We understand that last night the House \ntook to the Rules Committee the conference report on bankruptcy, which \nwe have been waiting for for more than a year, and also the terrorism \ninsurance conference report, legislation we have been trying to \ncomplete for more than a year. So we should be able to complete those \ntwo matters. It may be necessary, on one of them, to file a cloture \nmotion, but that would be determined at a subsequent time.\n  So other votes could occur over the course of today's session. \nCertainly on Friday there will be votes with respect to cloture and \nmaybe other items.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/14/senate-section/article/S10974-3", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now proceed to the consideration of the conference report \nto accompany S. 1214, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the House to the bill (S. \n     1214), to amend the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, to establish a \n     program to ensure greater security for United States \n     seaports, and for other purposes, having met, have agreed \n     that the Senate recede from its disagreement to the amendment \n     of the House and agree to the same with an amendment and the \n     House agree to the same, signed by all conferees on the part \n     of both Houses.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to the consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of November 13, 2002.)\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill be 60 minutes for debate on the conference report, with the time \nto be equally divided and controlled between the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Commerce Committee.\n  The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, first, I ask for the yeas and nays on \nthe conference report.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the American public is most familiar \nwith airline, highway and rail transportation. But perhaps the most \nvulnerable link in our transportation system is the component that few \nAmericans ever see: our major seaports.\n  Our 361 sea and river ports handle 95 percent of U.S. international \ntrade. These ports annually transfer more than 2 billion tons of \nfreight--often in huge containers from ships that discharge directly \nonto trucks and railcars that immediately head onto our highways and \nrail systems. But less than 2 percent of those 5 million containers are \never checked by customs or law enforcement officials.\n  That is a gaping hole in our national security that must be fixed. \nThat is why the Senate passed The Port and Maritime Security Act of \n2001 in December of 2001 and the House and Senate have filed the \nconference report on the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002.\n  Before discussing the specifics of this conference report, I want to \ndiscuss the vulnerabilities at America's seaports:\n  Lloyd's List International reported that a NATO country's \nintelligence service has identified 20 merchant vessels believed to be \nlinked to Osama bin Laden. Those vessels are now subject to seizure in \nports all over the world. Some of the vessels are thought to be owned \noutright by bin Laden's business interests, while others are on long-\nterm charter. The Times of London reported that bin Laden used his \nships to import into Kenya the explosives used to destroy the U.S. \nembassies in Kenya and Tanzania.\n  A suspected member of the al-Quida terrorist network was arrested in \nItaly after he tried to stow-away in a shipping container heading to \nToronto. The container was furnished with a bed, a toilet, and its own \npower source to operate the heater and recharge batteries. According to \nthe Toronto Sun, the man also had a global satellite telephone, a \nlaptop computer, an airline mechanics certificate, and security passes \nfor airports in Canada, Thailand and Egypt.\n  In October, a French-flagged tanker was attacked by terrorists in a \nmanner very similar to the speed boat attack on the USS Cole in 2000. \nThe attack caused 60,000 tons of oil to be released into the waters off \nYemen and killed one crew member.\n  These stories really bring home this issue of seaport security. \nExcept for those of us who live in port cities like Charleston, people \noften do not think about their ports--the ports that load industrial \nand consumer goods onto trucks and railroad cars heading directly to \ntheir hometowns. But making these ports more secure is vital to \nprotecting our national security. The destruction that can be \naccomplished through security holes at our seaports potentially exceed \nany other mode of transportation. And yet we have failed to make \nseaport security a priority.\n  Most Americans would be surprised to discover that until the \nprovisions in this bill there has been no unified federal plan for \noverseeing the security of the international borders at our seaports. \nAnd that's what seaports are: international borders that must be \nprotected as well as our land borders with Canada and Mexico.\n  The U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Customs Service are doing an \noutstanding job, but they are outgunned. In the year 2000, we imported \n5.5 million trailer truckloads of cargo. Due to that volume, the U.S. \nCustoms Service is only able to inspect between 1 to 2 percent of \ncontainers. In other words, potential terrorists and drug smugglers \nhave a 98 percent chance of randomly importing illegal and dangerous \nmaterials.\n  Senator Bob Graham a few years ago convinced President Clinton to \nappoint a commission to look at seaport security. At the time, the main \nfocus of port security was stopping illegal drugs, the smuggling of \npeople, and cargo theft. While those problems still exist, the new--and \nvery real--threat of terrorism strikes right at the heart of our \nnational defense.\n  The Interagency Commission on Crime and Security at U.S. Seaports \nissued a report a year ago that said security at U.S. seaports ``ranges \nfrom poor to fair.'' Let me repeat that: 17 federal agencies reviewed \nour port security system and found it in poor shape.\n\n[[Page S10975]]\n\n  According to the Commission:\n\n       Control of access to the seaport or sensitive areas within \n     the seaports is often lacking. Practices to restrict or \n     control the access of vehicles to vessels, cargo receipt and \n     delivery operations, and passenger processing operations at \n     seaports are either not present or not consistently enforced, \n     increasing the risk that violators could quickly remove cargo \n     or contraband. Many ports do not have identification cards \n     issued to personnel to restrict access to vehicles, cargo \n     receipt and delivery operations, and passenger processing \n     operations.\n\n  The report said:\n\n       At many seaports, the carrying of firearms is to \n     restricted, and thus internal conspirators and other \n     criminals are allowed armed access to cargo vessels and \n     cruise line terminals. In addition, many seaports rely on \n     private security personnel who lack the crime prevention and \n     law enforcement training and capability of regular police \n     officers.\n\n  The report also found that port-related businesses did not know where \nto report cargo theft and other crimes, and that federal, state and \nlocal law enforcement agencies responsible for a port's security rarely \nmeet to coordinate their work.\n  That is what our legislation does--it creates mechanisms to integrate \nall these different security agencies and their efforts to improve the \nsecurity of our seaports, and the railways and highways that converge \nat our seaports. Our seaport security bill also directly funds more \nsecurity officers, more screening equipment, and the building of \nimportant security infrastructure.\n\n  Each agency is good at what they do individually. But they will be \neven stronger working together, sharing information and tactics, and \ncoordinating security coverage at our seaports. More teamwork between \nthese federal, state and local agencies--along with our security \npartners in the private sector--will produce a more secure seaport \nenvironment that is stronger than the sum of each agency's individual \nefforts. To foster that teamwork, our bill sets up a National Maritime \nSecurity Advisory Committee responsible for coordinating programs to \nenhance the security and safety of U.S. seaports.\n  Most important in the bill are the requirements to implement security \nplans that will provide for efficient, coordinated and effective action \nto deter and minimize damage from a transportation security incident. \nThe plans will be developed as a national plan, a regional area plan, \nand facility and vessel plans. The National and Area Security Plans \nwill be developed by the Coast Guard and will be adequate to deter a \ntransportation security incident to the maximum extent possible. The \nfacility and vessel plans are for the individual waterfront facilities \nand vessels and must be consistent with the federal and area plans. The \nSecretary of Transportation will conduct an initial assessment of \nvessels and facilities on and near the water. The assessment will \nidentify those facilities and vessel types that pose a high risk of \nbeing involved in a transportation security incident. These assessments \nwill identify the vulnerable assets and infrastructure as well as the \nthreats to those assets and infrastructure.\n  Within a year the initial assessments will be made, interim security \nmeasures will be implemented, and more detailed assessments will be \nconducted, from which vessel and facility security plans will be \ndevised. These plans will be based on the Coast Guard vulnerability \nassessments and security recommendations. The plans will be submitted \nto the Coast Guard by port authorities, waterfront facilities, and \nvessel operators. All ports, waterfront facilities and vessels are \nrequired to operate under approved security plans that are consistent \nwith the Federal and Area Security Plans.\n  To further enhance law enforcement cooperation, we will require the \nestablishment of Area Security Advisory Committees at each port to \ncoordinate security plans among all the involved agencies: law \nenforcement, intelligence agencies, Customs, Coast Guard, Immigration, \nport authorities, shipping companies, and port workers. The bill also \ncreates new programs to professionally train port security personnel. \nCertification and training of maritime security personnel will be \ncrucial in increasing the professionalism of our federal, state, local, \nand private sector security personnel.\n  To address the immediate risk of terrorist activities at or through \nour seaports, the bill directs the Secretary of Transportation to \nimmediately establish domestic maritime safety and security teams to \nrespond to terrorist activity, criminal activity, or other threats. The \nunits will be composed of officers trained in anti-terrorism, drug \ninterdiction, navigation assistance, and facilitating response to \nsecurity threats. I would like to thank Senator Edwards for his work on \nthis provision. The bill also creates a Sea Marshal program to more \nspecifically authorize the Coast Guard to board vessels in order to \ndeter, prevent, or respond to acts of terrorism. These Sea Marshals \nwill ride along aboard some vessels entering U.S. ports as a deterrent \nagainst hijacking or other criminal activity. I would like to thank \nSenator John Kerry and Senator John Breaux for working on the Sea \nMarshal initiative. I also commend Senator Breaux for all his work on \nseaport security. He is the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Surface \nTransportation and Merchant Marine, he has toured throughout the nation \nreviewing security at our seaports and has done a yeoman's job helping \nto pass this bill.\n  The bill will require ports to limit access to security-sensitive \nareas. Ports also will be required to limit cars and trucks, coordinate \nwith local and private law enforcement, and develop an evacuation plan. \nPort areas will have increased security with specific area within the \nport being designated as controlled access where only those with the \nappropriate credentials will be allowed. The bill also will require \ncriminal background checks of employees with access to ocean manifests \nor access-controlled areas of a port or terminal. These background \nchecks are designed to ensure that individuals with access to our \nterminals and cargo facilities are not a terrorism security threat. A \nsystem of appeals and waivers will be provided to ensure that port \nworkers are given full and adequate opportunity to explain mitigating \nfactors justifying any waiver requests.\n  This bill will require for the first time that we know more in \nadvance about the cargo and crew members coming into the United States. \nThe more we know about a ship's cargo--and where it originated--the \nbetter our Customs agents and other law enforcement officers can target \nthe most suspicious containers and passengers. I am also pleased that \nwe established performance standards for the locking and sealing of \ncontainers. It is vitally important that we ensure that shipping \ncontainers are adequately designed and constructed and that we check \nthat they are securely locked for shipment.\n  The bill modifies a rulemaking requirement for advanced cargo \ninformation. The original requirement was included in the Senate passed \nversion of the bill. The rulemaking was then included in the Trade Act, \nand S. 1214 makes modifications to the Trade Act to incorporate \nadditional changes. I would like to thank the Finance Committee for \ntheir cooperative spirit in our effort to enhance cargo security.\n  Perhaps most importantly, we will give port authorities and local \nentities support in implementing and paying the costs of addressing \nCoast Guard identified vulnerabilities. We are dealing with an issue of \nnational security--and we will treat it as such. It would be great if \nwe could simply declare our ports to be more secure. But it takes money \nto make sure these international borders at our seaports are fully \nstaffed with customs, law enforcement, and immigration personnel. It \ntakes money to make sure they have modern security equipment, including \nthe newest scanners to check cargo for the most dangerous materials. \nAnd it takes money to build the physical infrastructure of a secure \nport.\n  For seaport security infrastructure, the bill directly authorizes \namounts sufficient to upgrade security infrastructure such as gates and \nfencing, security-related lighting systems, and remote surveillance \nsystems, equipment such as security vessels and screening equipment. I \nhad hoped that we would have an agreement on a dedicated funding \nmechanism to ensure that state, local and private sector entities that \nare required to comply with federal security mandates would have the \nnecessary funds to aggressively pursue compliance with security \nrequirements. Unfortunately, I was not able to\n\n[[Page S10976]]\n\nconvince all of the conferees that this was the proper course of \naction. I was happy that we did reach an agreement to have the \nAdministration report on how to pay for the federal portion of the \nseaport security responsibility. I will be following this very closely \nto ensure that we have some sort of agreement to allow for the \naggressive pursuit of a new system of seaport security.\n  U.S. Customs officers must be able to screen more than just 2 percent \nof the cargo coming into our seaports. We cannot expect to screen every \nmarine container entering the United States, but there must be some \nexpectation of inspection to deter cargo smugglers. While we spend \nbillions of dollars on an anti-ballistic missile defense system, we \nfail to see perhaps even a greater threat to our national security \ncoming through our ports. A cargo container can be delivered to \nanywhere in the United States for less than $5,000. The enemies of \nAmerica can afford $5,000 to import a container of explosive or \nhazardous materials much more easily than millions of dollars to launch \na rocket.\n  Investing in new screening technologies will help human screeners \ninspect more cargo, and detect the most dangerous shipments. To \nincrease the amount of cargo screened, the bill directly grants and \nauthorizes $90 million in research and development grants to be awarded \nto develop methods to increase the ability of the U.S. Customs Service \nto inspect merchandise carried on any vessel that will arrive in the \nUnited States; develop equipment to detect nuclear materials; improving \nthe tags and seals used on shipping containers, including smart sensors \nfor tracking shipments; and tools to mitigate the consequences of \nterrorist attack. The research and development funds are intended to \nfund any enhancements that are necessary to enhance technology at U.S. \nSeaports.\n  The destruction that can be accomplished through security holes at \nour seaports potentially exceeds any other mode of transportation. We \nall know the damage that can be caused by one truck bomb. But one ship \ncan carry thousands of truck-sized containers filled with hazardous \nmaterials. A hijacked tanker holding 32 million gallons of oil or other \nexplosive material that is rammed into a port city like Boston, New \nYork, Miami, Los Angeles or Seattle could potentially kill thousands of \npeople and destroy many city blocks.\n  That vulnerability is magnified by the type of facilities along our \ncoasts and rivers. There are 68 nuclear power plants located along U.S. \nwaterways. Along the 52-mile Houston Ship Channel, there are 150 \nchemical plants, storage facilities and oil refineries. The Baltimore \nSun reported that ``within a mile of the Inner Harbor of Baltimore is a \nmajor East Coast import and export hub for a broad range of dry and \nliquid chemicals. If ignited, many are capable of producing ferocious \nfires, explosions and clouds of noxious fumes--immediately adjacent to \nsuch densely populated row house neighborhoods as Locust Point, \nHighlandtown, and Canton.''\n  Most of the security procedures and infrastructure improvements \ncontained in our bill have long been practiced at our airports and land \nborder crossings. But, for some unfathomable reason, we don't take \nthese preventive steps at our seaports--where most of our cargo \narrives, and where we are most vulnerable.\n  Our agents at the Mexican border near Tijuana will tear the seats out \nof a car to search for drugs--while a crane just up the coast in Los \nAngeles lifts thousands of truck-sized cargo containers onto the dock \nwith no inspection at all.\n  For the first time we will require federal approval of seaport \nsecurity plans, better coordination and training of law enforcement, \nmore information about cargo, and directly fund more Coast Guard \npersonnel, U.S. Customs agents and security screening equipment to \nprotect against crime and terrorism threats.\n  Prior to September 11, 2001 we already faced security problems at our \nseaports related to smuggling, drugs, and cargo theft. But now we face \nthe even greater threat of terrorism--a threat that requires us to \nimmediately tighten security at our seaports, the most vulnerable part \nof our international border, in the defense of our nation.\n  This landmark bill also incorporates a Coast Guard authorization \nbill--the first Coast Guard authorization bill that has passed Congress \nsince 1998. The Coast Guard provisions in the bill reflect the \nprovisions of S. 951, the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2001, which \nwas reported out of the Commerce Committee last year.\n  The bill provides increased authorization levels for appropriations \nin fiscal year 2003, as well as increased personnel. The bill \nauthorizes approximately $6 billion for the Coast Guard's total budget \nfor fiscal year 2003. This is approximately $1 billion higher than the \namount appropriated in the FY 2002 Transportation Appropriations bill, \nand is approximately $200 million higher than the $5.8 billion of total \nenacted amounts in FY 2002, which includes two supplemental \nappropriations.\n  The bill also increases the maximum end-of-year strength to 45,500 \nactive duty military personnel, up from about 35,500, and includes \npersonnel incentives.\n  The authorizations of appropriations in this bill include \n$725,000,000 for capital investments, to ensure that the multi-year \nDeepwater program and the overhaul of the National Distress and \nResponse System (NDS), or ``Maritime 911,'' are adequately funded in \n2003.\n  Ensuring that the Coast Guard has sufficient personnel and capital \nresources could not come at a more important time. Since the tragic \nevents of September 11, far greater demands have been placed on the \nCoast Guard in the area of homeland security. Traditionally, the Coast \nGuard invested only 2 percent of its operating budget into seaport \nsecurity; this climbed to over 50 percent of its total operating budget \nafter September 11. Now, approximately 22 percent of the budget is \nenvisioned for seaport security.\n  The Coast Guard has unique missions not covered by any other federal \nagency. It has the primary responsibility of enforcing U.S. fisheries \nlaws, carrying out drug interdiction at sea, search and rescue \noperations, and protecting the marine environment against pollution.\n  With the new responsibilities for port security, combined with the \ntraditional role the Coast Guard plays in other mission areas, it is \ncritically important that the Coast Guard has a vision for how to \nachieve the ``new normalcy,'' wherein it carries out all of its \ntraditional and new missions, as well as the means to ensure its \nability to carry out such functions.\n  This bill requires the Coast Guard to examine and report to Congress \nits expenditures by mission area before and after September 11, and the \nlevel of funding need to fulfill the Coast Guard's additional \nresponsibilities. The bill also requires the Coast Guard to provide a \nstrategic plan to Congress identifying mission targets for 2003, 2004 \nand 2005 and the specific steps necessary to achieve those targets.\n  Even prior to 9/11, there were serious concerns about the Coast \nGuard's ability to carry out its core missions. For example, the Coast \nGuard's 30-year-old National Distress and Response System (NDS), also \nknown as ``Maritime 911,'' is breaking down, and has 88 gaps in its \ngeographical area of coverage. Failure to retain experienced crew has \nplagued the Coast Guard for years. The lack of experienced personnel \nhas resulted in tragedy, with unanswered calls for help leading to the \nloss of lives at sea. In 1997, all four passengers of the sailboat \nMorning Dew, three of them children, drowned outside of Charleston \nHarbor as a result of a failed search and rescue system.\n  The bill requires the Coast Guard to establish and implement \nstandards for the safe operation of all search and rescue facilities. \nThese include standards for the length of time an individual may serve \non watch, and acquisition of equipment to achieve safety in the \ninterim, as the entire system is upgraded.\n  Since the events of September 11, our demands on the Coast Guard have \nrisen dramatically. We must ensure that the Coast Guard is equipped \nwith all of the tools and resources that it needs to protect our \nseaports, and to carry out all of its traditional missions. I am \npleased that we have reached a successful result in the Conference with \nthe House, and that by enacting a Port Security bill, we will at the \nsame time be\n\n[[Page S10977]]\n\npassing a Coast Guard authorization bill this year.\n  Mr. President, the morning news reports that Osama bin Laden is alive \nand well and al-Qaida operates. Four years ago, we started working on \nthis measure, because it was just prior to that time that one of al-\nQaida's tankers pulled into Mombassa, the port at Kenya, and the \nterrorist crew jumped off and blew up the embassy at Nairobi and then \nDar Es Salaam's embassy in Tanzania. Lloyds of London reports Osama bin \nLaden has actual ownership of some 10 oil tankers, and he has control \nof some other 10 cargo tankers.\n  I point this out because it is the real threat. Yes, we have maybe a \nhijacking threat, but the real threat now, as we see it develop, is \nwith respect to our seaports. That is why we started in the committee, \nsome 4 years ago, with respect to seaport security.\n  Only, last year in Italy we found a suspected al-Qaida terrorist \nnetwork was operating, coming in through containers. There are some 5 \nmillion containers that come into the United States of America each \nyear with 2 billion tons of freight. Only 2 percent of those containers \nare inspected at this time.\n  But that one particular suspected terrorist had a bed and a toilet; \nhe had his own power source and everything else like that ready to \noperate. He could just as easily have come, and may have, unbeknownst \nto us, into the United States of America.\n  But let's go right to just last month, the oil tanker off of Yemen, \nthe French tanker with some 60,000 tons of oil. As they blew up the USS \nCole, they blew up this particular tanker. One can easily foresee that \na regular tanker could come up the Delaware River with a suicidal al-\nQaida group in operation or in control, where they throw the captain \noverboard and run it right into an oil tank farm there in Philadelphia, \nblowing the whole thing up, closing down the eastern seaboard.\n  So we worked very hard on this legislation. I commend the Senate \nitself because it was last year at this time, and both sides of the \naisle, under the leadership and working with my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator McCain--the soon-to-be chairman again--we worked and \nunanimously reported out a port security bill from our Commerce \nCommittee. We passed it in the Senate 100 to 0.\n  It languished on the House side for some months. And it was in June \nthat they finally passed it. And we have been with the staff.\n  I must emphasize the outstanding work of our staff in this particular \nregard. We worked all summer long. We thank particularly our colleague \nMr. Oberstar who worked with us as diligently as he could. In any \nevent, now we have the conference report. It is not complete in the \nsense that it is not funded. We provide in here certain sums as is \nnecessary to be reported to us in the Congress within 6 months.\n  We tried to get funding. The Senate had approved a user fee. They \ncalled it a tax, and we had some effort over the summer working it out \nto make sure it was a user fee. Then they said it was an origination \nproblem. Thereupon we said: All right. Just take the conference report. \nYou introduce it. We are not proud of its origin particularly. And you \nput it in, and we will approve it on the Senate side. So that caused a \ngreat delay, but now it's ready to go.\n  The Maritime Transportation Security Act will provide for the first \ntime a national system for securing our maritime borders. Heretofore, \nwe have known every plane that approaches the continental limits of the \nUnited States. They have transponders. We have the radar. We track \nthem. But we couldn't tell what ship was coming, when it was coming, or \nhow. We moved some weather satellites to repair that particular \ndeficiency. We now know, with the Coast Guard working overtime, of the \nships approaching. But we now have a secure system for our maritime \nborders.\n  We have to first ask that the Secretary of Transportation conduct an \nassessment of all vessels and facilities on or near the water and \nidentify the risks of being involved in an incident. Then we develop a \nport and area security plan.\n  Let me emphasize, you have the Coast Guard. You have Customs. You \nhave DEA. You have local law enforcement. You have the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service. When everybody is in charge, nobody is in \ncharge. Under the present law, the captain of the port is in charge. We \nhaven't changed that, but we have given him assistance.\n  We have the Coast Guard authorization bill also in this particular \nconference report, increasing the Coast Guard amounts and \nauthorizations some $1 billion this fiscal year 2003 over 2002. So we \nare beginning now to upgrade the wherewithal of the Coast Guard itself \nthat has been doing an outstanding job.\n  The plans are based on the Coast Guard security recommendations, \nwhich they will make within 1 year, of all ports, facilities, and \nvessels determined to be vulnerable. They then have the local port \nsecurity committees, which will coordinate the Federal, State, and \nlocal and private enforcement efforts.\n  We have been doing this, I know in the ports of Charleston and \nseveral others on the eastern seaboard. They have just been awaiting \nthis legislation to make sure we are working in lockstep with the \nFederal requirements. But then when I say they have to have the private \nefforts, think about it. If you went down to the Rio Grande, to the \nborder, and to the State of Arizona and told a rancher down there: Wait \na minute, there are some illegal immigrants coming across the border in \nthe nighttime, and what you have to do is not only put a barbed wire \nenclosure around your particular ranch, but you have to turn the lights \non at night and everything else like that, this is a private ranch, he \nwould look at you and laugh. He would say: What are you talking about?\n  That is what we are doing with respect to many of the ports that are \noperated privately. The Danes operate the Port of New York; the Chinese \noperate the Long Beach Port; the union operates the Seattle Port; the \nState of South Carolina operates our ports. So you can see this \nparticular task has to be a comprehensive and coordinated effort.\n\n  We then develop secure areas in the ports as part of the security \nplans. That is approved by the Department of Transportation. There is a \ngrant program here of allocations to the different ports authority, the \nsize, the threat, and whatever else is there. There is $90 million in \nresearch grants to be awarded to develop the methods to increase the \nability of the U.S. Customs to inspect the merchandise. There is a $33 \nmillion program intended for the development of security training.\n  There is an established maritime intelligence system to work with \nthis new Department of Homeland Security. They have to take all of this \ninformation, not just from the FBI, CIA, NSA, and Secret Service, but \nthe DEA in large measure furnishes intelligence.\n  We will have transponders on the various vessels coming in. Within \nthat year, we will have a certified system of transportation that is a \nsecure system of transportation allowing for secure maritime borders. \nThey will have to be screened prior to entry.\n  The transportation oversight board will establish a security program \nto develop the secure areas as well as the standards. People working in \nthose secure areas will be required to have background checks. Not \neverybody coming there delivering the Cokes for the Coke machine or \nwhatever will need it, but there will be secure areas, and people \nworking in them will have to have background checks. We have \nestablished a sea marshal program that the maritime folks have wanted \nfor quite a while.\n  We have an assessment of the foreign antiterrorism measure. And let \nme commend Mr. Bonner, the Director of Customs, who has already gone \noverseas and coordinated this. What we are doing is establishing \nassessment and check methods and secure methods for the ports of the \ncargo being loaded into the containers before they leave, let's say, \nthe Port of London. We are going to have to do the same things to \nfacilitate delivery when it comes into the United States.\n  I emphasize the Coast Guard authorization bill. We haven't had one \nsince 1998. We have been struggling with that. But now everybody has in \ntheir minds front and center the Coast Guard, the magnificent job it \nhas been doing, even as it has been understaffed and underfunded. We \nare going to build that up.\n\n[[Page S10978]]\n\n  I yield such time as is necessary to the distinguished Senator from \nArizona.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, let me start by, once again, thanking \nChairman Hollings for his leadership in addressing identified safety \nand security problems at our Nation's seaports. I applaud his \nleadership and steadfastness as we finally bring this important piece \nof legislation to completion.\n  The conference report we are considering today is an important step \nforward and will provide both the guidance and funding authorization \nneeded to improve maritime and port security. It is past time to send \nthis legislation to the President for his signature.\n  The old adage, ``a chain is only as strong as its weakest link,'' is \nvery true when it comes to securing our homeland. Today, our Nation's \nseaports remain a weak link in border security. This conference \nagreement will go a long way in strengthening that link.\n  Both the Hart-Rudman Report on Homeland Security and the Interagency \nCommission on Crime and Seaport Security found our seaports to be \nvulnerable to crime and terrorism. While there is no way to make our \nNation's seaports completely crime free and impenetrable to terrorist \nattacks, this conference report will undoubtably advance port security \nand help strengthen overall national security.\n  The report by the Interagency Commission on Crime and Seaport \nSecurity, also known as the Graham Commission, in recognition of \nSenator Graham's efforts to establish such a commission,was a catalyst \n2 years ago for the Commerce Committee's initial efforts to address \ncrime and security issues at our Nation's seaports.\n  The committee held a number of hearings in Washington focused on \nseaport security issues and the Subcommittee on Surface Transportation \nand Merchant Marine also held field hearings on the west coast in \nSeattle, WA, and Portland, OR, and on the southeast and gulf coast in \nPort Everglades, FL, New Orleans, LA, Houston, TX, and Charleston, SC. \nThe input from numerous witnesses contributed significantly to the \ndevelopment of this agreement.\n  As I have mentioned many times during the past year, it is widely \nreported that transportation systems are the target of 40 percent of \nterrorist attacks worldwide. This conference agreement would provide \nfor increased security at our Nation's seaports, helping to reduce \ncrime and protect vessels and vital transportation infrastructure from \nterrorist attacks.\n  The conference agreement includes a number of important provisions. \nIt requires coordination among the many entities that play a role in \nsecurity at our Nation's seaports and on our navigable waterways, \nincluding the Coast Guard, the Customs Service, and the many other \nFederal, State, local, and private agencies. It directs these entities \nto work together to establish security plans aimed at decreasing \nvulnerabilities and reducing threats to our ports and maritime \ntransportation system. These plans will help define specific \nresponsibilities and secure our seaports.\n  The conference agreement also requires the Secretary to establish \nincident response plans that explain the role of each agency and how \ntheir efforts are to be coordinated in the event of an attack on our \nNation's maritime transportation system. In addition to providing \nguidance on how to respond in the event of an attack, it is expected \nthe detailed planning called for in the agreement will help deter \nterrorist attacks and other criminal acts aimed at our seaports.\n  The conference agreement further requires the Secretary to establish \na grant program to provide much needed funding to ports and facilities \nto help defray the compliance costs associated with both area and \nfacility security plans. The Secretary will also be required to \nestablish a program to provide grants to look at new and existing \ntechnologies that can be used to better secure and protect our Nation's \nmaritime transportation system.\n  The conference agreement takes into account not only the wide range \nof threats and crimes surrounding our seaports, but also the unique \nnature of our ports. A ``one-size-fits-all'' approach will not work. \nThe planning process established in the conference agreement requires \nthe Secretary to consider the fact that our Nation's seaports are \ncomplex and diverse in both geography and infrastructure.\n  While there are still many questions regarding how far we must go to \nsecure our ports and waterways, I am confident that the compromise \nreached with our House colleagues will create a safer and more secure \nmaritime transportation system in the United States and allow the flow \nof commerce to continue.\n  Mr. President, this conference agreement also includes the provisions \nfrom our Coast Guard authorization. The Coast Guard has been operating \nwithout an authorization since 1998, and the resources and personnel \nbenefits provided in this measure for the men and women serving in the \nCoast Guard are long overdue.\n  This agreement authorizes funding for the Coast Guard for fiscal year \n2003 at the levels requested by the President for six accounts: one, \noperation and maintenance expenses; two, acquisition, construction, and \nimprovement of facilities and equipment, AC three, research, \ndevelopment, testing, and evaluation, RDT four, retirement pay; \nfive, environmental compliance and restoration; and six, alteration or \nremoval of bridges. It also authorizes end-of-year military strength \nand training loads to ensure that the Coast Guard will have the \nflexibility to respond to its ever growing missions.\n  The provisions from the Coast Guard authorization bill include \nnumerous measures which will improve the Coast Guard's ability to \nrecruit, reward, and retain high-quality personnel. The conference \nagreement addresses various Coast Guard personnel management issues \nsuch as promotions, retention, housing authorities, and education, \nalong with measures that grant the Coast Guard parity with its \nDepartment of Defense counterparts.\n  Additionally, this legislation provides a number of changes to U.S. \nmaritime laws and Coast Guard authorities such as extending the time \nfor recreational vessel recalls, and increasing penalties for negligent \nvessel operations. This bill also provides much needed advance funding \nauthority for the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund which will allow the \nCoast Guard to better respond to the ever increasing costs of \nenvironmental cleanups.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I want to commend the conferees for their \nwork to reach a compromise on this important legislation. I urge my \ncolleagues to support final passage of this legislation.\n  Again, I thank Senator Hollings for his dedicated and deeply involved \nwork on this legislation, including conduct of field hearings \nthroughout the United States, including the important port of \nCharleston, SC.\n  Mr. President, I know the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, wishes \nto speak on the conference report. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Momentarily our distinguished colleague from Florida \nwill speak. It was Senator Graham of Florida who persuaded President \nClinton to appoint the investigating commission with respect to seaport \nsecurity.\n  I wish to add a couple comments with respect to the Coast Guard \nauthorization. As I have stated, it is the first authorization since \n1998, and it increases the Coast Guard budget $1 billion, with 10,000 \nadditional active duty military personnel. They have been understaffed. \nI know of a tragic situation of search and rescue that did not work in \nCharleston, SC, my backyard. There are provisions in this legislation \nso we have adequate personnel manpower there.\n  The Coast Guard is to examine and report to Congress its expenditures \nand missions by September of next year. We want to get in lockstep as \nthey increase their effort from 2 percent of the budget to some 22 \npercent of the budget with respect to seaport security.\n  I can point out many other provisions, but I will yield such time as \nis necessary to the distinguished Senator from Florida.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, first, I wish to extend my congratulations \nto the Senator from South Carolina and the Senator from Arizona, who \nhave\n\n[[Page S10979]]\n\nbeen working on this issue for many months and have carried the \nposition of the Senate in the conference committee. I commend you for \nthe success we have achieved today and for the battles we both \nrecognize will be required in the future in order to fully realize the \ngoals of this legislation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am very pleased to rise in support of \nthe Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002.\n  This legislation will secure one of our Nation's greatest \nvulnerabilities, our seaports.\n  This bill not only ensures that our ports remain a driving force in \nthe American economy, it also commences the closing of the floodgates \nof vulnerability to the terrorist threat to American seaports.\n  Mr. President, there is much work that remains to be done.\n  For this legislation to be effective, it must have a predictable and \nsustained funding source for the agencies tasked with maintaining the \nsecurity of our maritime borders.\n  It was in December of 2001, almost a year ago, that the Senate \nunanimously passed a comprehensive seaport security bill. The House of \nRepresentatives passed its own version in June of 2002. This \nlegislation has been in conference for 4 months. Valuable time has been \npassing while an important part of our homeland economy, as well as our \nhomeland security and the Nation's 360 seaports, have remained \nextremely vulnerable.\n  I am pleased a final agreement has been reached and the bill is \ncompleted and it will soon go to the President for his signature.\n  To quote the Florida Ports Council:\n\n       Seaport security must be addressed in a comprehensive, \n     intelligent, practical manner by the Federal Government--now, \n     not in 2004 or 2006, or 2008.\n       The security of our borders is a national responsibility. \n     No matter how good our State processes and practices are--\n     without the Federal Government requiring realistic security \n     plans and standards--the public domain will remain at risk.\n  I am pleased we are doing that today and starting to fulfill our \nFederal responsibilities.\n  We live not only in a democracy but also in a nation that allows its \ncitizens and visitors the freedom to travel throughout our great \ncountry.\n  The United States thrives on global trade and global travel.\n  But support for democracy and freedom must go hand-in-hand with \nstrong protection of our maritime borders.\n  Fortunately, our seaports have not yet been attacked. Fortunately, as \nof today, one of those container cargoes, 16,000 of which arrive at \nAmerica's seaports every day, has not been used as the means by which a \nweapon of mass destruction will be delivered within the United States.\n  This means instead of looking at the security of America's seaports \nthrough the rearview mirror, as we have been doing since the events \naffecting airlines and airports as a result of September 11, 2001, we \nare looking at seaport security through the windshield, albeit a foggy \nwindshield. We not only have a responsibility but an opportunity to \ntake steps to avoid the head-on collision at America's seaports that \nhas not yet occurred.\n  Since September 11, there has been a lot of discussion about \nconnecting the dots, what could have been pieced together, the things \nwe should have seen before that tragic day. And, like 9/11, information \nabout our seaports presents a disturbing array of dots. But from these, \nthere is a clear pattern of vulnerability at our seaports and the cargo \ncontainers which they deliver.\n  Many of these dots are available only in classified form, which are \nnot disclosed for national security reasons. But there are many \ninstances of security breaches at seaports that have been publicly \ndisclosed--in open sources--that paint a stunning portrait of our \nmaritime vulnerabilities. Weekly, I read newspaper accounts of \nstowaways and narcotics arriving in our country, and of security lapses \nat our ports.\n  I have several articles I would like to bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues, and I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in their \nentirety in the Record immediately following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. On May 13, 2001, Fox News and the Associated Press \nreported that 25 Islamic extremists, hidden on commercial freighters as \nstowaways, illegally entered the United States. These individuals \nreportedly entered the United States through four seaports in Miami; \nPort Everglades, Fort Lauderdale; Savannah; and Long Beach. Where have \nthese men gone and, more importantly, what are their intentions?\n  The Washington Times, in a January 22, 2002, article entitled \n``Seaports Seen as Terrorist Target,'' reported al-Qaida ``shipped arms \nand bomb-making materials via Osama bin Laden's covertly owned \nfreighters.'' These explosives were later used to blow up the U.S. \nembassies in Kenya and Tanzania.\n  What if these ships were making port calls at a port in the United \nStates of America?\n  Further, in a front page article dated February 26, 2002, USA Today \nreported that in October of 2001, a month after 9/11, port authorities \nin Italy opened a suspicious container and found an Egyptian-born \nCanadian person, equipped with a satellite phone, laptop, false credit \ncards, and security passes for airports in Egypt, Thailand, and Canada. \nWhat if this container and person made a successful, undetected entry \ninto the United States?\n  On June 16, 2002, the Washington Post reported that three men \ncaptured by CIA and Morrocan authorities told interrogators they \nescaped Afghanistan and came to Morocco on a mission to use bomb-laden \nspeedboats for suicide attacks on U.S. and British warcrafts in the \nStrait of Gibraltar.\n  On October 6, 2002, the French-flagged supertanker Limberg was \nattacked and holed by a small boat packed with explosives, possibly a \nremote-controlled boat, off the coast of Yemen. This attack is now \nwidely believed to be the work of al-Qaida operatives.\n\n  Yemen is, of course, the same location as the USS Cole bombing of 2 \nyears earlier.\n  On October 29, 2002, as seen on national television, a 50-foot \ncoastal freighter with 234 Haitians and 2 Dominicans landed close to \nMiami, in Biscayne Bay, Florida. How did this boat manage to get so \nclose to a major American city? This vessel was not detected by the \nCoast Guard until the last few hours of its voyage.\n  Finally, less than 2 weeks ago, November 4, 2002, The Houston \nChronicle reported 23 stowaways to Honduras who were captured at the \nport, 16 on the barge and 7 more who had tried to swim ashore.\n  Mr. President, the current assessment from the U.S. intelligence \ncommunity is that 19 of the 35 State Department-designated foreign \nterrorist organizations have access to maritime conveyances, or are \ndirectly associated with maritime terrorism.\n  Since 1991, there have been 131 maritime attacks. This includes 19 \nship hijackings, bombings, armed attacks, or kidnappings in the 4-year \nperiod between January 1996 and December of 2000.\n  Clearly, both our seaports and maritime borders and their \nvulnerability to terrorists remain a primary U.S. security concern.\n  In 1998, I asked former President Bill Clinton to establish a Federal \ncommission to evaluate both the nature and extent of crime in our \nseaports. I have become aware of the extensive and expanding use of \nseaports for a variety of criminal activities.\n  In response to this request, President Clinton established the \nInteragency Commission on Crime and Security in U.S. Seaports on April \n27, 1999.\n  The three distinguished cochairs of the commission were Raymond \nKelly, then commissioner of the U.S. Customs Service, now head of the \nNew York City police department; James Robinson, then assistant \nAttorney General; and Clyde Hart, then administrator of the Maritime \nAdministration.\n  In October of 2000, the commission issued its final report. This \nreport outlined many of the common security problems that were \nunearthed at U.S. seaports. The commission made 20 findings and \nincluded recommendations to respond to these threats. Our seaport \nsecurity bill addresses many of them directly.\n  For example; the Commission reported a ``need for a more \ncomprehensive and definitive statement of the\n\n[[Page S10980]]\n\nspecific federal responsibilities,'' including the ``lead agencies'' of \nCustoms for international cargo and Coast Guard for seaport security.\n  Our seaport security bill provides new authorities for both of these \nagencies.\n  The Commission also noted that:\n\n       Comprehensive interagency crime threat assessments * * * \n     currently are not conducted at seaports and that the federal \n     government should establish baseline vulnerability and threat \n     assessments for terrorism at U.S. seaports.\n\n  The seaport security bill requires the Coast Guard to survey all \nports, prioritize them, and then conduct detailed port and vessel type \nvulnerability assessments.\n  The Commission called for a ``comprehensive initiative to improve \ncargo import procedures,'' noting that ``vessel manifest information, \nimport and export, is sometimes deficient'' and ``is more easily \nutilized * * * if it is received in electronic data formats before the \narrival of the vessel.''\n  The seaport security bill requires vessel and cargo data to be \nsubmitted in advance and in a format to be prescribed by the Secretary \nof Transportation.\n  The Commission was concerned that ``no minimum security standards or \nguidelines exist for seaports and their facilities.''\n  The seaport security bill would require security standards and \nprovide federal grants for these improvements.\n  These are but a few of the many vital provisions in this seaport \nsecurity bill.\n  On September 11, 2001, four commercial airliners were hijacked and \nturned into weapons of mass destruction, crashing into three symbols of \nAmerican strength. The fourth airliner was destined for yet another \nsymbol of American strength but for the courageous passengers and crew \nwho intervened. We were not able to prevent these hijackings before \nthey happened.\n  After that tragic day, Congress quickly responded and introduced the \nAviation Security Act on September 24. It was signed into law on \nNovember 19, 2001. This law requires safer cockpits, air marshals, \nFederal oversight of all the airport security operations, advanced \nanti-hijacking training for all flight crews, establishment of a \nsecurity fee, and background checks for flight school students.\n  On September 21, 2001, 10 days after the attack, Congress approved a \nrelief package for the airline industry. This included $5 billion of \nimmediate cash infusion for U.S. air carriers and $10 billion in loan \nguarantees.\n  We responded because we had been hit. The challenge of this \nlegislation is: Are we prepared to respond before we are assaulted?\n  I believe we are beginning to answer that question in the affirmative \nwith the adoption of this legislation.\n  The threat to our seaports is urgent and real. When a cargo container \narrives on our shores, it is quickly loaded into a truck or a train, \nleaving all Americans, not just those who are located close to a \nseaport, vulnerable to a security lapse which occurs at the seaport \nbecause the seaport is the last point at which that container can \nreasonably be checked and evaluated to determine if it represents a \nthreat to the American people.\n  While our bill is a step in the right direction, we must fully commit \nto our seaports as we have to our airports, which includes a steady \nstream of funding.\n  As my colleagues may be aware, the primary reason this seaport \nsecurity bill was in conference for 4 months was the inability of \nMembers to reach agreement on how to fund these security measures. So \nwhat we are passing today is essentially an authorization bill. We are \nproviding the basic architecture of the security, but the challenge to \nprovide the plumbing and the electrical systems that will bring this \narchitecture to life is yet to be faced.\n  My preference was to pass a bill which would have contained that \nplumbing and electrical system in the form of user fees, as we have \nalready done for airports and airlines, giving our ports an immediate \ninflux of money to quickly address the security lapses that have been \nidentified.\n  Why is this so important? If we do not have a dedicated stream of \nuser-generated revenue, our commitment to seaport security may be \nviewed as temporary and piecemeal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time reserved for the Senator from South \nCarolina has expired. The Senator from Arizona controls the balance of \nthe time.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eighteen and a half minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask the Senator from Arizona for a minute to close.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Certainly. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. As chairman of the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence, over the past 2 years, I have worked with the committee \non a 5-year plan of enhancing technology and human skills within the \nintelligence community.\n  It is our expectation that these investments will yield rich \ndividends in the intelligence community, to understand the terrorist \nthreat to our Nation, better inform decisionmakers on policies that can \ndefend against these threats, and take direct action against the \nterrorists.\n  It should be no different at our Nation's seaports. Investing in \nsecurity along our maritime borders is as vital as investing in our \nintelligence capabilities or our Nation's airports. But I am troubled \nby the prospects. The administration has shown no willingness to \nrequest any funding for our seaports.\n  The administration's fiscal year 2002 and 2003 budgets contained no \nfunding for seaport security. To date, all funding for enhancing \nsecurity at our seaports has been as a result of congressional action \non supplemental appropriation bills.\n  Illustrative of this gap between congressional funding and the \nadministration's funding is the fact that only $93 million was \navailable from the Transportation Security Administration for over $700 \nmillion of seaport security grant requests.\n  While this funding has aided some ports, comprehensive security \nimprovements for all ports will cost significantly more.\n  Based on a survey of just 52 large ports by the American Association \nof Port Authorities, the improvement costs totaled over $2.2 billion.\n  In addition, the United States needs a consistent policy on how much \nof the additional security costs are the responsibility of the \nGovernment and how much by industry and its consumers. We need to \nfairly apply this policy across all parts of the industries and \neconomy.\n  Ultimately, it should be similar to our approach, and response to, \nthe aviation industry. Undoubtedly, funding security improvements at \nour ports must be a major task and priority for the 108th Congress.\n  Seaports are an important economic engine. They are the major gateway \nto America for cargo and consumer goods.\n  Annually, the U.S. marine transportation system handles 2 billion \ntons of freight, 3 billion tons of oil, and 7 million cruise ship \npassengers. Over 800 ships make more than 22,000 port visits per year \nin the United States.\n  One terrorist incident at a seaport could impact an entire coast or \nthe entire economy of the United States. The financial impact of the \nclosing of our seaports would be devastating.\n  As reported last September in USA Today and numerous other \npublications, the closure of 29 seaports on the west coast due to labor \nissues reportedly cost $1 billion a day.\n  I ask my colleagues, what would happen if we had to close all of our \n361 seaports? Factories and plants would quickly be out of parts and be \nforced to shut down. Commodity hoarding would begin and prices would \nrise. The stock market would undoubtedly be shaken. Energy and oil \nprices would rocket upwards.\n  On April 1, 2002, Business Week magazine observed that ``if a \ndisruption at one of the country's 361 ports leads the U.S. Government \nto shut them down the way it grounded air traffic in September, it \nwould bring some $2 billion a day in seaborne trade to a dead stop and \ninstantly cripple the domestic economy.''\n  The issue of seaport security is not going away.\n  Foreign trade accounts for over one-fourth of the total U.S. gross \ndomestic product.\n  According to the U.S. Coast Guard, by 2020, one-third of all \ncontainer ships\n\n[[Page S10981]]\n\nwill be massive vessels termed ``mega-ships,'' oil imports will \nincrease to two-thirds of our consumption, and liquefied natural gas \nimports will increase by nine-fold.\n  The Customs Service estimates that by 2020 the volume of imported \ncargo will more than double.\n  While we have passed this important bill, we now have a \nresponsibility to finding funding for these need security improvements.\n  I urge my colleagues to make the security of our ports a priority and \nto pass, and later fund, this legislation.\n  We must not leave our maritime industry vulnerable to the potential \nuse by a terrorist organization. The possibilities are horrific: The \npossibility of major loss of life, the possibility of major economic \ndamage, or the possibility of the delivery of a weapon of mass \ndestruction.\n  We have take the first steps forward in aviation. Why would we leave \nour seaports and the maritime industry behind? The action that we take \ntoday is a beginning.\n  For this beginning to realize its promise of substantially enhanced \nsecurity at America's seaports, within the flood tide of cargo \ncontainers that arrive each day, further action is required.\n  Working with the House of Representatives, it is my hope that, early \nin 2003, we will take the next step, providing a permanent and \nsufficient funding source for today's legislation.\n  An appropriate place to start the discussion is using the model of \nairports and aviation security, where funding is provided by the \nindustry and its customers and the general public.\n  The President will recommend in his budget for 2004 what he considers \nthe appropriate level for seaport security.\n  I urge him to be more forthcoming than in the last two budget \nsubmissions.\n  With the President's level of general revenue support, the Congress \nwill be in a better position to determine what level of user fee will \ngive Americans assurance of security at our Nation's seaports.\n  We understand the threat and the horrible outcomes from terrorism so \nmuch better than 1 year ago.\n  After the terrorist attacks, Congress took quick action to \nrestructure our aviation security program, in order to better protect \nour country and prevent another attack.\n  We need to strengthen our seaports, with the same intensity \ndemonstrated at our airports. We must guard our maritime borders \nagainst obvious weaknesses and their potential use as a terrorist \ntarget.\n  Our seaports are a vital national asset.\n  I close by saying we have work to do, and the primary focus of that \nwork is going to be to arrive at a sustainable, reliable funding source \nfor these important security measures. We will have an early indication \nof what portion of this the President is going to recommend be paid \nthrough general tax revenue when we see his budget for the year 2004.\n  This legislation also requires the President, within 6 months of \nenactment, to submit a funding proposal on a permanent basis to the \nCongress. It is my hope that funding proposal will use as its starting \npoint what we have already done for the airline industry where we have \nmade some decisions as to how much of the security costs should be \nborne by general taxpayers and how much should be borne by the users \nand the industry. It seems to me we should strive to have a parity and \nbalance of allocation of financial responsibility across our \ntransportation systems. If we are committed, as the action today \nindicates, to providing security for our seaports before they are \nattacked and will not await a 9/11 to arrive at a city in the United \nStates through a cargo container with a weapon of mass destruction, \nwhich 48 hours earlier had come through a seaport, if we are committed \nto security without having to be awakened through an assault, then we \nshould also be committed to recognize this is not going to be cheap and \nit is not going to be a temporary commitment. It will be expensive and \nit will be sustained and we should provide the revenue to meet those \nrealities.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                    [From USA Today, Feb. 26, 2002]\n\n             Shipping Containers Could Hide Threat to U.S.\n\n                            (By Fred Bayles)\n\n       Charleston, S.C.--The odd noises that came from the 40-foot \n     shipping container at Gioia Tauro, Italy, harbor in October \n     demonstrated the danger facing officials at ports around the \n     world. When port authorities opened the suspect container, \n     they found Amir, Farid Rizk, 43, an Egyptian-born Canadian \n     equipped with satellite phone, laptop, false credit cards and \n     security passes for airports in Egypt, Thailand and Canada.\n       Officials charged Rizk with terrorism but later released \n     him after his lawyers argued he was fleeing religious and \n     legal persecution in Egypt and was not a terrorist.\n       Rizk's choice of transportation highlighted a security \n     problem that has troubled U.S. officials since well before \n     Sept. 11.\n       More than 6 million shipping containers arrive here at \n     Wando Welch yards in Charleston and other U.S. ports \n     annually. Only 2% are inspected. The rest remain sealed as \n     they are shipped throughout the country. It would be easy, \n     some fear, to take a container, stuff it with explosives, a \n     chemical weapon or a nuclear device and inject it into the \n     nation's economic bloodstream. Security experts had thought \n     about the massive flow of unchecked containers before the \n     attacks on New York and Washington. In the November 2000 \n     issue of Foreign Affairs, Coast Guard Cmdr. Stephen Flynn, a \n     security expert with the Council on Foreign Relations, \n     offered this scenario.\n       Suppose, he wrote, Osama bin Laden loaded a biological \n     weapon into a container and shipped it through foreign ports \n     to the USA. The container, unnoticed in the day-to-day bustle \n     of trade, could then be put on a rail car at Long Beach \n     destined for Newark, N.J. Somewhere along the 2,800-mile \n     route, it is detonated.\n       As bad as the destruction such an attack might cause, the \n     chaos that would follow could devastate the nation's economy.\n       The nation's shipping system could shut down, as airports \n     did after Sept. 11. ``The economic damage would be \n     incalculable,'' Flynn says. ``It would accomplish what a \n     terrorist group wants to do, which is to disrupt this \n     country's economic structure.''\n       So what can be done? Looking inside each of the 6 million \n     containers from abroad would disrupt the flow of goods. \n     Technological solutions, including x-ray machines, are \n     costly, expensive and not infallible. The answer may lie in \n     better surveillance at the container's point of origin. \n     Instead of inspecting every container upon arrival, \n     sophisticated computer and intelligence systems are being \n     established to identify suspicious containers before they \n     leave foreign ports.\n       ``You want to do something that doesn't wait until the \n     container is offloaded here,'' U.S. Customs Commissioner \n     Robert Bonner says. ``The big idea is to think about how to \n     push the border back.''\n\n\n                              wando welch\n\n       In South Carolina, the blur of movement at the port of \n     Charleston's Wando Welch Terminal vividly shows the shipping \n     business's need for speed. Massive cranes lift cargo \n     containers off merchant ships arriving from around the world. \n     The containers are stacked like giant Lego pieces across the \n     237-acre facility.\n       The activity at this, the nation's third-busiest, container \n     facility is a tribute to the efficiency of the ``intermodal'' \n     transportation system, which makes possible the quick \n     transfer of seaborne containers to railcars and trucks \n     without unloading and reloading their contents. The system \n     touches every facet of the economy. Each state receives goods \n     from an average 15 different ports every day, according to \n     the American Association of Port Authorities.\n       That is why the industry balks at inspecting every \n     container coming into the country. Several members of \n     Congress, including Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., have \n     proposed such steps.\n       At the Wando yards, the time a Customs inspector needs to \n     examine a single container illustrates the challenge. One \n     container, singled out because its manifest listed a cargo of \n     ``human aids,'' turns out to have been filled with bundles of \n     used clothing bound from Italy to Bolivia. It took the \n     inspector and a civilian crew most of the day to offload and \n     inspect the bundles, then reload the container and send it \n     back to the shipping yards.\n       ``It would be very difficult to search every container \n     without severely disrupting the flow of goods,'' Bonner says.\n       A glimpse of that kind of disruption came in late 1999. The \n     nation's Western rail system slowed dramatically as it \n     adjusted to a merger of two railroads, a booming economy and \n     other factors.\n       The slowdown created havoc for weeks. Christmas items did \n     not arrive to stores on time. Perishable goods rotted. \n     Factories closed because needed parts were delayed.\n       ``It was only temporary, but it created big headaches,'' \n     says John Foertsch, the Southeast operations manager for OOCL \n     (Orient Overseas Container Line), a major container shipper \n     based in Hong Kong. ``It's hard to imagine the chaos that \n     would come if delays like that became the routine.''\n\n\n                          technology solutions\n\n       Some look to technology as a solution. Last summer, Customs \n     agents at busier ports began using drive-through mobile X-ray \n     units that can scan containers as they are driven past a \n     checkpoint, much like luggage through an airport screening \n     station.\n\n[[Page S10982]]\n\n       Sitting in the cab of such a unit on the Charleston docks, \n     Customs Inspector Eddie Basham peers at a computer screen \n     displaying the shadowy interiors of passing containers. \n     ``Tires,'' he says, pointing to a stack of spirals filling \n     one container. On the next, he notices a dark, irregular \n     shape and sends it to the side for inspection.\n       Occasionally, the equipment hits immediate pay dirt. \n     ``There's a few times I've seen people standing in the inside \n     of a container,'' Basham says. Police took the illegal \n     immigrants into custody.\n       Other screening devices are being tested and deployed. In \n     Norfolk, Va., Virginia International Terminals is installing \n     radiation detectors on cranes, which will screen each \n     container as it is offloaded. As of now, Customs agents use \n     pager-sized radiation monitors that warn of excessive \n     radiation as they walk by rows of containers. Some estimates \n     put the cost of equipping all major ports with large scanners \n     at $5 billion.\n\n\n                          better intelligence\n\n       Some say the solution would be to inspect all U.S.-bound \n     containers before they leave a foreign port. But the \n     difficulty of doing that may be too great.\n       ``No one can argue against vetting cargo before it is \n     shipped, but you need the political will and resources to do \n     it,'' says John Hyde, general manager for security with \n     Maersk Sealand, one of the world's largest shipping \n     companies. ``When you're talking about putting requirements \n     on other sovereign nations, you can never be sure of what the \n     reaction will be.''\n       Many in industry and government, argue that there is no \n     need to check each of the thousands of containers that arrive \n     daily. They note that only 1,000 < less than 1% < of the \n     450,000 shippers who send cargo to the USA, account for \n     nearly 60% of all containers shipped to this country. A \n     majority of containers come from well-known and trusted \n     companies that make regular weekly runs to U.S. ports. ``It \n     is impossible to inspect everything, but you don't need to \n     inspect everything,''Bonner says. ``We are pretty good at \n     being able to sort out what needs to be inspected.''\n       To that end, the Coast Guard has joined with Customs, the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service and several \n     intelligence agencies to begin sorting out information about \n     containers before they arrive. After Sept. 11, the Coast \n     Guard initiated the Ship Arrival Notification System, the \n     nation's first centralized database on the movement of cargo \n     ships.\n       Before this system, the Coast Guard captain in charge of \n     security at each port only had to be notified of a shipment \n     24 hours before a cargo ship was due to arrive. Now that same \n     information arrives 96 hours in advance at the Coast Guard's \n     computer center in West Virginia. Information about the ship, \n     its containers and crew is entered into a database that can \n     be cross-referenced with immigration, FBI and Customs data.\n       The database allows many agencies to track the movement of \n     cargo around the world. Officials hope it will help zero in \n     on unknown shipping companies or a sudden shift in business \n     practices or cargoes that makes no sense. ``If a ship leaves \n     Genoa, Italy with palm oil bound for a port that normally \n     doesn't import palm oil, you might take a closer look,'' says \n     Capt. Tony Regalbutto, the Coast Guard's director of port \n     security.\n       Flynn sees this as the first step to a system that will \n     track individual containers as they are loaded overseas and \n     sent to U.S. ports. ``People have compared this to a needle \n     in a haystack problem,'' he says. ``But if you develop good \n     intelligence about what is a threat and what isn't, you get \n     the information down to a manageable number of targets. ''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   [From Business Week, Apr. 1, 2002]\n\n            Commentary: Freight Transport: Safe From Terror?\n\n                         (By Lorraine Woellert)\n\n       With its heavy traffic and massive chemical-storage tanks, \n     the Port of Houston would seem a tempting target for \n     terrorists. Touring the site in January, Senator John Breaux \n     (D-La.) asked what had been done to protect the 25-mile-long \n     seaway. A Coast Guard official assured him that the harbor \n     had been declared a security zone. Breaux was unimpressed. \n     ``That's like putting a `No Trespassing' sign on a nuclear \n     reactor,'' he said.\n       In the wake of the September 11 attacks, Washington \n     scrambled to shore up aviation security with tough new \n     passenger- and baggage-screening laws and criminal-background \n     checks on airport workers. But half a year later, U.S. land \n     and sea borders remain almost as vulnerable as ever. \n     Lawmakers hot to jump on the homeland-security bandwagon a \n     few months ago have succumbed to inertia, leaving the \n     nation's most at-risk transportation systems unprotected. \n     ``There has been a gross lack of focus,'' says Edward \n     Wytkind, executive director of the AFL-CIO's transportation-\n     trades division.\n       Altogether, trains, trucks, and ships move more than $1 \n     trillion worth of freight--about 99% of all U.S. cargo--into \n     the country every year. Seaports, which handle some $700 \n     billion of that cargo, are the first line of vulnerability. \n     If a disruption at one of the country's 361 ports leads the \n     U.S. government to shut them down the way it grounded air \n     traffic in September, it would bring some $2 billion a day in \n     seaborne trade to a dead stop and instantly cripple the \n     domestic economy.\n       Today, port ``security'' means little more than a few miles \n     of fencing and the occasional container search. Despite \n     stepped-up patrols by Coast Guard and Customs agents after \n     September 11, ships sail freely in and out of the nation's \n     inland and coastal ports. The network relies on an honor \n     system: It's up to carriers to announce their arrivals and \n     disclose their hauls. Federal agents search only about 2% of \n     the 11 million containers that make their way through the \n     U.S. maritime system each year--double the pre-September 11 \n     rate but still frighteningly low. ``You have a ship with \n     7,000 containers on it, and what do we do? Check the \n     manifest,'' laments Representative Don Young (R-Ala.), \n     chair of the House Transportation & Infrastructure \n     Committee, which is working on a port-security bill. \n     ``We're taking containers from Pakistan, and we don't know \n     what's in them.''\n       Lawmakers may be indignant, but their efforts to plug \n     security gaps have been few and ill-fated. In December, the \n     Senate, led by Commerce Committee Chairman Earnest F. \n     Hollings (D-S.C.), passed a $4 billion wish list of grants \n     and loans to buy equipment to search more incoming cargo \n     containers. Hollings' bill also would toughen hiring \n     standards by requiring maritime workers to pass a criminal-\n     background check similar to one imposed on nearly all airport \n     workers.\n       However, the idea of eliminating felons from the workforce, \n     a provision that sailed through Congress as part of an \n     aviation-security bill last year, has come under fire from \n     labor, including the Teamsters and the AFL-CIO-affiliated \n     longshoremen. They say requiring no felony convictions as a \n     prerequisite to holding a job amounts to double jeopardy for \n     workers who have already paid their dues to society.\n       Industry has its own problems with the idea. As a major \n     player at U.S. ports, the American Trucking Assn. supports \n     criminal-background checks but fears its members could be \n     sued by disgruntled job applicants denied work because of \n     something that showed up on their record. The ATA wants \n     protection from liability. It also worries that a background \n     check involving multiple agencies will prove time-consuming \n     and costly.\n       In the House, Young has labeled the Hollings measure \n     ``stupid'' because it puts the onus on the U.S. government to \n     search every incoming vessel instead of forcing overseas \n     transportation centers such as China and Panama to boost \n     their own security. But Young's vision has problems of its \n     own. He is seeking to establish an entirely new cargo-\n     information tracking system under the Transportation Dept., \n     duplicating work already being done by Customs and adding \n     another layer to the multi-agency bureaucracy that now \n     regulates container traffic. ``Neither shippers, carriers, \n     nor the government would be served by competing cargo-\n     information systems,'' says Christopher L. Koch, president \n     and CEO of the World Shipping Council in Washington.\n       Lawmakers--lacking the attention span or the willpower \n     necessary to sort out freight's complexities--seem inclined \n     to settle on politically expedient legislation that \n     emphasizes high-tech gadgetry, spot container searches, and \n     other piecemeal fixes. Such an approach could derail \n     container-traffic flow as dramatically as a terrorist attack. \n     ``It would grind the U.S. economy to a halt,'' says Jonathan \n     Gold, trade-policy director at the International Mass \n     Retailers Assn.\n       As Congress treads water, the next-best option is emerging \n     in the U.N., where the Coast Guard is pushing new \n     international standards for container inspection, worker \n     licensing, sea marshals, and a long-overdue system for \n     tracking ships at sea. It's an ambitious goal, and one that \n     requires U.S. cooperation. ``If we ask these foreign ports to \n     put security measures in place, then we have to be prepared \n     to do the same thing here,'' Fold says. Whether it's \n     motivated by fear or by shame, Congress must push harder for \n     secure transportation systems.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is my understanding from leadership that the vote is \nnow going to take place at 11:15. I ask unanimous consent that the \nremaining time be equally divided between now and 11:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Alaska such \ntime as he may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Aviation Security Act of 2001 came in \nthe immediate wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks and we may \nsoon send to the President for his signature the bill creating the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. The Maritime and Transportation \nSecurity Act of 2002 is another important piece of national security \nlegislation that will provide the organizational structure, \ncoordination and planning needed to safeguard our Nation's ports. I \nthank Senator Hollings, Senator McCain and Congressman Don Young for \ntheir tireless efforts to move this legislation through Congress.\n\n[[Page S10983]]\n\n  Under the Act, initial vulnerability assessments will be made to \ndetermine vessels and ports that pose a high risk of being involved in \na marine transportation security incident. Attention will be given to \ndeterring and responding to such incidents, and an overall evaluation \nwill be provided on the potential threat level of maritime terrorist \nattacks.\n  This port security assessment is imperative for our State of Alaska, \nwhich has roughly one-half the coastline in the United States. Alaska's \neconomy and quality of life are directly related to the functionality \nof it's numerous ports. The majority of our Alaskan communities, \nincluding Juneau our State Capital, are not on the road system and \ndepend almost exclusively on marine trade for the delivery of basic \ngoods. A terrorist attack at a port in Alaska, or anywhere on the West \nCoast, would cause significant interruptions in maritime service to our \nState, greatly affecting our way of life.\n  In addition, there are several other ports in Alaska vital to Alaska \nand the rest of the Nation. This is especially true of the Port of \nValdez, which is the southern terminus of the 800 mile long Trans-\nAlaska oil pipeline. Valdez is an important off-loading terminal for \nour Nation's domestic energy supply. A terrorist incident here would \nimpact U.S. oil production, without any question, and have a \ndevastating effect on Alaska's fisheries. Dutch Harbor is consistently \nthe top commercial fishing port in America, processing and shipping \nproduct to the rest of the world. Kodiak has the largest Coast Guard \npresence in the Nation and the Island of Kodiak has launch facilities \nthat make it an important staging area for future military and NASA \noperations that are vital to our Nation's national missile defense \nsystem.\n  The Maritime and Transportation Security Act of 2002 also includes \nCoast Guard authorization for fiscal year 2003. This is extremely \nimportant for the continued success of the Coast Guard in its ever \nevolving and expanding role in securing our Nation's coastal \nboundaries.\n  I commend the chairman and the future chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee for bringing this bill to the floor, and I support its \nimmediate passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. For purposes of notifying Members of the Senate, there has \nbeen a train accident. I hope it is not serious, but we have a couple \nof people on the train. We are now in the process of working out a \nunanimous consent agreement to have the vote maybe 45 minutes later \nthan scheduled.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We scheduled the vote for 11 a.m.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Actually, 11:15.\n  Mr. REID. It may be later than that.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield such time as he may consume to the \ndistinguished Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished chairman of the \nCommerce Committee for his involvement and his leadership in bringing \nthis legislation to the floor, as well as the ranking member of the \nCommerce Committee, the Senator from Arizona, and everyone really who \nhas been involved in this legislation.\n  Suffice it to say, the conditions in the world, and in the United \nStates in particular, have changed dramatically since the events of 9/\n11. Things we took for granted, things we did not pay a great deal of \nattention to, are no longer the status quo. The Commerce Committee, to \nthe credit of the leadership of our committee and Senator Hollings, had \ntaken up the concept of making sure our ports were more secure even \nbefore 9/11.\n  The Commerce Committee in August of 2001, before 9/11, passed a \nseaport security bill by a unanimous vote. The committee was clearly on \ntop of potential problems before 9/11. But certainly after the events \nof 9/11 it became clear we needed to do more even than we originally \nhad done in the legislation.\n  I have the privilege of chairing, under the Commerce Committee, the \nSubcommittee on Surface Transportation. At the suggestion of the \nchairman, it was determined we should have field hearings around the \nUnited States. We had field hearings in six different port cities in \nthe country. We had hearings in the chairman's hometown of Charleston, \nSC, and the home of the Senator from Texas, the Port of Houston. We had \nhearings in the Port of New Orleans. We had hearings in Fort \nLauderdale. We had hearings on the west coast. We had hearings on the \ngulf, Atlantic, and Pacific, to learn the conditions of the ports of \nthe United States regarding security.\n  We found when everyone is in charge, no one is in charge. In a number \nof ports, the sheriff's department was involved in security. In some \nports they had port security police partially in charge. In some areas \nthey depended totally on the U.S. Coast Guard to do all the work--which \nthey cannot do. Some had very lax security on the perimeter, on the \nshore surrounding the ports.\n  Every day, literally thousands and thousands of men and women drive \ntrucks loaded with containers into port facilities. We need to know who \nthey are. We need to know what their purpose in being there is. We need \nto know as much as we can about who comes and who exits these \ninternational ports.\n  It is very interesting how commerce works. One container can carry as \nmuch as 60,000 pounds of whatever you want to put in it. There are \nships entering our ports and laying alongside the docks containing as \nmuch as 3,000 separate containers on one ship. Each container carried \nas much as 60,000 pounds of whatever someone wants to put in them.\n  The USS Cole had a small vessel pull alongside of it and blow a hole \nin the side of it, killing American sailors; one relatively small boat \npulled right alongside the USS Cole, a military naval warship. At the \nsame time, remember what happened in Oklahoma City. Approximately \n15,000 pounds of explosives blew down the Federal Building with drastic \nconsequences to human life and to the stability of that city, shaking \nthe confidence of this Nation. One person with 15,000 pounds of \nexplosives knocked down an entire Federal building.\n  One container has 60,000 pounds of product that can be put into a \nship that may have 3,000 containers. The potential for damage if a \nterrorist wants to target one of the ports of this country by placing \nexplosives in one of these containers is great.\n  We had the example of one Egyptian who took a container and \npractically made an apartment out of it. He got a container in the \nMiddle East, had himself equipped with a cell phone, food, a bunk to \nsleep in, and literally was transported from the Middle East, through \nItaly, destined for Canada, and ultimately to the United States. Who \nknows what he was intent on doing? Again, one ship, with 3,000 \ncontainers; how do we determine what is in each container?\n  Some of our large container vessels pull alongside our ports. We saw \nin Houston, in the Port of New Orleans at the hearings we held, the \nPort of south Louisiana, the Port of Baton Rouge--there are miles and \nmiles of ports--some of these ports have, right alongside them, a \nliquefied natural gas facility. Next to the liquefied natural gas \nfacility there could be an oil and gas refinery. Imagine the damage \nthat could occur with one container loaded with explosives in a ship \ndocked alongside an LNG facility, which is next to an oil and gas \nrefinery, which may be followed by several other chemical plants. One \ncontainer exploding could set off a chain reaction with a great deal of \ndamage and a great loss of life.\n\n  Some of our ports are located in urban areas. The Port of Houston, \nthe Port of New Orleans, the Port of New York, the Port of New Jersey, \nthe Port of Fort Lauderdale, the Port of Savannah, the Port of \nCharleston they are all located in urban areas. There is a grave \npotential for damage.\n  The point I make is that things have changed since 9/11. A port \nmanager was asked: How do you secure vessels pulling alongside these \nLNG facilities? How do you assure they know what they are doing? How do \nyou secure the area? This individual said: Well, we have a sign posted \nthat says ``No Trespassing.'' I doubt a person intent on blowing up a \ncity or doing grave damage to one of our ports will be deterred by a \nsign that says ``No Trespassing.'' They will not pay any attention to \nit.\n\n[[Page S10984]]\n\n  The fact is we have to have people involved in security. We have to \nhave people in a chain of command, people who know what they are doing, \nwho is doing it, and what is the responsibility of each particular \nsegment of law enforcement operations.\n  This legislation will help do that. This legislation for the first \ntime will say every port in the United States of America will have to \ndevelop a comprehensive port security plan. Some of them have plans in \nplace now, but I don't think they are as comprehensive as they need to \nbe, and some have almost nothing. A comprehensive port security plan \nunder the U.S. Coast Guard, working with the local port and local law \nenforcement officials, can design a plan that fits a particular port. \nWhat may be necessary in the Port of Savannah may not be necessary in \nthe Port of Houston. What is necessary in the Port of Houston may not \nfit in the Port of Charleston. Each port has to have a plan designed to \nmeet the needs of that particular area.\n  Not only do the operations along the water's edge have to be better \nsecured, the entire facility has to be secured. As I said, we have \nliterally thousands of incoming and outgoing trucks loaded with \ncontainers. We need to know who those people are bringing in the \ncontainers, what their purpose is. No longer can a port be a tourist \nattraction. No longer can someone say let's go to the port and see the \nships. Unfortunately, times have changed. We need better security, \nbetter perimeter protection, better knowledge about the cargo on the \nships, better knowledge of the crew on the ships.\n  We have transponders on airplanes. We have GPS systems in \nautomobiles. There is no reason every ship that comes into an American \nport will not have a GPS system on it, an identification system on it, \nan automatic identification signal that can transport to the port \nauthorities where that ship is at all times--not just when it comes in, \nbut when it actually reaches the floor, while it is in port.\n  Senator Graham, who has been instrumental in helping pass this \nlegislation, raised at the press conference yesterday the concern about \nthe vessel that came in from Haiti. That vessel did not just come close \nto the U.S. shores, it actually landed on the beaches of Key Biscayne, \nFL. As Senator Graham has pointed out, instead of being a group of \nrefugees, suppose it was a same-sized vessel, loaded with explosives, \nwith a terrorist who was willing to commit suicide, who instead of \ndropping off several hundred refugees had pulled alongside one of the \nlarge buildings in the Port of Miami, or pulled alongside one of the \ncruise vessels loaded with passengers, and blew up his vessel and the \nvessels surrounding his vessel. That cannot be allowed to happen.\n  This legislation will help the ports do the job they need to do. \nUnfortunately, we do not have any funding other than a grant program to \nthe local ports. Most of the cost will have to be borne by the U.S. \nCoast Guard. I say to Senator Hollings and those on the Appropriations \nCommittee, it is going to be their great task to make sure we \nadequately fund the Coast Guard to carry out those plans, because they \nare going to cost more. We have to do a better job. It is going to cost \nmoney. What about the local ports? We talked about a user fee, which I \nthought was a better idea, to spread the cost across society. It would \nbe very small if we did it that way, but that's not part of this bill. \nThere are local grants that ports can apply for, because it is going to \ncost to do the security they need. I am hopeful that program will be \nsufficient in order to allow our ports to do the work that is needed.\n\n  This is a good piece of legislation. It can go a long way toward \nsecuring U.S. ports, which today are very vulnerable, which today, I \nwould add, are potential targets. This legislation, when in place, will \ngo a long way to providing the security of which we can all be proud.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would first like to thank Senator \nHollings and Senator McCain for helping us get this bill through the \ncommittee. Senator Breaux's remarks were right on target. I hosted \nSenator Breaux's hearing in Houston. He toured the Port of Houston with \nme. We saw firsthand what some of the problems are.\n  I have to say, I was very impressed with what the Port of Houston is \ndoing on its own. Using its own resources, it has beefed up its patrols \nand its security guards. Certainly, the Coast Guard is more involved in \nchecking manifests and the ships that come into the Port of Houston. \nBut the fact is, the Port of Houston is the largest port in America in \nterms of foreign tonnage. It handles more than half of the Nation's \npetrochemical capacity. We certainly need Federal funding and support \nto make sure a port like this one, which is vulnerable, and presents \nsuch a risk, has a fully implemented security system.\n  I thank Senator Breaux for coming to see firsthand this great port in \nmy State, for looking at what they are doing on their own, and then \nrealizing the need to give them added help through this port security \nbill. I am very pleased that we are taking this first step.\n  Due to the volume of hazardous materials, a terrorist attack in the \nPort of Houston could result in the loss of millions of lives. Of \ncourse, it would also interrupt our Nation's energy supplies, \ndelivering a huge blow to our economy at a time when we certainly \ncannot afford any more economic disturbances. However, there are other \nports as well in my State, and smaller ports throughout our Nation.\n\n  In my State of Texas we have Corpus Christi, Brownsville, Port \nLavaca, Galveston, Freeport, and Texas City. They each have different \nchallenges. Some have to safeguard cruise ships. Cruise ships are a \nnew, burgeoning tourist industry that is working particularly in \nGalveston. We are very happy about this, but it means we have to \nsafeguard these cruise ships by taking similar security measures.\n  Texas City, on the other hand, faces the security challenge of \nscreening cargo containers and shipping vessels on a shoestring budget. \nWe have Brownsville and Corpus Christi that are becoming very important \nports for Central and South American goods coming in. We are very \npleased about that, but they too need security.\n  So this is a compromise bill. It lays the foundation for a port \nsecurity system under the Transportation Security Administration. It \nrequires security plans for every port, background checks for employees \nwith access to secure areas, and improved identification technology for \nboth individuals and vessels traveling in United States waters. The \nproposed Homeland Security Department would also be tasked to assess \npotential threats presented by security practices at foreign ports, so \nthat we are able to find out if a foreign port is particularly lax. \nThen we would have to take extra steps for ships coming into the United \nStates from that port, whether it is the port of origin or whether it \nis a through-port.\n  I think those are the steps we need to take. I support this \ncompromise because certainly it is important to take these immediate \nfirst steps. However, I do not think the bill goes far enough. I am an \noriginal cosponsor, with Senator Feinstein, of the Comprehensive \nSeaport and Container Security Act that would provide more resources \nand greater emphasis on port security. Our bill requires profiling of \ncargo containers and scrutiny of high-risk shippers.\n  We are not closing the book on port security with the passage of this \ncompromise bill, but we are taking a major first step. I look forward \nto working with Senator McCain, Senator Hollings, Senator Breaux, and \nothers who are very concerned about the whole port security issue. In \nthe next session, I look forward to really addressing the container \ncargo and other high-risk port needs, and to assure we do not have a \nvoid in our port areas. Senator Stevens was saying the other night that \n50 percent of the American people live within 50 miles of a port. That \nis a very important statistic. We have to check our ports, our people, \nand the goods coming into this country.\n  I am very pleased we have taken this first step, because what we have \ndone in aviation certainly has been a huge improvement. Are we finished \nwith aviation? No, we are not. But are our airports safer today than \nthey were on 9/10/01? Yes, they are.\n\n[[Page S10985]]\n\n  I travel as much as anybody in America, commuting back and forth to \nmy home State every week. I see a significant difference in the quality \nof screening with the new Transportation Authority personnel. They are \ntrained. They are polite. They are doing their jobs in a professional \nway and I am very proud of that. We need to do more and, hopefully, we \nare going to address some of the other aviation needs in the very near \nfuture. But right now we are addressing a major area of responsibility \nfor our country and that is the security of our ports, the people, and \nthe cargo that comes through our ports.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will be brief. I came over from my \ncommittee meeting for two reasons. One is to compliment the chairman, \nthe Senator from South Carolina. Frankly, were it not for his \nconsistent and persistent efforts on security--port security and, I \nmight add, rail security--we would not be standing here today. There is \nmuch to say about this legislation and I am not going to take the time \nnow.\n  I do want to add one other point. I am sorry many more of my \ncolleagues, understandably, are in committee meetings right now and are \nnot here to hear this. We are taking the action that is necessary to \ndeal with a legitimate and real security concern for America's ports. I \nmight add there is more traffic up and down the Delaware River into \nPhiladelphia, with oil traffic in particular, than I think almost any \nother place in the country. There are a number of refineries in my \nState and in the neighboring State of Pennsylvania and ports in New \nJersey and Pennsylvania and Delaware. So this is very important to us.\n  But equally important to us is rail security. My friend, the \nPresiding Officer, a former Governor, knows about security, what the \nCIA indicated. I can publicly indicate it. They indicated the most \nlikely target is going to be rail. Since 9/11, my friend from South \nCarolina passed out very significant rail security legislation--$1.2 \nbillion. It is a clearly documented need and an overwhelming concern, \nlisted by the CIA as a likely target for terrorists--and we have done \nnothing on it. We have done nothing.\n  I realize it is a bit of a broken record. I have been on the floor \nmany times speaking to this. But I just say we are going to rue the day \nwe failed to take the action that has been documented which we need to \ntake to enhance the security of our rail system.\n  Let me give you again two examples. Then I will cease. But I want the \nRecord to show every day we wait, we are putting thousands of lives in \njeopardy. When you say thousands of lives, what are you talking about, \nSenator? Right now, as we speak, there are more people in a tunnel on a \ntrain under New York City--at this moment--than there are on five full \n747 aircraft. Those tunnels were built at the turn of the century. They \nhave no escape. They have no lighting. They have no ventilation. \nImmediately after the Civil War, the Baltimore tunnel was built for \nfreight and passengers.\n  You may remember that a little over a year ago there was a fire in \nthe Baltimore tunnel--just a regular old fire--no terrorist act. It \nshut down Baltimore. In that tunnel, there is nothing. It was cut \nthrough granite in 1869. Nothing has been done to that tunnel. Even its \nsignal systems are not adequate. We know this. Contracts have already \nbeen let. We already have the design. There is no need for design work. \nIt has already been done. We could literally start tomorrow.\n  My friend from South Carolina has documented all of this in his \nhearings. He has laid it out in spades. He has made it clear to \neverybody. But somehow we just think, OK, rail transportation is not \nvery much. It is the ultimate stepchild, both in terms of our \ntransportation network and in terms of security.\n  It has been over a year since my friend from South Carolina reported \nout a $1.2 billion piece of legislation on security. I am not even \ntalking about Amtrak--just basic security needs. We don't even have \ndogs available to sniff luggage in cars. There is nothing. There is \nvirtually nothing at all.\n  I just want to say I am not going to be here saying I told you so, \nbecause that would be unfair. But we are making a serious mistake, \ntotally ignoring what the CIA has publicly pointed out is a targeting \nconcern, and what everybody knows; that is, the threat of terror and \nthe richness of the targets available on the rail system.\n  I am all for this port security bill. I think it is a very positive \nstep forward. But I just say to my friends we are making a tragic \nmistake having held up now for the better part of a year the rail \nsecurity legislation that was passed out of committee and for which I \nthink there is a consensus. We can't get a vote on it. I think it is a \ntragic mistake.\n  Again, this is not in any way suggesting my State is very much \nimpacted by this port security legislation. We have thousands upon \nthousands of containers coming into my little State. We have major \nexport and import of automobiles coming in the Port of Wilmington. We \nare within the shadow of the Port of Philadelphia in Camden. More oil \ncomes up the Delaware River than I think any other estuary, taking care \nof the Delaware Valley where there are over 10 million people.\n  I am in no way suggesting we shouldn't be doing what we are doing. I \nam suggesting we are making a tragic mistake by not acting on rail \nsecurity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may take.\n\n  I am very surprised by the comments made by the Senator from \nDelaware. The fact is we did pass out a rail security bill. The Senator \nfrom Delaware wanted to add on billions of dollars for all kinds of \nassistance to railroads, which has had very little to do with security. \nI am all for security. But the Senator from Delaware and I are known \nfor our differences of opinion about Amtrak and how much of American \ntax dollars should be spent on Amtrak. In fact, it has been about $20 \nbillion to $30 billion in the last few years. We are still subsidizing \nrail routes to the tune of $200 to $300 per passenger.\n  But the fact is the reason we don't have a rail security bill is \nbecause of the desire to add on the bill billions and billions that \nhave nothing to do with rail security.\n  If the Senator from Delaware wants to pass our version of the bill \nwhich has nothing to do with the additional billions that are the \nsubject of debate on the transportation bill and other bills, that is \nfine. But the reason we are making a tragic mistake here is because we \ndidn't move forward just rail security. There was a strong desire by \nsupporters of Amtrak to lard onto it billions of dollars of additional \nspending having nothing to do with rail security.\n  I look forward to working with the Senator from Delaware. They should \nbe separated. Subsidization forever of Amtrak is not something this \nSenator will ever support when we subsidize rail routes, in the case of \na line in Wisconsin--recently terminated, thank God--at $2,000 per \npassenger. There is something wrong with the way Amtrak is being \nsubsidized.\n  I look forward to working with the Senator from Delaware. But let us \nhave no doubt as to why rail security didn't pass this floor with this \nSenator's endorsement, which is because of the additional billions of \ndollars that were going to be added onto it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, that has nothing to do with rail security. \nAnd as incoming chairman of the committee, I will be glad to review \nthis issue of Amtrak. We will get the GAO up again, and the GAO will \ntalk about the incredible subsidization of Amtrak which costs American \ntaxpayers billions and billions of dollars per passenger. That is the \nsubject of another day of debate.\n  But to come on this floor and say that we are making a ``tragic \nmistake,'' in the words of the Senator from Delaware, by not passing \nthe rail security bill, I say it is a tragic mistake to add billions of \ndollars of pork onto rail security when rail security should have been \nthe primary and only focus of a rail security bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I agree this is not the moment for debate \non that. Let me respond very briefly.\n  The bill was $1.2 billion and $900 million was for the tunnels, \nperiod. I don't know where the additional billions of\n\n[[Page S10986]]\n\ndollars come from. OK, $1.2 billion. Subtract $900 million. You are \nthen talking about $300 million. Of that, the money went to a lot of \nthings that relate to dogs, sniffers, and a whole range of additional \nAmtrak police. We can argue about rail signal systems and other things, \nwhich I think are essential. Let us get the numbers straight. We are \ntalking about $1.2 billion. Usually what we do when we have billions \nlike this is we disagree. We at least bring them up and debate them on \nthe floor. We can't even get the bill brought up and debated on the \nfloor.\n  If my friend from Arizona--and he is my friend--is correct about \nbillions of dollars of subsidization to Amtrak, then I am sure he will \nprevail when we talk about a security bill. But I respectfully suggest \nthat is not the case.\n  No. 2, this really is for another day. I will just take 2 minutes.\n  We talk about, for example, the Wisconsin line. We do airports. We \npay $150 million a year. I think we added another $100 million--don't \nhold me to that--to go into something like 350 cities where nobody \nwants to fly, nobody wants to go. We pay the airlines. We subsidize \nthem to go into Bemidji, MN. I don't know where they go--places that no \none wants to fly into or out of. We subsidize them with 150 million \nbucks. We do that. We just roll over. That is no problem.\n  At any rate, that is for another day. But in the meantime, I hope we \nwill at least be able to get to the point where we can debate on the \nfloor here the rail security legislation and not prevent it from being \ndiscussed on the floor unless we have what individual Members want in a \nbill before it even gets to the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to briefly speak in support of \nthis legislation.\n  I come from a coastal area. When I was in the House of \nRepresentatives, I served on the Merchant Marine and Fisheries \nCommittee and was a member of the Commerce Committee. I pay close \nattention to the maritime industry and what is happening with our ports \nand our ships and shipping industry.\n  I am very pleased to see this legislation has been brought to the \nfloor. I commend the chairman of the committee, Senator Hollings, and \nthe ranking member, Senator McCain, as well as others who were involved \nin working through some of the difficulties to produce results. Senator \nStevens was involved in that, and Congressman Young on the House side. \nI had more than one conversation with Senator Thomas and Senators \nBaucus and Grassley.\n  A lot of people worked to help make the production of this \nlegislation possible. I must say, I am amazed it took that kind of a \nheave because this is such necessary legislation. We probably could \nhave and should have done it last summer. There is no use reviewing all \nof what went into that, but there is no doubt in my mind that we need \nto pay attention to port security. That is a place where we could have \nvulnerability.\n  I believe we are making progress in using sophisticated technology to \nbegin to address those threats, but, still, we need to pay attention to \nthis area and make sure we are doing all we can to protect the American \npeople from terrorist attack or exploitation in our ports.\n  The vast majority of the U.S. international trade flows through our \nports. And I have worried that some enterprising terrorist could put \nsome very devastating material on a tramp steamer or a boat that would \ncome into South Carolina, New York, Baltimore, or Pascagoula, MS, and \nhave a devastating impact on those communities. So we need to think \nthrough this.\n  Over the past few decades, international and domestic port \ntransportation systems have responded to ever-increasing volumes of \ntwo-way trade by increasing their efficiency at moving cargo. The \nchallenge before us, though, is to take steps to find out what is on \nthose ships, what is in that cargo. We have to look at the port of \ndemarcation. How do we deal with them on the high seas? How do we make \nsure a threat is properly checked into or assessed? What do we do once \nthey get into the ports?\n  So this is important legislation. It is not to diminish the threat in \nall the areas of transportation. We have to think about and review all \nof them: aviation, trucking, automobiles, points of entry on land. But \nthis is one area in which we need to take action, and that is what the \nlegislation does.\n  The administration took immediate steps to increase the security for \nour maritime transportation system. The Coast Guard dedicated \nincreasing resources to protecting our ports. The Customs Service \ninitiated programs to improve its awareness of all cargo movements into \nthe United States and to push its inbound cargo screening efforts out \nto foreign ports.\n  The Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002, that we are \nconsidering now, provides new direction to the administration and \nadditional authority so we can deal with this area in a comprehensive \nmanner.\n  The bill establishes a system of national, area, port, and waterfront \nfacility and vessel security and response planning and involves the \nState officials, local officials, and Federal officials and industry \nrepresentatives.\n  The bill improves the authority for the Customs Service to collect \ncargo information. It promotes the sharing of intelligence information \namong agencies involved in maritime transportation security and close \ncoordination of security planning and operations among those agencies.\n  To me, it is unfathomable that they could not do that anyway; that \nis, exchange information and get information. This bill will make sure \nthat authority is there.\n  The bill establishes a national transportation security card system \nto control personnel access to secure maritime terminal areas, \nincluding performing background checks on applicants. Again, I cannot \nbelieve we actually did not already have a system such as this in \nplace. I hope the administration will, and I urge them to, work closely \nwith the maritime industry, especially in those sectors with frequent \npersonnel turnover, such as the inland waterway towing vessel industry, \nto address their needs for quick approval of employee access to these \nsecure areas. We do not want to become another bureaucratic nightmare \nand maze of delay, but this system needs to be put in place.\n\n  So I do believe this bill will help us to assess the effectiveness of \nour antiterrorism measures at foreign ports and to work with those \nports to improve those measures. It will provide additional funds in \nthis area. It will give the Coast Guard more authority and authorizes \nmore assistance as they deal with marine safety and the maritime policy \nimprovements.\n  So this bill is a good achievement. I am glad we are getting it done. \nIt may wind up being one of only four or five conference reports on \nwhich we do complete action before we leave at the end of this session, \nbut this is one of which we should be proud.\n  I commend the chairman, once again, for being willing to take my \ncalls and sit down and say: Can't we just work together? We did and we \ngot the results. So I thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I was asked at a news conference yesterday, did we \ncapitulate on account of the elections? I said no. Under Senator Lott's \nleadership, we capitulated before the election. You got us together, \nand I really thank the Senator on behalf of all of us.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield such time as is necessary to the \nSenator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank our distinguished chairman, our \ndistinguished now minority leader, and our distinguished ranking member \nfor this legislation of vital importance to my community of New York, \none of the largest ports in the world.\n  We all know what the bill does. And all of these things are good \nsteps forward. I particularly thank Chairman Hollings for his \nsteadfastness on this bill.\n  All of us probably would have wanted a little more in this bill, and \nin a\n\n[[Page S10987]]\n\nminute I am going to talk about one particular area of importance to \nme. But one of our jobs here is not to let the perfect be the enemy of \nthe good.\n  We need to do so much in our ports, and this is a good first step. \nThe idea of assessing what our problems are, the idea of having a \nsecurity identification card, background checks, and all of these other \nthings I think are extremely important in terms of getting the needed \ntechnology because the terrorists are going to look for our most \nvulnerable pressure points.\n  We are doing the job on tightening up air security. I flew in from \nNew York this morning. I saw the new Federal people there. It is \nbetter. I do not know if it is good enough yet, but it is better. But \nwith our ports, we have virtually done nothing. This bill is a very \ngood first step. And, again, I thank our chairman.\n  I want to talk about one area, and that is, the authorizing language \nis in the bill we worked on, but, unfortunately, not all the money is \nthere to do it. I will try to alert my colleagues to this.\n\n  My great nightmare, as I think of how the terrorists would come back \nand strike us again--it might be al-Qaida; it might be Iraq; but who \nknows, it could be someone else, Chechens, East Timorese--but someone \ntakes a nuclear weapon and smuggles it into one of the containers that \ncome into one of our ports over our northern or southern borders and \nthen detonates it in a huge population area. As horrible as 9/11 was--\nand, believe me, I know that horror--this would be much worse.\n  So we should be doing everything we can to make sure our ports are \nsecure and to prevent nuclear weapons from being smuggled into our \ncountry, particularly in one of the large containers that come, by the \nthousands, to our ports on the east coast and west coast and the \ncontainers that come over our borders.\n  I have talked to experts, and they have said there is good news. The \ngood news is that every nuclear device emits gamma rays, and gamma rays \ngo through almost everything, so they are detectable. Only lead can \nstop it. And that can be dealt with by having an x-ray detector there \nas well.\n  The good news, in addition, was that at our national energy labs, \nsuch as Brookhaven and Argonne Forest, have such detection devices that \nwork 50 or 60 feet away. Unfortunately, the bad news is the only \npractical commercial device is a Geiger counter. A Geiger counter works \nfrom 2 or 3 feet away. And it is virtually impossible for us to send \npersonnel on to every container that comes to our ports or across our \nborders and hold that Geiger counter a couple of inches from each of \nthe scores of crates that are on each container.\n  As I talked further to these experts, they said, for a relatively \nsmall sum, they could take the radiation detectors that now exist in \nour cyclotrons and can detect radiation 50 or 60 feet away and make \nthem practical; namely, they have to make them smaller because they are \nvery large, and they have to make them less delicate because they could \nbounce around. But imagine if we had such detectors. We could put them \non every crane that loads or unloads a container. We could put them on \nevery tollbooth that a truck, over the Mexican border or Canadian \nborder, drives by and prevent a nuclear weapon from coming in. And even \nif these terrorists were so sophisticated that they surrounded the bomb \nin lead, we put an x ray next to it, and the x ray could detect the \nlead, and we know something is up, and we inspect the crate.\n  I brought this to the attention of my friend from Virginia, Senator \nWarner, and we introduced legislation that would do just this. We \nworked long and hard to try to get it as part of the homeland security \nbill, but that did not happen. But the knight on the white horse in \nthis area was the chairman from South Carolina because he put the \nlanguage that we devised, with some suggestions by the Senator from \nArizona and some by his own folks, in this bill.\n  We are now authorized to do research to figure out a way to detect \nnuclear devices from 50 or 60 or 70 feet away to prevent--God forbid--\nsomebody from bringing in a device.\n  There is only one problem. I regret to bring this up, but it is true. \nThe Senator from South Carolina has made the fight. We need about $250 \nmillion to come up with such a device. Unfortunately, only $90 million \nis authorized for the entire research and development section of this \nbill. This is not a frivolous expenditure. This is not pork. This is \nvital to our security.\n  I am supportive of this bill. I am grateful to the chairman. He made \nthe fight. I don't care if the Government or the private sector pays \nfor this; somebody should be paying for this research because we don't \nwant to wake up one morning and find a device smuggled into our country \nwhen we can stop it. That is the frustrating thing. We can stop it. \nThis is not one of those things like cancer where we can put billions \nof dollars in and hope and pray that research finds a cure and stops \nthe disease.\n  We know if we put in the money, these devices, which already exist, \ncan be practicalized so they can be put on every crane and on every \ntoll booth where a truck with a container comes over our borders.\n  I hope when we come back next year--this is hardly a partisan issue; \nas I said, it was the Senator from Virginia and myself who spearheaded \nthis--that we will put new effort into authorizing and appropriating a \nfew more dollars so the research that needs to be done to make us \nnuclear secure is done.\n  I supported our President's motion for the war on Iraq. One of the \nreasons I did was I was afraid that Iraq would develop nuclear weapons \ndown the road, and we couldn't allow them to do that because they might \nbe smuggled in here. It is not going to be just Iraq. In our brave new \nworld, our post-9/11 world, other groups can come up with these \ndevices. It is our solemn obligation to do everything we can to prevent \nthem from being smuggled in.\n  The bill the chairman has sponsored is a great first step. I hope \nwith his leadership and that of the Senator from Arizona, who made many \nsuggestions to this part of our bill, that next year we will move \nforward to appropriate the necessary dollars to get this done quickly \nand make our country safe.\n  I yield back the time to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the Maritime \nTransportation Security Act of 2002.\n  I applaud Senator Hollings, Chairman of the Commerce Committee, \nSenator McCain, the Ranking Member, and other members of the Port \nSecurity Conference Committee for their efforts, but I believe this \nlegislation can best be summed up as ``too little, too late.''\n  The Senate passed Port Security Legislation last December, yet only \nnow, almost a year later, is the Congress sending this bill to the \nPresident. Moreover, once this legislation passes, it will be years \nbefore the Department of Transportation and the Department of Homeland \nSecurity implement effective security measures at our 361 seaports.\n  I would have preferred seeing the Conferees embrace other ideas to \nimprove port security such as the legislation I introduced with \nSenators Kyl, Snowe, and Hutchison. Instead, the Conferees rejected \nmany proposals on port security and slimmed down the Senate Bill so \nthat it is now one part security and three parts Coast Guard \nauthorization language that has nothing to do with security.\n  I believe Congress ``missed the boat'' with this legislation and \nsquandered an opportunity to take aggressive action to erect a \nformidable barrier at our seaports.\n  We know ports present optimal targets to terrorists. And we know al-\nQaida operatives are coming after us. As CIA director George Tenet said \nrecently before the Intelligence Committee, of which I am a member: \n``al-Qaida is in an execution phase and intends to strike us both here \nand overseas; that's unambiguous as far as I am concerned.''\n  And this week we learned of a new tape that seems to be by Osama bin \nLaden, which made clear al-Qaida intends to go after us again soon.\n  The October 2002 report by Gary Hart and Warren Rudman demonstrates \nthat our ports remain especially vulnerable even more than a year after \nSeptember 11. The report points out, ``Only the tiniest percentage of \ncontainers, ships, trucks, and trains that enter the United States each \nday are subject to\n\n[[Page S10988]]\n\nexamination, and a weapon of mass destruction could well be hidden \namong this cargo.''\n  The Hart-Rudman report recommends revising transportation security \nbecause ``the vulnerabilities are greater and the stakes are higher in \nthe sea and land modes than in commercial aviation. Systems such as \nthose used in the aviation sector, which start from the assumption that \nevery passenger and every bag of luggage poses an equal risk, must give \nway to more intelligence-driven and layered security approaches that \nemphasize prescreening and monitoring based on risk-criteria.''\n  Since we cannot inspect every ship and every container, I introduced \nthe ``Comprehensive Seaport and Container Security Act'' earlier this \nyear to establish a system for container profiling. The Feinstein-Kyl-\nSnowe-Hutchison Port Security Bill would also push U.S. security \nscrutiny beyond our Nation's borders to intercept cargo before it \narrives near America's shores.\n  This complements the strategy Customs Commissioner Robert C. Bonner \nis in the process of implementing. To prevent a weapon of mass \ndestruction from getting to the U.S. in the first place, Customs has \nentered into formal agreements with a handful of foreign governments to \nstation U.S. inspectors at ports overseas to profile high risk cargo \nand target suspicious shipments for inspection.\n  The Customs Service is working to put groups of U.S. experts at the \ntop 20 ports as soon as possible and they are moving at an impressive \npace.\n  Hitting the 20 port threshold is essential because together, these \nports account for approximately 70 percent of the 5.7 million \ncontainers shipped by sea to the U.S. annually.\n  We have known for a long time that America's ports needed an \nextensive security strategy and upgrade. In the fall of 2000, a \ncomprehensive report was issued by the ``Interagency Commission on \nCrime and Security in U.S. Seaports.'' I testified before the \nCommission and I believe the group's report serves as a very thorough \nprimer on seaport security issues.\n  While often out of the public eye, ports across the United States are \nour nation's economic gateways. Every year U.S. ports handle over 800 \nmillion tons of cargo valued at approximately $600 billion. Excluding \ntrade with Mexico and Canada, America's ports handle 95 percent of U.S. \ntrade. Two of the busiest ports in the nation are in California, at Los \nAngeles / Long Beach and at Oakland.\n  S. 1214, the Senate-passed bill written by Chairman Hollings and \nmembers of the Commerce Committee, was drafted before the September 11 \nterrorist attacks to incorporate the recommendations made by the \nInteragency Commission into law. While changes were made to this \nlegislation before the Senate passed it in December of 2001 to focus \nmore on antiterrorism, I believe the Conferees could have taken more \naggressive action to improve the bill.\n  I would like to cite a few examples to show how this Conference \nReport is weaker than the Comprehensive Seaport and Container Security \nAct I have introduced.\n  The Feinstein-Kyl-Snowe-Hutchison port security bill establishes a \ncomprehensive risk profiling plan for the Customs Service to focus \ntheir limited inspection capabilities on high-risk cargo containers.\n  However, the only mention of such a plan in the Maritime Security Act \nconference report is this paragraph of report language: ``A vessel \nscreening system which provides shipping intelligence and analysis can \nbe utilized to identify those vessels requiring close inspection by the \nCoast Guard and other agencies. We urge the Coast Guard and port \nauthorities to include vessel risk profiling in their enhanced security \nprocedures.''\n  The Feinstein-Kyl-Snowe-Hutchison port security bill strengthens U.S. \nsecurity scrutiny beyond our Nation's borders to monitor and inspect \ncargo and containers before they arrive on America's shores.\n  However, the conferees of this Maritime Transportation Security Act \nonly required foreign ports to be evaluated and authorized a program \nfor U.S. officials to train foreign security officers abroad.\n  The Feinstein-Kyl-Snowe-Hutchison port security bill imposes steep \nmonetary sanctions and criminal penalties for incorrect cargo manifest \ninformation or failure to comply with filing requirements.\n  However, the conferees of this Maritime Transportation Security Act \nonly authorized civil penalties of up to $25,000 for a violation.\n  The Feinstein-Kyl-Snowe-Hutchison port security bill requires the \nTransportation Security Administration to set standards to ensure each \nport has a secure perimeter, secure parking facilities, controlled \npoints of access into the port, sufficient lighting, buildings with \nsecure doors and windows and an alarm.\n  However, the conferees of this Maritime Transportation Security Act \nonly required vulnerability assessments and a National Maritime \nTransportation Security Plan.\n  The Feinstein-Kyl-Snowe-Hutchison port security bill requires the use \nof high security seals and electronic tags on all containers coming \ninto the U.S. and requires empty containers destined for U.S. ports to \nbe sealed.\n  However, the conferees of this Maritime Transportation Security Act \nonly mandated the development of performance standards for seals and \nlocks on cargo containers.\n  I have pointed out several areas where I believe the Conferees could \nhave taken more aggressive steps, but I do want to endorse many of the \nsecurity measures in this conference report such as the requirement for \nall workers in a secure area of the port to have a transportation \nsecurity card and I support the $15 million annual authorization for 5 \nyears to fund research and development efforts.\n  I thank Senator Hollings, Senator McCain, and other members of the \nCommerce Committee for the work they have done on this important issue.\n  I look forward to continue to work with the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Commerce Committee to address the threats to our ports. I \nbelieve additional legislation will be essential to follow up on this \nsecurity bill. We must be better prepared for a terrorist attack than \nwe were last year.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \ncongratulate Senator Hollings and Senator McCain the Chairman and \nRanking Member of the Commerce Committee for reaching an agreement with \nthe House on the Maritime Transportation and Security Act of 2002, S. \n1214. I am proud to have served as a conferee on this very important \nlegislation that will significantly improve security in our Nations \nseaports. In addition the bill would reauthorize the Coast Guard, a \nmajor component in improving security in our ports and harbors.\n  As Chairman of the Oceans, Fisheries and Atmosphere Subcommittee, I \nhad the opportunity to chair an oversight hearing on the Coast Guard's \nrole in improving maritime security after the terrible attacks of \nSeptember 11. As Senators Hollings and McCain well know, even before \nSeptember 11, our maritime and port security was in sorry shape.\n  I wish to thank Chairman Hollings for including three provisions from \nS. 1587, the Port Threat and Security Act, which I introduced last year \nin order to improve safety and security in our nations ports.\n  The first provision requires an annual report to the Congress that \nwould list those nations whose vessels the Coast Guard has found would \npose a risk to our ports, or that have presented our government with \nfalse, partial, or fraudulent information concerning cargo manifests, \ncrew identity, or registration of the vessel. In addition the report \nwould identify nations that do not exercise adequate control over their \nvessel registration and ownership procedures, particularly with respect \nto security issues. We need hard information like this if we are to \nforce ``flag of convenience'' nations from providing cover to criminals \nand terrorists. This is very important as Osama bin Laden has used \nflags of convenience to hide his ownership in various international \nshipping interests. In 1998, one of bin Laden's cargo freighters \nunloaded supplies in Kenya for the suicide bombers who later destroyed \nthe embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.\n  Also included from S. 1587, was my proposal on Sea Marshals. Sea \nMarshals would be authorized to be used on\n\n[[Page S10989]]\n\nvessels as well as shore facilities both private and public to ensure \nsafe transportation of high interest vessels into our ports, such as \nliquefied natural gas tankers and cruise ships. In Boston we have an \nLNG facility in the middle of Boston Harbor. Obviously we need \nincreased security each time an LNG tanker offloads natural gas. Prior \nto September 11 these vessels were escorted by Coast Guard vessels into \nthe port but no armed guards were present on the vessel. I strongly \nbelieve that having armed personnel, such as sea marshals, on these \nhigh interest vessels is very important and will considerably increase \nsecurity in our Nation's ports, including Boston. The ability of \nterrorists to board a vessel and cause a deliberate release of LNG or \ngasoline for that matter is very real. Sea marshals will make it much \nmore difficult for this to happen. In addition, this legislation would \nrequire a feasibility study to determine the potential to use other \nFederal, State or local law enforcement personnel as well as documented \nUnited States Merchant Marine personnel as sea marshals in the future.\n  Finally, this legislation includes a provision that would require the \nadministration to begin a vigorous foreign port threat assessment \nprogram. Inspectors would evaluate the effectiveness of security \npractices in both cargo and passenger terminals around the world. This \nlegislation allows the United States to prohibit any vessel from \nentering the United States if the vessel has embarked passengers or \ncargo from foreign ports that do not have adequate security measures as \ndetermined by our port threat assessment teams. Last year, inspectors \nin Italy checking a container bound for Canada discovered a member of \nthe al-Qaida terrorist organization hiding in a shipping container \nequipped with a bed and makeshift bathroom. The suspect, an Egyptian in \na business suit, had with him a Canadian passport, a laptop computer, \ntwo cell phones, airport maps, security passes for airports in three \ncountries and a certificate proclaiming him an airplane mechanic. We \nsimply cannot allow any country to have such poor security such that \nterrorists can stow away in a shipping container.\n  As I mentioned earlier this bill would also reauthorize the Coast \nGuard. The events of September 11 resulted in a new normalcy for the \nCoast Guard as port security and homeland defense missions rose to the \nforefront and our country realized the security shortcomings in our \nports. This legislation recognizes this fact and authorizes nearly $6 \nbillion for the Coast Guard in 2003. Obviously this country needs a \nviable and robust Coast Guard to safeguard our ports, and to ensure \nthat commerce and trade can continue to occur in our ports, safely, \nefficiently and most importantly without terrorist incident.\n  At the same time, the Coast Guard also has unique missions not \ncovered by any other federal agency. It is the only U.S. military \nservice with domestic law enforcement authority. It has the primary \nresponsibility of enforcing U.S. fisheries laws, carrying out drug \ninterdiction at sea, and protecting the marine environment against \npollution. I want to make it clear that all of these missions are \nimportant. And these traditional missions are suffering from resource \nconstraints.\n  This bill would also increase authorization for Coast Guard personnel \nfrom approximately 35,000 today, which is roughly the size of the New \nYork City Police Department to 45,500 by the end of this fiscal year.\n  This bill would authorize $4.3 billion for operating expenses in \nFY2003. Operating expenses cover all of the various activities of the \nCoast Guard, from boater safety and drug interdiction to port security, \nand adequate authorization is necessary to ensure that all of these \nCoast Guard operations can be carried out effectively.\n  This bill would also authorize $725 million in FY2003 for \nacquisition, construction, and improvement of equipment and facilities. \nMost of this funding will be used to fund the Deepwater Project, a long \noverdue modernization of the Coast Guard's Deepwater assets. The Coast \nGuard is the world's 7th largest navy yet they operate a fleet of ships \nthat rank 39th in age out of the world's 41 maritime fleets. The Coast \nGuard is operating World War II-era cutters in the deepwater \nenvironment to perform crucial environmental protection, national \ndefense, and law enforcement missions. In addition, Coast Guard \naircraft, which are operated in a maintenance-intensive salt water \nenvironment, are reaching the end of their useful lives as well. \nBesides high operating costs, these assets are technologically and \noperationally obsolete. The Deepwater program will not only reduce \noperational and maintenance costs, but will significantly improve upon \ncurrent command and control capabilities in the deepwater environment. \nI am delighted to see this program moving forward.\n  Every day on average, the Coast Guard saves 14 lives, seizes 209 \npounds of marijuana and 170 pounds of cocaine, and saves $2.5 million \nin property. Through boater safety programs and maintenance of an \nextensive network of aids to navigation, the Coast Guard protects \nthousands of other people engaged in coastwise trade, commercial \nfishing activities, and recreational boating. In addition, the Coast \nGuard has a role to play in Homeland Defense. It is vitally important \nthat we adequately fund and staff all of the missions of the Coast \nGuard. This legislation, while not as generous as many of us would \nlike, is a step in the right direction.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the legislation \nbefore the Senate which is designed to overhaul port security in this \nNation. Port security is a national imperative in the wake of September \n11. Frankly, I think it is regrettable that it has taken us this long \nto get to this point. After all, like aviation security, port security \nis national security, and it must now be viewed as such. We have to \nassume that every facet of our transportation system remains a target \nfor terrorism. Last year, we moved swiftly in an effort to close many \nof the gaps in our aviation security system, but we still have a long \nway to go on port and maritime security.\n  We cannot underestimate the importance of this issue. A terrorist \nattack at a major port could cost countless lives and have a \ndevastating impact on the national and global economy. As U.S. Customs \nService Commissioner Robert Bonner said recently, ``if terrorists used \na sea container to conceal a weapon of mass destruction and detonated \nit on arrival at a port, the impact on global trade and the global \neconomy could be immediate and devastating--all nations would be \naffected.'' At the same time, the 2000 interagency commission report \nfound the state of security in U.S. seaports generally ranges from poor \nto fair.\n  Remember, our ports link us to the world. They serve a crucial \npurpose. They give us access to global markets. Ships carry goods \ntotaling 95 percent of our foreign trade, excluding that with Canada \nand Mexico. Furthermore, the volume of goods passing through our ports \nis expected to double in the next 20 years. United States waters also \nsustain a $24 billion commercial fishing industry and a $71 billion \nrecreational and tourism industry.\n  As a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation and the port security conference committee, I am aware \nof the important responsibility we have to turn this situation around. \nAnd we can only achieve this with a comprehensive, exhaustive approach \nthat recognizes that the entire system is only as strong as its weakest \nlink.\n  The conference report before us today represents a multifaceted \napproach that runs the gamut and sets the stage for a complete \nreevaluation of port security from the ground up. We have an incredible \namount of collective talent and experience in this country, and I hope \nthat it can all be brought together to effect the kind of changes we \nneed to fix the deficiencies brought tragically home by 9/11.\n  First and foremost, it is vital that we ensure that the sum total of \nthe knowledge and resources of Federal, State, and local governments \nare brought to bear to both prevent disasters and respond to them. In \nthat light, coordination is critical, and the measure before us today \nprovides for greater coordination in this regard. In the wake of the \nSeptember 11 attacks, we saw outstanding responses at the local level, \nbut these actions were ad hoc--there were no national, standardized \ndirectives that could have been quickly disseminated and uniformly \nunderstood\n\n[[Page S10990]]\n\nand applied--in contrast to the FAA directive to ground all planes, \nwhich was enormously successful.\n  Well, I do not think there is any doubt we can no longer afford such \na piecemeal approach--if we are talking about our national security, \nwhich we are, we are talking about the need to establish a national \nresponse.\n  To confront the challenge of terrorism aimed at our maritime sector, \nwe need better information, better information sharing, and more \ncoordination. We need to enhance our ability to track cargo, and know \nwhat is being moved, with more inspectors, and improved technology. And \nwe need stringent international standards, so we stop terrorist plots \nbefore they reach our shores.\n  Security coordination between Federal, State, and local authorities \nhas been one of my top priorities in the aftermath of September 11, and \nI am pleased that the conference report greatly enhances coordination \nwith respect to port security. The bill requires comprehensive security \nand incident response plans for the Nation's 361 commercial seaports. \nIt also establishes a national maritime security committee and local \nmaritime security committees at each local port to better coordinate \nefforts and share critical information and intelligence.\n  I am particularly pleased that the conference report includes \nprovisions that build on legislation I introduced last fall to require \nships to electronically send their cargo manifests to a port before \ngaining clearance to enter. The port security conference report expands \non cargo security measures contained in the Trade Act of 2002 by \nrequiring that cargo and crew member information be relayed to port \nsecurity authorities prior to a cargo carrier's arrival in the United \nStates. The U.S. Customs Service would determine how far in advance to \nrequire such pre-arrival information.\n  The bill will also provide grants to local port security authorities, \nas well as $15 million annually during fiscal years 2003 through 2008 \nfor research and development grants for port security. I have seen \nfirsthand how important these port security grants are. In my home \nState of Maine, the city of Portland recently received a Federal grant \nof $175,000 for port security upgrades. However, the fact is that ports \nin Maine and across the country still need additional security-related \nfunding.\n\n  The conference report also addresses the complex issue of access to \nsecure areas of a port by requiring the Secretary of Transportation to \ndesign a comprehensive credentialing process for port workers. The bill \nestablishes a national standard for biometric security cards for \ntransportation workers, and would allow the Secretary to determine \nwhether an individual posed enough of a security risk to be denied an \nidentification card.\n  Finally, as ranking member of the commerce Committee's Subcommittee \non Oceans, Atmosphere, and Fisheries, I am please that this conference \nagreement includes provisions from my Coast Guard authorization bill. \nThe conference report will provide the Coast Guard with the funding and \npersonnel authorization levels it needs as well as over 30 other \nprovisions important to the Coast Guard and the maritime community. \nThis is the first time the Coast Guard has had an authorization bill \nsince 1998 and it was drafted to provide the Coast Guard with the tools \nit needs to operate in our post-September 11 reality.\n  The legislation provides a 1-year authorization for the Coast Guard \nto reflect the agency's changing priorities since September 11, \nincluding authorization for $1 billion in new funding, as President \nBush proposed in Portland, ME in February, and the authority to hire \n5,500 new personnel to meet both its new homeland security needs as \nwell as carry out its other traditional missions.\n  This bill also includes numerous measures which will improve the \nCoast Guard's ability to recruit, reward, and retain high-quality \npersonnel. It addresses various Coast Guard personnel management and \nquality of life issues such as promotions, retention, housing \nauthorities, and education.\n  Last year alone, the Coast Guard responded to over 40,000 calls for \nassistance, assisted $1.4 billion in property, and saved 3,355 lives. \nThese brave men and women risk their lives to defend our borders from \ndrugs, illegal immigrants, and other national security threats. In \n2001, the Coast Guard seized a record 132,920 pounds of cocaine and \n50,000 pounds of marijuana, preventing these substances from reaching \nour streets and playgrounds. they also stopped 4,210 illegal migrants \nfrom reaching our shores. They conducted patrols to protect our vital \nfisheries stocks and they responded to over 11,000 pollution incidents.\n  And in the wake of September 11, the men and women of the Coast Guard \nhave been working harder than ever in the service's largest peacetime \nport security operation since World War II. These operations are all \ncritical to defending our country, protecting our borders, preserving \nour environment, saving lives, and ensuring commerce moves safely \nthrough our waters.\n  As a conferee on this bill, I am proud of the work we have done, and \nthat we are sending a strong and meaningful port security bill to the \nPresident. We know full well that the world has changed, and seaport \nsecurity cannot be taken for granted. We also know that our \ntransportation system must be secure if we are to move the Nation \nforward, and also ensure that we are in a position of strength to be \nable to wage the kind of war necessary to eradicate terrorism.\n  So I urge all my colleagues to offer a strong show up support for \nthis important legislation.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for the \nimportant agreement that my fellow conferees and I achieved in the \nconference on the Port and Maritime Security bill. For many months, our \nstaffs have worked tirelessly to help us reach an agreement that meets \nthe needs of security while allowing commerce to flourish. This \nbipartisan legislation strikes a good balance between security and \ntrade, and I'm glad to see that it will be headed for the President's \ndesk.\n  This legislation, of which I am an original cosponsor, aims to \nprotect U.S. ports against terrorist attacks. The safer Oregon's ports \nare, the more prosperous they will be. I am also pleased to see that \nmany programs important to Oregon will continue to thrive. These \nprograms play a critical role in supporting Oregon's commerce and \nports, which support 1 in 7 jobs in the State. The Maritime Fire Safety \nAssociation on the Lower Columbia will continue its important work \nalong with the important Coast Guard stations that maintain safety and \nmanage fisheries for communities on the Columbia River and along \nOregon's coast.\n  In addition to safeguards for Oregon businesses, I am also pleased \nthat the agreement recognizes the important environmental laws that \nhelp maintain our State's environmental treasures and will continue to \nprotect Oregon's ocean and coastal environment.\n  I especially want to commend Chairman Hollings for his perseverance \non this legislation, and I thank my fellow conferees for their hard \nwork on this important bill.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today, the Senate will consider and approve \na final agreement on maritime and seaport security. This important \nlegislation will address critical security issues at America's \nseaports, and I rise to applaud the efforts of Chairman Hollings and my \nother colleagues who served on the conference committee that brokered \nthis historic agreement.\n  Conference negotiations always involve a delicate dance of give-and-\ntake. In this case, the conferees have been true to the intent and \nspirit of the originally passed legislation. They have retained \nimportant improvements, including a requirement that ports develop \nterrorism response plans; the creation of a coordinated maritime \nintelligence system; and a mandate that the U.S. Department of \nTransportation conduct background checks of port workers and require \nworker identification cards. As important, the agreement reflects some \nof the priorities I advanced in my own port security legislation--\nincluding enhanced requirements for the electronic submission of cargo \ninformation and the development of a uniform system for securing \ncontainers destined for the United States. This legislation, while not \na cure-all, constitutes a substantial improvement over the current \nsecurity situation at many of our Nation's ports, and I proudly cast my \nvote in favor of it.\n\n[[Page S10991]]\n\n  That said, passage of this legislation should not lessen our resolve \nto remain vigilant in our efforts to protect America's seaports. Each \nyear, an estimated 11 million containers worldwide are loaded and \nunloaded at least 10 times. The U.S. marine transportation system alone \nmoves more than 2 billion tons of domestic and international freight \nand imports 3.3 billion tons of oil. Surprisingly, notwithstanding the \nmagnitude of cargo transported by sea, there exists no uniform or \nmandatory standards for security at leading facilities, no uniform or \nmandatory system of sealing containers, and no independent checks to \nensure that basic safeguards are undertaken.\n  In order to remedy these gaps in our current security scheme, there \nremains much work to be done. As I have suggested, we should \nrecalibrate our transportation agenda to focus more sequarely on \nthreats to sea and land. We should adopt stiffer criminal penalties, \nincluding enhanced penalties for noncompliance with certain reporting \nrequirements; continue to explore policies and technologies that will \nensure container security--shockingly, as an independent task force \nrecently observed, most containers are now seated with a 50-cent lead \ntag--make sure that border agents are trained and equipped to detect \nthreats like nuclear devices, which would easily be concealed in the \nmass of uninspected cargo that enters the United States each day; work \nin partnership with the trade community to ensure appropriate data \nsecurity; and provide for proper data collection and reporting systems \nthat capture the magnitude of serious crime at seaports and related \nfacilities.\n\n  Let there be no doubt about it: this legislation provides no reprieve \nfrom our obligation to safeguard the homeland. The task will be \ndifficult and requires dogged perseverance, but the building blocks are \nbefore us. Moreover, we know what we must do: first, we must have solid \nintelligence to identify and track our enemies; second, we must erect \nthe proper barriers and preventive strategies to keep weapons and other \ninstruments of destruction out of their hands; third, if those \nstrategies fail, we must be prepared and able to stop any threat before \nit arrives on our shores; and fourth, as a fail-stop measure, we must \nhave the capacity to detect and destroy any threat that makes its way \nto our borders. No matter what your political stripe or special \ninterest, those basic principles must guide our fundamental strategy. \nAnd this legislation moves us substantially in that direction. I am \ncommitted to continuing to work aggressively on these issues in the \n108th Congress and invite my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \njoin me.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise in support of the \nMaritime Transportation Security Act of 2002. Of all of the important \nlegislation we have worked on this year to protect our Nation from \nfurther acts of terrorism, I consider this bill to be one of utmost \nimportance.\n  Most terrorist attacks around the world target transportation, and \nthe Nation's 361 seaports, 14 of which are in Florida, are especially \nvulnerable. Our seaports are open and exposed to acts of terrorism as \nwell as to drug trafficking, cargo theft, and especially important to \nFlorida, the smuggling of illegal immigrants. The fact that many of our \nports are located in and around large urban areas makes the security of \nthe seaports of paramount importance. The extreme vulnerability of the \nurban areas in and around seaports was underscored recently by the \nfishing boat that eluded Coast Guard interdiction and arrived just off \nthe shores of Key Biscayne, FL, carrying a large number of Haitian \nimmigrants. Had this boat carried terrorists or dangerous cargo, a \ntragedy might have occurred.\n  A terrorist attack at our seaports would produce devastating effects \nboth in terms of loss of life and in economic disruption. Florida's \nseaports play a critical role in our national, State, and local \neconomies. Florida's seaports are major gateways of commerce for the \nflow of goods and passengers along the Nation's and Florida's \ntransportation corridors of commerce. Florida ranks fourth in the \nNation's total container movements, and is home to four of the major \ncontainer ports in the country.\n  Florida has the top three busiest cruise ports in the world. \nApproximately twelve million passengers embarked or disembarked at \nFlorida seaports during 2001 and approximately 80 percent of those \npassengers were U.S. citizens. The security of the Nation's seaports is \ncrucial to the future of the cruise tourism industry.\n  Although Florida has the largest international water border in the \ncontinental U.S., and thus the largest Federal maritime domain of any \nState in the continental U.S., Florida's seaports receive very limited \nFederal law enforcement resources, and no Federal funding for security \ninfrastructure to provide the security controls necessary to protect \nthemselves from threats of large-scale terrorism, cargo theft, drug \ntrafficking, and the smuggling of contraband and aliens. The increased \nthreat of terrorism at our borders demands that action be taken \nimmediately.\n  This legislation lays out important security measures that must be \ntaken to ensure the safety and security of our seaports. It \nsignificantly increases funding for the Coast Guard to $6 billion in \nfiscal year 2003. It also authorizes $90 million in research and \ndevelopment grants to improve our ability to screen cargo for dangerous \ncontraband, to detect unauthorized people or goods from entering \nthrough seaports, and to secure access to sensitive areas of our ports. \nThis bill also mandates the development of standards for training \nFederal, State, and private security professionals and provides funding \nto carry out that training and education. It also mandates for the \nfirst time, the development by ports, facilities, and vessels, of \ncomprehensive security and incident response plans.\n  Unfortunately, the final version of this legislation does not include \na dedicated funding source necessary to carry out the needed security \nmeasures. The grant program it establishes will help fund some of the \nsecurity enhancements, but there must be more funding allocated to \nindividual seaports. Florida has already spent more than $7 million \nsecuring our 14 deepwater seaports. Florida needs more Federal funding \nto comply with the mandated security measures of this bill. We must \nalso ensure that ports that have already spent substantial amounts of \nfunding on security measures are reimbursed for those improvements. \nWithout a dedicated funding source, it is hard to see how we will \nachieve the high level of security at our seaports envisioned by this \nbill.\n  No one deserves more credit for the passage of this important \nlegislation than my good friend and colleague Senator Bob Graham. It is \nan important step forward to securing our seaports and making our \nnation safer. But, as Senator Bob Graham has said, we have much more to \ndo. I look forward to working with him and my colleagues on the \nCommerce Committee to take the next steps in making our seaports safe.\n  Mr. McCAIN. How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bingaman). The Senator from South Carolina \ncontrols 17 minutes; the Senator from Arizona, 11\\1/2\\.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am glad to yield some of my time to the \nSenator from South Carolina, if he needs it.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I appreciate it.\n  Let me thank the distinguished Senator from New York. He is right as \nrain. We did not get adequate funds. That was a struggle over on the \nHouse side. That was the Gordian knot broken by our distinguished \nminority leader, Senator Trent Lott. But we are going to have to find \nnot only the money for the research, we will have to find about $4 \nbillion at least to implement this measure.\n  I thank the Senator from New York. I particularly thank the Senator \nand chairman of our subcommittee, Senator Breaux. We had those six \nfield hearings. We had the Director of Customs there. We had the \nCommandant of the Coast Guard. They were very comprehensive hearings \nwith limited time. I can tell you now, we saw at one particular port a \nFord pickup truck back out of that container, and another container \nthat we happened upon had a bunch of mahogany desks from Mexico that we \ndidn't see at the particular time. But later on up in Delaware, the \nPhiladelphia area, it was opened up. It was all full of cocaine. So we \nmade a good raid at one of those hearings.\n\n[[Page S10992]]\n\n  Otherwise, the chairman on the House side, Mr. Don Young, and his \nranking member, Jim Oberstar, worked around the clock. They had to feel \nlike we had over on the Senate side to take care of this with the user \nfee. But we just couldn't get the support on the House side. We are \nonly here on account of the leadership of Chairman Young and \nCongressman Oberstar. We had Senator Ted Stevens reconciling a good bit \nof the differences from time to time. And in the financial area, we had \nSenator Bob Graham and Chairman Chuck Grassley of the Finance Committee \nwho worked with us.\n  I think we ought to understand that this, for the first time, \nrequires a national maritime security plan. As part of the plan, each \nregional area would be required to have a security plan. It requires \nfor the first time ever that all waterfront facilities and vessels have \na security plan that would have to be reviewed and approved by the \nCoast Guard. It requires for the first time ever that the Government \nwill do assessments of security at our ports, and these reports would \nbe the basis for port security planners. The security requirements will \nbe implemented instantly after review by the Coast Guard, and the act \nwould be fully implemented within 1 year.\n\n  We have background checks on all of the employees. We have the \ndevelopment of technology for seaport security, the maritime \nintelligence system; that requires tracking of vessels through \nsatellite legal authority over territorial waters, advanced reporting \nrequirements for vessels and cargo. And one final word: We did work \nwith the unions in this particular measure. The White House, the \nunions, the Republicans, the Democrats, the House, the Senate worked \nout those background checks on union employees. So when we got together \nand much has been said that on the homeland security bill that was the \nholdup--we worked out a very comprehensive system that was approved by \nall and will give security to our port facilities.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Arizona for his courtesy in \nyielding and his leadership on this particular measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona controls the \nremainder of the time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to go back for a moment to the \ndiscussion I had with the Senator from Delware concerning rail \nsecurity.\n  First of all, I agree with the Senator from Delaware. We need \nabsolutely to pass that legislation, particularly now that we have \nacted on airport and port security. Rail security is obviously a very \ncritical item. My point was that there are two bills: One is S. 1550, \nthe rail security bill, which provides $1.7 billion, $515 million for \nAmtrak systemwide security, and then $998 million for tunnel life \nsafety projects in New York, Baltimore, and Washington, DC, which comes \nup to $998 million, and $254 million for safety and security \nimprovements.\n  That bill I supported and worked through the committee and would \nsupport it, even though over 50 percent of it goes for just three \nareas: New York, Baltimore, and Washington, DC. But that is where \ntunnels that need work are located.\n  I was referring also to S. 1991, which is the Amtrak reauthorization, \nwhich calls for $4 billion annually and also includes the provisions of \nS. 1550. Holds were put on S. 1550. I do not support S. 1991 because it \nauthorizes as much as $4 billion annually.\n  The Senator from Delaware always talks about the fact that we \nsubsidize aviation projects. We do. We do primarily through user fees. \nThere are no user fees that are imposed on the railways of America and \nAmtrak.\n  I am pleased with some of the actions that have been taken by the new \nregime over at Amtrak. The new chairman is doing a much better job in \nmaking some very tough decisions.\n  I look forward to working with the Senators from Delaware. The junior \nSenator from Delaware, Mr. Carper, has been very committed and involved \nin the project. I look forward to working with him and Senator \nHollings. A top priority will be, in my view, rail security; we should \npass it.\n  I want to make it clear I don't believe other extraneous projects \nshould be associated with it. The Amtrak reauthorization should be \ntaken up on its merits or demerits. But I hope we can move forward with \nS. 1550, the rail security bill. Holds have been put on the bill. It \nhas received my support, as well as that of the distinguished chairman \nof the committee.\n  The issue of Amtrak rail security is of prime importance. The issue \nof the future of Amtrak is also of significant importance--not as \nimportant as that of rail security. I look forward to working with \nSenator Hollings and the Senators from Delaware and the members of the \ncommittee, including Senator Breaux, as we try to work through this \nwhole issue of the future of Amtrak. There are a number of different \nkinds of proposals, and Mr. Ken Mead of GAO, under whose \nresponsibilities Amtrak lies, is one to whom all of us pay a great deal \nof attention.\n  Finally, I again thank Senator Hollings for his leadership on this \nvery important legislation. I don't think there is any doubt in the \nminds of most safety and security experts that port security is an area \nof significant vulnerability. We hold no illusions there will be \nimmediate confidence that we can have security in the airports of \nAmerica, but I am confident that the implementation of this \nlegislation, over time, will provide Americans, to a large extent, with \nthe security and safety that is necessary in the ports of America.\n  In some ways, you can argue that the way the ports operate in \nAmerica, the challenges are even greater than at the airports, or even \nrail security, given the hundreds of thousands of containers that come \nthrough these ports on a daily basis, and how vital they are to the \neconomy of the United States, as we found out in the slowdown/strike in \nthe west coast ports recently.\n  So I again thank all involved. I also thank our friends in the other \nbody, the House, and also for the involvement of the administration.\n  Mr. President, I yield whatever remaining time I have to the Senator \nfrom South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Senator from Arizona. I am \nglad to hear him say we are going to work together on port security and \nthe reauthorization of Amtrak because that is vital. I think if the \nleader here, the Senator from Nevada, and the other side are ready, we \ncan yield back time and proceed to the vote. I yield back any time I \nmay have. I thank the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Arizona and the Senator from South \nCarolina yielded back their time. I think it is appropriate to start \nthe vote a couple minutes early.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time is yielded back, the question is \non agreeing to the conference report. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye), the \nSenator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), the Senator from Louisiana \n(Ms. Landrieu), and the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Torricelli) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 95, nays 0, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 243 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--95\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Barkley\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n\n[[Page S10993]]\n\n\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--5\n\n     Helms\n     Inouye\n     Kennedy\n     Landrieu\n     Torricelli\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS.

I thank the Presiding Officer. I appreciate the \nopportunity to speak. I am prepared to offer a unanimous consent on the \nCARE Act, which is the act that passed out of the Finance Committee 147 \ndays ago. It is the Charity Aid Recovery and Empowerment Act of 2002. I \nwill let the Members know what the legislation does, and then I will \nask unanimous consent to consider the legislation before we leave.\n  This legislation came out of the Finance Committee with 28 bipartisan \ncosponsors. More than 1,600 small and large charitable organizations \nsupport this act because it promotes giving, it promotes savings for \nlow-income individuals, and makes the Tax Code more fair, particularly \nfor the low-income and moderate-income individuals who do not fill out \nthe long form on their tax return.\n  It provides 86 million Americans the opportunity to itemize \ncharitable organizations, which now they cannot do because they do not \nfill out the long form. It allows 300,000 low-income individuals the \nopportunity to build assets through something that Senator Lieberman \nand Senator Feinstein and others on both sides of the aisle have \npromoted--individual development accounts. It will provide incentives \nfor $1 billion in food donations from farmers, restaurants, and \ncorporations. It will provide $150 million in a compassionate capital \nfund to provide money for smaller charities.\n  A lot of charities do not participate in government funding programs \nbecause they do not have the technical expertise to do so. We are \nproviding money for technical assistance to some of the community \ngrassroots organizations, faith-based organizations, and non-faith-\nbased organizations to participate in providing social services in a \nvery effective and compassionate way.\n  This is the way to do it. It adds something Senator Lieberman was a \ngreat advocate of, $1.2 billion in new social service block grant funds \nto provide social services to those in need in our society. It allows \npeople to give tax-free contributions from their individual retirement \naccounts. Again, right now if someone wants to give to a charitable \norganization, and you want to give it out of your IRA, you have to pay \ntaxes and penalties. This allows for a distribution from people who \nhave money in their IRA's who have a desire to give to charitable \norganizations. We will allow them to do that, liberating hundreds of \nmillions and billions of dollars to faith-based organizations.\n  This is legislation designed in response to 9/11 and the recession we \nhave been going through to try to target resources to these small, \ncharitable organizations; to try to get moderate-or low-income \nindividuals the opportunity to deduct the charitable contributions. One \nof the ways it is paid for is through corporate inversion. I argue we \nare nailing corporations that are moving their operations out of the \nUnited States and avoiding taxes. We are taking money that could be \nraised by these corporate inversion provisions and channeling it to \nthose most in need in our society.\n  That is what the legislation does. There is one other provision I \nmake clear. There is equal treatment language in this legislation. Let \nme state what that does. It is noncontroversial, equal treatment \nlanguage. It says organizations that receive government funds can \ndisplay a religious icon, that they can have a religious name. Believe \nit or not, I have been to many organizations, particularly in the \nJewish community, and because they have a Hebrew name, they are \nautomatically left off the list of organizations that can participate \nin government funds, even though they are not Jewish in nature. They \nmay be Jewish, but they are not in any way affiliated with the Jewish \nfaith. They just happen to be culturally a Jewish organization.\n  Having a religious name like St. John's should not eliminate you from \nparticipating in government funds, if you are not religious in nature, \nor do something unique for a religious purpose. You can have religious \nlanguage in your chartering documents, you can quote the Bible in your \nchartering documents, and it should not eliminate you from Federal \nfunds. Again, these are not controversial. You can use on your \ngoverning boards, nonprofits, not paid governing boards some sort of \nreligious criteria as to who serves. So if you are the Mormon Church \nand have a governing board on your social service agencies, you can \nrequire they be Mormons. I don't know that necessarily discriminates \nagainst anybody in the sense these are not paid positions. They are \nchurch-affiliated. We are not discriminating in the hiring. We are \ntalking about oversight of charitable organizations.\n\n  These are the provisions of this act. I believe if you look just at \nthe four walls of this bill, there is not a lot of controversy in this \nlegislation. What we have attempted to do, Senator Lieberman and \nmyself--we have been working this legislation now for almost 150 days. \nObviously this is legislation the President strongly supports. He \nbelieves we need to get this money out into communities to try to help \nthose in need in our society.\n  We have been working with Senator Daschle. I thank Senator Daschle \nand Senator Reid for their good-faith effort to try to move this \nlegislation forward. As many here in the Chamber know, Senator Daschle \nsaid publicly over and over, over the past couple of years, he would \ngive the President a vote on this initiative, which is just a piece of \nthe President's faith-based initiative. He has worked diligently to try \nto make that happen.\n  We have been hotlining a unanimous consent agreement. The unanimous \nconsent agreement would allow for four Democrat amendments on the \nsubstance of the legislation, attacking the substance of the \nlegislation, and one Republican amendment.\n  I want to repeat we are allowing the Democrat side four amendments \nand we have accepted it on our side. We hotlined it this week. There is \nno objection on our side of the aisle to giving four times as many \namendments to the Democrats as we have on this side.\n  I am hopeful that, given the importance of this legislation, given \nthe fact this is going to help those in need at a time of economic \ndistress and uncertainty, we can liberate literally billions of dollars \nto be targeted to organizations that want to help those in need in our \nsociety.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at a time determined by the majority \nleader, after consultation with the Republican leader--however, no \nlater than the close of business of the Senate--the Senate proceed to \nthe consideration of Calendar No. 496, H.R. 7, and it be considered \nunder the following limitations: That there be 1 hour for general \ndebate on the bill equally divided between the two managers, the only \namendments in order, other than the managers' substitute, be the \nfollowing: An amendment prohibiting proselytization using public funds, \nan amendment prohibiting discrimination using public funds, an \namendment prohibiting direct funding of religion, an amendment \npreserving State and local government options--these amendments were \nprovided to us by Senator Daschle, I believe to be offered by Senator \nReid--and a Republican amendment, to be offered by Senator Gramm, is an \namendment expanding benefits of land conservation provisions to all \ncharities; the amendments be limited to 60 minutes each, to be divided \nbetween the proponents and opponents, with no second degrees in order. \nI ask following the disposition of the amendments and expiration of \ndebate, the bill will be read a third time, and the Senate proceed to a \nvote on passage of the bill with no further intervening action or \ndebate.\n\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill\n\n[[Page S10994]]\n\nnot object, I support the request of the Senator from Pennsylvania for \nunanimous consent. I have been his cosponsor and coworker in this cause \nfor many a year now. This is part of an attempt to find a \nconstitutionally appropriate way to engage. The initial attempt was to \nengage faith-based groups in making this a better society, using the \nparticular skills they have, and sense of mission that faith-based \ngroups have, to help us deal with some of society's social problems.\n  Of course, there are thousands of faith-based groups that are doing \nthat today with regard to fundamental human needs such as hunger and \nhomelessness, and going beyond that, to violence, family dysfunction, \ndrug abuse, substance abuse, and a host of other problems. This was an \nattempt to see if we could find a constitutionally appropriate way to \nhave the Government help these groups do that.\n  Along the way many concerns were raised. The bill was passed in the \nHouse, so-called charitable choice, building, in fact, on a charitable \nchoice provision that was in the welfare reform bill of 1996 and signed \nby President Clinton. A similar provision was adopted in three other \nsocial service programs, but when it came to introducing this \nlegislation last year--which President Bush had coordinated and \ninitiated--there was some opposition and controversy around it.\n  I must say here, and perhaps it is timely and appropriate to say it, \nas the pending legislation before the Senate is the homeland security \nlegislation, where this Senator has said several times I have felt the \nadministration, on a particular point, has been inflexible or--in any \ncase, in this measure, with regard to faith-based institutions, the \nadministration has in fact been quite flexible. We have now come \ntogether on a proposal that is not really any longer strictly a faith-\nbased initiative. It is a charity initiative. We have eliminated all of \nthe controversial sections that were in the House-passed legislation, \npassed earlier in the 107th session. We have it honed down now to very \nsignificant tax incentives for charitable giving, for people to give to \ncharities, faith-based and otherwise, at a time when those charities' \nincome is falling because of the economy and other demands. Yet the \nneeds, if anything, as the economy is stagnating, are even greater.\n  As to the $1.2 billion to social services block grants, if there was \nnothing else in this bill, I would say it was worth it because these \nare critically important, humane programs that are carried out. Again, \nthey don't just go to faith-based groups. They go to all--they go \nmostly to nonfaith-based groups. And then technical assistance for \ncharities to be able to qualify for public assistance, the Individual \nDevelopment Accounts, which were a wonderful way--experimented with in \nseveral places around the country--to help poor people build savings \nthat are matched by financial institutions, to get some wealth and work \ntheir way up into the middle class.\n  I know there remain some concerns about the bill. But they are not \nabout the language of the bill, which I believe is noncontroversial at \nthis point. They are about trying, around this bill, to change some \nlanguage that is in the statute now--particular language in title VII \nof the Civil Rights Act that allows faith-based groups to hire people \nonly of the faith of the group. That is an issue on which we can all \nagree or disagree. But I plead with my colleagues, it is an issue for \nanother day.\n\n  The fact is, under the unanimous consent proposal that the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania has made, our colleagues who are concerned about that \nissue, though it is not specifically within the parameters of this \nproposal, will have the opportunity to introduce amendments to alter \nit.\n  I think this is a very reasonable proposal which is all good and will \nhelp charitable groups of all kinds help us make this a better country. \nTherefore, I appeal to my colleagues to allow this unanimous consent to \nbe adopted so that, before we leave, we can in a sense give a gift, as \nwe approach the holiday season, to those who are most in need in our \nsociety and particularly directly to those charitable groups where the \nfocus is on helping those most in need.\n  I hope we can agree on this unanimous consent proposal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, my problem with this unanimous consent \nrequest relates to the limitation on amendments. There have been four \namendments specified. I have been trying for weeks and months, in some \ncases years, and other Members of this body have also been attempting \nto get other amendments that relate to the Finance Committee's work \nbefore this body for a vote.\n  The Senator from Connecticut talks about the needy. Clearly, he is \nright. There are needy people in this country. One of the neediest \ngroups is the people who have exhausted their unemployment benefits. We \nhave been trying for months to get an extension of unemployment \ncompensation before this body for a vote. In prior recessions, there \nhave been extensions of unemployment of 29 weeks in 1974, 26 weeks in \n1981, 33 weeks in 1990, and 26 weeks in 2002. We need an extension of \nunemployment benefits. We have a large number of people--900,000 \nworkers--who have exhausted all of their additional weeks of Federal \nunemployment insurance between May and July of 2002. This number is \ngoing to grow to 2.2 million before the end of the year. We have lost 2 \nmillion private sector jobs in this country since January of 2001--an \nactual decline in private sector jobs for the first time in 50 years.\n  We have economic problems. We have suffering. We want to extend \nunemployment benefits. Yet I am precluded--as have our other colleagues \nwho have been working diligently on this issue--from offering an \namendment to this bill to extend unemployment benefits. It is that \nlimitation, that restriction, that prohibition in the unanimous consent \nproposal that I have a problem with. I think it is important that those \nwho are fighting for an extension of unemployment compensation have \nthis opportunity on this bill because this is a bill which can pass and \noffer immediate and critical help to our people.\n  That is the problem I have with the unanimous consent request.\n  In addition to the extension of unemployment benefits, I ask if the \nauthor of this unanimous consent request would consider modifying his \nrequest to allow three amendments I have been trying to get considered \nby this body. One is the extension of unemployment compensation which \nmany people have been attempting for months to have considered by this \nbody. I would like to see that locked in and guaranteed for \nconsideration on this bill. This bill can pass. No. 1.\n  No. 2, an amendment relevant to stock options which was blocked. \nSenator McCain was blocked from offering it a number of months ago. The \namendment would simply require the Financial Accounting Standards Board \nto consider the issue of stock options within a year and report back.\n  The third is the Securities and Exchange Commission administrative \nenforcement amendment.\n  We circulated those amendments. They are clearly within the \njurisdiction of this committee. The only way we are going to get these \namendments considered is if they are part of a unanimous consent \nrequest such as this.\n  I ask the Senator from Pennsylvania whether he would consider \namending his unanimous consent request to allow three additional \namendments. That is the only problem I have with his unanimous consent \nrequest--it precludes amendments from being offered which are within \nthe jurisdiction of this committee, which are critically important to \nthis country, and which won't be considered unless we can make them \npart of a unanimous consent request.\n  That is my question to the sponsor of the unanimous consent.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, let me address the three amendments.\n  With respect to the first amendment, I agree with the Senator from \nMichigan. That is something we should do. Even though I believe it is \nnot germane to the package we have before us, it is certainly within--\nfrom the standpoint of what this bill is trying to do, which is help \nwith the financial and economic stress--it certainly meets the overall \ngoal of the legislation.\n  My understanding is that there is a very good chance the House is \ngoing to\n\n[[Page S10995]]\n\npass an extension today and send that over. In fact, I feel very \nconfident about that. They are going to pass an extension and send it \nover, which I hope we will be able to act upon and pass.\n  I would say to the Senator from Michigan with respect to this piece \nof legislation that I think you will have an opportunity to deal with \nthat issue on the bill that certainly will have just as much chance of \npassing as this bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield on that point? Is it the Senator's \nunderstanding that that extension is simply an extension or part of a \nlarger package which has many other features to it?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I do not know if anybody else has a better \nunderstanding than I do. If they do, feel free to chime in.\n  My understanding is they are going to pass a clean extension.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, will the Senator from Michigan yield on \nthat question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is my understanding that the unemployment extension \nbenefits that the House is considering, first of all, are embraced \nwithin the package that encompasses other things as well.\n  Second, and more importantly perhaps, the unemployment insurance \nbenefits issue itself is very limited and falls far short of the sort \nof amendment the Senator from Michigan is considering in terms of \nextending these unemployment insurance benefits, which is a growing \ncrisis in the country. We need to recognize that. I certainly support \nthe Senator from Michigan in his effort to ensure the unemployment \nbenefits. But what the House is considering, as I understand it, is \ngrossly inadequate in terms of addressing the unemployment insurance. \nIt doesn't even carry forward a full extension of the current situation \nbeyond that. There are going to be people falling off the cliff here \nvery shortly. Many of them have already fallen off the cliff.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the Senator is making the point that he \ndoesn't have another vehicle for an opportunity to offer his amendment. \nMy point is, when this bill comes over, he will have an opportunity to \noffer an amendment on unemployment extension, and he does not need to \nuse this vehicle. That is the point.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is my understanding correct that an unemployment benefit \nextension is part of a larger package which has many controversial \nissues in it? If so, then that bill may not go anywhere because of the \nother parts of it--not because of the unemployment extension, which \npurportedly everyone favors around here but then wants it to be used to \nproduce other achievements and successes that are highly controversial.\n  This is not a controversial amendment. This extension we are talking \nabout is not a particularly controversial amendment. The Senator from \nPennsylvania favors it. And yet, when I am asking whether he favors an \nextension----\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I haven't seen the amendment. I do not know.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I withdraw that--favors an extension of unemployment \ncompensation, we may be able to sit down and work out something that \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania does favor in the area of unemployment \ncompensation extension and include that in his unanimous consent.\n  But it seems to me it is absolutely reasonable to ask for a more \ncertain way of getting an unemployment benefit extension passed through \nthis Congress. It is critically important to hundreds of thousands of \npeople who are suffering. It is immediate. It is urgent.\n  I therefore renew my request that those three amendments be added to \nthe unanimous consent request of the Senator.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would certainly be willing on the \nfirst amendment to sit down with the Senator to see if there is an \nunemployment extension that can be agreed to. I think it is something \nwe need to do. I think there is a willingness on our side to have an \nunemployment extension. I would have no objection to setting aside the \nunanimous consent request to try to work out a unanimous agreement on \nthe issue of unemployment compensation.\n  There are other issues which are really outside the scope of this, \nand they are very controversial. I understand the Senator--I know \nbecause I have been on the floor many times--from Michigan has \nattempted to get the initiative aired. I understand his passion on it. \nI respect how he feels about it. But I think the Senator from Michigan \nwould agree with me that these are hotly contested. In fact, one of the \ncosponsors of this legislation on the other side of that issue is the \nSenator from Michigan. I think adding those two amendments that really \naren't germane for helping those in need in our society are outside of \nthe scope, and in fact the amendments would sink the entire bill if \nthey were adopted.\n  I can try to meet the Senator halfway. Let us try to work together on \nunemployment. If we can do that, and if the Senator is willing to set \naside the other two amendments, then we can try to move forward with \nthe consent request. I would be happy to work with him.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me ask the Senator from Pennsylvania \nabout the third amendment to which I referred, which wasn't \nparticularly controversial but yet precluded when we considered the \nSarbanes bill, which has to do with administrative enforcement by the \nSEC of their regulations.\n  The only area that the SEC cannot now administratively enforce with \ncivil fines is the area of regulations involving corporate executives \nand auditors. When it comes to the stockbrokers, they are able to \nenforce administratively their regulations with the use of civil fines, \nof course subject to the appeals courts. But the area which has been so \ncrucial and so sensitive--violations of regulations which have \ncontributed so much to the suffering in the economy, violations by \ncorporate executives and by auditors--in that area, the SEC does not \nhave the authority to proceed administratively. They want it. I do not \nknow of folks who oppose it. But unless we can act on it this year, \nthere will be another delay.\n\n  I ask the Senator from Pennsylvania whether or not his offer to go \nhalfway would include the second of the three amendments relative to \nthe SEC administrative enforcement.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. My understanding is that third amendment is not a tax-\nrelated amendment and would be appropriate to be offered, for example, \nif you wanted to, on the homeland security bill or another piece of \nlegislation that is coming through. So there isn't a need to have that \namendment attached particularly to a tax vehicle.\n  I understand your second amendment has tax implications and is \nnecessary to offer to a tax bill. But this amendment you could offer, \nif you wanted to, once we leave this unanimous consent, to homeland \nsecurity. It probably has a much better chance of being passed and \nsigned by the President in this legislation.\n  So I would say to the Senator, if he wants to do that, I would argue \nthat the better opportunity for him to do it is on homeland security, \nnot this tax bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield on that?\n  Actually, both the amendments have tax revenue implications. Stock \noptions have been, in my judgment, excessively used in an inconsistent \nway, where a tax deduction is given to a stock option which is not \nshown as an expense on the books but is taken as an expense on the tax \nreturn. So there are very significant tax issues on the stock option \nissue.\n  Also, on the auditors and executive issue, there are tax revenue \nimplications because in both cases we have lost significant amounts. \nBecause of violation of regulations by auditors and by executives, we \nhave lost tax revenue.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Michigan, the \nthird amendment, from my reading of it, is an amendment that is under \nthe jurisdiction of the Banking Committee and not under the \njurisdiction of the Finance Committee and not a tax-related amendment. \nThere may be revenue implications, but there are lots of revenue \nimplications of things we do here that are in the jurisdiction of other \ncommittees having to do with enforcement. But there is no tax \nimplication. Therefore, there is no need to offer it here in this tax \nlegislation. The second one certainly does.\n\n[[Page S10996]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. On the stock option, there has even been a hearing in the \nFinance Committee.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I understand the third one, that you are arguing for \nnow, is not necessarily appropriate for this legislation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Happily, the Senator's argument against it on the third \namendment helps me on the second amendment because it is clearly in the \njurisdiction----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The second amendment is highly controversial and would \nbe an amendment that would surely sink any possibility of this \nlegislation being passed.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Would the Senator yield for a question about his second \namendment on the stock option?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has the floor.\n  Does the Senator from Pennsylvania yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is my understanding that the amendment the Senator \nfrom Michigan is talking about on stock options does not have a \nsubstantive result contained in the amendment. It is simply a request \nthat the Financial Accounting Standards Board study the issue and \nreport back.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. In that sense, it is neutral on the substance of the \nissue; is that correct?\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is correct. There is a requirement that they report \nback in a year. But the Senator is correct, on the substance of the \nissue, it is neutral.\n  I think the Senator from Pennsylvania might also find that some of \nthe people who previously opposed the effort in the area of stock \noptions may not object to having the Financial Accounting Standards \nBoard review this matter and report back in a year, for the very reason \nthat the Senator from Maryland raises, which is that it is \nsubstantively neutral.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lieberman). The Senator from Pennsylvania \nhas the floor.\n  Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you very much.\n  I say to my colleague from Pennsylvania and my colleague from \nConnecticut, I understand the importance of this issue to each of you \npersonally, and to those who are cosponsors, and why you are anxious to \nraise the flag and at least raise the issue in the closing days and \nhours of this session.\n  I find it interesting, in listening to the presentation here, that we \nhave focused on the Finance Committee and tax implications, referrals \nfrom the Finance Committee, and their debate, and really have, \nunfortunately, not addressed what I consider to be the larger issue, an \nissue which should have been addressed by the Judiciary Committee, an \nissue which goes to constitutionality and the premise of the separation \nof church and state in the United States of America--something that \nmany of us find fundamental to the American experience and to our \nAmerican society.\n  I do not quarrel with the premise of the Senator from Pennsylvania. I \ncould list, and he could, too, so many faith-based charities in his \nhome State and my home State that have done wonderful work, and \ncontinue to do so. They receive Government assistance, and they should. \nI have supported them. I have found appropriations for them. I will \ncontinue to do that. I do not believe that is the issue here.\n  Frankly, if that were the referendum before us, it would receive a \nunanimous vote. We all concede charitable and faith-based organizations \ndo exceptional work, and governmental assistance, under the right \ncircumstances, can be of benefit to America as a society.\n  But the President's initiative that you have brought to the floor \nsuggests the way we have done business in America for decades has to be \nchanged substantially, dramatically. Those changes deserve an airing \nand full debate.\n\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania has been kind enough to acknowledge \nfour amendments prepared by Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island as well \nas myself to bring to the floor. I would argue, perhaps, that 1 hour of \ndebate for each of these amendments, considering the gravity and \nimportance, is not nearly adequate.\n  But I also say this to my colleague from Pennsylvania. Is it not a \nfact that with the House minutes or hours away from adjournment, and \nthe fact that no conference committee is likely to ever convene on this \nissue, there is little that can be accomplished in a substantive way on \nan issue of this importance?\n  Is it also not a fact that this issue is of such importance to us \nthat we should take time to engage in a debate which, frankly, will \ngive all sides an opportunity to express themselves, to make certain we \ndo not----\n  Mr. NICKLES. Regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has called for the \nregular order.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me say I reserve the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is that a request has been \nmade.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Well, then, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. And a Senator, when the regular order is \ncalled for, must either object or the request will be granted.\n  Did the Senator from Illinois object?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I was trying to keep the floor open for those who wanted \nto express themselves on this issue. If I am forced to object, I will, \nbut I have other colleagues here who would like to share some concerns \nwith the Senator from Pennsylvania. And as I understood, there was a \ndialogue between us, or at least I hoped there would be. That was the \nreason I was asking questions of the Senator. And if it is necessary at \nthis point to object, and it will foreclose my colleagues from making a \nstatement, I did not want that to happen. But if that is where we stand \non this, I suppose I have no alternative. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania continues to have the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I am very disappointed that there was an \nobjection. I understand the Senator from Illinois and the Senator from \nRhode Island have objections to this legislation. As the Senator from \nConnecticut said very clearly and very articulately in his statement, \nthe objections they have are not with this legislation. They may be \nwith current law, the 1996 Welfare Act and the three other provisions \nthat were signed by President Clinton and passed by this Senate, two of \nwhich were passed unanimously, to my recollection.\n  The objections are to underlying law, not to this legislation. This \nlegislation does not deal with any of the issues that are in the \namendments the Senator from Illinois has offered.\n  The Senator mentioned that an hour's debate is not enough. I am \nwilling to spend as long--2 hours, 3 hours per amendment. I offered an \nhour of debate as an accommodation to the leader, to the majority \nleader, in trying to find a reasonable amount of time to finish.\n  I agree with the Senator from Illinois, this is a very important \npiece of legislation. But if the problem is that we need more time for \ndebate, I certainly would, and I know the Senator from Connecticut \nwould, be perfectly willing to come here.\n  I think these are important issues, but I would argue they are not \nissues about this legislation. They are not issues in your amendments \nhaving to do with proselytization using public funds. There is nothing \nin this legislation that permits that--nothing. Nothing even addresses \nit or comes close to it. These are tax provisions that allow----\n  Mr. REED. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania does have the \nfloor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President. I will yield to the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. The Senator from Pennsylvania points out that the \nlegislation is silent on the critical issues, but the\n\n[[Page S10997]]\n\nsilence is not correct. There are potential constitutional flaws that \nare inherent in the legislation. As I understand it, part of the \nlegislation is to authorize directly funding religious institutions to \nprovide social services.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Reclaiming my time, I will read to you the provisions \nof this legislation on what the money is expended for. No. 1, it talks \nabout $2.6 billion of this legislation is a nonitemized or charitable \ndeduction. It is not for religious organizations. It allows people who \nfill out the short form to deduct charitable contributions.\n  No. 2, IRA charitable rollovers. What it says is people who have an \nIRA can roll over that IRA into a charitable organization, qualified \nunder 501(c)(3) or other, whatever organizations would be eligible, and \nthat is $2.9 billion over the next 10 years--again, nothing to do with \nfaith-based organizations; no direct government dollars to anybody.\n  Third has to do with enhancing charitable deductions for farmers, \nrestaurateurs, and businesses for food donations. Again, it has nothing \nto do with charitable choice, nothing to do with any kind of government \nfunds going to charitable organizations.\n  Fourth, we have enhanced charitable deductions for book donations--\nagain, nothing to do with charitable choice. Incentives for S \ncorporations to give more money to charities--again, nothing to do with \nfaith-based organizations. We have an IDA amendment, which is something \nthe Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from California, Mrs. \nFeinstein, have championed, and I have worked on our side to allow low-\nincome individuals to have matched savings accounts for purposes of \nbuying a home, going to school, or starting a small business--again, \nnothing to do with charitable, faith-based organizations.\n  Also, we have the social services block grant fund which I know is \nwildly popular on the Democratic side of the aisle. That is $1.37 \nbillion over the next 2 years.\n  So if you look at all of these provisions, I understand the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island and the Senator from Illinois have serious concerns \nabout the existing charitable choice provisions in law. I accept that. \nI understand that. I understand the Senators from Rhode Island and from \nIllinois have problems with the bill the House passed because it did \nhave an expansion of that in the House-passed bill. But the Senator \nfrom Connecticut has been very tough at negotiating with the White \nHouse and with the Senator from Pennsylvania in leaving every \ncontroversial element that could touch on any kind of constitutional \ninfirmity out of this legislation.\n  You can argue that we don't fix the problem that may be in existing \nlaw, but there is nothing in this legislation that even comes close to \nany of those provisions. You have as much argument, in my opinion, to \noffer the amendments that you have offered to homeland security as you \ndo to this bill because neither of them deal with the subject of your \namendments.\n  I understand there is a problem. I understand there is a debate that \nneeds to be had on these issues, but not on this bill because this bill \ndoesn't do what many are suggesting it does.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I worked with the two leaders in arranging time that you \ncould offer this unanimous consent request. The two managers are very \nanxious to get to homeland security. We have two cloture votes facing \nus. People wanted to offer amendments. I would ask that the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania, as soon as he has completed his statement, yield the \nfloor so we automatically, as I understand it, go back to homeland \nsecurity. Is that right, Mr. President?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is right. The Senate \nwould resume consideration of the pending business which is the \nsubstitute on homeland security.\n  Mr. REID. I would say to the Senator from Pennsylvania, we \nanticipated this taking just a little bit of time. It has taken a large \namount of time.\n  To all my friends who have problems with this legislation, as has \nbeen indicated, the homeland defense bill is open for debate and \ncertainly amendment. Anyone who has anything they have not been able to \ncomplete saying now on this issue could complete their statements on \nH.R. 5005.\n  All I am saying is, I hope the Senator from Pennsylvania won't talk \ntoo much longer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I want to say with all respect to the \nSenator from Nevada, the Senator from Pennsylvania has been trying to \nrespond, actually giving the opportunity to other Members to express \ntheir concerns about this legislation. I did not call for regular \norder. I did not try to limit in any way those who have concerns about \nthe legislation from having the opportunity to speak. I was using the \ntime I had to give them the opportunity to express their concerns and \nthen, to the extent I could, try to respond to their concerns.\n  I have no intention of trying to hold up the homeland security bill. \nI just wanted the opportunity, if we could, to have a discussion to see \nif we could reach some sort of accord to actually move what many of us \nbelieve is a very important piece of legislation. It does not look as \nif that is going to happen.\n  I am disappointed because I do not believe the issues that have been \nraised about infirmities of other pieces of statutory law are in any \nway impacted by this legislation. It is a tragedy that literally tens \nof billions of dollars that could go to low-income individuals, \nincentives for people to give, the opportunity to have matched savings \naccounts for low-income individuals to buy a home and to start a small \nbusiness or to get an education, that is going to be forfeited on \nissues that have nothing to do with the underlying bill.\n  That is unfortunate. I am hopeful that now that we have had this \ndiscussion, Members will think more about it and hopefully come to a \ndifferent conclusion as to whether to object to this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/14/senate-section/article/S10997-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10997-S11000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 3009\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I intend to offer a unanimous consent \nrequest that the Senate proceed to immediate consideration of the \nextension of unemployment insurance. As the dialog between the \ndistinguished Senators from Pennsylvania and Michigan just illustrated, \nthis is an issue that had bipartisan support--really, nonpartisan \nsupport.\n  There are 2.2 million workers who have exhausted or are about to \nexhaust their benefits without finding a job. Ignoring these people, \nespecially as we are about to enter into the Thanksgiving-Christmas \nholiday season, will not make them go away. It is not going to help \nthem automatically find a job because they have been out there \ndiligently looking.\n  The fact is, we don't have enough jobs right now. All of us hope that \nis going to turn around. But if you look at the statistics available, \nthere are 1.7 million workers who have been unemployed for longer than \n6 months as of October. That is an increase of 70,000 over September \nand over 180,000 over August. One out of every five of these unemployed \nhas been out of work for more than 6 months. That is a proportion \nlarger than at any time in the previous 8 years.\n  I believe that extending these benefits now sends a message to those \nwho lost their jobs through no fault of their own in States such as \nmine and that of Senator Cantwell of Washington. The provision we are \nasking unanimous consent on would provide 13 more weeks of unemployment \ninsurance for everyone who lost their job, were laid off, cannot find a \njob. The bill would not provide a single additional benefit, if you \nlook at what the Republicans are proposing. So our bill is a much \nbetter one because the Republicans would permit those who are about to \ncrash into the brick wall of December 31 no relief.\n  I believe it is imperative that we take action before we leave.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Certainly.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I wish to ask her a question before she asks unanimous \nconsent. Just to clarify the record, to be correct, I believe she \nstated her proposal is a 13-week extension. Is her proposal S. 3009?\n\n[[Page S10998]]\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Yes, it is.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Just to clarify, I believe that is not a 13-week \nextension; it is a 26-week extension.\n  Also, just for your information, the House may soon try to pass \nlegislation that would eliminate this cliff as of December 31. So I \nwant the Senator to know that efforts are being made by some in the \nHouse to pass legislation that would address the unemployment \ncompensation issue, and extend welfare authorization, among other \nthings.\n  I wanted to make sure you are aware that the bill you are trying to \npass by unanimous consent, S. 3009, is not a 13-week extension, but it \nis a 26-week extension and costs $17.1 billion. A simple 13-week \nextension costs less than half of that. I wanted to make those few \nfacts known before I object to the Senator's request.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I appreciate the Senator's factual intervention. It is \nthe same proposal that was used in the early 1990s to extend \nunemployment insurance under the first President Bush. It is what has \nhistorically been done. Now, some people benefit more because of the \ncircumstances in which they find themselves. Indeed, when we passed the \nonly extension of unemployment insurance back in, I think, March, there \nwere a couple of States that had been very hard hit that were given \nadditional benefits.\n  As the Senator points out, what the House is about to send over is \nnot just an unemployment insurance extension; it changes welfare law, \nit provides Medicare benefits to a certain category of Medicare \nrecipients and not to others. So I think that it would be far better \nfor us to ensure that an unemployment insurance benefit was going to be \nextended.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Yes.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I am joining the Senator in support of bringing this up \nunder a unanimous consent. The issue the House is looking at is simply \nanother 5-week extension. So, yes, maybe more for the holidays people \nwill think they have 5 more weeks. But the issue is that expansion of \nthis unemployment program is about helping people through a tough \neconomic time. We don't expect that it is going to get any better \nJanuary 1 or January 31.\n  Frankly, I think if you listen to Alan Greenspan and everybody else \nin the administration, they don't expect it is going to get any better \nin the next 5 months. So the point is that we want to have a stimulus \nfor those local economies.\n  My State of Washington, with nearly 80,000 people impacted, has been \nputting something into the economy. But starting December 31, they \nwon't be because they won't be able to make mortgage payments or take \ncare of health care or do a lot of things. So this is about making a \nstatement and expanding the program beyond another 5-week Band-Aid. If \nwe had a commitment that we were going to be here on January 1 when the \nnext 5 weeks runs out, and we were going to take a look at the next 6 \nmonths--but we are not doing that. We are saying we expect no economic \nimprovement. We are not willing to step up, as the Bush 1 \nadministration was willing to do in the 1990s, and say, yes, an \nextension of unemployment is a good stimulus, a safeguard, while the \neconomy is needed to improve. That is what we are talking about here. \nSo the Band-Aid approach that the House is sending over is simply 5 \nweeks, basically taking care of the worse case scenario. We need to \nmake a positive statement. I have talked to many business people in my \nState who are supportive from that perspective of not taking out this \nincome from the local economies that are being crunched.\n\n  I wanted to add to my colleague from New York, the numbers are \nstaggering. New York has over 300,000 people who will be impacted as of \nDecember. Other States: Illinois with almost 170,000 people; Georgia, \n125,000 people; Pennsylvania, 125,000 people; Texas, 215,000 people.\n  So there are States throughout this country that are feeling this \nimpact. I think the previous Bush administration was very wise to say a \ngood stimulus and a good support for unemployed workers who have lost \njobs through no fault of their own, who cannot find employment, let's \nkeep the basic income going and give a stimulus to the economy. I don't \nknow that the Senator from New York is opposed to negotiating any kind \nof proposal that would get us past just a Band-Aid. I think we are \nwilling to look at what the proposal is, but this is about the sixth or \nseventh unanimous consent request and negotiation proposal this side of \nthe aisle has put forward.\n  We are saying that the time has run out and that these individuals \nare going to get very minimal--if next to nothing--good news about \ntheir economic opportunity for the next year or year and a half.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I yield to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I commend the Senator for offering this unanimous \nconsent request. Secondly, in response to the points raised by the \nSenator from Oklahoma, as I understand it, the bill provides for an \nadditional 13 weeks. If you have exhausted your benefits, having drawn \nthe basic 26 weeks, and the additional 13 weeks that we have provided \nfor in March of this year, you could then draw another 13 weeks. So for \nthat limited group would, in fact, get 52 weeks. I point out that that \nlimited group is unemployed. They have not been able to get a job in a \nlabor market that is not working.\n  In fact, Chairman Greenspan, yesterday, testifying before the Joint \nEconomic Committee, when asked about extending unemployment insurance \nbenefits, testified that the extended unemployment insurance provides a \ntimely boost of disposable income. He acknowledged that we are \ncurrently in a period where jobs are falling. He stated:\n\n       I have always argued that in periods like this that the \n     economic restraints on the unemployment insurance system \n     almost surely ought to be eased.\n\n  That is exactly what this legislation seeks to do.\n  Secondly, there is $27 billion in the trust fund to pay unemployment \ninsurance benefits, specifically designed to meet this kind of \nsituation. Those moneys have been paid into the trust fund over a \nperiod of time. The whole system was structured to have this trust fund \nbuild up in good times, and then to utilize it in bad times.\n  We certainly are facing bad times now. In fact, we have 2.2 million \nwho have lost, or will lose, their unemployment benefits by the end of \nthe year. The long-term unemployed--those more than 26 weeks--rose \n71,000 last month alone. There are now more than 1.6 million long-term \nunemployed--a million more than when President Bush took office.\n  What the Senator is seeking to do was done, I must point out, under \nPresident Bush the first. For the life of me, I don't understand why \nPresident Bush the second won't agree to and support this measure.\n  What are these people to do who have lost their jobs? The premise of \nthe system is you get some short-term support, the labor market picks \nup, and you can go back and find a job. They cannot find these jobs. In \nfact, not only can they not find them, more people are losing their \njobs. So the labor market is constraining, not expanding. These people \nneed help. There is $27 billion that has been paid into the trust fund \nfor the very purpose of providing unextended employment insurance \nbenefits.\n  Now, the Senator in this legislation has not, as I understand it, \nsought to do some of the other proposals that have been floating around \nhere in terms of providing a more extended coverage of the system, \nupping the benefits and other proposals.\n  There are many who think the existing system is inadequate. She is \nnot seeking to correct that, as I understand it. We are only seeking to \ndo this 13-week extension. I certainly think we ought to do that before \nthis Congress leaves.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Yes, I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I want to make a statement. Too many times it happens--\nthe Senator yields to me to ask a question, not to make a speech--many \ntimes in the debate people have yielded the floor as if they control \nthe floor. The Presiding Officer controls\n\n[[Page S10999]]\n\nthe floor. The Senator can yield for a question but not yield for a \nspeech. I did not hear a question the last time. I do not want to get \ntoo technical, but we ought to adhere to normal Senate rules.\n  Now my question: The Senator is trying to pass a bill. I stated that \nthe bill is a 26-week extension, not a 13-week extension. I keep \nhearing people say it is a 13-week extension. That is not factually \ncorrect. It is a 26-week extension. If you just entered into the \nprogram, am I not correct, you can exhaust your 26 weeks of State \nbenefits and qualify for 26 weeks of 100 percent Federal benefits? It \nis a 26-week extension which doubles the cost of the program. It is a \n$17 billion program. Am I not correct--I want to be factually correct. \nIf I am wrong, I am happy to be corrected. But am I not correct it is \nreally a 26-week extension for anybody entering into the program? So \npeople could qualify for 26 weeks of State benefits and 26 weeks of \nFederal benefits if the Senator's bill should pass?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. With all due respect to my friend from Oklahoma, that \nis not what the bill says. The bill provides 13 weeks for those first \ncoming into the system, but for people who have already exhausted their \n13 weeks, it does provide an additional 13 weeks, which adds up to 26 \nweeks.\n  Maybe it is not artfully enough drafted. I certainly have the \ngreatest respect for my colleague from Oklahoma, who is one of the \npremier legislators in this body, but if it is not clear, then I will \nbe more than happy to write it so it is absolutely clear.\n  The intention is, as I have stated, to provide an additional 13 weeks \nto people who have exhausted their benefits. To echo the eloquent \ncomments of my colleagues from Washington and Maryland, there are lots \nof people out there. The Senator from Washington read the numbers. Let \nme give you one quick example.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I want an answer to my question.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. The answer is the bill does not provide for those first \ncoming into the system 26 weeks. It does provide an additional 13 weeks \nso that those who have exhausted their first 13 weeks can have 26 \nweeks.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield further for a question?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I believe the bill offers 26 additional weeks for \nanybody who just came into the system.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. We would be more than happy to clarify that. That is \nnot the way the bill was intended. It certainly is not the way it was \nmeant to be drafted. If there is any--\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for an additional question?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Let me finish my answer. You get to ask, I get to \nanswer. My answer is, it is intended to be a 13-week extension. If \nthere needs to be a cutoff point so it is absolutely clear that this is \nthe intention, we stand ready to do that.\n\n  In contrast, the bill the House is working on is a 5-week extension \nfor those who already are in the system, and then it is over. No more \nhelp. From my perspective, representing 300,000 unemployed New Yorkers, \n120,000 of whom lost their jobs directly as a result of September 11, \nit is very hard to go back to New York and look at people such as Felix \nBatista who worked for 22 years at Windows on the World, with four \nchildren--luckily was not there that day when the terrorist attack \noccurred--and has not been able to find work, even though we have all \nbeen trying to help him. He is a man of limited skills, but a good, \nhard-working person, a father of four. He has no help. What is he \nsupposed to do? Let me ask that question of the Senator from Oklahoma. \nWhere is my office supposed to send literally thousands of people who \nhave no work because the economy is not producing jobs?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for an additional question?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Yes, I will be more than happy to yield.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The proposal before us still has the adjusted insured \nunemployment rate to where it includes the following paragraph:\n\n       Except that individuals exhausting their right to regular \n     compensation during the most recent three calendar months for \n     which data is available before the close of the period for \n     which such rate is being determined shall be taken into \n     account as if they were individuals filing claims for regular \n     compensation for each week during the period for which the \n     rate is being determined.\n\n  Basically that means if someone even completes the system and gets a \njob, they still are counted as unemployed; is that still in this \nlegislation?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. What we did, in response to the Senator from Oklahoma--\nand maybe we were misinformed about this--we went back to our last \nrecession under the previous President Bush. We thought that would be a \ngood model as to what was done five times to extend unemployment \ninsurance benefits. We took the language the first Bush administration \nand the bipartisan body here at that time decided was the appropriate \nlegislative language to bring about the result that people agreed was \nneeded.\n  If it was in some way misguided to rely upon the first Bush \nadministration's extension of unemployment insurance, then we are going \nto say we did the best we could to look at what had been effective and \nworked in the past.\n  In direct response, the people who are still being counted in the \nunemployment insurance is a relatively small number because, obviously, \nto get them on and off does take some bureaucratic and technical \nadjustments. There are certainly some--I am sure I could find a few in \nOklahoma and a few in New York. But the fact is the overwhelming number \nof people who will be eligible and will receive benefits are people who \ndeserve it, and that is, I think, the goal we should be addressing.\n  Mr. NICKLES. So the answer to my question is that language is still \nin the bill?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. We have the same language that was used in the first \nBush recession. Now we are in the second Bush recession. We are using \nthe same language. It worked then.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield again? So that language is still \nin there. I will tell my colleague, I will never agree to this language \npassing. I will also tell my colleague, if she is politicizing this, \ntalking about the first Bush recession and the second Bush recession, \nthe first compensation package did not have the same triggers. I did \nnot agree with the first. I do not like the language that somebody who \ngets a job is still counted as unemployed for these rates. I would \nnever agree to it. I did not know it was in the first program ten or so \nyears ago, and it will not be in the next one if I am still standing \naround here.\n  I also ask my colleague, are not the triggers different under this \nproposal than the compensation packages that passed in the early \nnineties?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. It is the same kind of trigger, I am advised.\n  Mr. NICKLES. There are different triggers. More States would qualify \nfor greater benefits; is that not correct?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. It includes States with concentrated high unemployment. \nThat is true, there is a slightly different trigger. Again, I was not \naround in 1991 and 1992, so I cannot speak to what the Senator would or \nwould not have done. The fact is, we have a problem. We have tried \nrepeatedly--eight separate times--to work out some way to provide some \nadditional benefits for people who deserve them. If there is a way to \nwork out a better approach, to do something that will clearly meet the \nobjections of the Senator from Oklahoma, I stand ready to do that.\n  I am just worried about all of these decent people who are running \nout of unemployment benefits. There is nowhere for them to go. I do not \nknow what else to bring to the floor other than those stories. We can \nargue about triggers. I am sure between the two of us, we can fix a \ntrigger if there was a willingness to act on that. What is coming over \nfrom the House, larded with other controversial provisions, is not a \ngood-faith effort to extend unemployment benefits to people in need. It \nis an effort to basically try to say something was done which will not \nhave any lasting benefit for those who are most in need.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  (Ms. CANTWELL assumed the chair.)\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Clearly, if the Senator from Oklahoma is going to \nobject to our following the precedent of the triggers of the President \nBush 1 package, then obviously we are going to have to go back to the \ndrawing board.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nthe immediate consideration of Calendar\n\n[[Page S11000]]\n\nNo. 619, S. 3009, a bill to provide for a 13-week extension of \nunemployment compensation; that the bill be read three times, passed, \nand the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, without \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, reserving the right to object, the UC \nrequest, as I read it, says it is a 13-week extension. The bill before \nus is a 26-week extension. A 13-week extension, I believe, costs $7.3 \nbillion; a 26-week extension cost--by CBO--is $17.1 billion. That is \nthe proposal before us, and, therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. The two managers of this bill have been very patient and \ncooperative, but we have to ask their patience once again. We have a \nmatter that the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Barkley, wishes to bring \nforward in honor of Senator Wellstone. This will take a short period of \ntime, and I ask that we be able to move to that at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask for time before the Senators from \nMinnesota speak.\n  Mr. REID. I ask that the Senator from Washington be recognized after \nthe two Senators from Minnesota speak. Would that be appropriate?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. How much time will the Senators from Minnesota require?\n  Mr. REID. Could I ask of my two friends how much time they wish to \ntake on this matter?\n  Mr. BARKLEY. Madam President, I wish to take approximately 4 minutes.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, I will be approximately the same.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the two Senators from \nMinnesota be recognized for 10 minutes equally divided between the two \nof them. Following their statements--I understand they want to move \nlegislation--I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Washington \nbe recognized.\n  Senator Murray indicates she only wishes to speak for up to 5 \nminutes. So I am sure my two friends would allow her to proceed for up \nto 5 minutes, and then following that the two Senators from Minnesota \nwould be recognized for up to 10 minutes.\n  Following that, we will definitely go to the homeland security bill. \nThere are people waiting to offer amendments. So I make that in the \nform of a unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

I rise today to note a very significant event that \noccurred last night on the floor of the Senate, and that was the \npassage of the pipeline safety conference report.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, in our State of Washington, a tragic \naccident occurred 3\\1/2\\ years ago when a pipeline blew up on a sunny \nJune afternoon, tragically killing three young children in our State \nand devastating a mile-wide section of a river that travels through \nBellingham, WA. This was a traumatic event that has impacted the lives \nnot only of those families and their friends but hundreds of people in \nBellingham and across this country.\n  At the time, I thought this was a uniquely tragic accident that \noccurred in my State when a pipeline suddenly blew up on a sunny Friday \nafternoon, after school. But after coming back to Washington, DC, and \nresearching what was known about pipelines, I found out that in a short \ntime period, between 1986 and 1999, there had been 5,700 pipeline \naccidents.\n  What happened in my home State was not unique. Three hundred twenty-\nfive people had died in that time period. There had been 1,500 injuries \nthat had occurred and $850 million in environmental damage. Working \nwith many colleagues, Senator McCain, who chaired the Commerce \nCommittee, and Senator Hollings, who worked diligently with me, \nSenators Inouye, Breaux, Wyden, Brownback, Bingaman, Domenici, Corzine, \nTorricelli, my colleague who is presiding today, Senator Cantwell, and \nformer Senator Gorton, made this an issue in this country. It has been \na long and difficult road. We have passed this bill out of the Senate \non several occasions. We have been stopped in the House, and today we \nare finally at a point where the House, I believe, is going to pass \nthis legislation as well, and it will be sent to the President of the \nUnited States. It will put into place significant new improvements on \ntraining and qualifications of our pipeline personnel, on inspection \nand prevention practices, on tough penalties for people who violate \nthis, and States' abilities to expand their safety activities.\n  For the thousands of families who live next to pipelines, who work \nnext to pipelines, who send their kids to schools next to pipelines, \nthis is definitely an improvement in our law.\n  Is it everything we ask for? No. But today I want to rise and thank \nall of my colleagues, and Congressman Larsen as well, for finally \nmoving us to a point where the families of Wade King, Stephen Tsiorvas, \nand Liam Wood can realize the hard work they have put in is going to \nfinally result in a change of law that means some future child, some \nfuture family, some future community, will not have to face the \nsituation as they have.\n  I thank my colleagues for their work on this, and I look forward to \nhaving the President sign this into law.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/14/senate-section/article/S11000-3", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11000-S11002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      PAUL AND SHEILA WELLSTONE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY BUILDING ACT\n\n  Mr. BARKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. 3156, introduced earlier today by \nmyself and Senator Dayton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3156) to provide a grant for the construction of \n     a new community center in St. Paul, Minnesota, in honor of \n     the late Senator Paul Wellstone and his beloved wife, Sheila.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. BARKLEY. Madam President, today, Senator Dayton and I are \nintroducing legislation to pay tribute to Senator Paul Wellstone and \nhis beloved wife Sheila.\n  Our legislation would provide a $10 million authorization of Federal \nfunds for construction of the ``Paul and Sheila Wellstone Center for \nCommunity Building'' at Neighborhood House in St. Paul, MN, where Paul \nand Sheila lived.\n  First, let me thank the leadership on both sides of the aisle for \nfacilitating consideration of this legislation. Senator Dayton and his \nstaff, Senator Wellstone's family and staff, and especially my \ncolleague from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, have literally moved heaven \nand earth to bring this bill to the floor.\n  I may be the newest Member of this Chamber, but I fully appreciate \nthe extraordinary efforts of so many to allow Senator Dayton and I to \ncreate a living legacy in honor of Paul and Sheila Wellstone in such \nshort order.\n  Neighborhood House was founded by the women of Mount Zion Temple in \nthe 1880's as a settlement house, helping newly arrived Eastern \nEuropean Jewish immigrants to establish a new life and thrive in their \nnew community.\n  Senator Wellstone always had a genuine affinity for Neighborhood \nHouse,\n\n[[Page S11001]]\n\nas his parents, Leon and Minnie, were Russian Jewish immigrants \nthemselves. But his affinity reached far beyond this personal link. \nNeighborhood House truly embodies everything that Paul Wellstone fought \nfor over the course of his entire life: that all people, no matter \ntheir background or economic status or country of origin or race or \ncreed, would have a fair shake at life, and an opportunity to belong to \nand enrich their communities.\n  Neighborhood House has been building doorways of opportunity for \ndiverse communities for nearly 120 years. The Neighborhood House is a \nmulticultural-multilingual agency that provides and houses an array of \nprograms, including legal services, child care, recreation programs, \nsenior programs and education. ``Senator Paul,'' as he was referred to \nby many at Neighborhood House, came every year to the Freedom Festival \nat Neighborhood House to honor the new American citizens from the \nHmong, Latino, and other communities.\n  Indeed, the entire Wellstone family was very committed to \nNeighborhood House. Just 2 weeks before their deaths, Senator Wellstone \nsent his daughter Marcia to tour Neighborhood House and talk with staff \nabout important issues for our community.\n  In addition, Sheila Wellstone's championing of women's issues is \nembodied in Neighborhood House programs such as Hispanic Women in \nAction, a cultural empowerment group that enables women to retain their \nculture while learning a new one, address challenging family issues, \nand develop into leaders not only for their families but also their \ncommunity.\n  When Neighborhood House began to research the construction of a new \nfacility to meet growing needs, it was Senator Wellstone himself who \nsuggested that the organization seek a Federal statute to help fund the \nconstruction.\n  The Paul and Sheila Wellstone Center for Community Building will be a \n93,000 square foot state-of-the-art community gathering place on St. \nPaul's west side. It will house social services, community engagement, \nrecreation, and arts programs for residents of St. Paul, as well as new \nAmericans in the greater Twin Cities area.\n\n  The Paul and Sheila Wellstone Center for Community Building will also \nserve as an education and learning center for communities throughout \nthe entire State of Minnesota. Last evening, the memorial program for \nthe service to celebrate the lives of Paul and Sheila Wellstone \ncontained these words:\n\n       Complete those dear, unfinished tasks of mine. And I, \n     perchance, may therein comfort you.\n\n  Paul, this is our first step toward finishing your work. I also \ncommit to working during my short tenure in this distinguished body to \ntry to help pass your signature legislation, the Mental Health Parity \nAct.\n  Again, I thank the Senate leadership for the extraordinary \naccommodation to allow us to bring this bill to the floor today. It, \ntoo, is a tribute to the respect and love of Paul Wellstone by his \nSenate colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, I am proud to join with my colleague, \nSenator Barkley, in cosponsoring the Paul and Sheila Wellstone Center \nfor Community Building Act. I pay tribute to my colleague, Senator \nBarkley, for taking the initiative on this matter, for your leadership. \nI believe it has been one week to the day since the Senator arrived in \nWashington, and even before he had undertaken the oath of office and \nassumed the official title of Senator from Minnesota, he was acting on \nbehalf of our State.\n  He deserves the credit for this measure. Others are moving Heaven and \nEarth, as the Senator said. I believe he is too modest. He is the prime \nmover in this matter. I salute my colleague for his doing so under such \nextraordinary circumstances. I could not think of a better way for \nanyone to begin service in this Chamber than to honor our colleague, \nPaul Wellstone, and his wife Sheila, who cared about these matters from \ntheir own heart.\n  As Senator Barkley said, with the experience that Paul had being the \nson of immigrants and his undying compassion for those who came to this \ncountry under any circumstances, Paul's concern extended beyond those \nwho could do him some good in this society. Paul's concern was for \nthose he could do good in this society. He devoted countless hours, \nthousands and thousands of hours to people and causes where there was \nno benefit for him, there was no political advantage.\n  Most of the people coming to this center were not citizens and would \nnot be for a number of years. Paul did it out of his heart; Sheila did \nit out of her heart, out of their common compassion for their fellow \ncitizens, with no thought of gain or benefit to themselves.\n  This is a fitting first tribute. I hope it will be only the first \ntribute. I join with Senator Barkley in asking my colleagues here and \nin the House to ultimately pay tribute to Paul and Sheila, especially \nPaul, since this was his matter of concern, the Mental Health Parity \nAct. He worked tirelessly with Senator Domenici to pass this in the \nSenate, and unfortunately it was not adopted in conference committee.\n  I join Senator Barkley in hoping that measure could be passed in this \nsession. If it is not possible, I will do everything I can, working \nwith Senator Domenici and others next year to see it does pass. This is \nan important statement of the Senate and the House. We need to pass it, \nhonoring Paul and Sheila Wellstone. It is appropriate because it \nsymbolizes that compassion, that spirit of humanity which marked their \nlives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). Do Senators yield back their \ntime?\n  Mr. BARKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the bill be read \nthree times and passed and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 3156) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3156\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Paul and Sheila Wellstone \n     Center for Community Building Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Senator Paul Wellstone was a tireless advocate for the \n     people of Minnesota, particularly for new immigrants and the \n     economically disadvantaged.\n       (2) Paul and Sheila Wellstone loved St. Paul, Minnesota, \n     and often walked the neighborhoods of St. Paul to better \n     understand the needs of the people.\n       (3) Neighborhood House was founded in the late 1800's in \n     St. Paul, Minnesota, by the women of Mount Zion Temple as a \n     settlement house to help newly arrived Eastern European \n     Jewish immigrants establish a new life and thrive in their \n     new community.\n       (4) Paul and Sheila Wellstone were very committed to \n     Neighborhood House and its mission to improve the lives of \n     its residents.\n       (5) When Senator Wellstone became aware that the \n     Neighborhood House Community Center was no longer adequate to \n     meet the needs of the St. Paul community, he suggested that \n     Neighborhood House request Federal funding to construct a new \n     facility.\n       (6) As an honor to Paul and Sheila Wellstone, a Federal \n     grant shall be awarded to Neighborhood House to be used for \n     the design and construction of a new community center in St. \n     Paul, Minnesota, to be known as ``The Paul and Sheila \n     Wellstone Center for Community Building''.\n\n     SEC. 3. CONSTRUCTION GRANT.\n\n       (a) Grant Authorized.--The Secretary of Housing and Urban \n     Development shall award a grant to Neighborhood House of St. \n     Paul, Minnesota, to finance the construction of a new \n     community center in St. Paul, Minnesota, to be known as ``The \n     Paul and Sheila Wellstone Center for Community Building''.\n       (b) Maximum Amount.--The grant awarded under this section \n     shall be $10,000,000.\n       (c) Use of Funds.--Funds awarded under this section shall \n     only be used for the design and construction of the Paul and \n     Sheila Wellstone Center for Community Building.\n       (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2003, which \n     shall remain available until expended, to carry out this Act.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I congratulate our new colleague from Minnesota, not \nonly for the nobility of the purpose for which this legislation is \ndedicated, to honor the memory of our dear friends Paul and Sheila \nWellstone, but for the fact he achieved the passage of a measure so \nearly in his time here as a Member of the Senate. I congratulate him \nfor his purpose and for his success.\n\n[[Page S11002]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/14/senate-section/article/S11000-3", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11000-S11002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      PAUL AND SHEILA WELLSTONE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY BUILDING ACT\n\n  Mr. BARKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. 3156, introduced earlier today by \nmyself and Senator Dayton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3156) to provide a grant for the construction of \n     a new community center in St. Paul, Minnesota, in honor of \n     the late Senator Paul Wellstone and his beloved wife, Sheila.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. BARKLEY. Madam President, today, Senator Dayton and I are \nintroducing legislation to pay tribute to Senator Paul Wellstone and \nhis beloved wife Sheila.\n  Our legislation would provide a $10 million authorization of Federal \nfunds for construction of the ``Paul and Sheila Wellstone Center for \nCommunity Building'' at Neighborhood House in St. Paul, MN, where Paul \nand Sheila lived.\n  First, let me thank the leadership on both sides of the aisle for \nfacilitating consideration of this legislation. Senator Dayton and his \nstaff, Senator Wellstone's family and staff, and especially my \ncolleague from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, have literally moved heaven \nand earth to bring this bill to the floor.\n  I may be the newest Member of this Chamber, but I fully appreciate \nthe extraordinary efforts of so many to allow Senator Dayton and I to \ncreate a living legacy in honor of Paul and Sheila Wellstone in such \nshort order.\n  Neighborhood House was founded by the women of Mount Zion Temple in \nthe 1880's as a settlement house, helping newly arrived Eastern \nEuropean Jewish immigrants to establish a new life and thrive in their \nnew community.\n  Senator Wellstone always had a genuine affinity for Neighborhood \nHouse,\n\n[[Page S11001]]\n\nas his parents, Leon and Minnie, were Russian Jewish immigrants \nthemselves. But his affinity reached far beyond this personal link. \nNeighborhood House truly embodies everything that Paul Wellstone fought \nfor over the course of his entire life: that all people, no matter \ntheir background or economic status or country of origin or race or \ncreed, would have a fair shake at life, and an opportunity to belong to \nand enrich their communities.\n  Neighborhood House has been building doorways of opportunity for \ndiverse communities for nearly 120 years. The Neighborhood House is a \nmulticultural-multilingual agency that provides and houses an array of \nprograms, including legal services, child care, recreation programs, \nsenior programs and education. ``Senator Paul,'' as he was referred to \nby many at Neighborhood House, came every year to the Freedom Festival \nat Neighborhood House to honor the new American citizens from the \nHmong, Latino, and other communities.\n  Indeed, the entire Wellstone family was very committed to \nNeighborhood House. Just 2 weeks before their deaths, Senator Wellstone \nsent his daughter Marcia to tour Neighborhood House and talk with staff \nabout important issues for our community.\n  In addition, Sheila Wellstone's championing of women's issues is \nembodied in Neighborhood House programs such as Hispanic Women in \nAction, a cultural empowerment group that enables women to retain their \nculture while learning a new one, address challenging family issues, \nand develop into leaders not only for their families but also their \ncommunity.\n  When Neighborhood House began to research the construction of a new \nfacility to meet growing needs, it was Senator Wellstone himself who \nsuggested that the organization seek a Federal statute to help fund the \nconstruction.\n  The Paul and Sheila Wellstone Center for Community Building will be a \n93,000 square foot state-of-the-art community gathering place on St. \nPaul's west side. It will house social services, community engagement, \nrecreation, and arts programs for residents of St. Paul, as well as new \nAmericans in the greater Twin Cities area.\n\n  The Paul and Sheila Wellstone Center for Community Building will also \nserve as an education and learning center for communities throughout \nthe entire State of Minnesota. Last evening, the memorial program for \nthe service to celebrate the lives of Paul and Sheila Wellstone \ncontained these words:\n\n       Complete those dear, unfinished tasks of mine. And I, \n     perchance, may therein comfort you.\n\n  Paul, this is our first step toward finishing your work. I also \ncommit to working during my short tenure in this distinguished body to \ntry to help pass your signature legislation, the Mental Health Parity \nAct.\n  Again, I thank the Senate leadership for the extraordinary \naccommodation to allow us to bring this bill to the floor today. It, \ntoo, is a tribute to the respect and love of Paul Wellstone by his \nSenate colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, I am proud to join with my colleague, \nSenator Barkley, in cosponsoring the Paul and Sheila Wellstone Center \nfor Community Building Act. I pay tribute to my colleague, Senator \nBarkley, for taking the initiative on this matter, for your leadership. \nI believe it has been one week to the day since the Senator arrived in \nWashington, and even before he had undertaken the oath of office and \nassumed the official title of Senator from Minnesota, he was acting on \nbehalf of our State.\n  He deserves the credit for this measure. Others are moving Heaven and \nEarth, as the Senator said. I believe he is too modest. He is the prime \nmover in this matter. I salute my colleague for his doing so under such \nextraordinary circumstances. I could not think of a better way for \nanyone to begin service in this Chamber than to honor our colleague, \nPaul Wellstone, and his wife Sheila, who cared about these matters from \ntheir own heart.\n  As Senator Barkley said, with the experience that Paul had being the \nson of immigrants and his undying compassion for those who came to this \ncountry under any circumstances, Paul's concern extended beyond those \nwho could do him some good in this society. Paul's concern was for \nthose he could do good in this society. He devoted countless hours, \nthousands and thousands of hours to people and causes where there was \nno benefit for him, there was no political advantage.\n  Most of the people coming to this center were not citizens and would \nnot be for a number of years. Paul did it out of his heart; Sheila did \nit out of her heart, out of their common compassion for their fellow \ncitizens, with no thought of gain or benefit to themselves.\n  This is a fitting first tribute. I hope it will be only the first \ntribute. I join with Senator Barkley in asking my colleagues here and \nin the House to ultimately pay tribute to Paul and Sheila, especially \nPaul, since this was his matter of concern, the Mental Health Parity \nAct. He worked tirelessly with Senator Domenici to pass this in the \nSenate, and unfortunately it was not adopted in conference committee.\n  I join Senator Barkley in hoping that measure could be passed in this \nsession. If it is not possible, I will do everything I can, working \nwith Senator Domenici and others next year to see it does pass. This is \nan important statement of the Senate and the House. We need to pass it, \nhonoring Paul and Sheila Wellstone. It is appropriate because it \nsymbolizes that compassion, that spirit of humanity which marked their \nlives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). Do Senators yield back their \ntime?\n  Mr. BARKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the bill be read \nthree times and passed and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 3156) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3156\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Paul and Sheila Wellstone \n     Center for Community Building Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Senator Paul Wellstone was a tireless advocate for the \n     people of Minnesota, particularly for new immigrants and the \n     economically disadvantaged.\n       (2) Paul and Sheila Wellstone loved St. Paul, Minnesota, \n     and often walked the neighborhoods of St. Paul to better \n     understand the needs of the people.\n       (3) Neighborhood House was founded in the late 1800's in \n     St. Paul, Minnesota, by the women of Mount Zion Temple as a \n     settlement house to help newly arrived Eastern European \n     Jewish immigrants establish a new life and thrive in their \n     new community.\n       (4) Paul and Sheila Wellstone were very committed to \n     Neighborhood House and its mission to improve the lives of \n     its residents.\n       (5) When Senator Wellstone became aware that the \n     Neighborhood House Community Center was no longer adequate to \n     meet the needs of the St. Paul community, he suggested that \n     Neighborhood House request Federal funding to construct a new \n     facility.\n       (6) As an honor to Paul and Sheila Wellstone, a Federal \n     grant shall be awarded to Neighborhood House to be used for \n     the design and construction of a new community center in St. \n     Paul, Minnesota, to be known as ``The Paul and Sheila \n     Wellstone Center for Community Building''.\n\n     SEC. 3. CONSTRUCTION GRANT.\n\n       (a) Grant Authorized.--The Secretary of Housing and Urban \n     Development shall award a grant to Neighborhood House of St. \n     Paul, Minnesota, to finance the construction of a new \n     community center in St. Paul, Minnesota, to be known as ``The \n     Paul and Sheila Wellstone Center for Community Building''.\n       (b) Maximum Amount.--The grant awarded under this section \n     shall be $10,000,000.\n       (c) Use of Funds.--Funds awarded under this section shall \n     only be used for the design and construction of the Paul and \n     Sheila Wellstone Center for Community Building.\n       (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2003, which \n     shall remain available until expended, to carry out this Act.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I congratulate our new colleague from Minnesota, not \nonly for the nobility of the purpose for which this legislation is \ndedicated, to honor the memory of our dear friends Paul and Sheila \nWellstone, but for the fact he achieved the passage of a measure so \nearly in his time here as a Member of the Senate. I congratulate him \nfor his purpose and for his success.\n\n[[Page S11002]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/14/senate-section/article/S11002-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11002-S11012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 HOMELAND SECURITY ACT OF 2002--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the pending business.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5005) to establish the Department of Homeland \n     Security, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Thompson (for Gramm) amendment No. 4901, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n       Lieberman/McCain amendment No. 4902 (to amendment No. \n     4901), to establish within the legislative branch the \n     National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United \n     States.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I will speak on the substitute on \nhomeland security introduced yesterday by Senator Thompson on behalf of \nSenators Gramm and Miller. My feelings about this substitute, to put it \nas directly as I can, are mixed. The substitute would create a single \nstrong Department of Homeland Security under the leadership of an \naccountable Secretary, which many Members have supported, actually, for \nmore than a year now in response to the terrorist attacks of September \n11, 2001, and the dangerous vulnerabilities in our federal homeland \nsecurity system that those attacks revealed.\n  The substitute is also problematic in many ways. I categorize them in \nfour chunks.\n  First, this substitute contains several provisions that are just ill-\nconceived, missed opportunities to close vulnerabilities in our \nsecurity or that otherwise make the wrong choice.\n  Second, the bill contains provisions that are unrelated to homeland \nsecurity legislation. Apparently, as often happens in Congress, some of \nour colleagues have decided to put the provisions on what they assumed \nwas the last bus out of town during this session rather than waiting \nfor the right ride.\n  Third, the bill contains provisions that do seem, as we approach \nDecember, to be gift wrapped by lobbyists to satisfy some special \ninterests, not carefully considered to improve the security of the \nAmerican people.\n  Fourth, a number of provisions in the bill are 11th hour additions, \nnew to everyone in the Senate, not previously included either in the \nlegislation that came from our Governmental Affairs Committee or in the \nso-called Graham-Miller substitute, at least in its previous \niterations. This makes it difficult to know whether these provisions \nare good or bad. It is in that sense that these last-minute conditions \non a critically important bill are not up to the standards the Senate \nshould follow, and are not of the urgent necessity that cries out for \nthis bill, which is to protect the homeland security of the American \npeople.\n  There are many good things to say about the substitute in a number of \nareas. The bill has made real progress from earlier proposals, both \nfrom the President and from our Republican colleagues. I am grateful, \nonce again, as in the previous Gramm-Miller substitute, the overall \narchitecture and composition of the proposed Department of Homeland \nSecurity is quite similar to what we conceived in the legislation \napproved by the Governmental Affairs Committee, first on a partisan \nvote in May and then unfortunately in a bipartisan vote in July of this \nyear.\n  This bill, the substitute, would create a new Department with major \nprovisions responsible for border and transportation security, \nintelligence, and critical infrastructure protection, emergency \npreparedness and response, science and technology, and immigration \nservices.\n  This bill is nearly identical to the bill approved by the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee in deciding which domestic defense-\nrelated agencies and offices should be transferred and how they should \nbe organized. In fact, when we say, as has been said so often in this \ndebate in this Chamber, that there is agreement on 90 to 95 percent of \nwhat we should be doing here with regard to homeland security, that is \nwhat we mean. We mean we agree on the big picture, if I may put it that \nway. That is a big deal.\n  We recognize that today's terrible vulnerabilities are there and we \nagree not only on the need for a comprehensive reorganization to close \nthose vulnerabilities but almost all of the components that have \nreorganization.\n  Today, homeland security is institutionally homeless--everyone is in \ncharge and therefore no one is in charge. Under this substitute, as \nunder our committee-approved legislation, that will no longer be the \ncase. Under this bill, as under our bill, for the first time we would \nbolster emergency preparedness and response efforts to ensure that all \nareas and levels of government are working together to anticipate and \nprepare for the worst. Today, the fact is that coordination of our \nhomeland security agencies is the exception, not the rule. That is \nunacceptable.\n  Under this bill, as under our bill, for the first time we will have a \nsingle focal point for all of the intelligence available to our \nGovernment so it can be properly fused and analyzed, and so that we \nwill enhance our ability to deter, prevent, and respond to terrorist \nattacks.\n  This was clearly one of the most glaring weaknesses of our Government \nleading up to September 11, 2001, as the excellent work done by the \nJoint Intelligence Committee investigations has made clear.\n  Under this bill, again as under our committee bill, for the first \ntime we would build strong bonds between Federal, State, and local \ngovernments to target terrorism. State and local officials are on the \nfront lines of the fight against terrorism, as we learned so clearly \nand painfully in the death tallies of the September 11 heroes. Today, \nlocal communities are waiting for better training, for new tools, and \nfor coordinated prevention and protection strategy. And this proposal, \nas under our committee bill, would accomplish that.\n  Under this bill also, as under our committee bill, for the first time \nwe would bring key border and national entry agencies together to \nensure that dangerous people and dangerous goods are kept out of our \ncountry without restricting the flow of legal immigration and commerce \nthat clearly nourishes our Nation. Today, threats to America may be \nslipping through the cracks because of our disorganization, and that is \nindefensible.\n  Under this bill, as under our bill, for the first time we would \npromote significant new research and technology development \nopportunities and homeland defense. The war against terrorism has no \ntraditional battlefield. One of the untraditional battlefields where we \nmust fight to emerge victorious is the laboratory. Today these efforts \nare dispersed and often blurred. That is unwise. We cannot tolerate \nthis any longer.\n  Under this bill, as under our bill, for the first time we would \nfacilitate close and comprehensive coordination between the public and \nprivate sectors to protect critical infrastructure. Fully 85 percent of \nour critical infrastructure is owned and operated by the private \nsector. We are talking here about electric grids, transportation, food \ndistribution systems, cyber-systems, and the like. We have to close \nvulnerabilities in those systems before terrorists strike them. To do \nso, we have to be working with the private sector.\n\n  In all of these areas, this piece of legislation, the substitute, \nwill usher in, I am confident, a much more secure nation. Beyond its \noverall structure, I am also pleased the substitute has moved toward \nour committee-approved bill in a number of specific areas, namely \nintelligence, science, and technology, workforce improvement, and \nappropriations. I want to discuss these each briefly now.\n  First, intelligence. The President's initial proposal had a very \nlimited conception of the intelligence powers and responsibilities of \nthe new Department. The intelligence provisions in this bill borrowed \nheavily from our legislation, and as a result will give our Government \na much better opportunity to avoid repeating the disastrous disconnects \nthat prevented us from connecting those dots before September 11.\n  First, the bill would, like our committee legislation, make it clear \nthat the purpose of the new Department's information analysis function \nincludes fusing, analyzing, and disseminating intelligence to deter, \nprevent, preempt or respond to all terrorist threats against the United \nStates. That is a central change from the President's initial, more \nlimited conception of an intelligence division designed primarily to \nprotect our critical infrastructure. We argued that was inadequate \nbecause--well, the World Trade\n\n[[Page S11003]]\n\nCenter itself, and the Pentagon, are not parts of our traditional \ncritical infrastructure, nor are shopping malls and places of public \ngathering which terrorists unfortunately strike.\n  This substitute also made progress in priority setting. It gives the \nUnder Secretary the authority to work with the Director of Central \nIntelligence and other agencies to establish intelligence collection \npriorities and insures that the Department of Homeland Security will be \nat the table with the rest of the intelligence community when \nintelligence requirements and priorities are established.\n  Finally on this point, the bill does seem to have moved closer to the \ncommittee bill on the crucial issue of access to information by giving \nthe new Department access to information except in cases where the \nPresident objects.\n  However, some differences do remain on intelligence. Rather than \ncreating separate Senate-confirmed Under Secretary positions to oversee \nintelligence analysis and infrastructure protection, the substitute \ncreates Assistant Secretaries within the same division of the new \nDepartment. In my view, intelligence and infrastructure protection \nshould each be led by a separate Senate-confirmed Under Secretary, each \nof whom can bring the necessary clout, attention, resources, and \nattention to those complex and different challenges. The access to \ninformation provisions--Senator Specter and I agree, and he may also \nhave an amendment on them--also could be enhanced.\n  On the whole, however, this critical function of the Department, \nintelligence, has been greatly improved in this substitute. The \nDepartment created by this bill will systematically organize, \nscrutinize, and bring together all relevant data in order to much \nbetter protect the American people from terrorism.\n  Science and technology next. So, too, has this substitute moved \ntoward our legislation on science and technology. Our committee worked \nvery hard to give this new Department the creative abilities it needs \nto develop and deploy a full range of technologies to detect and defeat \ndanger on our home soil.\n  In World War II, of course, we had the Manhattan Project, scientists \nwho came together to design revolutionary weaponry which was ultimately \ndecisive in that war.\n  In the war against terrorism here at home, we need revolutionary \ndefense technologies, machines that can scan for dangerous materials--\nbiometric identification systems, information analysis software, \nvaccines and antidotes to deadly pathogens--poisons. The list goes on \nand on, most of it probably at this moment unimaginable in detail but \ncritically important to our future security.\n  I am very gratified to see the substitute before us provides for a \nDirectorate of Science and Technology headed by a Senate-confirmed \nUnder Secretary, a Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency \nthat is modeled after DARPA in the Department of Defense, federally \nfunded research and development centers to provide analytical support \nto the Department, and a mechanism for allowing the Department to \naccess any of the Department of Energy laboratories and sites.\n  All of these were not included in the President's original homeland \nsecurity proposal. I am grateful to the authors of the substitute for \nincluding them now.\n  There are some other points of progress in the bill I think are worth \nnoting.\n  First, thanks I gather in large measure to the effective advocacy by \nthe senior Senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens, and unlike the \nPresident's original proposal, this substitute has wisely preserved \ncongressional accountability over spending by the new Department--after \nall, that is our constitutional role--and in doing so has rejected the \nadministration's call for expansive authority to shift money among \naccounts--appropriated money, the public's money--without approval by \nCongress.\n  Second, this bill has made significant strides in safeguarding the \nDepartment's integrity, cost-effectiveness, and respect for individual \nrights.\n  The original Gramm-Miller substitute, offered on behalf of the \nadministration, would have created a department without a civil rights \nofficer or privacy officer, and with an inspector general over whom the \nDepartment's Secretary would have had unprecedented authority, thereby \nmaking it possible that the inspector general's independence would have \nbeen compromised.\n  In this new substitute now pending, there is once again a civil \nrights officer in the Department, there is a privacy officer, and the \nSecretary's authority over the inspector general has been substantially \nchecked.\n  I wish the improvements had gone further. Our committee-endorsed \nbill, for instance, would have given the civil rights officer and the \ninspector general more authority than the substitute does and, \ntherefore, help assure a new Department of Homeland Security that would \nmore likely adhere to the highest standards of values and conduct. But \nI am grateful for what has changed in this substitute.\n  Finally, I am pleased that the substitute amendment has incorporated \nthe entire Federal workforce improvement bipartisan proposal developed \nby Senators Akaka and Voinovich, both distinguished members of our \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. That reform package will help this \nDepartment and all other Federal Departments attract, retain, and \nreward the best talent with the help of new personnel management tools \nand management flexibility given to the new Secretary.\n  Mr. President, unfortunately, as I said at the beginning, there is \nsome bad news. That was the good news in the substitute. There is some \nbad news as well.\n  While this bill, as I have just indicated, does incorporate, \nparticularly in the Akaka-Voinovich agreement, some substantial human \ncapital reforms for the Federal workforce, it unfortunately also takes \na step backward in other related areas. On the personnel issues--the \nFederal workforce issues that became such an unfortunate wedge between \nus here in this Chamber for so long--I must say I am not happy with the \noutcome. I don't want to rehash the arguments for and against keeping \ncivil service protections in place and giving union representative \nemployees basic protection against having their rights arbitrarily \nterminated. But let me just say this. What motivated us all along was a \ndesire to ensure this new Department would from day one have not only \nthe best leadership, the most sensible organization, and the resources \nnecessary to do the big job we are giving it, but that it would also \nhave the highest quality and best motivated workforce it could possibly \nhave; that we would not begin the history of this new Department with \nexpressions of suspicion about the commitment--even perhaps the \npatriotism--of these Federal employees, but that we would engage them \ntogether as part of a team, as respected members of the team, and \nindeed as those members of the team who would be doing the critical \nwork every hour of every day to protect the security of the American \npeople at home.\n\n  We often in our debate referred to the events of September 11 and the \nfact that those firefighters and police officers who we honored for \ntheir heroism, who we mourned for the ultimate sacrifice that they \ngave, were all members of unions, were all governed by civil service \nrules. But in the hour of crisis, in the hour of public need, not a \nsingle one of them but for a second thought about their union rights, \nor their collective bargaining agreement, or their civil service \nagreement. They rushed to the duty that they had, and accepted it as \npublic employees.\n  At one point a few months ago, a group of us met with a battalion \nchief from the New York City Fire Department. He told us that on that \nday, September 11, he was off duty with a group of friends who were off \nduty. When they heard the planes had hit the World Trade Center, they \njust rushed to the scene. He talked about terrible frustration and \nheartbreak because some of his colleagues, when they got to the scene, \nwere told they could not go into the building to try to rescue those \nwho were there. That is what public service is about. Civil service \nprotections and collective bargaining rights never come between public \nemployees and their obligation or responsibility to do duty. It was \nshown over and over again by the Federal employees in the departments \nand agencies that will be consolidated into this new Department.\n\n[[Page S11004]]\n\n  On this front, this substitute continues to be a disappointment to \nme. The bill fails to correct major problems in the previous Gramm-\nMiller substitute, and, as a result, I fear, invites politicization, \narbitrary treatment, and other personnel abuses in the Federal \nGovernment in a way that may damage the merit-based workplace Federal \nemployees and the American people--we the American people--who these \nFederal employees serve and in this new Department must protect have \ncome to depend upon.\n  I hope, of course, that what many fear does not occur and that if, or \nprobably when, this substitute passes, this and future administrations \nwill not overstep their bounds, will not unfairly use the unprecedented \nauthority they are given in parts of this legislation, and will not \nundermine thereby the effectiveness of the new Department.\n  I must say I still personally fail to understand why any President \nwould need to remove collective bargaining rights from unionized \nemployees who have a long and proud history of helping to protect the \nhomeland, as the 45,000-some employees who will be unionized of the \n170,000, who will be moved to this Department, and who will continue to \ndo exactly the same work they have done for decades.\n  While previous Presidents have had the same authority and have not \nexercised it to remove their collective bargaining rights, they will \ncontinue to do that work in this new Department. If and when this \nPresident or any future Presidents should decide to eliminate \ncollective bargaining within a unit of the Department--as they will \nhave the legal power to do if this substitute passes unilaterally--I am \nconfident the Congress will not just sit back and watch.\n  We will expect the President to take such a step only if it is truly \nessential to national security and not merely a management convenience \nor an ideological compulsion. We will expect the Department's \nleadership will have first made good-faith efforts to work \ncooperatively with their employees who are union members, determining \nthat union representation is in fact incompatible with national \nsecurity. We will expect the explanation the President provides to \nCongress, required under this substitute, to be thorough. The \nadministration for its part has said, particularly in recent days, it \nis not out to break Federal employee unions, but only to retain an \nextraordinary authority that has been exercised only a handful of times \nover the last four decades. We in Congress and our successors and I \nbelieve the American people will hold both this President and his \nsuccessors to that promise.\n  When it comes to the creation of a modified personnel management \nsystem, we expect the employees in the new Department will be hired, \npromoted, disciplined, and fired based only on merit. We expect that if \nand when existing civil service rights and protections are altered or \nremoved, the administration can demonstrate a clear need for doing so \nin the context of the homeland security mission of the Department. We \nexpect fair and independent procedures will be maintained for all \nemployees with grievances, especially those who allege abuse or \ncorruption within the Department--whistleblowers. We expect changes to \nthe system will be carefully crafted through negotiation and \ncollaboration with employees and their representatives at all levels, \nfrom the rank and file to top echelons of management. And if a \ndisagreement arises, or an agreement is not possible to obtain, the \nrequired 30 days of mediation and negotiation between the \nadministration and the unions will be substantial and in good faith, \nnot cosmetic.\n\n  The administration has pledged not to undermine the integrity of a \nmerit-based public-sector workplace. Here again, the American people \nand we in Congress will be watching, and watching carefully.\n  Let me discuss a few other concerns that I have about the substitute. \nOn immigration, this bill takes what, in my view, is a step backward \nfrom our committee-approved legislation by splitting the Immigration \nand Naturalization Service programs between the Border Directorate, \nwhere all immigration enforcement will be housed, and a new Bureau for \nCitizenship and Immigration Services, which will handle immigration \nservices.\n  I am concerned that this configuration may diffuse responsibility for \nimmigration policy and coordination among a large number of officials. \nAnd it is contrary to the earlier bipartisan Kennedy-Brownback \nimmigration legislation.\n  I am also troubled that the bill weakens provisions we had carefully \ndeveloped to ensure that the independence of immigration courts would \nbe preserved and that vulnerable child aliens would not be lost in the \nshuffle to the new Department.\n  I regret that the bill would shield private-sector information that \nis voluntarily submitted to the new Department from the Freedom of \nInformation Act from being used in civil litigation and even from \nrelease by State and local governments under their own sunshine laws. \nThat is a major retreat from the carefully crafted bipartisan Bennett-\nLevin-Leahy compromise that was included in our committee bill and in \nthe Gramm-Miller substitute in its original form, and is of particular \nconcern to community groups, workers, environmental advocates, and \nwatchdogs who depend on access to this information to help them reduce \nenvironmental health and safety risks to themselves, their families, \nand the public.\n  In addition, out of the blue, if I may phrase it that way, this \nsubstitute includes a provision that had not been seen in any previous \nproposals regarding homeland security, and that would take complaints \nabout vaccine additives out of the courts and require them to be made \nthrough the Federal Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.\n  That would affect potential claims involving the mercury-based \npreservative thimerosal. Because there are a number of class action \nlawsuits pending on this issue, this is a highly controversial and \ncomplicated issue, one that the relevant committee of the Senate, which \nhas been working on it, the HELP Committee, has not been able to come \nto a consensus on after several months of deliberation.\n  So why is this provision being rushed through now in the context of \nhomeland security legislation in a way that makes it very hard for us \nto reach a proper conclusion, though we have very significant fears \nthat rights of injured parties are being severely limited?\n  The bill also omits a vital provision in our bill that would have \nprovided $1 billion for each of the fiscal years 2003 and 2004 to local \ngovernments to hire firefighters. This provision, sponsored in our \ncommittee, and cosponsored--again, bipartisan--by Senators Carnahan and \nCollins, would create what is effectively a firefighter's version of \nthe immensely successful and productive and valued COPS Program that we \ncreated in the 1990s. I believe it started in 1994 for police officers \nlocally.\n  After September 11, the firefighters are people we depend on, \nparticularly in an emergency. The fire departments have taken on new \nresponsibilities throughout the country post September 11 and are doing \nmore hiring, so we need to help them pay for their new personnel. We \nneed to help them train and equip those personnel. Unfortunately, that \npathbreaking, productive, progressive provision has been taken out of \nthe substitute.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will yield for a question from the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. My question is this: The distinguished Senator is pointing \nout some very glaring differences between the bill--I call it a bill. \nIs this the hydra-headed monster that has come over from the House in \nthe last 24 hours or so? And is this the item before the Senate today? \nAnd is this the vehicle to which the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut is addressing his remarks? That would be my first question.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Through the Chair, I thank the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  The House, last night, adopted a proposal which I gather is \nessentially the same, perhaps totally the same, as this substitute \nwhich was offered yesterday by Senators Thompson, Gramm, and Miller.\n  Mr. BYRD. So what we have before the Senate--Mr. President, will the \nSenator yield further?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will.\n\n[[Page S11005]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. What we have before the Senate is a massive piece of \nlegislation with 480-odd pages, that has been virtually dropped into \nour laps within the last 36 hours, allowing for yesterday and thus far \ntoday. This is a virtually new bill, as I see it; is it not? It is \nsomething that was--I read about it in the newspapers--something to the \neffect this is a compromise that was passed by the House and sent to \nthe Senate. It is now under discussion in the Senate.\n  The distinguished Senator from Connecticut is performing, as I see \nit, a great service in addressing his remarks to this monstrosity. That \nis my word for it. It is a monstrosity. It is almost 500 pages, and it \nis just suddenly dropped into our laps. This is not the bill which came \nout of the committee chaired by the Senator from Connecticut, is it?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator. As I said at the outset of the \nremarks I am giving here, there is a lot that is in this substitute \nthat has, in fact, been taken from our committee bill. But as I am \nenumerating now, there is a lot also that has been added, and some of \nit really at the last moment.\n  Some of it is compromise legislation, for instance, on the question \nof Federal worker rights, which we have been debating here for several \nweeks now. But some of it, such as the provision on child vaccine and \nthe liability of pharmaceutical companies in cases of injury from that \nvaccine, we have never seen in any of the many forms of homeland \nsecurity legislation that have been introduced or discussed, and not \nonly in the Senate but I believe in the House as well.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield for a \nfurther question?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in speaking of the vaccines, as you know, in \nthis town, and in this Chamber, there is often a great deal said about \npork, about pork, and particularly with reference to appropriations \nbills.\n  This seems, to me, to be some pork--some pork--in this bill for the \npharmaceutical companies.\n  That is what it sounds like. I believe the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois will later have something to say about this, possibly have an \namendment in regard to it. That was kind of what I understood from a \nconversation earlier today. It sounds to me as if this is something \nbrand new to the distinguished Senator from Connecticut.\n  What I am leading up to is this question: Here we have a bill we are \nbeing asked to pass virtually sight unseen. We have had yesterday and \nthus far today to study this new vehicle that has come to us from the \nHouse, passed by the House, I believe. And this vehicle itself did not \ncome before the committee that is so ably chaired by the distinguished \nSenator from Connecticut. This is a new piece of legislation, virtually \nsight unseen in many ways. There are many parts of it, of course, that, \nas the distinguished Senator from Connecticut has indicated, were \nprobably lifted out of the measure which he and the other members of \nhis committee, both Republicans and Democrats, reported from that \ncommittee some several months ago, that bill we referred to back in \nthose days as the Lieberman substitute.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I remember those days fondly.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I remember them fondly also.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. But I am very disturbed by the fact that here we have \nbefore the Senate a measure which is in many ways a measure that has \nnot been seen, studied, except for the few hours of yesterday and today \nwe and our staffs have been able to allot to it. This is something new, \nand we are going to be asked to vote on cloture on this vehicle, this \npiece of legislation. We are going to be asked to vote on cloture by no \nlater than tomorrow on this matter, and we don't know what is in it. I \ndon't know what is in it. I have had my staff on it since yesterday \nwhen it first made its appearance in my office in the form of several \nseparate pages which I hold in my hand, various and sundry pieces of \nit, almost 500 pages.\n  Here we are going to be asked to vote on cloture on this measure \ntomorrow. I hope we don't invoke cloture. I hope Senators will not vote \nto invoke cloture on this matter tomorrow. The Senate is entitled to \nhave more time in studying this measure before we vote on it. The \nAmerican people are entitled to know more about what is in this bill as \nit comes to us now from the House, what is in the bill before we vote \non cloture. I think people are entitled to that.\n  I say to the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, again, he is \nperforming an extremely important service to the Senate, to his people, \nand to the people of the United States. I was in my office when I heard \nhim talking. I heard him talking about the vaccines. I heard him \ntalking about other areas of the bill which are new to him, some of \nwhich he had not seen. He indicated they are new to him.\n  Why should we vote? I ask this question. The distinguished Senator \nmay not wish to answer it right now, but it is a question. I am within \nmy rights to ask the Senator a question, if he is willing to listen to \nmy question. Perhaps this is a rhetorical question. But why should \nSenators invoke cloture? Why should Senators vote to invoke cloture on \na measure when they don't know what is in it? Many of them did not know \nwhat was in H.R. 5005 before the August recess, and many of the \nSenators, I assume, did not know a great deal about what was in that \nbill even after we debated it for a considerable length of time.\n  The distinguished Senator from Connecticut has put most of the summer \nand a great deal of the spring of this year into his bill. He and his \ncommittee have worked hard. Mr. Thompson and others have worked hard on \nthis homeland security bill.\n\n  I will take my own time on the floor later today to say these things, \nbut I will just say this: We are being importuned by this \nadministration, by this President, to vote quickly on this bill \ncreating a department of homeland security. I think it is irresponsible \nof the administration to insist upon the Senate's acting on this \nlegislation in such a great hurry.\n  One might say, well, they have had all summer. But we have not had \nall summer. We have something new here that was just brought into the \nSenate yesterday, and we are being importuned to vote for this \nlegislation before we go out of session, presumably maybe at the end of \nnext week, maybe not. But I think it is most irresponsible for the \nadministration to put this kind of pressure on the Senate, especially \nwhen the administration has turned its back on appropriations bills \nthat have been reported from my committee, the committee chaired by me \nand the ranking member, Mr. Ted Stevens, former chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee and soon to be chairman again.\n  I think the administration has had before it these various and sundry \nappropriations bills, many of which contain homeland security \nappropriations. Yet this administration has put the pressure on the \nother body, the Republican-controlled House, not to pass those \nappropriations bills.\n  There was homeland security. There was real homeland security. If the \nadministration would just have taken the bonds or the chains or the \nhandcuffs off the House and let it act on those appropriations bills, \nthere is homeland security. If we really want to do something for the \npeople, do it fast for them--and I will go into this in greater length \nlater today--there was the chance. Instead of putting the pressure on \nthat, instead of pushing hard to get the appropriations bills through \nand get them down to the President so he could sign them, the \nadministration has instead put great pressure on the Senate now to pass \nthis homeland security bill.\n  Yet we don't know what is in the bill. We haven't had much time.\n  My question is--the Senator may not want to answer it--does he not \nthink that the Senate ought to take more time before invoking cloture? \nI respect the fact that sooner or later cloture will be invoked. But it \nwouldn't hurt--I will say this on my own--for this bill to go over \nuntil next year when we could have more time to look at the 485 pages--\nI may be missing one or two--so that we could take our time and know \nwhat we are voting on.\n  They will say: Something may happen. The terrorists may strike. We \nneed to get this done.\n  Let me say to my dear friend the Senator and other Senators and to \nthe\n\n[[Page S11006]]\n\nChair: Passing this bill won't make one whit of difference if a \nterrorist attack occurs tonight, tomorrow, next week, next month. \nPassing this bill will not make one whit of difference. The people who \nare to protect us under this bill, if we ever get the bill passed and \nget it implemented, this new department up and running, the people who \nwill be ensuring the safety of the American people under this bill are \nout there right now: Immigration and Naturalization Service, the \nCustoms Bureau, the policemen, firemen, the emergency health personnel, \nthe border security personnel, the security at the ports. These people \nare out there now. They are out there every day.\n  This bill, only for political reasons, is going to amount to a hill \nof beans. That will be all it will be worth. They can say, well, they \npassed the bill. But it won't make the people of this country a bit \nmore secure.\n  As a matter of fact, they will be lulled into a feeling of security \nwhen they will be very insecure with this bill--as much so, or more, \nperhaps, than if we didn't pass it. I am one of those who, first, may I \nsay to my friend--if he will allow one further comment and then my \nquestion--I am one of those who first advocated a Department of \nHomeland Security; I am one of the first to advocate it. But I have had \nthe bitter experience of trying to get the Director of Homeland \nSecurity up before the Appropriations Committee, and Mr. Stevens, the \nranking member, joined me in inviting Mr. Ridge up before the \ncommittee, but the President said no. He put his foot down and said, \nno, he is on my staff; he doesn't have to come. We had no alternative \nbut to go ahead with the seven department heads and various and sundry \nmayors and Governors throughout this country, and police organizations, \nhealth organizations, firemen organizations, and so on.\n  We came up with a good bill. But in that bill, we also included \nlanguage that would have required the Director of Homeland Security to \nbe confirmed by the U.S. Senate. So we said, OK, it won't be done by \ninvitation; you will come because you are going to have to be confirmed \nby the Senate, and then you will come. So the administration saw that \ncoming down like a Mack truck. They saw it coming down the track. It \npassed the Senate with 71 votes--at least 71, as I recall. There wasn't \na finger raised against that provision, not an amendment offered to \nstrike that provision; and the administration saw that bearing down on \nthem like a Mack truck, so they rushed to get ahead of the wave, which \nthey are pretty good at doing. Out of the bowels of the White House, \nthey hatched this idea of homeland security, and here it was--not here \nit is. This is something new. It came up here. This Department of \nHomeland Security had been hatched by Mitch Daniels, Director of the \nOffice of Management and Budget, and by Andrew Card, and by Tom Ridge, \nand Mr. Gonzalez, the White House counsel. Those four eminent public \nofficials hatched up this great, grand idea and unveiled it.\n  The President called us down for the unveiling. I remember, he said \nhe had to go to St. Louis to make a speech, but before he went, he said \nhe had this package. He didn't explain what was in the package. He \nreferred to it as ``this package.'' He wanted to see this package \npassed quickly and he was going to have to go to St. Louis and make a \nspeech. I seldom go down to the White House. I am not invited much \nanymore, but I am not crying about that. I don't want to go down there, \nas a matter of fact. I went down when I was majority leader and \nminority leader and majority whip so much that I got tired of going. \nOthers may have the pleasure. But on this occasion I went.\n  The President said here we have this package, and he said he wanted \nto thank the Members of Congress for their input. I scratched my head. \nWhat input is he talking about? The Members of Congress haven't had any \ninput. He said, ``I have to hurry and go to speak.'' He called on the \nSpeaker for a few words. He called on the distinguished Republican \nleader here, and he called upon the distinguished Democratic leader, \nand he called upon the distinguished Democratic leader in the House, \nand then he was finished. He didn't call on me. I was just invited to \ncome as an ornament, I suppose, one that is not often seen by people at \nthe White House.\n  In any event, the President started off to make that speech in St. \nLouis. I said, ``Wait a minute, Mr. President. I heard you say \nsomething about this package, how you want this passed. I don't know \nwhat is in this package.'' Then he said to somebody down the line that \nmay have been a Member of the House, may have been a Democratic leader \nthere--I don't recall--maybe I do, but I don't need to say. Anyhow, \nwhen reference was made to this ``thing,'' that we need to pass this \nthing in time for the first anniversary of September 11, I said, ``I \nheard something said about this `thing,' that we need to pass it in \ntime for the first anniversary. I don't know what this `thing' is.''\n\n  I kind of dismissed it in my feeble way, in that manner, saying I \ndidn't know what they are talking about, this thing, this package. \nNobody explained this ``package'' to me down there. Nobody explained \nwhat this thing was down there. So I came back up to the Hill, knowing \nlittle more than I knew when I went down.\n  I say all that to say this: Here, today, we don't even have the \n``package'' they had that day. We don't even have the ``thing'' they \nwere talking about that day. Here is a brand new animal that has been \nbrought in here--480-odd pages--and they are saying we have to pass it. \nThe Senator and I and others are going to be asked to vote for cloture \non this ``thing''--the new thing.\n  My question is, does not the Senator feel it would be time well spent \nif this Senate did not invoke cloture tomorrow, or maybe the day after, \nor next week, but would it not be time well spent if the Senate took \nthe necessary hours to carefully study what is in this new package that \nhas been dropped on our desks not more than 6 hours ago? Is that a fair \nquestion?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator from West Virginia. It is a fair \nquestion. I would like to answer it by continuing to outline some of \nthe shortcomings in the substitute before us, and then offering a \nconclusion, and then I will yield to the Senator from Illinois, who has \nbeen waiting to be recognized.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his comments and his \nrecollection of the history here.\n  Mr. BYRD. Also, the Senator has made some valuable contributions \ntoday by pointing out already some of the differences that he sees in \nthe new language. So it seems to me--I will answer my own question--\nthat we need to take more time than just tomorrow in invoking cloture \non this bill. We owe it to ourselves and to the people.\n  We are creating a brand spanking new, big, massive Department. In \nthis package, we are going to make a massive transfer of power to the \nexecutive branch. I plead to Senators that they not vote for cloture on \nthis tomorrow. At least give us another week.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator for his patience, which is a \ncustomary characteristic of his. I value him, and I am going to listen \nwith great interest to what he continues to have to say about this \nmeasure.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia \nonce again. I mentioned, when the Senator asked a question or two, \nabout the omission from the bill of the program that our committee \ncreated, which would have authorized a COPS-like program for \nfirefighters, which would be critically important to local fire \ndepartments all around America, who are already spending more money to \nget ready to protect their people from terrorist attack. I want to go \non with a few more of what I call the bad news in the substitute. The \nsubstitute also grants--it's ironic that I come to this moment now, but \nit grants the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security broad \nreorganization--I'm sure Senator Byrd will speak to this later in the \nday--with no need for congressional approval. The President would \nsimply submit a reorganization plan to Congress within 60 days after \nenactment. No congressional approval would be required, as it would \nunder both Gramm-Miller and our committee bill. Only notice.\n  The substitute also contains a sweeping liability protection \nprovision that eliminates punitive damages and provides other caps and \nimmunities from\n\n[[Page S11007]]\n\nliability for any products that the Secretary of the new Department of \nHomeland Security certifies as antiterrorism technologies.\n\n  This provision, if construed broadly, could do serious damage to \nindividuals' rights. The Secretary must simply designate that a new \ntechnology is antiterrorism-related, and the exemption and the \nprotections that are provided by this section of the bill go into \neffect.\n  Perhaps the most egregious flaw is the bill would cap liability at \nthe limits of a seller's insurance, meaning people who allege they have \nbeen injured by one of these technologies certified by the Secretary \ncan go either completely or partially uncompensated even if a seller \nwho is liable has more than enough money to compensate them because the \nprovision of this bill says the limits of liability are the limits of \ncoverage of the seller's insurance.\n  Even if, as I read this provision, the seller has assets and the \nplaintiff has proved that his or her injuries are the result of \nnegligence by the seller, the liability is capped at the limit of the \ninsurance policy. That is a significant change in tort law.\n  At various times in this Senate, I have been quite active in \nadvancing what is broadly called tort reform. This section some may \ndescribe as tort reform, but I think it goes way over the line in \ncompromising the rights of individuals under our system of negligence \nand tort law.\n  Finally, the bill fails to include a package of vital information \ntechnology reforms initiated by Senator Durbin, who will speak soon, \nand cosponsored by Senator Thompson and myself that were included in \nour committee-approved legislation. This amendment would dramatically \nimprove the way data is managed in the new Department, and that will be \ncentral to the Department's effectiveness of protecting the security of \nthe American people at home.\n  It would also improve the way data is managed throughout all agencies \nrelated to homeland security by allowing agencies to share and \nintegrate their data swiftly and seamlessly. By failing to tackle \ninformation technology management, the substitute misses a huge \nopportunity to fix one of the most frustrating bureaucratic barriers to \neffective homeland security, and it will be a shame if this provision, \nwhich is noncontroversial, is omitted from the substitute.\n  Finally, I wish to say briefly, because I spoke to this yesterday \nwhen Senator McCain and I offered the amendment, I was deeply \ndisappointed to find that the substitute bill fails to include an \nindependent citizens commission to investigate the September 11 \nattacks. How can we learn from the past if we do not face up to our own \nfailures honestly and directly and bravely? How can we reassure the \nAmerican people we are taking every necessary step to protect them \nagainst terrorism if we are unwilling to scrutinize every agency in our \nFederal system unflinchingly?\n  The answer, unfortunately, is we cannot. That is why the homeland \nsecurity legislation our committee proposed was amended by the Senate \nby a resounding, overwhelming bipartisan vote of 90 to 8 to include a \nprovision offered by Senator McCain and me and others to create a \nbipartisan, nonpolitical blue ribbon commission to investigate the \nGovernment's failures in all the years leading up to September 11.\n  In fact, the earlier iteration of the so-called Gramm-Miller \nsubstitute embraced, after the Senate spoke so resoundingly, that same \nidea for a bipartisan commission. Yet this substitute omits that \nproposal. That is outrageous and unacceptable. We should not accept it, \nand I can tell you that the families of the victims of September 11 do \nnot and will not accept it.\n\n  Senator McCain and I said yesterday, and I repeat today, that we, and \nI am sure many others on both sides of the aisle, will be persistent \nand steadfast and continue to search for and find every possible \nvehicle and method we can to get this independent commission to \ninvestigate September 11 adopted.\n  Let me now say by way of conclusion, I have tried to describe the \ngood parts of this bill because, again, most of the proposals in the \nbill, the overall architecture of the new Department, and most of the \nspecific provisions are taken from the bipartisan legislation that \nemerged from the Governmental Affairs Committee in the Senate, which I \nhave been privileged to chair.\n  In fact, in some significant ways that I have outlined, this second \niteration of the Gramm-Miller substitute has been improved to take in \neven more parts of our initial proposal. We have all learned together \nhow to improve this legislation. That is all to the good.\n  I do disagree respectfully with my dear colleague from West Virginia \nbecause I believe there is an urgent necessity now to better organize \nour homeland defenses because the current disorganization was part of \nthe cause of September 11. The continuing disorganization is dangerous. \nYes, the various agencies are out there, but as I said at the beginning \nof my statement, everyone is in charge, therefore no one is in charge. \nWe need to bring these agencies together. We need to eliminate overlap \nand save some money by doing that. We need to make them more efficient \nand, most of all, have a clear line of accountability.\n  There remains--and this really gnaws at me, and I know many Members \nof the Senate--a disconnection between too much of our intelligence \ncommunity apparatus and law enforcement apparatus, including State and \nlocal law enforcement, and that disconnection means we do not have in \none place all the information that can telegraph to this new agency \nthat a terrorist attack is coming and give us the time to stop it \nbefore the terrorists act. This agency will create such an intelligence \ndivision now. The urgent necessity for a new Department has to be \nweighed against the shortcomings and the late additions that I have \ndescribed.\n  I cannot repeat the plain facts about our persistent vulnerabilities \noften enough. I have said them before and I will repeat them. The \nwriter H.G. Wells once said:\n\n       Adapt or perish, now as ever, is nature's inexorable \n     imperative.\n\n  Adapt or perish, and that is our challenge and our choice today. \nAdapt to the new terrorist threat or grow weaker and watch some of our \nfellow Americans perish.\n  Adapt to build on our strength and our ingenuity, or continue to have \nthe American people live in fear.\n  Adapt or have your children grow up feeling that they are at the \nmercy of our terrorist enemies, no matter how strong we are in \nconventional military power, in economic strength, in cultural \nstrength, in values, rather than seize the moment and control our own \ndestiny through our strength and the organization of it.\n  A bill creating a Department of Homeland Security led by a strong and \naccountable Secretary will make sure that our domestic defense efforts \ndo adapt to this new threat. It is really a source of continuing regret \nand frustration that the substitute comes to us now not only with \ncompromises that have been made that are less than I would have liked--\nvery few of us get exactly what we would like in legislation; that is \nthe nature of the process--but that irrelevant and very troubling \nadditions have been made to the legislation, and that is the balance \nthat we are going to have to strike.\n  For my part, I have filed several amendments by the 1 o'clock \ndeadline today to strike various parts of this substitute that I think \nare not only marginally relevant but, in some cases, totally irrelevant \nto the central task of homeland security, and not only do not add but \nsubtract from the rights and freedom from fear of the American people.\n  It is nonetheless urgent to go forward and act on this measure. I, \nfor one, do intend to vote for cloture to bring this debate to a \nconclusion, but I have attempted to fashion the amendments I have filed \nin a way that cloture will not prevent me from obtaining a vote in my \nattempt to strike some of the objectionable and unnecessary provisions \nof this substitute proposal.\n  ``Adapt or perish, now as ever, is nature's inexorable imperative,'' \nthose words of H.G. Wells speak to each one of us as we balance the \ngood and bad in this substitute and decide how to vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I express my gratitude to the Senator \nfrom Connecticut, the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee. I \ndo not\n\n[[Page S11008]]\n\nbelieve those following this debate, unless they have watched it for a \nlong time, can appreciate the amount of time and effort that has been \nput into this bill by Senator Lieberman and his staff. The record and \nhistory will demonstrate that before the President introduced a \nDepartment of Homeland Security, Senator Lieberman not only introduced \none, which I was proud to cosponsor, but passed it favorably from the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee without the support of a single \nRepublican Senator.\n  There was some confusion on the Republican side as to what the \nPresident's intentions were, but there was no confusion on the \nDemocratic side. Senator Lieberman believed, and still does, as I do, \nthat a Department of Homeland Security is important for the defense of \nAmerica against the threat of terrorism.\n  About 2 weeks after Senator Lieberman's bill passed out of committee, \nthe President introduced his own. Senator Lieberman then addressed the \nissue again to make his bill and our bill conform more closely with the \nPresident's intentions and brought this matter to the floor. There was \na controversy which ensued. It was an incredible controversy because it \nrelated to the rights of new employees in this Department. I use the \nword ``new'' advisedly because the 170,000 employees of the Department \nof Homeland Security are already working for the Federal Government.\n  With the passage of this legislation and its implementation, they \nwill come under a new roof and a new title, but, frankly, they will be \ndoing many of the same things they have done for years.\n  There was a question as to whether or not we would be able to protect \nthese employees who had collective bargaining rights in the new \nDepartment. It was a contentious issue and one on which the White House \nand many Members of Congress disagreed.\n  Senator Lieberman, again in good faith, tried to find some common \nground. With the help of some of our colleagues, such as Senators \nBreaux and Landrieu of Louisiana, as well as many Republicans, we came \nup with compromise language weeks ago that could have raised this issue \nand moved it forward.\n  I say pointblank, there were Members of the Senate who did not want \nthis issue resolved before the election. They did not want the \nDepartment of Homeland Security enacted before the election. They \nwanted to be able to campaign across America suggesting that the \nDemocratic Senate had not passed this important legislation. As a \nresult, they used every procedural trick in the book. They slowed down \nthe process. They refused to have a vote and they got their way. We \nleft for the election without the passage of this important legislation \nwith the compromise language that had been prepared.\n  In many States and many congressional districts across the Nation, \nthis became a political issue. Sadly, it had an impact on the election \nfar beyond its actual gravity because we could have passed this \nlegislation, and sadly, we come today in an effort to try to bring this \nissue to a close in the hopes of doing it before we adjourn for the \nyear, before the new Congress comes into session. I certainly hope we \ncan achieve that.\n  The point has been made by Senator Byrd, Senator Lieberman, and \nothers that we were literally given a 484-page document, which passed \nthe House of Representatives late last night, which creates this new \nDepartment of Homeland Security. There are many items in this document \nthat are repetitive. Looking back to the President's original proposal \nand the proposal from the Governmental Affairs Committee, a lot of this \nis not new although many things are new. Many of us are trying to \ndigest it.\n\n  I was paging through this bill as the debate was ensuing on the \nfloor, picking out sections that raised questions in my own mind. If \none looks around the Senate Chamber, they will see a 484-page bill on \neach desk. By my rough calculation, some 48,000 pages of documentation, \nmany of which will never be read, are looked at by colleagues in the \nSenate. I do not say that being critical because, frankly, it is almost \nimpossible for an individual Senator to monitor and evaluate every page \nof a bill. We rely on staff and people who we trust to get that done. \nBut the fact is this just came over.\n  The reason I raise that issue is as soon as I finish this \npresentation, I am going to propose a second-degree amendment to \nSenator Lieberman's amendment which relates to an issue that is \ncompletely ignored in this 484-page bill on the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  To give a little background, on September 11, 2001, I was in a \nmeeting in this building when word came that we had to evacuate because \nof the planes flying into the World Trade Center. With hundreds of \nothers, I raced down the steps of the Capitol on to the lawn outside. \nWe stood there, not knowing quite what to do next. I heard a sonic boom \nas we scrambled the fighter jets over Washington, DC, to prepare for \nfurther attack. We could see on the other side of the Capitol the black \nsmoke billowing out of the Pentagon. Many of us who are entrusted with \nthe responsibilities of serving in Congress were bewildered as to what \nhad happened to our country and wondered what we could do, as \nindividual Senators and Congressmen, to make it safer. I thought about \nit long and hard, and there is one area on which I decided to focus. I \ndo not profess great expertise when it comes to first response in \nfighting terrorism, but the one omission I found that needed to be \naddressed in the administration of our Government was the information \ntechnology systems, the computer systems used by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  The reason I had been alerted to this problem was that in a hearing \nin the Senate Judiciary Committee a few weeks before September 11 we \nbrought in the Federal Bureau of Investigation and, among other things, \nasked them about the state of their computers.\n  I am sorry to report to the Senate and those following this debate \nthat the computer systems in the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the \npremier law enforcement agency in the United States of America, is \ndisgraceful. It reflects a mentality within that agency that has \nresisted change, resisted new technology and, as a result, is currently \noperating with computer systems that small businesses in my hometown of \nSpringfield, IL, would reject out of hand as archaic.\n  I dare say, we could bring in from anyplace in the United States a \ngrade school student who is familiar with computers and they would find \nthe FBI computer system laughable. What they are using to fight crime \nin the United States, to track down terrorism around the world, is \noutclassed by computers that can be purchased off the shelf at Sears, \nBest Buy, and Radio Shack. As hard as that may be to believe, it is a \nfact.\n  I also might add that we came to learn that the computer systems of \nthe major agencies which we are depending on to protect America cannot \ncommunicate with one another. Would any of my colleagues want to be the \nCEO of a corporation with a variety of different departments and \noffices around America that had computer systems that could not \ncommunicate with each other? That is a fact today in the Federal \nGovernment. It is a fact of life, and it is a disgrace. This bill which \nwe are considering to establish the Department of Homeland Security \nvirtually ignores this problem.\n  How could we say to the American people, we are going to create a \nDepartment to make them and their family feel safer if we do not \naddress the most fundamental issue of the exchange of information? In \nmy concern over this issue, I decided to try to focus on it. I said \nthis is the one thing I will work on. There are 535 Members of \nCongress. Everyone has a different agenda. I am going to try to carve \nout this niche and work on upgrading the computer systems in the FBI \nand creating what they call interoperability, the power of computers in \ndifferent Federal agencies to communicate with one another. I have \nworked on it for over a year. I came up with some ideas based on \nhistorical experience.\n\n  I looked back in history because others have written of this \nchallenge. They make reference to the Manhattan Project. For those who \nare not students of history, that was in 1939, before World War II. \nBefore the attack on Pearl Harbor, our scientists in America discovered \nnuclear fission. It was a breakthrough. They knew they had something \nwith great potential with the nuclear fission process. They were\n\n[[Page S11009]]\n\nnot quite sure what they could do with it on a positive or negative \nbasis.\n  Then President Franklin Roosevelt created the uranium committee to \nexplore the various scientific things that could be done with nuclear \nfission and report back. The committee, like most, did some things but \ndid not do them very quickly and did not produce much.\n  Then came December 7, 1941. The Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. \nWithin 2 days, President Roosevelt came before a joint session of \nCongress and asked for a resolution of war against the empire of Japan \nand its allies, Germany and Italy, and America was truly at war.\n  In August of 1942, President Roosevelt was reminded about this \nuranium committee. He made a historic decision. He put them out of \nbusiness. He said, we want to create a new project under the Army Corps \nof Engineers. We are going to, in this new project, try to take on a \nmuch bigger challenge. In charge of this project was an individual, a \ncommanding officer named General Leslie R. Grove. Under what was called \nthe Manhattan Project, we said to General Grove, you have the \nresponsibility to gather together in the Manhattan Project the \nscientific, industrial, and military capability of America so that we \ncan take nuclear fission and develop weapons that could win World War \nII.\n  General Grove is an interesting figure. From what I have read, I \nunderstand he was a powerful individual. In the course of several \nyears, 4 years, he spent $2 billion. This is the early 1940s. In \ntoday's dollars, that would be $20 billion on the Manhattan Project. He \ndeveloped four bombs, which were detonated over Japan, which brought an \nend to World War II. The Manhattan Project was successful.\n  Think about that when we talk about our own computer capability. I \nbelieve we need a Manhattan Project when it comes to the computer \ninformation technology of our Federal Government. I believe we need to \nempower a person and an agency to not only look to bring the most \nmodern technology to each agency but to determine how they work \ntogether. That is what is missing.\n  The Department of Homeland Security bill, 484 pages long, does not \neven envision this as a challenge to be met. How, then, can we offer \nsecurity to this country? How, then, can we use the best technology and \nscientific resources to make this a safer nation?\n  Currently, each of the agencies--the Coast Guard, the Customs \nService, FEMA, INS, the Secret Service, the new Transportation Security \nAdministration, and others--are to be coordinated under this Homeland \nSecurity Department. They each operate with their own information \ntechnology system and with their own budget. Needless to say, they do \nnot communicate with outside agencies as the FBI or the CIA. These \nagencies already spend about $2 billion a year on information \ntechnology. The President is asking for $37.5 billion for a new \nDepartment, which is being gathered from current budgets.\n  Let me illustrate for a moment an example of why this challenge is \nimportant. A few hours ago, we considered port security--I voted for \nit; 95 Senators did--to try to make our ports safer in the United \nStates. Of course, representing Chicago and Lake Michigan, I understand \nthe importance of port security. Take a ship entering the U.S. waters \nthat comes down the St. Lawrence Seaway. It comes into the Great Lakes. \nWhat happens? Four agencies of the Federal Government collect \ninformation on that ship. One agency determines whether the ship is \ncarrying contraband. Another Federal agency checks whether the ship has \npaid its tariffs and fees. Another agency determines whether the ship \nand its crew comply with immigration law. And another agency checks for \nadherence to health and safety regulations. One ship, four different \nFederal agencies.\n  As currently planned, much of this information will end up in \nseparate systems--some of them new and expensive. One of those, a $1.3 \nbillion Customs Services project known as the automated commercial \nenvironment, is an import processing system. Another, the student \nexchange and visitor information system, is being developed by the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service. Other border protection is held \non databases held by the Coast Guard and by the Department of \nAgriculture.\n  The new Transportation Security Administration also will collect and \nhold relevant information in its systems. Think of how many different \nagencies I have just mentioned are concerned about the one ship that we \nfear may be bringing the wrong people with the wrong cargo to threaten \nthe United States.\n  Now reflect on this: None of these information technology systems are \ndesigned to communicate with one another, none of them. How in the \nworld can we assure the American people of their safety when we are \ndealing with such archaic standards, when we are ignoring the most \nbasic requirement--that these agencies work together and share \ninformation? This bill, 484 pages in length, ignores this challenge. We \ncannot ignore this challenge. Frankly, we have to respond because these \ndivergent systems will ultimately need to be linked to the Homeland \nSecurity Department. We need to make certain there is a seamless \ninterconnected system.\n  We have to ask key questions about the best way to ensure that the \nhomeland security components communicate and share information with one \nanother. By whom, when, how, and at what cost can the systems be \nlinked. In addition, it is equally important to establish appropriate \nlinks between the Homeland Security Department and other agencies, \nparticularly the intelligence community and law enforcement agencies.\n  Think about the ship coming into Lake Michigan from a foreign port \nand all of the questions that I just proposed. Would you not want to \nmake certain that the FBI and the CIA had access to that information? \nIn addition, the National Security Agency, Department of Defense, State \nDepartment, State and local officials, all of them could benefit by \nhaving access to that information. These links are needed because the \nHomeland Security Department will be inordinately dependent upon full \nand timely information exchange.\n  We cannot put a soldier or policeman on every corner in America and \nmake this a safe nation. But what we can do is gather important \ninformation and share it so that it can be evaluated and coordinated \nand acted upon. That cannot happen with this bill as it currently \nstands before the Senate. This bill does not even envision that as a \ngoal to be met. The status quo, which unfortunately this bill in many \nways preserves, is not adequate to do the job.\n  At a June 26 Governmental Affairs Committee meeting focusing on the \nDepartment of Homeland Security in the intelligence community, I \nintroduced the concept of ensuring interoperability, the communication \nof different computer systems in the Federal Government. I talked about \nthe history of the Manhattan Project. My premise was if we are going to \ncombine the intelligence resources and gathering of the Department of \nDefense, the Department of State, the Department of Justice, and the \nnew Department of Homeland Security, would it not make common sense to \nestablish a Manhattan Project when it comes to information technologies \nso all these agencies can communicate with one another, share \ninformation, and try to make the job more effective?\n  We have all this discussion on reorganization, but we are not facing \nthe basic challenge. Given the current state of affairs in the Federal \ninformation technology systems, it is obvious we need to address the \ninformation technology issues that are raised as part of the new \nManhattan Project.\n  Let me tell you about some of the current problems and challenges we \nface, if you wonder how we are going to make America safer against the \nthreats of terrorism. Six years ago the U.S. Congress mandated the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service to establish a database to \nrecord visa holders exiting the United States. Understand the process. \nYou are a foreign national and you want to come to the United States \nfor any number of reasons--as a student, as a visitor, for some other \nreason. You go through the Immigration and Naturalization Service and a \nvisa is offered to you through our consulates overseas. That is \nrecorded. That is part of their database.\n  We then said to the INS we want you to make a record of those leaving \nthe\n\n[[Page S11010]]\n\nUnited States so we have, at any given time, an inventory of people who \nare visa holders in our country. It makes sense. If you don't do that, \nfrankly, you are turning loose visa holders with no accountability as \nto whether they overstayed the legally permitted period for their visa \nor something else.\n  Six years ago we said to the INS, come up with a database that will \nrecord the exit dates of visa holders. We received a report a few \nmonths ago from the Director General that, despite 6 years of effort, \nthe INS is unable and incapable of creating this database. Think about \nthat for a second, about making America safer, about visa holders and \npeople coming into this country. We have been unable in a 6-year period \nof time to establish that database.\n  Let me give you one other illustration. Both the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation and the Immigration and Naturalization Service collect \nfingerprints. They, of course, do that in the course of law \nenforcement, in the course of people visiting the United States. Three \nyears ago we said to these two agencies, the INS and the FBI, combine \nthe fingerprint database. We want to know if you have a person who is a \ncriminal suspect who also may be out of status with the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service. We want to put that information together into \none single database of fingerprints available to law enforcement in the \nUnited States. Three years later, still it has not been done.\n  As we look at the challenges we face, it is one thing to move the \nboxes around on the chart, to talk about a new Department of Homeland \nSecurity with 170,000 employees, but it is quite another to make \ncertain that when these employees sit down at their desks in their \noffices, they have computer capability to literally protect America. \nThis bill does not address that.\n  This is our Department of Homeland Security. It is being given to us \nby the House, which will soon adjourn without any effort to address \nthis challenge.\n  An article in the July 27 edition of Fortune magazine also ascribes \nsuch a styling to the concept, pointing out:\n\n       There is an abundance of breathtakingly versatile \n     technology available to counter the menace of terrorist \n     attacks at home. Now for the bad news: Computers are only as \n     smart as the bureaucrats who use them.\n\n  This is Fortune magazine speaking.\n\n       It may require a Manhattan Project of social engineering to \n     induce agencies that have traditionally viewed each other \n     mostly as rivals for budget dollars to reach out and hold \n     hands.\n\n  At the hearing which we held before the Government Affairs Committee, \nI asked several of our witnesses to comment. One of the witnesses was \nGEN Hughes, LTG Patrick Hughes, U.S. Army, retired, former director of \nthe Defense Intelligence Agency, 1996 to 1999. I talked to him about \nwhat I have just said in my opening remarks here. Here is what he \nsaid--first replying. General Hughes said to me:\n\n       First, your characterization of this problem is, in my \n     view, right, but it is not about technology. The technology \n     to do the things that you are talking about wanting to do is \n     present and available. It is about parochial interests, \n     managing and constructing the technology for their own \n     purposes, as opposed to the synergistic, larger effect of \n     mission support across the government.\n\n  This man, who for 3 years had the responsibility in the Defense \nIntelligence Agency, knows what the problem is. He knows, \nunfortunately, that it is a problem that is not addressed by this \nDepartment of Homeland Security proposal. The amendment which I propose \nto create a Manhattan Project through the Department of Management and \nBudget had the bipartisan cosponsorship of Senator Lieberman, who was \non the floor earlier, as well as Senator Thompson, who is here. It was \nadded to the bill by unanimous consent of all members of committee. \nSection 171 of the committee-approved legislation requires the Director \nof the Office of Management and Budget to develop a comprehensive \nenterprise architecture for information systems of agencies related to \nhomeland security.\n  It calls for designating a key official at OMB, approved by the \nPresident, whose primary responsibility is to carry out the duties of \nthe Director. This is our General Grove. This would be our Manhattan \nProject. The President would have the last word on this person and the \nresponsibilities he would have to execute. OMB must make sure agencies \nimplement the plan and regularly submit status and progress reports to \nCongress, as they should.\n  The enterprise architecture and resulting systems must be designed so \nthey can achieve interoperability between and among Federal agencies \nresponsible for homeland security and homeland defense, whether inside \nor adjunct to the new Department.\n  These systems must be capable of quick deployment. These must be \nreadily upgraded with improved technologies. Effective security \nmeasures must be maintained as well.\n  The OMB director and Secretary of the new Department shall also \nfacilitate interoperability between information systems of Federal, \nState, and local agencies responsible for homeland defense. This is a \ncommon complaint. I have heard it from the City of Chicago and other \nagencies across my home State, that the whole question of homeland \nsecurity has to work its way down to the first responders at the local \nlevel, as does the information. This bill, sadly, does not address that \nbecause it does not include the amendment which I proposed in \ncommittee.\n  Enterprise architectures require systematically thinking through the \nrelationship between operations and underlying information \ntechnologies. Used increasingly by industry and some governments, they \ncan reduce redundancies, modernize operations, and improve program \nperformance.\n  Historically, Federal agencies have developed information systems in \nwhat you call, euphemistically, parochial stovepipes with little or no \nthought about communication with other agencies. Agencies vital to \nhomeland security are currently plagued by outdated technology, poor \ninformation security, and, unfortunately, not the necessary motivation \nto make the positive change.\n  An article appearing in this month's issue of Government Executive \nmagazine captured the problem. Let me give you just a few words from \nthat article, if I might. This is from Government Executive, September, \n2002:\n\n       When a computer mistakes a 70-year-old black woman for a \n     28-year-old white man who is a triple murder suspect on the \n     FBI's terrorist group list, something is wrong with the \n     computer or the information inside it. The terrorist list on \n     which this person's name appeared is just one of more than 25 \n     maintained by dozens of law enforcement, intelligence and \n     Defense Department agencies. Those lists are not integrated \n     and often are not shared. We must build a system of systems \n     that can provide the right information at all the right \n     times. Information will be shared horizontally, across each \n     level of government, and vertically among Federal, State, and \n     local government, private industry, and citizens. \n     Electronically tying together the more than 20 agencies to be \n     merged into a new Department will harness their security \n     capabilities, thereby making America safer.\n\n  It goes on to quote John Koskinin. He was the Federal Y2K chief \nbrought to avert what we thought might be a computer crisis. He was \nasked to assess the challenge of bringing them together. I am for \nbringing them together. Here is a man who worked to analyze all the \ncomputers of the Federal Government and what he says is, I am afraid, \nchilling. I quote:\n\n       You'll never get your arms around it.\n\n  He believes placing all the security agency systems under one roof \nand building more systems will not make agencies communicate. He \nunderstands the challenge we face. This bill does not face that \nchallenge and that, unfortunately, is a terrible shortcoming.\n  Interoperable information systems would permit efficient sharing of \ndata and better communication. I have discussed this with a man I \nrespect very much. Tom Ridge and I came to Congress in 1982, and we \nserved many years together in the House. I was one who praised the \nPresident for choosing Governor Ridge of Pennsylvania as the first \nperson to direct our homeland security operation. I called him on this \nissue. I explained to him what it was all about. Tom said to me, in his \nown words, he believed that what I am proposing here in this amendment \nwould be a ``force multiplier.'' It would enhance our technology, \nenhance our ability to protect America.\n  This substitute which we have before us does not include that force \nmultiplier. This substitute, unfortunately, falls short of utilizing \nthe resources we have most effectively.\n\n[[Page S11011]]\n\n  It scratches the surface by tasking an under secretary with ensuring \ninformational systems compatibility. Yet there is no corresponding duty \noutside of this Department of Homeland Security with any other agency \nor any other director in government.\n  If there is a coordination of information technology within the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, there is no premise or promise that we \nare going to have this agency communicate with the CIA, with the FBI, \nwith the Department of Defense, with the Department of State, and \nwithout that interoperability, we are missing this force multiplier. \nThe amendment would make sense and fill the gap. It would give an \noverarching job to OMB for homeland security enterprise architectures.\n  I think we can all agree there is no one single magic silver bullet \nto protect America. But we have to strengthen our security. We have to \nuse the information we collect and use it effectively.\n  When you take a look at the systems, we have to consider a recent \nchallenge. On October 23 of this year--a few weeks ago--GovExec.com, an \nonline news service, reported that the FBI ran into serious \nshortcomings in its effort to capture the Washington-area snipers. A \nsystem known as ``Rapid Start'' was set up at the investigation command \ncenter in Rockville, MD. Leads called in to the center and to hotlines \nwere manually entered into a database which organized the information \nto try to find the snipers. They assigned investigators to follow up. \nAccording to the news article, Rapid Start--the computer system at the \nFBI--was never designed to handle the large volume of information and \nthe 67,000 calls they received. The system was overwhelmed. What is \neven more compelling is that Rapid Start was created by the FBI as a \nway to avoid working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation's \nexisting computer system, the ``Automated Case Support System.'' The \nagents of the FBI had already determined the existing computer \ncapability at the FBI could not handle the investigation to find two \nsnipers in the Washington, DC area. The FBI's antiquated technology \nsystems don't allow its agents to share information among field \noffices.\n  Let me give an illustration. The September 11 disaster occurred. \nWithin a few hours, we collected photographs of the 19 suspected \nterrorists who we believed to be on those airplanes. The FBI, when they \ncollected these photographs, communicated that information and these \nphotos to their field offices.\n  How would you do that if you were at a home computer and you wanted \nto send a photograph to your grandson or your granddaughter? Virtually \nevery computer system that is worth its salt has the capacity to \ntransmit photographs. But not the computer system of the Federal Bureau \nof Investigation. They had to FedEx the photos of the suspects to their \nfield offices because the computer system couldn't transmit \nphotographs.\n  Think about that. Would you buy a computer system if you were a law \nenforcement agency that couldn't do that? That is a fact today.\n  The Automated Case Support System that Rapid Start was built to \ncircumvent was blamed for the loss of 4,000 documents in the \nprosecution of Timothy McVeigh for the Oklahoma City bombing.\n  According to a recent article, only in recent months did the FBI \nstart a computer system through a project known as Trilogy. It is \nstarting to replace obsolete desktops. I have been talking about this \nfor a long time. This committee has tried to address it. We did address \nit with a bipartisan amendment agreed to by Senator Lieberman, Senator \nThompson, Republicans and Democrats in the committee. We put it in the \nbill. But it is not in this bill that has come over to us from the \nHouse of Representatives.\n\n  What I am proposing to my colleagues on the Senate floor is this: \nPlease let us depoliticize this issue. Why in the world should this \nbecame a partisan matter? The computers of this government are going to \nserve all of the citizens. No one is going to be able to have bragging \nrights--Democrats or Republicans, or anyone of any other political \nstripe. It is a question of whether we are going to put in place the \nresources and tools and weapons we need to fight terrorism.\n  The amendment which I am about to propose as a second-degree \namendment would do just that. It would take the exact language from the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee on a bipartisan basis, put it in this \nbill, and give us a chance to establish interoperability and enterprise \narchitecture across the Federal Government.\n  How in the world can we pass this legislation without doing that? How \ncan we leave Washington and say to America, ``Sleep safely. You know \nthe terrorist threats are there. We are doing everything we can''? We \nare not.\n  This 484-page bill fails in one of the most basic challenges. It does \nnot challenge us to establish the very best in computer technology for \nthe Federal Government. The fact of the matter is our current system \ndoesn't even measure up to the most basic standards of requirements of \ncomputers and computer basics across America. Shouldn't we bring to the \nAmerican people the very best in computer technology to protect our \nNation, our families, our children? That, I think, is what is at stake \nhere.\n  I implore my colleagues. I understand what is going on here. We were \ntold the House will leave town, we will get this 484-page bill, don't \nchange a period, a comma, or a single word--no amendments, take it or \nleave it--and we are going home. That isn't good. That really isn't \ngood.\n  I think the Senate has a responsibility. We can identify the glaring \nomissions from this bill--and one that ultimately has to be corrected. \nBut in the months before we return, while this problem still festers \nand looms, we are not going to be protecting America as much as we \nshould. We will not be providing the American people the kind of \ndefense against terrorism which they deserve. We will not be using the \nbest resources of our government and technology to make America safer.\n  I am hoping my colleagues will consider this amendment and give it \nthe same type of bipartisan approval they did in the Governmental \nAffairs Committee.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4906 to Amendment No. 4902\n\n  I would like to offer the amendment which I filed with the clerk as a \nsecond-degree amendment to the pending Lieberman amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4906 to amendment No. 4902.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide for the development of a comprehensive enterprise \narchitecture for information systems to achieve interoperability within \nand between agencies with responsibility for homeland security, and for \n                            other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Madam President, let me clarify one point. Recent news \nstories indicate the former national security adviser John Poindexter \nis working at the Department of Defense to develop a plan to shift \nprivate database research in fear that it might be useful for \nintelligence purposes. That proposal raises some privacy questions, I \nconcede. Another mistaken news story suggests that homeland security \nwill facilitate that kind of investigation into private databases.\n  My proposal has nothing to do with this DOD plan. My proposal focuses \nonly on making sure the Federal Government computer databases can \ncommunicate with one another when necessary to make certain, for \nexample, that the INS and the FBI can share internal information--not \ninformation on private databases--to help protect against terrorist \nrisk.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/14/senate-section/article/S11012-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       VISIT TO THE SENATE BY MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Today, I am pleased to welcome another 16 of \nhis colleagues representing countries from across that great continent. \nAs I said when Mr. Cox visited in July, this tradition is especially \nmeaningful, because although the Atlantic Ocean separates us from our \nEuropean friends, we are certainly connected--connected in beliefs and \nin the rule of law, and a commitment to the betterment of the people we \nserve and the world we share.\n  Today's visit has added significance, coming as it does at a period \nof heightened concern across Europe about the potential new terrorist \nattacks.\n  So we reiterate today our strong determination to stand together, \nunited by our shared values and by our commitment to stand, as we have \nfor now so long, on issues related to commerce, on issues related to \ntrade, and on issues related to war.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the names of our colleagues from the \nEuropean Parliament be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n  EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT DELEGATION FOR RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES,\n  55TH EP/US CONGRESS INTERPARLIAMENTARY MEETING, 11-17 NOVEMBER 2002,\n                      WASHINGTON, DC, AND SAN DIEGO\n              [List of participants (16) in protocol order]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                         Group             Country\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMr. Jim Nicholson, Chair..........

Madam President, I now ask that we return to the regular \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). Regular order.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nthe bill generally, and to discuss three amendments which I have filed.\n  I believe it is vitally important that the Senate conclude action on \nhomeland security at the earliest possible date. And I believe, \nregrettably, but importantly, that we should accept the\n\n[[Page S11013]]\n\nbill which was passed by the House of Representatives because if we do \nnot, we will not have a bill this year.\n  The House has passed a homeland security bill and has given notice \nthat it intends to depart. This has left the Senate with the choice of \ntake it or leave it. I believe that the national interest and the \npublic welfare requires that we take it, even though I believe we would \nhave a much better bill if it were to be amended in certain respects.\n  I have filed three amendments which I think would vastly improve the \nHouse bill.\n  If these amendments are offered and accepted, then there will have to \nbe a conference. The prospects for having a conference, with the House \nof Representatives having departed, is remote, and the likelihood of \npassing this bill this year would be virtually nonexistent.\n  It is with reluctance that I say these amendments will not be \noffered, but these are amendments which I intend to pursue next year. \nIn coming to this conclusion not to offer these amendments, I have done \nso at the request of President Bush who is very anxious that this \nlegislation be enacted and sent to his desk so that the country may \nproceed to reorganize the Government to provide for homeland security.\n  Earlier today, I talked to President Bush, I talked to Vice President \nCheney, and I talked to Governor Ridge about these three amendments. \nThe President urged me not to offer these amendments so that this \nlegislation could be passed. The President stated that he would be \nwilling to sit down and discuss the concerns I have and the amendments \nI have proposed, with a view to possible action on them next year. He \nis obviously not committing to accept these amendments until he has had \na chance to review them, but did say there would be full review by the \nPresident. The President said that. And the Vice President also said he \nwould review the matters.\n  I talked at length to Governor Ridge, to whom I have talked on many \noccasions. These are amendments which I have had an opportunity to \ndiscuss with the President in the past, in meetings in the White House. \nAs soon as the homeland security bill was introduced, he brought in a \nnumber of Members who were interested. I have had a chance to discuss \nthe amendments with him at several leadership meetings, and when he \ntraveled to Pennsylvania recently to campaign, I had a chance to \ndiscuss the matter with him.\n  One of the amendments I have filed, denominated amendment No. 4920, \nprovides that the Secretary of Homeland Defense, subject to the \ndisapproval of the President, would have the authority to direct the \nagencies to provide intelligence information, analysis of intelligence \ninformation, and such other intelligence-related information as the \nAssistant Secretary for Information Analysis determines necessary.\n  This language is important because it would empower the Secretary of \nHomeland Defense to ``direct.'' That is very different from asking. My \nexperience as chairman of the Intelligence Committee in the 104th \nCongress convinced me about the turf battles which go on among the \nvarious intelligence agencies. Those turf battles are endemic and \nepidemic.\n  In chairing the Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Department of \nJustice Oversight, I have seen the same turf battles going on in the \nFBI and know of the turf battles which have gone on in other \nintelligence agencies.\n  I believe that had all of the dots been put on a big screen prior to \nSeptember 11 of 2001, 9/11 could have been prevented. We knew the FBI \nhad an extensive report coming out of Phoenix about a suspicious \nindividual taking flight training. The man had a big picture of Osama \nbin Laden in his apartment. That FBI memorandum was buried, and never \nreached appropriate personnel at headquarters.\n  We know the Central Intelligence Agency had information on two al-\nQaida men in Kuala Lumpur. That information was not transmitted to the \nFBI or the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Those al-Qaida \nterrorists got into the United States and piloted one of the suicide \nbombers on \n9/11.\n  We know the computer of Zacharias Moussaoui had a tremendous amount \nof useful information in his possession which was not obtained because \nthe FBI did not use the proper standard applying for a search warrant \nunder the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. We know that a \nPakistani al-Qaida member by the name of Murad had stated in 1995 that \nal-Qaida planned to have airplanes loaded with explosives fly into the \nCIA. We know the National Security Agency had a warning on September \n10, 2001, about something to happen the next day, and it was not \ntranslated until September 12. I believe there was a veritable \nblueprint, had all of these dots been on the same screen and put \ntogether.\n\n  When FBI Director Mueller came to testify before the Judiciary \nCommittee in early June of this year and was questioned about the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act and I saw the entire picture, I \nstated at that hearing that I thought there was a veritable blueprint.\n  I do not agree with CIA Director George Tenet that another 9/11 is \nimminent. The CIA Director testified to that at a public hearing before \nthe Intelligence Committee a few weeks ago. Perhaps it is an effort to \ninoculate the CIA so that if there is an attack, somebody can say: \nWell, after all, we are not surprised.\n  But I do not believe in the defeatist attitude that we have to \nsustain another attack. I believe our intelligence services are \ncapable, if they are under one unified direction and they have one \nscreen and put all of the dots on one board, that we have an excellent \nchance of preventing another September 11.\n  While it is important to have antidotes for anthrax and to deal with \nsmallpox and to deal with the problems of bacteriological warfare or \nchemical warfare, that if we are attacked, most of the damage will \nalready have occurred. So a very sharp focus of our attention should be \nto prevent another \n9/11.\n  To accomplish that, I believe the current bill is not the best of the \nbills. It does bring all of the analysis agencies under one umbrella, \nbut it does not give the Secretary of Homeland Defense the authority to \ndirect them. If the Secretary of Homeland Defense does not have the \nauthority to direct the head of the CIA or to direct the head of the \nFBI or to direct the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency or to \ndirect the head of the National Security Agency or the other \nintelligence agencies, then we are likely to have the same old turf \nbattles which we have had up until now.\n  That is why I believe this amendment, which I had wanted to offer and \nhave discussed on this floor on many occasions, would vastly improve \nthis bill.\n  But we all know that the better is often the enemy of the good. I \nbelieve it is of sufficient importance to move this bill ahead now that \nI am prepared to wait until next year and to accept the offer the \nPresident has made--and the Vice President and Governor Ridge--to sit \ndown and go over the concerns I have expressed and these amendments, if \nwe can get administration support on these amendments.\n  There has been enormous controversy on the issue of labor-management \nrelations. This was the subject of extensive debate when this bill was \non the floor from September 3 until October 4. This Senator engaged in \nextensive discussions with Senator Lieberman, the manager of the bill \nfor the Democrats, and Senator Thompson, the manager of the bill for \nthe Republicans, as to what the Nelson-Chafee-Breaux amendment meant. \nThat amendment had incorporated the essence of what Representative \nConnie Morella had put in with two paragraphs, and the issue was \nwhether or not those two paragraphs were in place of, or in addition \nto, the paragraphs of existing law.\n  The paragraphs of existing law, under section 7103 of title 5, \nprovide that there can be a national security waiver of collective \nbargaining, that the President can make a determination to deny \ncollective bargaining coverage for national security reasons. When the \ncolloquy was entered into with the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. \nLieberman, he agreed that the two paragraphs of the Nelson amendment \nwere in addition to and not in place of existing law, and these two \nadditional paragraphs made it a little more difficult for the President \nto exercise the national security waiver; but still the national \nsecurity waiver could have been exercised and there could have\n\n[[Page S11014]]\n\nbeen harmony with the employees had that change been made.\n  Then, with respect to the provisions for personnel flexibility, the \namendment I have submitted as No. 4921 would have taken the format for \ndenying collective bargaining coverage with the national security \ndetermination and added the additional two paragraphs which, again, \nwould have provided for harmony, meeting the concerns that had been \nexpressed by governmental employees.\n  It is my hope that we will yet have an opportunity next year, in \nconsultation with the President, the Vice President, and Governor \nRidge, to have consideration of this amendment and have the law changed \nnext year.\n  In addition, I have filed amendment No. 4936, which contains \nprovisions for a Presidential override but has, as a compensating \nfactor, provisions for the utilization of the Federal Services Impasse \nPanel, and that again would bring harmony with the concerns and \nobjections that have been raised by Federal employees.\n  So, in essence, what I am proposing to do is not to offer these \namendments, Nos. 4920, 4921, and 4936; but I do believe they are \nimportant amendments, and I intend to press them in the 108th Congress. \nTo repeat, I have discussed these issues directly with the President, \nwho asked that I not put these amendments forward in the interest of \nexpediting passage of this bill and avoiding a possibility of having a \nSenate bill different from the House bill, which would then require a \nconference and, most probably, preclude the enactment of legislation on \nhomeland security this year.\n  There will be a number of amendments offered. There are already \namendments that are pending, and some of them, frankly, I agree with. \nBut I believe that the better is the enemy of the good here, and it is \nvery much in the national interest for national security that this \nSenate move ahead and pass a bill.\n  I do not like the fact that the House enacts passage of a bill, sends \nit here, and then leaves town, which is just an example of legislative \nblackmail. But that is where we are. It is not an unusual occurrence. \nAlthough we had a full month to debate these issues and to vote on \nthem, that never occurred, notwithstanding the fact that this Senator \nand others were on the floor. And I made these arguments about the \nnecessity for a Secretary of Homeland Defense to have the authority to \ndirect, and I made the arguments that when you added the two paragraphs \nof the so-called Morella amendment to the existing language, the \nPresident's national security waiver remained intact.\n  At this point, that is all history. Now we are faced with the \nalternatives of either accepting the House bill and moving on and \ngetting this Department established, so that we can make our maximum \neffort to protect the American people, or to offer amendments and try \nto get them passed and improve the bill, which will lead to the \nconclusion of no legislation this year. So, with great reluctance, I \nhave acceded to the requests of the administration. I will not offer \nthese amendments.\n  I exhort and urge my colleagues not to change the bill, no matter how \ngood their amendments may be, but to take this bill; and if there are \nmatters that ought to be changed, let's work on them next year. Before \nwe leave town--hopefully this week, but in any event not later than \nnext week--let's put the legislation in a posture where it can be sent \nto the President, be signed and become law, to do our utmost to protect \nthe American people and to secure our homeland from another terrorist \nattack.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania \nfor his statesmanlike approach to this matter. He is absolutely right \nthat the way we are proceeding is not a usual occurrence. It is also a \nfact, however, that these are not usual times. I agree with him that it \nis vitally important we move forward. We have had a month or so of \ndiscussion and debate on this bill. We have a small window of \nopportunity now to do what we all know we need to do, and that is to go \nahead and pass a homeland security bill. The Senator's actions that he \nhas just taken will help that along immeasurably, and I thank him for \nthat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak \nup to 15 minutes on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, I rise today to thank my colleagues in \nthe House and in the Senate, as well as the leaders in the White House, \nwho have worked very well together to arrive at a reasonable plan to \nallow this President the opportunity to properly establish a Department \nof Homeland Security and meet this threat before the 107th Congress \nadjourns.\n  I especially want to thank Senators Fred Thompson and Phil Gramm for \ntheir tireless work and their dedication, commitment and, as always, \ntheir very thoughtful leadership. Both of these gentlemen, Senator \nThompson of Tennessee and Senator Gramm of Texas, are concluding their \ndistinguished service in the Senate, and what a perfect way to do it, \nwith such a strong finishing kick in their sterling record of \nleadership.\n  I believe the Department of Homeland Security proposal that we are \nnow considering--the same one passed by the House last evening--\npreserves the essential functions outlined in the President's plan \nwhile also addressing several changes that will help ensure successful \nimplementation.\n  Specifically, the new provisions clarify the roles and \nresponsibilities of the Department and help form a top-notch workforce \nwithin the civil service framework. They also enhance research and \ndevelopment opportunities and protect civil liberties.\n  I am hopeful that my colleagues will come together and support this \nproposal as soon as possible. Let's get the job done. The job needs to \nget done without any further dilatory or political delays. Since \nSeptember 11 of 2001, we have all seen the need to improve our homeland \nsecurity. This matter has been debated for many months. As Senator \nSpecter said--I will paraphrase him--as far as I am concerned, it has \nbeen fine-tuned to near perfection. It may not be 100 percent of what \neverybody wants, but 98 or 99 percent is pretty good work.\n  Madam President, as you may know, I am the chairman of the Republican \nhigh-tech task force, and I am very pleased to see that this proposal \nhighlights the vital role technology and innovation play in our \nNation's war to protect the people of our homeland from a variety of \npermutations of terrorism and terrorist threats.\n  This measure recognizes the importance of information technology and \nresearch and development in achieving the most effective homeland \nsecurity.\n  There has been a lot of talk and a lot of focus on flow charts that \ntalk about which department is here and which box goes here and this \nsubagency there. All those flow charts are very interesting and \nrelatively important, but most important is the flow of information, \nthe ability of various Federal agencies to analyze the volumes of \ninformation and bits and facts and details--analyze all those thousands \nor tens of thousands of bits of information, analyze it, flag it, then \nact on it and, in some cases, also share that information within that \nFederal agency and also other Federal agencies, as well as State and \nlocal law enforcement agencies that also have a need to know that \ninformation.\n  New technologies are being developed every day that can help save \nlives and improve the ability of our Government to fight and respond to \nterrorist threats. It is incumbent upon us as elected leaders to ensure \nour team, in fighting terrorism, is equipped with the best available \nand the most advanced technology.\n  I have consistently maintained the Federal Government should and, \nindeed, must procure, adopt, and use these innovative technologies in \nan efficient and flexible manner in addressing this country's defense \nand homeland security needs.\n  I wish to briefly touch on a few of the important provisions I have \nworked on with representatives from the technology community and my \ncolleagues in the Senate, such as Senators\n\n[[Page S11015]]\n\nBennett, Warner, and Wyden, which, I am happy to say, are addressed in \nthis legislation. Again, I thank Senator Thompson and Senator Gramm and \ntheir staffs for listening--listening to me and listening to my staff \nas well, and in particular I thank Frank Cavaliere--to these ideas in \naddressing these important provisions.\n  Let me highlight a few of the more salient provisions.\n  First, this proposal protects companies developing advanced \ntechnologies that help detect and prevent terrorism from assuming \nunlimited liabilities for claims arising from a terrorist strike. This \nprovision helps ensure that effective antiterrorism technologies that \nmeet stringent requirements are commercially available.\n  The reality is that without these safeguards, the threat of unlimited \nliability prevents leading technology companies from providing their \nbest products to protect American citizens, American businesses, and \ngovernmental agencies.\n  The liability protections in this legislation are responsible to the \nGovernment, the industry, and also, very importantly, to the American \ntaxpayer. I thank my colleague from Virginia, Senator Warner, for all \nhis assistance, experience, and constructive leadership in this \nimportant aspect of the bill.\n  Second, along with Senator Bob Bennett of Utah, I am very pleased to \nsee this legislation remove some of the legal barriers to information \nsharing between private industry and the Government. The threat to this \ncountry's critical information systems is extraordinary and this bill \nestablishes procedures that encourage private industry to share \ninfrastructure vulnerability information with the Government. The \ndialog between the Government and the private sector will ultimately \nhelp identify and correct weaknesses in our Nation's critical \ninfrastructure while not compromising any of the provisions or \nprotections provided under the Freedom of Information Act in other \ngovernment agencies.\n\n  Information-sharing protections are particularly important in the \narea of cyber-security and threats. Taking preemptive measures to \ndisclose vulnerabilities with the Government will help both the private \nand public sectors develop strategies to combat the numerous and \nconstantly evolving cyber attacks threatening our Nation's critical \ninfrastructure.\n  I encourage industry, law enforcement, and Federal officials to \ncontinue to work to build trust-based relationships and processes that \nwill foster more information-sharing reporting.\n  Removing legal obstacles--which is what this bill does, which is very \ngood--removing legal barriers to information sharing is very important \nand essential, but so is building trust.\n  A national forum on combating e-crime and cyber-terrorism was held at \nthe Computer Sciences Corporation offices in Northern Virginia just 2 \nweeks ago by the Information Technology Association of America and the \nU.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia where they \nbrought together law enforcement and private sector leaders from all \naround the country to address some of the remaining obstacles to \nimproving cooperation. These are the types of efforts I encourage, and \nI am hopeful this legislation will continue to promote.\n  Also included in the Thompson-Gramm amendment is the Federal \nInformation Security Management Act, or FISMA, which will strengthen \nand protect the Federal Government's information and communications \nnetworks. FISMA establishes guidelines that are performance based. Let \nme repeat that. The guidelines are performance based so they can \nquickly adapt and respond to the fast-changing cyber-security threats. \nStrengthening the Government's information security is a vital \ncomponent and piece of the homeland security puzzle. FISMA will foster \naccountability and make sure that every agency and department in our \nFederal Government prioritizes information security and promotes the \nuse of commercially available technologies while avoiding technology-\nspecific or product-specific government-wide security standards.\n  This is vitally important in making sure we get procurement that is \ngood for the taxpayers and allowing all those who have great ideas to \noffer their programs, their systems, their products, and their efforts.\n  I am also happy to see this compromise proposal establishes a \nnational technology guard or NET Guard. This is a bill that Senator \nWyden and I introduced earlier this year to help local communities \nrespond and recover from attacks on their information systems and \ncommunications networks.\n  After the September 11 attacks, I, along with other Senators, \nreceived volumes of information from numerous companies about their \nvaried products, their systems, their programs, and their ideas \nregarding the defense of our homeland. As public servants, we want to \nbe sure the Government has the necessary structure and process in place \nto test and apply new technologies to meet our homeland security needs.\n  The new Department of Homeland Security will have a designated \ncenter--and this is part of this bill--to serve as a technology \nclearinghouse to encourage and to support private sector solutions that \nenhance our homeland security.\n  Lastly, the Thompson-Gramm amendment makes the coordination of our \nFederal, State, and local officials charged with protecting our \nhomeland a national priority. Over the last year, I have strongly \nadvocated that any homeland security plan focus on interaction with \nlocal public safety officials as they are really on the front line of \ncombating terrorist threats and attacks.\n  Specifically, I have worked in the Senate to promote the development \nat the local level of a voice and data interoperable communications \nsystem for Federal, State, and local emergency responders. Last year, \nthis Congress appropriated $20 million for the CapWIN project. CapWIN \nhas started to award contracts for the development of an interoperable \ncommunications system for Federal, State, and local public safety \norganizations in the greater Washington, DC area. That is Northern \nVirginia, the Maryland suburbs, and the District.\n  The CapWIN project is a real-life example of adapting technologies, \nspecifically communications technologies, to address and overcome \nexisting national security concerns, as well as homeland security \nconcerns in this region.\n  I again thank my colleagues for listening to me, and to the tech \ncommunity for their persistence and their positive leadership on this \nhistoric legislation. I respectfully urge all of my colleagues to \nsupport this carefully crafted measure that will help the President, \nFederal, State, and local agencies, and the private sector utilize the \nbest innovations of technology, to analyze and respond and, thereby, \nprotect the security of our American homeland.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, this homeland security bill has been \ndebated for 7 weeks. We have pretty well talked about the issue enough. \nI do believe we are on the verge of acting on it, so I wanted to come \nover this afternoon, given that we are going to have a vote on cloture \ntomorrow, to make a few comments.\n  First, I do not think anybody set out with the goal of turning this \ninto a partisan issue. We came very close to that happening. In the \naftermath of the election, I think we have pulled back from that.\n  I thank the President for that. In the aftermath of an election where \nthe President triumphed--I do not think there is another fair word--\nthere might have been some who in those circumstances would have said: \nLet's take this over to next year and I will write it exactly like I \nwant it. I think we could have all understood had the President taken \nthat approach.\n  In the aftermath of the election, he had the right to take that \napproach, but I would have to say I admire the President for the fact \nhe did not take that approach. There are not many people, after \nvalidating an issue in an election, who are still willing to \ncompromise, but that is what the President did.\n  We now have a bill that will give the President the tools he needs. \nWe have responded to legitimate concerns that have been raised. We have \nstrengthened to some degree the ability of those people who are going \nto be affected by the second largest governmental reorganization in the \nhistory of our country to be heard, but on the other hand not\n\n[[Page S11016]]\n\nhave the power to obstruct; to have input but not the ability to \ndictate. I think that represents a reasonable compromise.\n  Senator Byrd raised probably the most significant issue in that the \noriginal proposal would have dramatically transferred power from the \nlegislative branch to the executive branch by giving the President the \nability to reorder priorities in appropriations. If the Constitution is \nclear on one subject, it is that Congress has the power of the purse. I \nbelieve we have reached a reasonable compromise in that area. I know \nSenator Byrd is not for this bill, but I believe a major concern he \nraised has been dealt with, and I think his input improved the bill.\n  If I were writing the bill by myself, it would be different than the \ncompromise we have reached, but to be honest it would not be much \ndifferent. I say to people who are opposed to this bill to look at the \nalternative as we come down to the final moments before it is adopted. \nThe alternative, it seems to me, is to wait for another bill until next \nyear. For those who oppose the bill and for those who believe it gives \nthe President too much power, I ask them to honestly ask the question: \nDo they believe waiting 3 more months in a new Congress, under new \nleadership, they will get a bill more to their liking than the bill \nthat is before us? I believe an honest answer to that question is no.\n  I also believe 3 months does make a difference. Finishing the work in \nthis Congress is important. Getting on with this Department is the \nright thing to do. So whichever side my colleagues are on--whether they \nare on the side of Senator Thompson and the President and believe that \nthis is a good bill that ought to be adopted now, or whether they \noppose it because they believe it gives the President too much power--\nit seems to me the right thing to do is to finish this job now, because \nif we wait until we come back in the next Congress, it will be February \nbefore we can get to it. The bill that will be adopted in February will \nbe less to the liking of the President's opponents on this issue than \nthe bill before us, and we will have squandered 3 months.\n\n  This is an incredible issue that does not come along very often, \nwhere at this point in time, no matter where one stands on the issue, \nit seems to me a plausible, logical, reasonable, and I believe correct \ncase can be made that we should go ahead and act.\n  I am not expecting 100 Senators to vote for the bill, but I do hope \npeople will allow us to go forward and adopt the bill. I do hope we get \na strong vote. It does make a difference whether a bill passes 51 or \n65, especially when we are trying to do something that is going to be \nvery difficult and the President is going to need all the help he can \nget.\n  I thank Senator Thompson for his leadership and his in-depth \nknowledge on this issue which has been an indispensable ingredient for \nthose of us who have tried to work on it.\n  I thank Senator Lieberman. Earlier, when I was off doing something \nelse, I understand Senator Lieberman said he intended to vote for \ncloture. I think that is an act of leadership, and I applaud him for \nit.\n  I thank my dear colleague Zell Miller, who has worked with me on the \nsubstitute that Senator Thompson has offered on our behalf. I think \nSenator Miller's leadership has been indispensable on this bill. He has \na way of getting down to the bottom line of what an issue is about and \nexpress it in terms that people can understand, and that has been a \nvery important ingredient in getting us to this point.\n  I am ready to move forward. It is my understanding we are going to \nvote on cloture tomorrow. I hope after that cloture vote we could move \nto a vote on final passage tomorrow. If that is not to be the case and \nwe carry it over until early next week, then we carry it over into \nearly next week. But I do believe it is important we pass this bill in \nthis Congress.\n  The House will finish its business this afternoon and will leave \ntown. They have no intention of coming back. This is not really a take \nit or leave it kind of deal because this deal was negotiated over the \nweekend. We had broad input. We have some 53 Members who are committed \nto voting for this compromise. So it clearly has a majority, and I am \nhopeful that we will see that majority prevail.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I thank Senator Gramm of Texas for his \nstrong leadership on this issue. He is one of the most eloquent, \nlogical, and persuasive Senators who has ever served in the Senate, I \nam sure of that. The Senate is going to miss his strong voice. He is \nfierce in battle and he is magnanimous in victory. I am proud he is my \nfriend, and I thank him for his comments.\n  It does look as if we are at a point where we can come together on a \nhomeland security bill. I hope it is not done in a way that is a \ngrudging concession for some, that they believe it is a bad bill but \nmust on balance vote for it. I hope the employees who are going to be \nin this Homeland Security Department do not feel they are going to be \ntaken advantage of or this bill in some way strips them of basic \nrights. Those sorts of things have been alluded to, but they are simply \nnot accurate.\n  This bill preserves the antidiscrimination provisions and protections \nof title V--for example, discrimination based on color, race, religion, \nsex, age, handicap, marital status, or political affiliation; those \nprotections are preserved. Those were never at issue. Protection from \npolitical coercion, a basic right that is set forth in title V, is \npreserved. Fair competition for employment is preserved, protection \nfrom nepotism whistleblower protection is preserved. Those rights are \nnot trampled upon in any way. Workers are not being deprived of those \nrights. Veterans preference provisions are preserved. Equal pay for \nequal work provisions are preserved.\n\n  I hope we do not go down this road together, but still separate, in \nour feeling for the need for this bill because we feel in some way we \ncan still draw lines between management and workers and play on any \nhostility or misunderstanding that might be out there. It is not based \nupon reality. It is based upon a recognition that our Government is \nsimply not working very well in some areas, in some basic provisions. \nMany of our departments have troubles.\n  Senator Durbin, with whom I will engage in a colloquy shortly \nconcerning some technology provisions, is absolutely right when he \ntalks about the problems our Government has with regard to getting our \ncomputers to talk to each other. This is simply another example of our \nGovernment not working very well. We have spent billions of dollars in \nthe IRS trying to get the computers to talk to each other, to upgrade \nthem and incorporate technology capabilities that private industry has \nemployed for a long time. We had great difficulty in doing that. That \nis one small area of the problem. The other side of that problem coin \nhas to do with personnel.\n  When the IRS was in such bad shape, we gave them additional \nflexibility to pay people more, to go outside the personnel rules and \npay people more and give them more flexibility as to who they could \nhire. That is the sort of thing you do to solve the problem. Do not \njust identify the problem; try to solve the problem.\n  In department after department, agency after agency, we have looked \nat the problems our Government has as it grows, as the bureaucracy \ngrows, and we get bogged down and cannot hire the people we need and we \ncannot fire the people we do not need. We get bogged down in endless \ndisputes over minute matters such as smoking facilities and the color \nof the carpets in offices and things of that nature. We have given \nflexibilities to get around those things. That is what we are doing in \nthis bill.\n  It is not a heavy-handed cram down that violates people's rights. It \nis simply a response to the fact that this Nation is in a different era \nnow. We recognize the difference we are in, the different threat this \nNation faces, one that it has never faced before. We are not fearful of \nvast armies and tanks and battalions rushing across Europe anymore and \nthreatening our friends and our troops in that part of the world. It is \nmuch more insidious and much more dangerous than that, where a handful \nof people with modern technology can destroy the lives of thousands of \npeople. We are just in the baby steps phase of even beginning to deal \nwith that.\n\n[[Page S11017]]\n\n  That is what the homeland security bill is about. It is taking the \nfirst baby step to organize ourselves to deal with that. We have a big \nbattleship of a government and we are trying to turn it around a little \nbit. Oftentimes it is wasteful, inefficient. As Senator Durbin points \nout, the computers cannot talk to each other. We have all the things \nthat make it difficult to face the high-tech threats we are facing. \nThat is what homeland security is all about.\n  We simply cannot exist in this environment in the world when, while \nwe are the world's superpower, we are also the world's supertarget. We \ncannot exist the same way we have in times past, being willing to pay a \nfew billion here and a few billion there because of waste and \ninefficiency in government, knowing things may not work--so be it--and \nwe simply add another bureaucracy on top of that, have another \nelection, and spend a few more billion dollars and absorb it because of \nour economic strength. We cannot do that anymore. We have to do things \ndifferently.\n\n  It goes back to equipment, computers, technology, and personnel and \nthe flexibility to use and interchange those things to meet the modern \nconditions we are facing. We cannot go along anymore with a system that \ntakes 6 months to hire someone and 18 months to fire someone. That does \nnot work. Where, if you want to transfer someone to the front and get \nyour best people in certain crucial places you have endless appeal \nrights that take years to resolve. We cannot do that anymore. It is not \na matter of trying to take advantage of someone, it is a matter of \ntrying to protect this country. That is what this is all about.\n  I hope this is not viewed as a take-it-or-leave-it proposition that \nhas not been compromised. Some have said this is not a compromise, this \nis an agreement--meaning, apparently, the President was not willing to \nbend; or our side was not willing to compromise in any way, but we did \nagree to disagree and we are going to vote for the bill. That is the \nway I interpret that. It should not be that way. I don't think that is \na justifiable response to the situation.\n  Going back to the beginning of this legislation, we must go back to \nSenator Lieberman. Senator Lieberman began this process. He should get \ngreat credit for that. He and a few others heightened our awareness to \nthe need to take a different look. It was in the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, the committee that deals with Government organizations and \nreorganizations. Goodness knows, many Members have known the whole \nGovernment has needed a reorganization for many years. He said we \nshould look at a reorganization with regard to the parts of Government \nregarding homeland security. We did not agree on exactly how to do \nthat.\n  We had several hearings. We had committee consideration. I offered \nseveral amendments as ranking member on the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. Some of the amendments simply were trying to incorporate \ncurrent law into the Homeland Security Department and were voted down \npretty much along partisan lines. We tried to negotiate the personnel \nflexibility issue at that point. We did not meet with any success at \nthat point in trying to negotiate any of those things out. Senator \nLieberman had the votes. He passed the bill. He is to be commended for \nthat. We might not be here today if it was not for him.\n  The fact is, there was disagreement and discussion and his side \nprevailed along party lines on just about every vote when we tried to \nget some authority for the President that other Presidents had. The \nanswer was no. We tried to get personnel flexibility; some of the \nunions opposed that, but I think the people support it. The answer was \nno, all along the line. This has not been a totally one-sided \nproposition from our standpoint. I voted against the proposal in \ncommittee at that time. It was before a national strategy had been \nsubmitted by the President. I thought the President ought to have an \nopportunity, at a minimum, to analyze the nature of the problem and \ncome forth with a comprehensive national strategy. That is what \nhappened.\n  This bill, today, not only is not what Senator Lieberman proposed, it \nis not what the President originally proposed, either. The President \nhad more flexibility in his original proposal than is found in this \namendment. The original bill did not have the various provisions in \ntitle V, nonwaivables. I do not think there was an intention to make \nthem expendable at all, the various protections were not in the bill, \nbut we wound up putting those in the bill. The President wanted \nappropriations transfer authority, up to 5 percent of appropriated \nfunds. The President did not get that. That is not in this bill.\n  When it came down, Senator Gramm and Senator Zell Miller, the two \nSenators who made the major proposal and response to the Lieberman \nbill, and whose work was so effective and we certainly would not be \nhere today without their work, they suggested 2 percent, the President \nbe given appropriations transfer authority up to 2 percent. We are \ngoing to have to create a new Department. We have to have some \nflexibility, some money to make these changes up to this amount. That \nis not in the bill either. An indemnification provision that was in \nGramm-Miller, that is not in this bill either.\n\n  So there are things that each side wanted that are not in this bill. \nIt has been compromised and discussed all along the way. It is true \nthat somewhere along the line someone has to prevail on certain key \nissues. It is true that the President stood pat, pretty much, on his \nnational security authority and took the position from day 1, and \nmaintained that position throughout, that he simply was not going to \nrelinquish any authority that all other Presidents had since the time, \nreally, of John F. Kennedy, when there was an Executive order that gave \nhim that authority, and since the time of Jimmy Carter, that there has \nbeen a statute that gave them that authority. Democrat and Republican \nPresidents both exercised that authority. It passes down to George W. \nBush, and the proposal on the other side was that there be new hurdles \nthe President might have to go jump over before he could exercise that \nauthority.\n  It made no sense to us or to the President that in a time of war we \nwould be giving the President additional hurdles and roadblocks in \norder to, on occasion, exercise his national security authority in \ncertain areas. He maintained that provision. He prevailed on that \nposition. That is the position that is in this bill, and rightfully so.\n  The same thing is true with respect to personnel flexibility. I will \ndiscuss that perhaps in some detail. We have had a lot of discussion \nabout this agreement or compromise, or whatever you would call it, that \nwe introduced yesterday, but we really have not got ten into the \ndetails of what is in it to any great extent. If anyone wants to come \ndown and speak on this bill, I will be glad to let them do so. But \nuntil that time, I will just go over a few of the provisions that are \nin this amendment that we filed.\n\n  With regard to the issue of personnel flexibility, as we know, the \nbill to create a Department of Homeland Security consolidates 22 \nFederal agencies comprising 170,000 employees, 17 different unions, 77 \nexisting collective bargaining agreements, 7 payroll systems, 80 \ndifferent personnel management systems. It is a monumental job under \nany circumstances--a monumental job. Reorganizing an agency with all \nthe vested interests and positions that involves is a big job. This is \na monumental job. It is imperative that some sort of procedure is put \nin place to enable the Secretary to create one unified Department to \nprevent terrorist attacks and protect our homeland.\n  We all agree that flexibility is needed. We have not been able to \ncome to agreement, up until now, as to how much flexibility is \nrequired--flexibility meaning the guy who is going to run the agency, \nhave to take the responsibility, have the accountability but be given \nthe tools to get the job done with. That is a big job--the most \nimportant job, probably, in Government, outside the Presidency itself, \nin light of the world in which we live.\n  The idea of providing agencies with some increased flexibility with \nregard to personnel management is not revolutionary. Almost half of all \nFederal executive branch employees already work in agencies with human \nresource management programs that operate, in\n\n[[Page S11018]]\n\nwhole or in part, outside the framework of Federal employees laws that \nare in title V.\n  I think we need to realize on the one hand that employees probably \nshould not have an equal seat at the table with managers when it comes \nto running a Department; on the other hand, we need to emphasize in the \nlaw that some employee rights are basic they are basic and should not \nbe subject to the whim of a manager.\n  An employee is entitled to appeal rights. We can discuss whether it \nought to take 5 years to get something resolved or whether we ought to \nhave five different levels of appeal. I think that is ridiculous in the \nday and age we live in now. We can do better than that but still keep \nthose appeal rights. The manager should not be the judge and jury and \nexecutioner but should have the right to manage and then some appeal \nrights if he oversteps his authority.\n  This new bill sets up a consultation process for the creation of a \nhuman resources management system. It sets four steps management must \ntake in order to create the new system. There is detailed language that \nprovides for a preimplementation congressional notification, \nconsultation, and mediation process the Department must go through, \ninvolving the management and employees of the Department, the Office of \nPersonnel Management, Congress, Federal employee unions, and the \nFederal Mediation and Conciliation Service. So there is quite an \nelaborate process of consultation and even mediation where these views \nhave an opportunity to be aired.\n  It is not all one sided. Sometimes reasonable people can actually sit \ndown and modify their views when they have a chance to talk. It is not \nas if all the employees are going to look at it the same way. If I were \na good employee, the way most of the employees are, and I were offered \nthe opportunity of my management, my Department, having some more \nflexibility so that I could move more toward the things I am interested \nin and good at, that had a chance of higher pay and more recognition \nand a more significant mission, such as homeland security, but in \nexchange I had to agree that if I did something that caused \ndisciplinary action I would only have, let's say, three levels of \nappeal instead of five, I think I would take that deal. I think most \nemployees would take that deal.\n\n  In the first place, the overwhelming number of employees do not even \nget in that position because they are good employees. This is not \nsomething about which most employees are going to be concerned. I think \nit is going to be something most employees will embrace, if some of \ntheir leadership will be honest with them about what this is all about.\n  We are not talking about lower pay. We are talking about potentially \nhigher pay. We cannot get good technicians in the modern marketplace to \nwork for the Government at the salaries we are paying now. We are going \nto have to do better.\n  There is good news in this bill. It is not an onerous thing, looking \nfor a way to fire a bunch of people. That would never work. Natural \nattrition is going to take a tremendous toll on Federal employees \nanyway. We are going to be looking for good people. But a manager \nsimply has to have the right in any kind of organization, especially \none this big, especially one this complex, especially one that has this \ntroublesome track record that so many of our Departments and Agencies \nalready have--a manager must have some flexibility. We cannot \nincorporate the mess we have created in so many areas of Government \ninto homeland security.\n  We have a golden opportunity to take the first steps toward doing \nsomething different, doing something right, something that can be a \ntemplate, an example for other parts of government.\n  Also in this amendment is a provision concerning reorganization \nauthority. It is important for Congress to consider granting the \nSecretary the ability to make programmatic reorganizations within the \nDepartment. It will take many years for the Department to get up and \nrunning efficiently. There may be many instances, for example, in which \nthe various functions within the Department can be consolidated in \norder to eliminate overlap and duplication.\n  If you listen to GAO, and you ever read any of those reports--and you \ncould fill this room to the ceiling with GAO reports talking about \ninefficiency, waste, fraud, abuse, overlap and duplication, year after \nyear, Department after Department after Department. But in order to \ndeal with this, a manager ought to have a right to do some \nconsolidation.\n  While waiting for Congress, both Houses, with its 88 committees and \nsubcommittees of jurisdiction, to hold hearings, introduce legislation, \nconsider their proposal in subcommittee and committee, debate on the \nissue, vote, and then hold a conference on the legislation, it is \nimportant the Secretary be able to implement these changes in a timely \nmanner.\n  Gramm-Miller was somewhat broader. The Secretary could go outside the \nagency, reporting to Congress. This does not allow going outside an \nagency. But it does not require a report to Congress. So there is an \nadjustment there. There is a compromise there. There is another \nindication that this is not a cram-down. This is the product of serious \ndiscussions back and forth, just as was Gramm-Miller. That whole \nprocess was a product of Senator Gramm and Senator Miller and others of \nus sitting down across tables and working out minute details.\n  That work product, which is the basis of where we are today, was \nmoved further toward the positions of some of our other colleagues in \norder to get something that people not only could grudgingly support \nbut something they really thought was a good product and still got the \njob done.\n  You can always compromise and get an agreement just about on anything \nif it is meaningless enough and inconsequential enough. That is not the \nonly key--getting a deal. The key is to get a deal that will get the \njob done and people can feel good about.\n  The bill before us today would enable the Secretary to initiate an \ninternal reorganization that would reallocate functions among the \noffices of the Department so long as the Secretary submits a \ncomprehensive reorganization plan to Congress.\n  I think this language goes a long way toward giving the Secretary the \nflexibility needed to ensure the long-term viability of this new \nDepartment.\n  Procurement flexibility is another important area. It is important \nthroughout Government. It is especially important here. All of these \nproblems need to be looked at with a magnifying glass. All these \nproblems we see in these other areas--all of these, well, we need to do \nbetter here or there--become really magnified when you realize a \nhandful of people with modern technology can murder tens of thousands \nor hundreds of thousands of people when you consider the vast ranging \ninfrastructure that we have which is 90 to 95 percent in private hands. \nIt is not something the Government can turn a switch and change \novernight. When you consider that, all of these difficulties that we \nhave had become greatly magnified.\n  Procurement is another issue that, for many years, we have accepted \nthat the Federal Government has paid a premium, both in dollars and in \ntime spent for goods and services it buys solely because of the unique \nrequirements it places on contractors.\n  While the Federal procurement system has been streamlined and \nsimplified over the last several years, much redtape and barriers still \nexist. This is due in part to trying to maintain the proper balance \nbetween an efficient procurement system and accountability when \nspending taxpayer dollars.\n  Last year, Congress provided the Defense Department with the \nauthority to quickly and efficiently purchase the most high-tech and \nsophisticated products and services in support of the warfighter. I am \npleased that the present bill includes provisions giving the Department \nof Homeland Security similar authority in its efforts to defend against \nterrorism and provide flexibility to buy technologies or products that \nare cutting edge but that may not have made it through the commercial \nmarketplace yet.\n  Further, the bill also includes language that gives similar \nflexibilities to Federal agencies Governmentwide to support \nantiterrorism efforts and to defend against biological, chemical, \nradiological, or other technology attacks. Although these \nGovernmentwide flexibilities are more limited than those\n\n[[Page S11019]]\n\nprovided for in the new Department, all agencies of Government will be \nable to better avail themselves of the most sophisticated technologies \nin order to successfully fight against terrorism--one of the things \nSenator Durbin was talking about just a while ago.\n  The bill before us today includes a provision that requires the \nSecretary to develop and submit to Congress a plan for consolidating \nand coallocating the more than 1,000 field offices that will fall under \nthe new Department's jurisdiction. Previous versions of the legislation \nrequired the Secretary to come back to Congress to ask permission to \nchange these field offices. The language in this bill is more \nproactive, requiring the Secretary to take the initiative to come up \nwith a way to unify the Department's front line of defense.\n\n  As to congressional oversight structure, we know what the situation \nis there. We have to have a sense of the Senate. Congress is beginning \nto acknowledge the obvious. As I mentioned before, the Department of \nHomeland Security will have 88 committees and subcommittees claiming \njurisdiction over various aspects of this Department. It is bad enough \nfor departments that must answer to two or three different committees. \nI can't imagine how much energy will have to be focused on reporting to \nCongress rather than to the Department. That oversight responsibility \nis important. It is just not the amount; it is the quality of it.\n  There is a provision in this bill for a sense of Congress rather than \nan actual requirement for Congress to revise its committee structure. \nThat at least is a step in the right direction and an acknowledgment \nthat Congress really should address the question of revising its \ncommittee structure and doing something about the fact that there are \n88 committees and subcommittees that deal with this matter. That is not \ngoing to work. I think Congress would acknowledge that.\n  Another issue that is important to highlight is the compromise \nproposal for securing our Nation's borders.\n  There has been little dispute that the Immigration and Naturalization \nService needs much improvement. On the one hand, there have been \nproblems with INS enforcement functions and ensuring that those who may \nwant to enter the United States to do us harm are not admitted. On the \nother hand, the INS has experienced big problems in backlogs in the \nprocessing of applications for visas and other immigration benefits for \nthose qualified aliens who lawfully want to enter the country. So we \nhave a law enforcement function and a services function.\n  This bill both strengthens the INS functions and promotes a stronger \nborder. It places all of the INS enforcement functions, including \nBorder Patrol inspections, within the Border and Transportation \nSecurity Director. This will allow the Border Under Secretary to \neffectively coordinate immigration efforts at the border with Customs \nand the Transportation Security Administration allowing the Department \nto create a seamless border.\n  In addition, it establishes a bureau of citizenship and immigration \nservices which will report directly to the Deputy Secretary.\n  The services part is not getting lost in the shuffle. It is important \nand will report directly to the Deputy Secretary.\n  This bureau will focus on immigration service, including the \nprocessing of visas and naturalization applications and administering \nother immigration benefits. The separating and restructuring of the \nimmigration enforcement and service functions within this new \nDepartment will help establish the framework for increased security at \nour borders, as well as improve services for lawful immigrants.\n  I picked up the New York Times this morning, and I read a story that \nstarts out as follows:\n\n       ``The Immigration and Naturalization Service has begun an \n     internal review to determine how a man suspected of having \n     ties to the Islamic radical group Hezbullah was able to \n     become a naturalized United States citizen,'' several agency \n     officials said yesterday.\n\n  There is story after story after story. We must--must--do better, and \nhopefully this will be a significant step in the right direction.\n  During my tenure on the Governmental Affairs Committee, I spent a lot \nof time on legislation and oversight to protect the security of Federal \ncomputers and information systems. Senator Lieberman and I worked very \nclosely together in this regard for some years. I am pleased that this \nbill includes the Federal Information Security Management Act which \nwill require Federal agencies to utilize information security best \npractices to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of \nFederal information systems. This language builds on and makes \npermanent the foundation laid by the Government Information Security \nReform Act, a relatively new law which Senator Lieberman and I \nsponsored, which requires every Federal agency to develop and implement \nsecurity policies that include risk assessments, risk-based policies, \nsecurity awareness training, and periodic reviews.\n\n  Now, that sounds like a big mouthful that is hard to understand, but \nwhat it means is our computers are very vulnerable to cyber-attack. As \na part of our infrastructure, it is very vulnerable. A lot of people \nthink the next big attack, if we ever have one in this country, will be \npreceded by this kind of cyber-attack. We must do more and do better in \nthat regard.\n  At a time when uncertainty threatens confidence in our Nation's \npreparedness, the Federal Government must make information security a \npriority. The language in this bill is vitally important to accomplish \nthis objective.\n  Law enforcement authority for inspectors general may seem like a \nsmall item, but it is an important item, and it is a part of an even \nmore important thing; that is, the homeland security bill itself. I am \npleased this bill includes a provision, which again Senator Lieberman \nand I sponsored, to codify law enforcement authority for certain \nPresidentially appointed inspectors general.\n  In the wake of September 11, the FBI is diverting resources and \nagents to fight against terrorism like we have never seen before. As a \nresult, the Bureau will rely even more heavily on the work of \ninspectors general to investigate fraud and other crimes in the Federal \nGovernment. This provision will ensure that the IGs have the tools they \nwill need to carry out these investigations.\n  Now, this is not exactly the bill I would have drafted myself. I \nthink almost anybody who speaks on behalf of it would say that. Some \nwould say that is an earmark of a good bill. Some would say that is an \nearmark not of something that is being forced down folks' throats but \nis the earmark of something that has been compromised and worked out.\n  The intelligence issue is an extremely important one. How do we \nhandle the intelligence issue with regard to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity? It is a big issue. It is a big problem.\n  Throughout this process, there have been a couple of different \napproaches to the creation of an intelligence directorate for the new \nDepartment. Some have sought to create a superintelligence agency that \ncould direct other agencies that would be responsible for connecting \nthe counterterrorism dots. It is a complicated problem.\n  We talk about connecting the dots. If the dots had been connected and \nhad been there on the board for one person to connect, we would have \navoided 9/11. The problem with that is these dots were within a sea of \ndots. For every dot we now know was significant, there were scores of \ndots right around it that looked the same that we now know apparently \nwere not significant. So it is a big problem, much bigger than just \nputting somebody in charge of dot connecting.\n  Others, like myself, have argued for a structure much more modest \nthat would be responsible for conducting threat and risk analysis and \nproducing vulnerability assessments; in other words, look at our \ninfrastructure. We have problems enough just assessing the \nvulnerability of our farflung infrastructure in this country, and then \nworking with intelligence to figure out how best to protect it.\n  The emphasis of this structure would be on a critical infrastructure. \nOne of my chief concerns, which I have repeatedly expressed in the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee and on this floor, is that we not act \ntoo broadly in regard to creating this intelligence directorate. It is \nimperative we do not lull\n\n[[Page S11020]]\n\nMembers into believing we have taken comprehensive reform of our \nintelligence community when so much, in my opinion, remains to be done \nin that regard.\n\n  But, for the most part, I am satisfied with the intelligence \nprovisions in the compromise legislation that is before us. These \nprovisions combine the directorates for information analysis and \ncritical infrastructure, as requested by the President. It would be \nresponsible for analyzing terrorism threat information, assessing the \nvulnerabilities of the American homeland, and producing risk \nassessments, something not being done anywhere else in the Federal \nGovernment.\n  These assessments tell us of the likelihood that a target will be \nattacked and will help us best allocate our limited resources. I \nbelieve this is the proper emphasis for this directorate.\n  Still, this bill goes further than I would prefer in the amount of \ninformation that is provided to the new Department. Specifically, the \naccess-to-information provisions provided in this new directorate mean \nthey will receive all information on terrorist threats, even if the \nprovider of the information considers such information to be highly \nsensitive or not particularly useful or raw material. The only way to \navoid this requirement is for the provider to convince the President \nthe information should not be shared. If the President says this \ninformation is not to be shared, it will not be shared.\n  So I would prefer the burden be on the recipient to show a need for \nthis information rather than the burden being on the President to stop \nit, but it is not a major consideration.\n  The fact of the matter is, we are going to try this out for a while \nto see what is best. We are not going to have it right in a lot of \nthese areas, no matter which direction we take. But we will only learn \nhow we can improve by getting started. That is why this bill right now \nis so important. We need to get started and see how it works.\n  Even our Constitution, as the Framers of our Constitution knew, is \nnot a perfect document in that it would be exactly the way we would \nwant it for 200 years without any changes. We saw some ways we could \nimprove it. And that will not be any different with this legislation.\n  This provision will radically alter the current relationship between \nconsumers and providers of intelligence information. I certainly agree \nwith those who suggest the traditional means of sharing intelligence \ninformation with the community must be revamped. But I think it should \nbe done next year as a part of a larger look at our intelligence \ncommunity. I am concerned. The intelligence community is no different \nthan the rest of our Government in that you live and you learn and you \nadjust. And we are undergoing a big adjustment now because of the \nchange in the nature of the primary threats to this country, and the \nreprioritizing that is going on, and the fact that for well over a \ndecade we saw a decline in emphasis of some of the things we know are \nvery important now, such as human intelligence, such as signals, \nintelligence capabilities, and still have the same operation. There is \nmuch more out there for that same operation to collect and deal with. \nThey are swamped with information, and there are big adjustments to \nmake. I admire the men and women who are valiantly trying to deal with \nit, but they have not dealt with it well in some respects.\n  We simply have to let the chips fall where they may after we have \ndone a thorough analysis of what we are doing right and what we are \ndoing wrong, and to what extent we need to reorganize, to what extent \nleadership has to be different. How do we get the good people we need? \nHow do we keep them motivated? What should Congress do to give them \npolitical support?\n  Congress is great about seeing the horse running out of the barn and \ndown the road and pointing out that the horse is out of the barn. We \nneed to see how we can do a little bit better in terms of helping to \nresolve the problem instead of criticizing the way we have done it, and \ncausing our intelligence community to hunker down and have as their No. \n1 goal, which is the impression I get sometimes, not getting in \ntrouble, not getting in trouble with us. I think that is a good goal, \nbut it is not an exclusive goal. It is not even the most important \ngoal.\n  All that needs to be looked at. If we think, in creating this \nHomeland Security Department, and a little Intelligence component \nemphasizing our infrastructure, that we have really dealt with all of \nthat, we are fooling ourselves. That is a job for a little further down \nthe road.\n\n  I notice the Senator from Illinois in the Chamber. I have a bit more, \nbut if the Senator wanted to comment, I would be glad to relent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Tennessee. I also thank him for \nhis dialog with me during the last hour or two concerning my pending \nsecond-degree amendment which, as we noted in the Record, relates to \nmodernizing information technology in the Federal Government to protect \nour Nation against terrorism.\n  I have discussed this with the Senator from Tennessee, and I know \nfrom some experience in this body that there are moments in time when \nyou should try to find a good exit strategy which achieves as closely \nas possible your goals. I believe the Senator from Tennessee and I have \nagreed on such a strategy. I would certainly like to see my amendment \nadopted as part of the Department of Homeland Security legislation. It \nwould be a valuable addition.\n  The Senator from Tennessee and I have discussed it. He has supported \nmy amendment in committee, and I believe he agrees with it at least in \nprinciple. However, we are faced with an extraordinary legislative \nresponsibility to pass this bill literally in the closing hours of this \nsession with very limited opportunities, if any, for amendment, or \nconference committee, resolving differences with the House.\n  So what I have agreed to with the Senator from Tennessee is to take a \ndifferent approach and to be prepared to withdraw the amendment with an \nunderstanding and a colloquy between us on the floor relative to the \nissue. I thank the Senator from Tennessee for agreeing to that.\n  I believe there is a serious omission in this bill in that it does \nnot address directly the issue of modernizing and coordinating \ninformation technology. The amendment which I have suggested, however, \nadds little more to the existing Federal statutory requirement of the \nOffice of Management and Budget.\n  In 1996, two colleagues I have served with, former Congressman Bill \nClinger of Pennsylvania and former Senator Bill Cohen of Maine, passed \nthe Clinger-Cohen Act related to information technology management \nreform--1966, 6 years ago. If you read this and what they said in the \nlaw and required of the Office of Management and Budget, you reach the \ninescapable conclusion that this agency already has been tasked with \nthe responsibility of modernizing information technology in the Federal \nGovernment. The sad reality is that after the passage of this \nlegislation in 1996, it appears that little has been done, certainly \nnot nearly enough has been done to meet the challenge we currently face \nsince September 11, 2001, in terms of modernizing our computers.\n  The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is required, \nunder the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, to make plans for information \ntechnology acquisition. Note that I said 1996. The reason I believe \nthis amendment is necessary is that many years have passed with \nrelatively little progress on improving Federal information systems and \ntheir interoperability. I believe that we can't wait any longer. In the \nname of national security, in the name of homeland security, we must \ndemand that the Director of the Office of Management and Budget take \nthe steps that would have been required by my amendment and by the \nClinger-Cohen Act of 1996.\n  OMB must, in consultation with the Secretary of this new Department, \ndevelop a comprehensive enterprise architecture plan for information \nsystems, including communications systems, to achieve interoperability \nbetween and among information systems of agencies with responsibility \nfor homeland security, including the agencies inside the new Department \nand those that are outside of it but key to homeland security, such as \nthe FBI and the CIA.\n\n  OMB must develop time lines, realistic and enforceable time lines, \nthat are met to implement this plan. And a\n\n[[Page S11021]]\n\nparticular person must be designated to be responsible for this effort. \nThere has to be someone in charge of this project beyond Mr. Daniels, \nwho serves as head of the Office of Management and Budget. There needs \nto be a person who is well skilled and versed in information technology \nwith the authority, the power, and the responsibility of dealing with \nthis issue. This person has to carry out the duties of the Director of \nOMB.\n  I also believe OMB must keep Congress informed on the development and \nimplementation of this plan. My amendment would have required a yearly \nreport.\n  I am fortunate that the people of my home State of Illinois have \nrenewed my contract a week or so ago and given me an opportunity to \nserve for another 6 years. It will give me an opportunity to stay on \ntop of this issue. I will pursue this issue and others of law and order \nin this venue, while my colleague from Tennessee pursues them in \nanother venue. But I believe that what we are doing here is to at least \nserve notice on OMB that under Clinger-Cohen of 1996, they have the \npower and the responsibility, and with this new Department, they have a \nnew imperative to meet these guidelines, these schedules, these time \nlines, and to really make significant progress.\n  We need to do more than just ask for a report. We need action. I will \nrevisit this issue again in the next Congress, if significant progress \nis not made, but I trust that Mr. Daniels and members of the \nadministration who share my concern about information technology will \nput their best efforts to work to make certain that it is met.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, as I understand it, my colleague from \nIllinois has withdrawn his amendment.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 4906 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if I may at this point, pursuant to the \nagreement I had with the Senator from Tennessee, I ask unanimous \nconsent to withdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague's withdrawal \nof his amendment. As he knows, I agree with what he is trying to do \nwith this amendment. I was a cosponsor of it when he offered it in the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. I agreed to cosponsor his amendment in \ncommittee because the problem of interoperability of Government \ninformation systems is a real problem and one we have tried to address \nfor years. I mentioned the IRS a while ago as being a very good example \nof that.\n  Congress passed the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 in response to concerns \nabout how the Federal Government was managing and acquiring information \ntechnology. Clinger-Cohen built on the information management \nrequirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act. The Director of the Office \nof Management and Budget, under both of these laws, is charged with the \nresponsibility of overseeing and evaluating agencywide information \ntechnology management and acquisition. It is certainly consistent with \nOMB's own implementing guidance to expect that the Director will \ndevelop, in consultation with the new Secretary of Homeland Security, a \ncomprehensive enterprise architecture plan for information systems, \nincluding communications systems to achieve interoperability. I agree \nwith Senator Durbin that OMB should develop and meet time lines to \nimplement this plan.\n  Senator Durbin's amendment would have required a particular person to \nbe designated to be responsible for this effort. Certainly with all \nthose people they have at OMB, I am sure they have someone with the \nexpertise to be responsible for the success of this effort. I do know \nthis is something that the folks at OMB are concerned about, and I have \nfull faith that they will do the right thing about it.\n  I thank Senator Durbin for his leadership on this important issue. I \nam confident the administration hears this and will be responsive on \nthis issue.\n  On a couple of other issues having to do with our amendment that is \nunder consideration today, as we attempt to wrap up the homeland \nsecurity bill, there are provisions here dealing with the Department of \nEnergy National Laboratories on which I would like to comment for a \nmoment.\n  I strongly believe the new Department of Homeland Security, and \nparticularly the Science and Technology Directorate, can benefit \ngreatly from the cutting edge research and development being performed \nat our National Laboratories in this country--crown jewels of this \nNation--much of which is directly related to homeland security.\n  Senator Domenici, Senator Bingaman, and I have worked hard to craft \nlanguage that will allow the new Department of Homeland Security to \ntake advantage of the expertise that is resonant at our National \nLaboratories in order to strengthen homeland security. I must say, \nhowever, I am disappointed that the compromise bill included language \nallowing the new Department to select a so-called ``headquarters \nlaboratory'' from the National Laboratory system to serve as the focus \nfor homeland security R\n  I believe all the National Laboratories have something to offer this \nnew Department and that the DHS should be able to directly access \nwhichever laboratory it believes can best serve a given need. There \nshould be a level playing field in this regard.\n  For example, if the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee--just \nto pick a laboratory at random--has developed a technology that would \nhelp to strengthen our homeland security, or is conducting research in \nan area of particular interest in the new Department, the Secretary \nshould be able to go to this laboratory directly and take advantage of \nthat. The Senate bills--the Gramm-Miller bill and Lieberman bill--set \nup a mechanism to allow this type of interaction.\n  The compromise includes many of our principles in these bills but \ndoesn't place the same emphasis on this level playing field. I will \nnote that the language in the compromise is permissive; that is, it \nallows the new Department to select a headquarters laboratory but \ndoesn't require it to do so. I encourage the new Secretary, whoever he \nor she may be, not to do so. I hope the new Department will look at all \nof the National Laboratories for assistance and fully utilize the \ntremendous capabilities they have to help strengthen our homeland \nsecurity.\n  On the issue of risk sharing and indemnification, which has been \nreferred to earlier, I am disappointed the bill doesn't include \nlanguage that would give the President the ability to exercise existing \ndiscretionary authority to indemnify contractors and subcontractors for \nFederal agencies' procurement of antiterrorism technologies and \nservices. I had hoped this bill would clarify that the President, if he \nchooses, may use the indemnification authority of current law to \nprovide companies supplying goods and services to the Government some \ncertainty about the risk involved when developing cutting edge \ncounterterrorism tools.\n  The law now covers wartime products and services--certain products \nand services having to do with wartime, and they are defined in the law \nand in the bill. But there are other items, such as mail sorters, and \nthings of that nature, that may not fit into the same category I think \nought to be covered, too. Instead of the indemnification provisions \nincluded in the Gramm-Miller amendment, this bill includes some limited \ntort reform provisions to protect the manufacturers and sellers of \nantiterrorism technologies that satisfy certain requirements.\n  Under the principles of federalism on which our country is based, \ntort laws are traditionally reserved to the authority of several \nStates. I have never been one, just because I liked a certain policy, \nto federalize something that had been the province of the States for \n200 years, simply because I wanted to conform it to my idea of national \npolicy. That is inconsistent with our position on federalism. There \ncomes a point on balance where the need for the development and \ndeployment of effective antiterrorism technologies throughout the \nNation supports the creation of national or Federal standards, upon the \ndetermination by the Secretary, of the technology if it meets the \nstatutory criteria.\n\n  As time goes on, things change, certain things become national \nissues, certain things become matters of concern of even national \nsecurity. We are\n\n[[Page S11022]]\n\nliving in a different world, and I think we must respond to that. We \nmake some progress toward doing that, without wholesale so-called \nreform that would totally federalize the areas that have been under the \nprovince of States since the creation of our Government.\n  Corporate inversion is another area that is dealt with in this bill. \nI am disappointed that the bill includes language to prohibit the \nSecretary from entering into contracts with U.S. firms that have \nreincorporated outside the U.S. through a series of transactions, \ncommonly referred to as inversion. It is a very popular idea to punish \nfolks who go outside and incorporate. We would do a whole lot better if \nwe concentrated on improving the tax that caused it to happen. It is \ngoing to be part of this bill, and I wish it was not.\n  The Committee on Governmental Affairs, which has jurisdiction over \nFederal procurement policy, has not held a single hearing to consider \nthis issue and its impact on the procurement process.\n  There are consequences to what we do around here. I think we will \ndiscover there are some consequences to this--maybe unintended--and \nthey will be addressed later. So be it. One result of the language \nwould be--get this--to allow foreign companies that have always been \nforeign based to bid on Department of Homeland Security contracts, but \nit would preclude foreign companies headquartered in the U.S. before \nthe Department was created from bidding on U.S. Department of Homeland \nSecurity contracts, even if the work would be performed in the U.S. by \nAmerican workers.\n  Maybe somebody will step up and tell me how that makes sense. It is \nin there, and it is not nearly as important an area as these other very \nbeneficial sections of this bill.\n  In the interest of full disclosure, as I go through these provisions, \nI have to state my honest beliefs about them. This provision is not one \nof our finer moments in the bill.\n  In conclusion, I think we have come a long way since the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, under Senator Lieberman's leadership, first \nconsidered legislation to create a Department of Homeland Security back \nin June. I look forward to the Senate's final consideration in the next \nfew hours, days, or whatever, of this compromise amendment that I have \nintroduced on behalf of Senators Gramm, Miller, and myself. I do not \nbelieve we will necessarily get everything right the first time around. \nBut it is important that we come to agreement as soon as possible. I \nthink this bill does that and, for that, I am happy.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I come to the floor in support of \nSenator Lieberman's amendment to strike the provisions in the homeland \nsecurity package that have nothing to do with homeland security.\n  Mr. President, we are here for the most critical and compelling of \npublic interests; namely, our homeland security. But I have to say that \nwe make a mockery of our duties if, instead of focusing our attention, \nour time, as we end this session, on this absolutely essential issue, \nwe let the Homeland Security Department bill become a vehicle for other \nmatters, special interests, pet projects that Members in either House \nhave, instead of focusing on the business at hand.\n  Senator Lieberman has eloquently listed a number of these provisions \nthat have been inserted into the homeland security bill in the other \nHouse. I know my colleague from Connecticut is here to talk about \nsomething taken out of the bill that has direct implications for \nhomeland security, which makes the shell game going on even harder to \nunderstand.\n  Among the many provisions that have no business being in this bill at \nthis late hour of this session is one that offers special protection \nagainst litigation for pharmaceutical companies that manufacture \nchildhood vaccines by using the homeland security bill to dismiss \nexisting lawsuits. Now, I, along with Senators Dodd and DeWine, have \nlegislation that we think is very important when it comes to \npharmaceuticals and children.\n  We believe that protecting our children against shortages in the \nuniversally recommended childhood vaccines for diseases such as \nmeasles, tetanus, and polio is absolutely critical. Our bill would \nprovide stockpiles and advance notice so that the Centers for Disease \nControl can manage shortfalls without having to turn children away when \nthey come for immunizations.\n  There are very few public health achievements in the last century \nmore significant than protecting children against vaccine-preventable \ndiseases. Yet as we meet today, we are struggling with a vaccine \nshortage which clearly we need to deal with as soon as possible. It is \na very important, sensitive issue.\n  We have bipartisan consensus around what we should do. Yet we could \nnot put it on the homeland security bill. We were not given an \nopportunity to try to deal with a real problem, namely, the shortage of \nvaccines. We were told it was an unsuitable vehicle. Yet we find that \nothers have not shown the same degree of respect for our Nation's \nsecurity and have added all kinds of unrelated provisions.\n  I specifically want to focus on the vaccine liability provision. By \nexcluding our vaccine supply proposal, they cannot even argue with a \nstraight face that these provisions are needed to protect our children \nand protect their access to required vaccines.\n  The few one-sided provisions that have been snuck into this bill not \nonly fail to protect or advance homeland security, they even fail to \nadequately protect our children against preventable diseases. All they \ndo is protect manufacturers of vaccines against lawsuits.\n  What is really sad is that we in the HELP Committee had been working \non a comprehensive approach to dealing with these vaccine issues. \nSenator Frist from Tennessee had such a bill that would include many of \nthese provisions because he acknowledged, as a physician, that we not \nonly needed to figure out what was appropriate to protect manufacturers \nfrom unnecessary liability, but, first and foremost, how to benefit \nchildren, consumers, and families.\n  We have worked very closely over a number of months with the Senators \nand their staffs--Senator Frist, Senator Gregg, Senator Kennedy, as \nwell as Senator DeWine and Senator Dodd--to try to figure out how we \nwould deal with these vaccine issues. They have been very productive \ndiscussions. We fully expect we will reach a bipartisan resolution \nearly in the next session.\n  Unfortunately, we are now confronted with a homeland security bill \nthat not only undermines our discussions but, once again, puts the \nhealth of our pharmaceutical companies in front of the health of our \nchildren. That is by no definition I am aware of homeland security. In \nfact, it is just the opposite. It is home insecurity. What are our \nfamilies supposed to do? Many of us read the article in last week's New \nYork Sunday Times magazine about the potential link between this very \ningredient that the House has decided to protect against lawsuits, a \ncompound known as thimerosal which is made of mercury that was put into \na number of pharmaceutical preparations to preserve them, including \ninto vaccines.\n  My colleagues read the article. We do not know what the right \nconclusion is. We do not know whether this has any effect on the rather \nalarming increase in the number of children who are diagnosed with \nautism and the related problems associated with the autistic condition, \nbut we know it is a problem. Now all of a sudden, we are taking one \nprovision out of all of the hard work that Senator Frist and others \nhave done to deal in a comprehensive way with our vaccine issues of \nshortage, liability, manufacturing standards, and everything else, \nplucking one thing the pharmaceutical companies wanted out and sticking \nit in homeland security. It is not surprising I guess after being here \nnow for nearly 2 years. It is still stunning that in the midst of a \ndebate about how to protect ourselves, by George, we are going to \nprotect our pharmaceutical companies from what may or may not be fair \nquestions about liability.\n\n  Now we will never know because it was those parents of children who \nhad developed autism who were bringing the lawsuits to get to the \ninformation to figure out what was going on with this compound. Now \nthey will be foreclosed from pursuing their lawsuits.\n\n[[Page S11023]]\n\nThey will be told: Sorry, whatever research and work you have done to \ncome up with some answers--and these parents deserve these answers--\napply to the vaccine liability fund and we will take care of you, but \nwe are not going to go any further; we are not going to try to find out \nwhat really is at the root of this increase in autism.\n  It is a very sad commentary that this is where we have come with this \ndebate. As I listened to my colleague from Connecticut, whose idea it \nwas to have the Homeland Security Department, whose legislation he \nmasterfully maneuvered through the Governmental Affairs Committee, \nagainst the opposition of the administration, list all of these \nextraneous untested provisions that have been stuck into this bill at \nthe last minute is disheartening because there has been no one who has \nbelieved more strongly in homeland security and the need to get our \nFederal Government smarter and quicker and more flexible than Senator \nLieberman.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Lieberman amendment to strike \nunrelated provisions. If what we are concerned about is homeland \nsecurity, if what the administration and the President have been \ntalking about during this past election season about protecting our \nhomeland is absolutely what we are supposed to be doing, then let's do \nthat job. Let's do the job that needs to be done on homeland security \nwithout undermining other important issues that should go through the \nlegislative process to reach the kind of bipartisan resolution they \ndeserve.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before my colleague from New York leaves the \nfloor, I wish to join with her in this call for support of the striking \namendment. I am going to try to offer a couple of amendments--I do not \nknow what kind of success I am going to have--to put some provisions \nback into the homeland security legislation dealing with the \nprofessional firefighters, as well as some law enforcement officials.\n  I have letters I will read into the Record shortly from the \nInternational Association of Firefighters and from Federal Law \nEnforcement Officers Associations urging in the strongest words \npossible that these amendments be included as part of the homeland \nsecurity bill.\n  The point my colleague from New York has made, the great irony she \nhas pointed out is that we now have provisions in the bill that have \nnothing to do with homeland security. They are a backdoor effort to \nundermine legislation being developed in a bipartisan fashion. We had \ncooperation.\n  We are now being told in this bill that we are going to undo efforts \nmade dealing with children's safety and children's health and exclude \nthe very provisions that are asked for by the first responders to \nhomeland security threats--firefighters and law enforcement.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Will the Senator from Connecticut yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I am well aware of the Senator's longtime support for \nfirefighters and the work he has done throughout his career to make \nsure our firefighters have the resources they need.\n  Isn't it ironic that we stand here debating a homeland security bill \nwhich has no money for first responders, and the only money that was in \nthere they have now taken out? There is not a single penny that is \ngoing to the firefighters, the police officers, the emergency \nresponders on the ground, and we are going to leave with a continuing \nresolution that also has no additional resources.\n  Since September 11 of last year, with our firefighters and police \nofficers having faced many more challenges, is it not the Senator's \nunderstanding they have not received additional resources?\n  Mr. DODD. My colleague is absolutely correct. In fact, one of the \nthings we find--I am sure the Presiding Officer has had the same \nexperience--are simple things such as interconnectivity so that \nfirefighters can talk to police departments. One of the problems we \ndiscovered in New York, the State that our distinguished colleague so \nably represents, in the wake of 9/11 in New York City, was that the \nfirefighters could not speak to each other--incompatibility of systems. \nThey have been asking for some Federal help so police departments could \ntalk to fire departments, could talk to emergency medical services and \nget some help in doing so. That was one of the provisions we wanted. \nThat has been included in this bill.\n  It is incredible that we are faced with provisions in this bill to \nprotect--and I say this as someone who represents many of them--the \npharmaceutical companies that have objected to the idea of having to \nface a potential liability as a result of efforts to protect children \nfrom dreadful health problems. Yet the bill excludes language that \nwould do exactly what the Senator from New York has described, and that \nis to see to it we have additional new firefighters on the ground. We \nhave asked for it.\n  Reading from a letter from the International Association of Fire \nFighters, they state:\n\n       On behalf of the 250,000 professional fire fighters who are \n     members of the International Association of Fire Fighters, I \n     want to express our deep gratitude--\n\n  And I apologize we are not going to be able to fulfill their sense of \ngratitude.\n\n     for your leadership and effort in amending the homeland \n     security bill to provide for fire fighter staffing. Your fire \n     fighter staffing amendment expands upon the FIRE Act Grant \n     program . . .\n\n  And then it goes on to say:\n\n       As fire fighters in New York and Washington demonstrated on \n     September 11, fire fighters save lives and are the linchpin \n     to an effective terrorism response. Fire fighter staffing \n     must be part of the homeland security bill.\n\n  It has been stricken. It is no longer a part of this bill at all. The \nFederal Law Enforcement Officers Association efforts are also not \nreflected in this bill now. They have been trying to get some help and \nsupport and that is not in here.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the correspondence from the \nInternational Association of Fire Fighters, the International \nAssociation of Fire Chiefs, and the Federal Law Enforcement Officers \nAssociation be printed in the Record so our colleagues can have the \nbenefit of reading what these national and international organizations \nare calling for.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                      International Association of\n\n\n                                                Fire Fighters,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 14, 2002.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: On behalf of the more than 250,000 \n     professional fire fighters who are members of the \n     International Association of fire Fighters, I want to express \n     our deep gratitude for your leadership and effort in amending \n     the homeland security bill to provide for fire fighter \n     staffing.\n       Your fire fighter staffing amendment expands upon the FIRE \n     Act Grant Program to allow for the hiring of thousands of new \n     additional career fire fighters. Currently, inadequate \n     staffing is the major crisis facing the fire service. Two-\n     thirds of all fire departments currently do not have enough \n     fire fighters to meet industry standards for safe fire ground \n     operation. This exposes fire fighters to increased hazards \n     when they respond to emergencies. Your amendment addresses \n     this major firefighting hazard.\n       As fire fighters in New York and Washington demonstrated on \n     September 11, fire fighters save lives and are the lynchpin \n     to an effective terrorism response. fire fighter staffing \n     must be part of the homeland security bill.\n       Again, thank you for your time and leadership on this \n     important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Harold A. Schaitberger,\n     General President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      International Association of\n\n\n                                                  Fire Chiefs,\n\n                                   Fairfax, VA, November 14, 2002.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: The International Association of Fire \n     Chiefs (IAFC) strongly supports your amendment to Department \n     of Homeland Security bill (HR 5005) which would create a \n     federal grant program to assist local governments in hiring \n     career fire service personnel.\n       As you well know, our nation's first responders have been \n     historically short-handed on the front line in responding to \n     fire and life safety emergencies within our communities, as \n     well as to emergencies involving the nation's critical \n     infrastructure. Response to fires, medical emergencies, \n     specialized rescue, releases of hazardous materials, and now \n     threats and acts of terrorism have placed significant \n     stresses on our limited personnel. The need for additional \n     training,\n\n[[Page S11024]]\n\n     staffing and equipment has increased dramatically over the \n     last several years as the nation's first responders have \n     accepted these additional critical response roles.\n       The federal government stepped forward in 2000, recognizing \n     that the fire service's expanded role needed support beyond \n     that which most communities were capable of providing. The \n     Firefighter Investment and Response Enhancement (FIRE) Act \n     provided much needed funding to purchase basic equipment and \n     safety programs for communities unable to afford them.\n       But, our most critical resource is people. National studies \n     have shown that a crew of four (4) on a responding apparatus \n     is the most efficient crew when attacking a structure fire. \n     The same studies showed that there was not only a higher \n     level of efficiency in carrying out the department's mission, \n     but a higher margin of safety for the public and emergency \n     response personnel. However, there are few communities \n     capable of providing that level of staffing. National \n     statistics show that sixty percent (60%) of fire departments \n     operate at emergency scenes with inadequate staffing. In \n     addition, many of our members also serve in our nation's \n     armed forces as reservists and national guardsmen and women. \n     When they are called to duty in defense of our country they \n     are no longer available to serve their communities in the \n     fire department. This places an additional strain on our \n     already limited human resources.\n       The LAFC greatly appreciate your leadership on this issue.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                             Garry L. Briese, CAE,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           Federal Law Enforcement\n\n\n                                         Officers Association,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 14, 2002.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: On behalf of the 20,000 federal agents \n     who are members of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers \n     Association (FLEOA), we respectfully request that SA 4839 be \n     attached to the pending legislation creating a Department of \n     Homeland Security. As you know, SA 4839 is an extension of S. \n     2770 introduced by you in May 2002 with bi-partisan support. \n     FLEOA believes this is an urgently needed solution to the \n     grievous problems existing in the federal agent pay \n     structure.\n       FLEOA is a non-partisan professional association \n     representing federal agents from the agencies listed on the \n     left masthead. We are on the front line of fighting terrorism \n     and crime across the United States and abroad. The current \n     pay structure for federal law enforcement does not enable us \n     to recruit the best and brightest to our ranks and retain \n     senior agents in high cost of living areas. SA 4839 is the \n     first step to rectifying this tremendous problem. SA 4839 \n     only amends the locality pay for federal agents that were \n     specified in Public Law 101-509. This proposal is supported \n     by the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), National Association \n     of Police Organizations (NAPO), National Troopers Coalition \n     (NTC), International Brotherhood of Police Organization \n     (IBPO), and the Police Executives' Research Forum.\n       Again, FLEOA respectfully requests that SA 4839 be attached \n     to the legislation creating the Department of Homeland \n     Security. We thank you for your leadership on this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Richard. J. Gallo.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that we temporarily lay aside the \npending amendment so I may offer two amendments en bloc.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I would have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4951 to Amendment No. 4902\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will send to the desk an amendment in the \nsecond degree. This does not strike any provisions of the underlying \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd] proposes an \n     amendment No. 4951 to amendment No. 4902.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To provide for workforce enhancement grants to fire \n                              departments)\n\n       At the end insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . GRANTS FOR FIREFIGHTING PERSONNEL.\n\n       Section 33 of the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act \n     of 1974 (15 U.S.C. 2229) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subsections (c), (d), and (e) as \n     subsections (d), (e), and (f), respectively;\n       (2) by inserting after subsection (b) the following:\n       ``(c) Personnel Grants.--\n       ``(1) Duration.--In awarding grants for hiring firefighting \n     personnel in accordance with subsection (b)(3)(A), the \n     Director shall award grants extending over a 3-year period.\n       ``(2) Maximum amount.--The total amount of grants awarded \n     under this subsection shall not exceed $100,000 per \n     firefighter, indexed for inflation, over the 3-year grant \n     period.\n       ``(3) Federal share.--\n       ``(A) In general.--A grant under this subsection shall not \n     exceed 75 percent of the total salary and benefits cost for \n     additional firefighters hired.\n       ``(B) Waiver.--The Director may waive the 25 percent non-\n     Federal match under subparagraph (A) for a jurisdiction of \n     50,000 or fewer residents or in cases of extreme hardship.\n       ``(4) Application.--An application for a grant under this \n     subsection, shall--\n       ``(A) meet the requirements under subsection (b)(5);\n       ``(B) include an explanation for the applicant's need for \n     Federal assistance; and\n       ``(C) contain specific plans for obtaining necessary \n     support to retain the position following the conclusion of \n     Federal support.\n       ``(5) Maintenance of effort.--Grants awarded under this \n     subsection shall only be used to pay the salaries and \n     benefits of additional firefighting personnel, and shall not \n     be used to supplant funding allocated for personnel from \n     State and local sources.''; and\n       (3) in subsection (f) (as redesignated by paragraph (1)), \n     by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(3) Supplemental appropriation.--In addition to the \n     authorization provided in paragraph (1), there are authorized \n     to be appropriated $1,000,000,000 for each of fiscal years \n     2003 and 2004 for the purpose of providing personnel grants \n     described in subsection (c). Such sums may be provided solely \n     for the purpose of hiring employees engaged in fire \n     protection (as defined in section 3 of the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act (29 U.S.C. 203)), and shall not be subject to \n     the provisions of paragraphs (10) or (11) of subsection \n     (b).''.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Tennessee.\n  I wanted to offer two amendments in one slot. I thought creatively of \nhaving one amendment en bloc, but that was not acceptable, so I made a \nchoice on the two amendments, both of which are very important. I will \nexplain both of them. The one pending deals with the firefighters and \nthe tremendous need that exists to expand the workforce of first \nresponders. I don't care which State you go to, when you talk of \nresponding to terrorism, those called upon first to respond are State \npolice, local police, firefighters, emergency medical service \nproviders.\n  That point hardly needs to be made. Those who watched the scenes of \n9/11, know who were the first responders to the World Trade Center and \nthe first responders to the Pentagon. It is ironic, as we consider this \nhomeland security legislation, the provisions struck by the other body \nas they sent the bill over were the provisions for assistance to the \nlocal first responders in the case, God forbid, of a terrorist attack.\n  I wanted to include an amendment to amend the Law Enforcement Pay \nReform Act of 1990 to adjust the percentage differentials payable to \nFederal law enforcement officers in certain high-cost areas. The \nPresiding Officer is sensitive to this question, as we represent \nneighboring States. There, we are losing people from our Federal law \nenforcement agencies because of the pay differentials. It is impossible \nto meet the costs of living in certain areas of the country. I will \nmake another effort before this bill is completed to see if we can \nconsider that critically important amendment to the homeland security \neffort.\n  For purposes of this debate, the only amendment that will be under \nconsideration is the amendment dealing with firefighters. Both of these \namendments fix glaring omissions in the pending substitute. The \namendment I am offering on behalf of the firefighters provides Federal \nassistance to local fire departments to hire 75,000 new firefighters to \naddress new homeland security needs.\n  Senator John Warner, my friend and colleague from Virginia, and I \nrecognized the problem of firefighter understaffing shortly after \nSeptember 11 and we wrote legislation to help solve the problem. The \namendment is based on the bill Senator Warner and I wrote. This \namendment also builds on the\n\n[[Page S11025]]\n\nFIRE Act, which Senator DeWine and I authored in 2000. With the support \nof Senators Warner and Levin the FIRE Act became law, and has provided \nsome $400 million to tens of thousands of firefighters around the \ncountry. Today's amendment is also nearly identical to an amendment \nauthored by Senator Carnahan, which was accepted by the Governmental \nAffairs Committee earlier this year.\n  One aspect of being prepared is to have the men and women on the \nground who can put out the fires and respond to the injuries and the \ntragedies that may occur. Just as we call upon the National Guard to \nmeet the increased needs of more manpower in the military, we must make \na national commitment to hire additional firefighters necessary to \nprotect the American people on the homefront. The legislation we \nproposed would put 75,000 new firefighters on America's streets over 7 \nyears.\n  Since 1970, the number of firefighters as a percentage of the U.S. \nworkforce has steadily declined. Today in the United States there is \nonly one firefighter for every 280 citizens. We have fewer firefighters \nper capita than nurses and police officers, and we need to turn this \naround now more than ever. Understaffing is such a problem that \naccording to the International Association of Fire Fighters, nearly two \nthirds of all fire departments cannot meet minimum safety standards. \nOSHA standards require that for every team of two firefighters in a \nburning structure, another team of two be stationed outside to assist \nmen in the event of collapse. Sadly, too many men and women are lost \nbecause there is no second team outside the unstable buildings. We saw \nthis in Worcester, Massachusetts a few years ago.\n\n  I will not go down all of the provisions that emphasize the \nimportance of having the additional personnel on the ground. I \nmentioned earlier we had a letter from the International Association of \nFire Fighters, and that letter is printed in the Record, along with a \nletter from the International Association of Fire Chiefs. So this is a \ncase where you have both labor and management making the same request \nas we consider this homeland security legislation.\n  I do not want to belabor the point. I am struck by the fact we would \ndrop provisions which have been almost universally supported in this \nChamber even prior to 9/11, the need for additional personnel on the \nground to provide assistance to local communities through grant \napplications. To give an idea of the pent-up need, when we originally \nauthored the FIRE Act which was to provide grant moneys to local \ndepartments, the 33,000 around the country, paid, volunteer, or \ncombination departments, there was $100 million put into the budget to \nprovide grants to local communities. In excess of $3 billion in \napplications in the first year came to FEMA because of the pent-up need \nthat exists across the country for additional equipment, and to provide \nadditional personnel, additional training, so firefighters can respond.\n  Most Americans today are aware, obviously, that the role of \nfirefighters and EMS services are vastly different than even a few \nyears ago. Today, firefighters are called upon to respond to situations \nwhere highly toxic chemical materials are involved. The degree of \nsophistication to be brought to the trade of firefighters is so much \nmore complicated than before, as the demands have increased \ndramatically. When we speak of volunteer departments, for instance, we \nrely on the good will and the spirit of volunteerism. In many of our \nrural and local communities, people volunteer to serve. Yet today they \nare called upon to respond to very complicated and dangerous \nsituations.\n  There was an overwhelming degree of support when Senator Warner and \nSenator Levin took the bill that Senator DeWine, myself, and others \nfashioned and included as part of the Defense authorization bill. Then, \nof course, the appropriations were forthcoming and the demand was \nevident. After 9/11, the demand increased dramatically as a result of \nthe new threats of terrorism.\n  I am deeply troubled and saddened that we are talking about homeland \nsecurity and yet there is nothing in this bill, nothing, that provides \none red penny to hire first responders of terrorist attacks. How \nludicrous is that? We are talking about a homeland security bill and we \nhave nothing in here to go to local police, fire, and EMS services, and \nwe will call this a homeland security bill. The great irony, as our \ncolleague from New York pointed out, is there are provisions in this \nbill to protect the pharmaceutical industries from lawsuits where \nvaccines are developed for kids. How do you explain that to the \nAmerican public? We sneak provisions in this bill to protect corporate \nAmerica, yet we will not provide money to those who are called upon to \nrespond, God forbid, if another terrorist attack occurs. How do you \nexplain that to the American public?\n  Under these procedures we are dealing with--and it gets confusing \neven for those who have been here a while with post cloture and other \nprocedural roadblocks--I am probably not going to get a vote on this \namendment dealing with the firefighters. I probably should not waste \nthe time to bring it up, but people ought to know that while people go \naround and beat their chest about homeland security in this bill, you \nshould not be deluded by the name. The name may sound pretty good, but \nunderneath it are a lot of problems. There are things that are in this \nbill that have nothing to do with homeland security, and there are \nthings that should be in here that are not. These firefighters need our \nhelp and support and backing.\n\n  I regret I was not able to include the problem dealing with law \nenforcement, an amendment which has--I will not bother listing everyone \nhere, I will include these names for the Record--a broad-based \nconstituency here of some 30 Members of this Chamber who have supported \nthis bill, S. 2770: Senator Baucus, Senator Biden, Senator Snowe, \nSenator DeWine, Senator Durbin, Senator Collins, Senator Corzine, \nSenator Schumer, Senator Murray, Senator Warner--the list goes on here, \nof our colleagues who have supported this law enforcement provision \nthat I mentioned earlier about the great disparity in pay. We are \nlosing these people.\n  I am not allowed under the procedures to offer that amendment now. I \nwill try to find a chance to do it in the next few days, at least to \nmake an effort to have it as part of this bill. Again, I have a very \nstrong letter from the law enforcement agents, asking for some \nassistance here.\n  I don't know how you explain to people what we are doing in homeland \nsecurity as law enforcement and firefighters here are basically going \nto be left out of this bill. I regret that is the case.\n  I am faced now with this particular second-degree amendment, and we \nwill see what happens over the next day or so and whether or not we can \nactually get a vote on it, but I wanted to take a few minutes to \nexplain my concerns about it.\n  Earlier this year, of course, we had adopted funding for the FIRE Act \nas a separate appropriation. It was not vetoed, but it was tantamount \nto a veto. It was what we call sequestered by the President. He took \nthose moneys and basically said I am not going to sign this into law. \nSo the grant money for communities in Rhode Island and New Jersey and \nMichigan--all across the country--who were looking for us to be a \npartner in getting better prepared to deal with the threats of \nterrorism, I am sorry to tell you, are not included in here. I don't \nknow who you are including in homeland security, but you are not part \nof the deal. Apparently the pharmaceutical industry is, but we are not. \nWe will try our best in the next few days to rectify this, but under \nthe rules and procedures I don't think it is going to happen, I am sad \nto report. Maybe we can try in the next Congress.\n  But I am saddened we are passing a homeland security bill and \nfirefighters and law enforcement officials are not going to be a part \nof this effort, at least as far as these amendments are concerned.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first I thank the Senator from \nConnecticut for his eloquent remarks. I could not agree with him more.\n  When we look at this bill, a bill that I fully want to support--I \nsupport setting up a Department of Homeland Security and the goals \ninvolved, and have\n\n[[Page S11026]]\n\nsupported moving this forward. But as we look at the details of what \nhas been given to us from the House, it is unbelievable. When we look \nat first responders, people in Michigan on the front lines on the \nground--not only police and firefighters and EMS but our Border Patrol \nwho are working double time and triple time, and those from local law \nenforcement who have been assigned--we have been trying to provide some \nreimbursement for their overtime and the costs to local units of \ngovernment. It is amazing to me that in the name of homeland security \nwe have a bill in front of us that does not include many things that \nare critical to our security in this country but that includes items, \nfrankly, that are outrageous special interest items that are being \nstuck in the bill, hoping we will not notice.\n  We all are concerned about homeland security and want to move forward \ntogether to put together the strongest safety and security for our \ncitizens. I want to speak to one of those today that colleagues have \nalready spoken to that is a provision, unfortunately, in this bill, \nthat protects the financial security of the pharmaceutical industry, \nnot the homeland security of the people of America. This provision I \nfind absolutely outrageous and I intend to support the Lieberman \namendment to withdraw this from the bill.\n  The homeland security bill contains a provision that will expand the \nliability protections that currently exist for vaccines to include \nother components such as vaccine preservatives like thimerosal. This \nwas included in the bill with no debate, no committees.\n  How many times have we heard on this floor as we were debating so \nmany bills--I remember on prescription drugs--we heard over and over \nagain that we should not be adding important provisions that would \nlower the prices of prescription drugs because, colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle were saying, we had not gone through the regular \nlegislative process. We had not had hearings. There had not been votes \nin committees.\n  Yet now, in the 11th hour of the session of this Congress, we see a \nprovision added that nobody has looked at other than a few people, I \nwould argue, operating on behalf of one of literally the strongest \nspecial interests in this country today.\n  There are six drug company lobbyists for every one Member of the \nSenate. They certainly have earned their pay on this bill.\n  When we look at this particular provision and we look at the fact \nthat we have an industry that has stopped a bill that we sent to the \nHouse, S. 812, that was a bipartisan bill to create more competition \nfor the industry through generics, opening the border to Canada, giving \nStates the ability to negotiate on behalf of the uninsured, a bill that \nwould lower prescription prices today, immediately when passed--they \nare successful in killing that bill that passed last July in the \nSenate. Yet they are able to place a provision in the homeland security \nbill that will virtually exempt from liability a company that is making \na product over which there is great concern as it relates to the safety \nof children.\n  Thimerosal, which is manufactured by Eli Lilly and Company, is the \nsubject of several class action lawsuits based on increasing research \nconnecting this preservative, which contains mercury, to the rising \nincidence of autism in children. Just this weekend the New York Times \nran a very comprehensive six-page story about the growing body of \nevidence connecting thimerosal with autism and other developmental \ndisorders in children. While the research is far from conclusive, is \nthis narrowly written special interest provision, unrelated to homeland \nsecurity, the way to respond to concerns that relate to this issue and \nconcerns about mercury as it relates to vaccines and additives and the \nwhole question of autism in children and what contributes to it? Is \nthis the way to do that?\n  Don't children and their families merit the full protection under the \nlaw and due process to be able to sort through some very serious issues \nand to allow the courts to work their will, looking at the evidence? \nThe provision in this homeland security bill, brought to us from the \nHouse of Representatives, would severely limit parents' ability to get \njustice for their children. How is that homeland security?\n  The provisions include vaccine components in the National Vaccine \nInjury Compensation Program. It is a program in which awards are given \nand they are limited to funds available through a special trust fund so \nliability is limited. Instead, it is a no-fault system. That would now \ninclude vaccine components, which is a far broader definition than \nvaccines.\n  In 1988, Congress enacted the National Vaccine Injury Compensation \nProgram as a no-fault alternative to the tort system for resolving \nclaims resulting from adverse reactions to mandated childhood vaccines. \nThis Federal no-fault system is designed to compensate individuals or \nfamilies of individuals who have been injured by childhood \nvaccinations, whether administered in the public or private sector. \nDamages are awarded out of a trust fund that is financed by excise \ntaxes of 75 cents per dose imposed on each vaccine covered under the \nprogram.\n  This bill seems to be protecting the financial interests of a \ncompany, Eli Lilly, rather than the taxpayers who will now see, through \nthis fund, a greater subsidy, and families and children across this \ncountry.\n  What I find particularly disturbing is we are looking at a company \nwhose CEO is in the top five for compensation with $4.3 million in \ncompensation last year and unexercised stock options valued at $46 \nmillion in the year 2001. A 2001 study of the top 50 drugs marketed to \nseniors shows that Eli Lilly and Company posted $115 billion in \nrevenue. I do not in any way object to successful business, although I \nguess in this case I would say given the inability of people to receive \nmedicines, I find that kind of salary and others across the industry \ndisturbing.\n  But what I am particularly concerned about is that a company which is \nso successful, an industry that is the most successful in the country, \nand highly subsidized by taxpayers, would now be in a situation to \nprotect themselves from liability, and to jeopardize families and \nchildren who are asking that their case be heard about potential \nthreats of mercury placed into vaccines and the possible connections to \nautism.\n  The protection in this bill is included for an industry that gets a \nhigher return on its revenue than any other industry in this country, \nor in the world. If we are looking at protection, certainly we ought \nnot to be adding another subsidy to an industry that is so heavily \nsubsidized by all of us now--highly subsidized. And, yet, most people, \nmany people in this country cannot afford the product they make.\n  I support the Lieberman amendment to strike this provision. This \nprovision does not belong in the homeland security bill. This provision \nshould go through the process of hearings so both sides can be heard. \nWe also have a court process going on that we need to respect and allow \nto continue.\n  I am hopeful my colleagues will join with us to exempt this provision \nfrom the bill so we can in fact focus on homeland security, and not a \nvery clear special interest provision put in by an industry that \nalready receives many special provisions.\n  An issue as serious as potential mercury poisoning of children \ncertainly deserves serious deliberation and deserves the full \nlegislative process.\n  Let me say again that colleagues earlier this year on the Medicare \nprescription drug bill--on our generic bill as well as on many other \nbills--have come to the floor from the other side of the aisle \nexpressing concern about issues that had not gone through committee. If \nthis is a serious issue--and I believe it is a very serious issue--\ndoesn't it merit that same high standard? Subsidizing Eli Lilly and \ntaking away the ability of families to recover from liability because \nof potential mercury poisoning of their children does not belong in \nthis homeland security bill. I find it shameful that it was put in.\n  I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join with us to \nremove this provision.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may I say to the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan, Senator Stabenow, that I have listened to what she has said. \nI am not surprised by what she has indicated that she has found in this \nreservation. I think it supports my viewpoint; namely, that we ought \nnot vote\n\n[[Page S11027]]\n\non cloture tomorrow on this bill--cloture at some point, undoubtedly. \nBut I hope we don't vote for it tomorrow. This bill needs further \nscrutiny. It needs a microscope upon it. We need to study it. We need \nto know what is in this bill which has suddenly been foisted upon us \nwithin the last 48 hours--a new bill.\n  There are those who maintain we have been on this subject matter for \n5, 6, or 8 weeks, or more. That is one thing. But we haven't been on \nthis bill. This is a new bill. Senator Stabenow is talking about \nprovisions that are in this bill that haven't seen the light of day \nbefore. These are new and disturbing. And yet we are being asked on \ntomorrow to apply cloture to shut off debate so there can only be 30 \nhours remaining for debate on this bill.\n  I hope Senators will listen to Senator Stabenow. I hope they will not \nvote for cloture tomorrow. We ought to do our duty. Our duty is to stay \non this bill until the American people know what is in it, and so we \nSenators know what is in it. There are 484 pages in this bill which \njust came to light on yesterday. It is a new bill. There are some \nprovisions in it that have been in other bills that have been discussed \nin the Senate earlier in the fall and in the summer. But there are many \nprovisions in this bill that are absolutely new. We really do not know \nwhat else is in the bill. Things are being discovered as we go along. \nBut who knows what else is in the bill?\n\n  I compliment the distinguished Senator from Michigan, a Senator who \nis absolutely able and always dedicated, always serving her \nconstituents and the people of this country, who has a fine mind, and \nwho is a tremendous legislator. I have so much admiration for her. I \nsit with her on the Budget Committee. And what she has said with \nrespect to this particular bill I think we should hear. We should \nlisten to her. I hope Senators will not vote for cloture on tomorrow.\n  Is there anything the distinguished Senator wishes to add?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to yield to the Senator \nwithout losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the Senator for \nhis kind words. Second, I simply say, as Senator Byrd has said so many \ntimes on the floor, we need to look at details. We need to know what is \nin this bill. It is a different bill that came back. I was deeply \ndisturbed as I looked through it. I want to support homeland security. \nI support developing a department. We all share that. This is not a \npartisan issue. We want to have maximum safety, security and ability, \ncommunicate it effectively and efficiently, and create the kind of \nconfidence people expect us to create in terms of the ability to \nrespond and ideally prevent attacks. But my fear is that under the name \nof homeland security we are saying special interest provisions are put \nin this bill which are outrageous and should not have the light of day. \nI think it is our responsibility to shine the light of day on those \nprovisions.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia. I appreciate his good work.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator. She has \nperformed a tremendous service. I congratulate her, and I again thank \nher.\n  Mr. President, we hear this is a compromise bill. It is a compromise, \nall right. It is a compromise in many ways. It is a compromise of our \ncivil liberties. It is a compromise of our separation of powers. It is \na compromise of our checks and balances. It is a compromise of workers' \nrights. There are many compromises in this bill.\n  To express it as a compromise is a term that is often used around \nhere in the legislative halls. Legislation is the art of compromise. We \noften compromise on legislation. Compromise on legislation is a series \nof compromises among Republicans and Democrats, and among committees. \nBut, in this sense, this is a far different animal we have here. By \npassing this legislation, we are all complicit in a giant hoax. This is \nthe worst kind of game playing possible in trying to foist this \nDepartment onto the American people as a substitute for real action on \nhomeland security.\n\n  This Congress and this administration are both being irresponsible. \nInstead of providing the American people with real security, we are \noffering them a placebo, a sugar pill that will not protect them and \nwill not make them safer, not by even the slightest measurement.\n  There will be an uncertain sound of the trumpet. And when I refer to \nthe ``uncertain sound of the trumpet,'' let me refer more specifically \nto the Book of 1st Corinthians, the 14th chapter. And I read from the \n8th verse:\n\n       For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall \n     prepare himself to the battle?\n\n  Mr. President, Congress is about to give an uncertain sound to the \nAmerican people. Based on what we shall all too soon, I am afraid, pass \nas a homeland security bill, they are going to feel more secure. They \nwill not be. They are going to feel that Congress has enacted \nlegislation that will make their homes safer, make their schools safer, \nmake their communities safer, make them safer on the jobs. This \nlegislation will not make jobs or schools or homes or communities one \nwhit safer, not one whit safer.\n  The same people who will be employed in implementing the homeland \nsecurity legislation to make the people safe are out there now, right \nthis minute. They are on the northern border. They are on the southern \nborder. They are in the ports of this country. They are in the \nhospitals. They are in the fire departments. They are in the law \nenforcement agencies. They are in the FBI. They are in Customs. They \nare already out there now. And tonight, at midnight, when you and I are \nin our beds and on our pillows, they will be out there.\n  We are not waiting until this bill passes for them to be out there. \nThey have been out there for weeks and months. They have been doing a \ngood job with what they have had placed in their hands by way of \nresources that they could use.\n  We saw the FBI arrest the persons in the cell in New York. The FBI \nwas on the job. The FBI did not wait for this legislation to pass this \nSenate or the House and be sent down to the President and signed. The \nFBI was on the job.\n  People are not going to be one whit safer with the passage of this \nbill. They are going to feel a lot safer because we are trying to make \nthem believe they are going to be safer. We are trying to make the \nAmerican people believe that with the passage of this bill--and the \nadministration is complicit, absolutely complicit in this.\n  The President himself has been out there all throughout the land, \nespecially during the campaign, raising money for campaign purposes for \nelecting their candidates, and all the while they have been with a nice \nbackdrop of American Marines or soldiers or airmen, or whatever, but a \npatriotic backdrop, trying to make the American people believe that \nwith the passage of this--if the Congress would only pass this homeland \nsecurity bill, they, the people out there in the plains, in the \nmountains, in the valleys, on the prairies, will all be safer. They \nwill not be 10 cents safer, Mr. President. They might be even less safe \nbecause in the next year, during which time these various and sundry \nagencies are going to be phased into this new Department of Homeland \nSecurity, during that time there is going to be chaos in a lot of these \nagencies. They will be moving phones, moving desks, moving chairs, \ntrying to get accustomed to the new visions, the new objectives, and \nthe people themselves are going to be less secure.\n\n  So we are offering the American people a placebo, a sugar pill. It is \na political pill. It will not make the people safer.\n  We ought to be taking real action to protect lives now. Sadly, we are \nwalking away from that responsibility. I only pray our irresponsibility \ndoes not result in lost lives.\n  Now, this is not how the American people expect this Congress to \noperate. When we were Members of the House of Representatives, or \nearlier than that, perhaps, or at some point, we have sent out letters, \nwe have sent out booklets, telling the young people in this country--we \ntell these young pages up here--how your laws are made.\n  I remember years ago, when I was in the House of Representatives, \nsending out a little booklet to the people in my then-congressional \ndistrict of how our laws are made. It is a joke.\n\n[[Page S11028]]\n\n  We tell our young people that, first of all, a bill is offered by a \nMember of the Senate or the House. That bill is referred to a \ncommittee. And at a certain date, at a certain time, the chairman of \nthat committee will have his committee called together, and he will \nplace the bill before the committee for its consideration. And the \nmembers on both sides of the tables in that particular committee which \nhas jurisdiction over that particular legislation will debate it back \nand forth, and they will offer amendments in the committee. They will \ntalk about the bill. They will have their staffs seated around them. \nThey will have good discussions of this bill that has been introduced \nby the legislature. Then the bill will be amended, perhaps, or, \nperhaps, in any event, it will finally be reported by the committee to \nthe Senate or to the House for action. There it will be placed on the \ncalendar.\n  Sometimes these beautifully written pieces on how our laws are made \nare illustrated by cartoons. We have all seen those cartoons. We then \nsee that the bill is off to the Senate, and it is placed upon the \ncalendar. And at some point in time, the majority leader or a Member, \naccording to those cartoons, will call up the bill, and then will ensue \na debate, a heated debate, Republicans on one side, Democrats on the \nother. And they will all work together. They will offer amendments \nagain, and they will have a heated debate. They will answer questions. \nThe witnesses, which first appeared in committees and testified on the \nbills, may then be seated in the galleries listening to the debate as \nit goes forward in the Senate and in the House.\n  After a while, then, after they amend, after that bill is \nappropriately amended, it finally reaches a vote, and it is passed by \nthat body.\n  Then, according to the booklet on how our laws are made, that bill \nthen goes to the other body. If it originated in the Senate, it goes to \nthe House. If it originated in the House, after going through the \nworkings of the committees, and so forth, and the debate on the floor, \nafter its passage, it is sent over to the Senate. It goes through the \nsame procedure then in the other body, where it is amended. And if \nthere are differences in the House bill and the Senate bill, the bill \nis sent to a conference made up of Members of the two bodies, and the \nareas that are not in agreement will be worked on in the conference \nbetween the representatives of the two legislative bodies. Agreement \nwill finally be reached as to every difference that was to be found \nbetween the two bodies. So all those differences will be resolved.\n  Then the conference report will be brought back to the House and \nbrought back to the Senate and brought up at the appropriate time by \nthe managers of the legislation on whatever committee had jurisdiction \nover the legislation, and then conference reports are brought up. \nConference reports are debated, and they are agreed upon in both \nHouses.\n  Off goes the bill which is now an act. It goes by special messenger \ndown to the President of the United States. It appears on his desk \nwhere he may sign it or he may veto it.\n  So we all remember how those laws are made according to the script as \nprepared there in those handsome little booklets that we send out.\n  That is how the American people expect this Congress to operate. That \nis the way we are supposed to operate. But the way this bill was \nbrought in here, less than 48 hours ago, a brandnew bill. It had not \nbeen before any committee. It had undergone no hearings, not this bill. \nIt is a bill on our desks that has 484 pages. There are 484 pages in \nthis bill. It has not been before any committee. There have been no \nhearings on this bill. There have been no witnesses who were asked to \nappear to testify on behalf of the bill or in opposition to it. It did \nnot undergo any such scrutiny. It was just placed on the Senate \nCalendar. It was offered as an amendment here. And so here it is before \nthe Senate now. There it is.\n  That is not the way in which our children are taught how we make our \nlaws--not at all. The American people expect us to provide our best \njudgment and our best insight into such monumental decisions. This is a \nfar, far cry from being our best. This is not our best. As a matter of \nfact, it is a mere shadow of our best. Yet we are being asked, as the \nelected representatives of the American people, those of us who are \nsent here by our respective States are being asked on tomorrow to \ninvoke cloture on these 484 pages.\n  If I had to go before the bar of judgment tomorrow and were asked by \nthe eternal God what is in this bill, I could not answer God. If I were \nasked by the people of West Virginia, Senator Byrd, what is in that \nbill, I could not answer. I could not tell the people of West Virginia \nwhat is in this bill. There are a few things that I know are in it by \nvirtue of the fact that I have had 48 hours, sleeping time included, in \nwhich to study this monstrosity, 484 pages.\n  If there ever were a monstrosity, this is it. I hold it in my hand, a \nmonstrosity. I don't know what is in it. I know a few things that are \nin it, and a few things that I know are in it that I don't think the \nAmerican people would approve of if they knew what was in there. Even \nSenator Lieberman, who is chairman of the committee which has \njurisdiction over this subject matter, even he saw new provisions in \nthis legislation as he looked through it yesterday and today. As his \nstaff looked through it, they saw provisions they had not seen before, \nthat they had not discussed before, that had not been before their \ncommittee before.\n\n  Yet we are being asked on tomorrow to invoke cloture on that which \nmeans we are not going to debate in the normal course of things. We are \ngoing to have 30 hours of debate. That is it, 30 hours. That is all, 30 \nhours; 100 Senators, 30 hours of debate. And this is one of the most \nfar-reaching pieces of legislation I have seen in my 50 years.\n  I will have been in Congress 50 years come January 3. God help me to \nreach that date of January 3, 2003, the year of our Lord. In my 50 \nyears here, that is the most far-reaching, certainly one of the most \nfar-reaching pieces of legislation that I have seen in my 50 years. I \nhave been on this Hill longer than anybody else in this Capitol on \neither side of the aisle in either body. In both bodies, I am the only \nperson, 50 years. I have been here longer than all of you, staff \npeople, Members, Members' wives. Take it or leave it, Robert Byrd has \nbeen here longer than anybody else--the security personnel, any \npolicemen, whatever you call it, pull them out here, nobody, nobody in \nthe House. John Dingell, he is the dean of the House; I served with his \nfather in the House.\n  Never have I seen such a monstrous piece of legislation sent to this \nbody. And we are being asked to vote on that 484 pages tomorrow. Our \npoor staffs were up most of the night studying it. They know some of \nthe things that are in there, but they don't know all of them. It is a \nsham and it is a shame. We are all complicit in going along with it.\n  I read in the paper that nobody will have the courage to vote against \nit. Well, Robert Byrd is going to vote against it because I don't know \nwhat I am voting for. That is one thing. And No. 2, it has not had the \nscrutiny that we tell our young people, that we tell these sweet pages \nhere, boys and girls who come up here, we tell them our laws should \nhave.\n  Listen, my friends: I am an old meatcutter. I used to make sausage. \nLet me tell you, I never made sausage like this thing was made. You \ndon't know what is in it. At least I knew what was in the sausage. I \ndon't know what is in this bill. I am not going to vote for it when I \ndon't know what is in it.\n  I trust that people tomorrow will turn thumbs down on that motion to \ninvoke cloture. It is our duty. We ought to demand that this piece of \nlegislation stay around here a while so we can study it, so our staffs \ncan study it, so we know what is in it, so we can have an opportunity \nto amend it where it needs amending.\n  Several Senators have indicated, Senator Lieberman among them, that \nthere are areas in here that ought to be amended.\n  What the people of the United States really care about is their \nsecurity. That is what we are talking about.\n  We don't know when another tragic event is going to be visited upon \nthis country. It can be this evening, it can be tomorrow, or whatever. \nBut this legislation is not going to be worth a continental dime if it \nhappens tonight, tomorrow, a month from tomorrow; it is not going to be \nworth a dime. There are people out there working now to secure this \ncountry and the people. They\n\n[[Page S11029]]\n\nare the same people who are already on the payroll. They are doing \ntheir duty right now to secure this country.\n  This is a hoax. This is a hoax. To tell the American people they are \ngoing to be safer when we pass this is to hoax. We ought to tell the \npeople the truth. They are not going to be any safer with that. That is \nnot the truth. I was one of the first in the Senate to say we need a \nnew Department of Homeland Security. I meant that. But I didn't mean \nthis particular hoax that this administration is trying to pander off \nto the American people, telling them this is homeland security. That is \nnot homeland security.\n  Mr. President, the Attorney General and Director of Homeland Security \nhave told Americans repeatedly there is an imminent risk of another \nterrorist attack. Just within the past day, or few hours, the FBI has \nput hospitals in the Washington area, Houston, San Francisco, and \nChicago on notice of a possible terrorist threat. This bill does \nnothing--not a thing--to make our citizens more secure today or \ntomorrow. This bill does not even go into effect for up to 12 months. \nIt will be 12 months before this goes into effect. The bill just moves \naround on an organizational chart. That is what it does--moves around \non an organizational chart.\n  Mr. President, do you really believe Osama bin Laden cares whether \nthe associate commissioner for border enforcement will have his title \nchanged to the Assistant Secretary of the Bureau of Border Security? \nWill that make any difference to Osama bin Laden? Do you think the al-\nQaida organization cares one whit whether that Assistant Secretary \nworks for the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization \nService or for the new Under Secretary for Border and Transportation \nSecurity? No. Osama bin Laden doesn't give a whit what his title is \ngoing to be. The al-Qaida doesn't care about that. They are tickled to \nsit back and watch us be fooled into complacency by virtue of our \npassing this piece of trash.\n  That is not to say there are not some parts of the bill that are \ngood. This whole thing is being rushed through, and we are all being \npressured to pass it, vote for cloture. Let's get out of here. We have \nto go home, let's go. Let's get this thing out of the way. What Osama \nbin Laden would care about is whether there are more security guards, \nbetter detection equipment at our ports and airports. What Osama bin \nLaden would care about is whether we have enough border patrol agents \nto capture his terrorists as they try to enter this country. What Osama \nbin Laden would care about is whether we have sufficient security at \nour nuclear powerplants to deter his efforts to steal nuclear material \nor blow up a nuclear facility.\n  The Senate Appropriations Committee, on which Senator Stevens and I \nsit, along with 27 other Senators, including the distinguished Senator \nwho presides over the Chamber at this moment, the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, Mr. Reed, tried to provide funds to programs to hire more FBI \nagents, to hire more border patrol agents, to equip and train our first \nresponders, to improve security at our nuclear powerplants, to improve \nbomb detection at our airports. That committee of 29 Senators--\n15 Democrats and 14 Republicans--voted to provide the funds for these \nhomeland security needs. Those funds have been in bills that have been \nout there for 4 months. This administration, right down here at the \nother end of the avenue, has had its leaders over in the Republican-\ncontrolled House sitting on those bills. The chairman in the \nAppropriations Committee in the House saw the need for these bills. He \ntried to get the leadership in the House to take the cuffs off his \nhands and wrists and let him go forward with these appropriations \nbills. The answer was no. So the money has been there. All that needed \nto be done, all we needed in order to release those funds--I can \nremember in one bill we had $2.5 billion in homeland security funds. \nAll the President had to do was sign his name to the effect that this \nwas an emergency. That money would have flowed; it would have been out \nthere now--not next week, not next year, but now it would have been out \nthere.\n\n  Various people at the local level--the firemen, the policemen, people \non the borders, border patrol, people in the ports, securing the ports, \npeople at the airports that help the emergency personnel--all of these \npeople would have had the advantage of that money flowing immediately \nfor homeland security.\n  But the President said no--no, he would not sign it. President Bush \nis the man I am talking about. He would not sign that as an emergency. \nThese moneys have been reported by a unanimous Appropriations \nCommittee. But this administration said no. So that is what happened. \nThese are actions that would make America more secure today. Did the \nPresident help us to approve these funds? No. Instead, the President \nforced us--forced us--to reduce homeland security funding by $8.9 \nbillion, and he delayed another $5 billion.\n  This is shameful; this is cynical; this is being irresponsible. It is \nunfair to the American people. And then to tell them Congress ought to \npass that homeland security bill--that is passing the buck.\n  Mr. President, I call attention to a column in the New York Times. \nThis is entitled ``You Are A Suspect.'' It is by William Safire. I will \nread it:\n\n       If the homeland security act is not amended before passage, \n     here is what will happen to you:\n\n  Listen, Senators. This is what William Safire is saying in the New \nYork Times of November 14, 2002. That is today. This is what the New \nYork Times is saying to you, to me, to us:\n\n       If the Homeland Security Act is not amended before passage, \n     here is what will happen to you:\n       Every purchase you make--\n\n  Hear me now--\n\n       Every purchase you make with a credit card, every magazine \n     subscription you buy and medical prescription you fill, every \n     Web site you visit and e-mail you send or receive, every \n     academic grade you receive, every bank deposit you make, \n     every trip you book and every event you attend--all these \n     transactions and communications will go into what the Defense \n     Department describes as ``a virtual, centralized grand \n     database.''\n       To this computerized dossier on your private life from \n     commercial sources, add every piece of information that \n     government has about you--passport application, driver's \n     license and bridge toll records, judicial and divorce \n     records, complaints from nosy neighbors to the F.B.I., your \n     lifetime paper trail plus the latest hidden camera \n     surveillance--and you have the supersnoop's dream: a ``Total \n     Information Awareness' about every U.S. citizen.\n\n  Every U.S. citizen, and that is you, that is you, that is you, that \nis you, that is you.\n\n       This is not some far-out Orwellian scenario. It is what \n     will happen to your personal freedom in the next few weeks if \n     John Poindexter gets the unprecedented power he seeks.\n       Remember Poindexter? Brilliant man, first in his class at \n     the Naval Academy, later earned a doctorate in physics, rose \n     to national security adviser under President Ronald Reagan. \n     He had this brilliant idea of secretly selling missiles to \n     Iran to pay ransom for hostages, and with the illicit \n     proceeds to illegally support Contras in Nicaragua.\n       A jury convicted Poindexter in 1990 on five felony counts \n     of misleading Congress and making false statements, but an \n     appeals court overturned the verdict because Congress had \n     given him immunity for his testimony. He famously asserted, \n     ``The buck stops here,'' arguing that the White House staff, \n     and not the president, was responsible for fateful decisions \n     that might prove embarrassing.\n       This ring-knocking master of deceit is back again with a \n     plan even more scandalous than Iran-Contra. He heads the \n     ``Information Awareness Office'' in the otherwise excellent \n     Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which spawned the \n     Internet and stealth aircraft technology. Poindexter is now \n     realizing his 20-year dream: getting the ``data-mining'' \n     power to snoop on every public and private act of every \n     American.\n       Even the hastily passed U.S.A. Patriot Act, which widened \n     the scope of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and \n     weakened 15 privacy laws, raised requirements for the \n     government to report secret eavesdropping to Congress and the \n     courts. But Poindexter's assault on individual privacy rides \n     roughshod over such oversight.\n       He is determined to break down the wall between commercial \n     snooping and secret government intrusion. The disgraced \n     admiral dismisses such necessary differentiation as \n     bureaucratic ``stovepiping.'' And he has been given a $200 \n     million budget to create computer dossiers on 300 million \n     Americans.\n       When George W. Bush was running for president, he stood \n     foursquare in defense of each person's medical, financial and \n     communications privacy. But Poindexter, whose contempt for \n     the restraints of oversight drew the Reagan administration \n     into its most serious blunder, is still operating on the \n     presumption that on such a sweeping theft of privacy rights, \n     the buck ends with him and not with the president.\n\n[[Page S11030]]\n\n       This time, however, he has been seizing power in the open. \n     In the past week John Markoff of The Times, followed by \n     Robert O'Harrow of The Washington Post, have revealed the \n     extent of Poindexter's operation, but editorialists have not \n     grasped its undermining of the Freedom of Information Act.\n       Political awareness can overcome ``Total Information \n     Awareness,'' the combined force of commercial and government \n     snooping. In a similar overreach, Attorney General Ashcroft \n     tried his Terrorism Information and Prevention System (TIPS), \n     but public outrage at the use of gossips and postal workers \n     as snoops caused the House to shoot it down. The Senate \n     should now do the same to this other exploitation of fear.\n       The Latin motto over Poindexter's new Pentagon office reads \n     ``Scientia Est Potentia''--``knowledge is power.'' Exactly: \n     the government's infinite knowledge about you is its power \n     over you. ``We're just as concerned as the next person with \n     protecting privacy,'' this brilliant mind blandly assured The \n     Post. A jury found he spoke falsely before.\n\n  If the American people, if the American public is to believe what \nthey read in this week's newspapers, the Congress stands ready to pass \nlegislation to create a new Department of Homeland Security. Not with \nmy vote. Passage of such legislation would be the answer to the \nuniversal battle cry that this administration adopted shortly after the \nSeptember 11 attacks: Reorganize the Federal Government.\n  How is it that the Bush administration's No. 1 priority has evolved \ninto a plan to create a giant, huge bureaucracy? How is it that the \nCongress bought into the belief that to take a plethora of Federal \nagencies and departments and shuffle them around would make us safer \nfrom future terrorist attacks?\n  Osama bin Laden is still alive and plotting more attacks while we \nplay bureaucratic shuffle board after we have already spent about $20 \nbillion in Afghanistan to capture or to obliterate Osama bin Laden. He \nhas surfaced on audio tapes boasting about how he is plotting \nadditional terrorist attacks against the United States. Yet our only \nresponse is to reorganize the Federal Government. That is our only \nresponse, reorganize the Federal Government.\n  Right here it is, 484 pages of it, reorganizing the Federal \nGovernment. Am I missing something here?\n  Eleven of the thirteen appropriations bills have not yet been passed. \nTogether they contain over $25.6 billion in funds to improve our \nhomeland defense. That is money to hire additional border security \npersonnel. That is money to purchase equipment at our seaports and \nairports to inspect packages for weapons of mass destruction. That is \nmoney for protection against cyber-attacks. That is money to protect \nour nuclear facilities, not a year from now but now. That is money to \nassist local police, local firefighters, local health care workers in \ncase of additional terrorist attacks.\n  Yet the administration is refusing to allocate this money, refusing \nto turn on the spigot and let it flow, let it roll.\n  This is real money to improve America's safety, but instead of \npushing for these resources, the administration's top and seemingly \nonly priority is a bureaucratic reshuffling of agencies. So this \nadministration will continue holding up the money needed to protect \nAmericans--your children, your grandchildren, your wife, your in-laws, \nyour friends--at home and it will be allowed to do so because it will \nhave this flimsy 484 pages of legislation to cover its political \nbackside.\n  The design of this hulking bureaucracy has been the administration's \nfocus for the past several months. That is where it wanted Congress to \nfocus its attention. That is where the administration wanted the \nAmerican people to focus, not on providing real homeland security but, \nrather, on playing bureaucratic shuffle board.\n  We have witnessed a great show. We have been told that if only we \npass this 484 pages of legislation--this political hoax that I hold in \nmy hand, that many of us have not seen before yesterday--the American \npeople have been told that if only we pass this legislation, all would \nbe well.\n  But like the great and powerful Wizard of Oz, with his terrifying \nsmoke, flames and roar, the reality of this too-good-to-be-true \nproposal will eventually be unveiled.\n  Mr. President, my concerns about this legislation and its several \niterations are many. It gives the President too much unchecked \nauthority. It gives the Secretary of the new Department too much \nunchecked authority. It makes massive changes in Government structure \nwith little scrutiny, and it allows those changes to be made without \nthe approval of the Congress.\n  It threatens changes to worker protections that could have enormous \nand detrimental effects. It extends the cloak of secrecy that has been \na hallmark of this White House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator will suspend. \nSenators will kindly take their conversations off the floor.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this legislation not only cuts the Congress \nout of the loop, it also includes provisions to keep the people and the \npress--and the press had better take notice--it includes provisions to \nkeep the people and the press, the members of the fourth estate, in the \ndark.\n  I don't think the media realize this about this bill. And the media \nhas apparently swallowed the line that this is a compromise. It is more \nthan that. It is a compromise of our personal liberties. It is a \ncompromise of the privacy rights of our people. It is a compromise of \nthe checks and balances. It is a compromise of the separation of \npowers. It is a compromise of the American people's right to know--the \nAmerican people's right to know. It is a compromise of that.\n  For those who do not understand what I am saying, they should get \nthis bill, 484 pages of it. It is a new bill. It did not exist anywhere \nuntil yesterday.\n  We have talked about how this whole idea of a Homeland Security \nDepartment, presented to us by this administration, we have talked \nabout how it was hatched in secrecy in the bowels of the White House, \nhow it was hatched in secrecy, cooked up by four different persons in \nthe White House. I have named them earlier today: Mr. Card, Mr. \nGonzales, Mr. Mitch Daniels, and Mr. Ridge. No disrespect to any of \nthem--they are all fine people; they are all fine public servants--but \nthey are not anything extraordinary, I would say that, insofar as \npeople go. They hatched this thing. They hatched it in secrecy.\n  We understand from the newspapers this was talked about among the \npeople in the administration, down in the secrecy of the White House. \nIt had been talked about. It had been developed. And then it sprang \nforth like Minerva from the forehead of Jove, fully clothed, fully \narmed. There it was.\n  We could say the same thing about this bill that we are passing here. \nWe have little right to complain about the White House and about the \nway in which it developed in secrecy this whole egg that was hatched \nand sprung upon us as the homeland security bill.\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/14/senate-section/article/S11030-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:45 A.M.

We have done the same thing right here. This \nwas concocted in secrecy in the darkness of the night. It didn't see \nthe light of day until yesterday--484 pages. We are expected to pass \nthis. We are expected to invoke cloture on it tomorrow and pass it and \ntell the American people they are safer after the passage of that \nmonstrosity.\n  No doubt there are some good things about that bill. There are some \ngood things in it. Some of the provisions in this 484-page bill have \ncome out of Senator Lieberman's committee's deliberations, and it \npassed. Some of these have been discussed before, but not all of them. \nThere are a lot of provisions in this bill that had not seen the light \nof day until yesterday.\n  The press has been kept in the dark. The press is going to realize \nall too late what has happened to the people's right to know that we \nwere going to pass right here in this bill. I am going to address those \nprovisions briefly in a few minutes. I hope the press will stay tuned \nbecause I want to point out to the press what is about to happen to the \npeople's right to know.\n  I have often had my differences with reporters, but I am a firm \nbeliever in the freedom of the press and in the responsibilities of the \nfourth estate. If the Congress is going to so willingly blindfold \nitself to the inner workings of this administration and this new \nbureaucracy, I hope the press will not be so compliant. Hear me, those \nin the fourth estate. You stay tuned. I will point out part of this \nbill in a few minutes. But if you haven't read it as yet, it is going \nto turn your stomach because you believe in the people's right to know. \nI hope it will keep a watchful eye. I am talking about the media. I \nhope the media will keep a watchful eye on this new agency. \nUnfortunately, provisions contained in this bill will make it harder \nfor the fourth estate--harder for you in the press--and harder for the \npeople to do so.\n  I still find it difficult to believe that the American war on \nterrorism hinges on the building of a new, huge bureaucracy. Our plan \nto eradicate a vicious, cunning nest of vipers is to reorganize the \nGovernment.NOTICE\n\nIf the 107th Congress, 2d Session, adjourns sine die on or before \nNovember 22, 2002, a final issue of the Congressional Record for \nthe 107th Congress, 2d Session, will be published on Monday, \nDecember 16, 2002, in order to permit Members to revise and extend \ntheir remarks.\nAll material for insertion must be signed by the Member and \ndelivered to the respective offices of the Official Reporters of \nDebates (Room HT-60 or S-123 of the Capitol), Monday through \nFriday, between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. through \nFriday, December 13.

If I thought for a moment I could kill this bill \nhere tonight by filibustering it, I would do it. But there are a lot of \nSenators here who wouldn't know a filibuster--a lot of people who \nwouldn't know a filibuster--if they met one on the way home. There are \na lot of people who wouldn't know it if they met it in the middle of \nthe road.\n  I intend to stand on my feet and try to expose some of the things in \nthis bill that are not going to be good for the American people and \nwhich will not contribute to their safety.\n  Our plan to eradicate a vicious, cunning nest of vipers is to \nreorganize the Government. This is a massive reorganization. This is \nour battle plan--talking about the administration. This is its \npriority. This is our ammunition against the terrorist threat to our \nhomeland.\n  A certain Senator here a few days ago talked about killing snakes. He \ntalked about snakes in his State. He knew snakes when he saw them. \nWell, there are some snakes in West Virginia too. I knew about those \nsnakes when I walked the red clay hills of southern West Virginia in \nMercer County. We had copperheads back in those hills in those days and \na few rattlesnakes. There are snakes. I know a snake when I see it. I \nsaw a snake in this bill. This bill is a snake. If I could chop off its \nhead, kill it dead, dead, dead, I would do it.\n  This 484 pages right here is what I am talking about. This is our \ninitiative--this is the administration's ammunition. They know better \nthan that. They know that is not going to make this homeland one whit \nsafer.\n  I have listened very hard. I do not hear the American people \nclamoring for us to build a new, cumbersome, bureaucratic leviathan.\n  The midterm elections--despite what many of the pundits may believe--\nhad little to do with the creation of this new Department. The American \npeople weren't clamoring for this new bureaucracy. While Americans cast \ntheir ballots, they may have had hopes for safer communities than \nprotection from terrorism, but I sincerely doubt that they were voting \nto create a huge, new bureaucracy.\n  Surely nobody believes that building a giant bureaucracy has suddenly \nbecome the nemesis to the threat of the acts of madmen on our people \nhere at home.\n  With a battle plan such as the Bush administration is proposing, \ninstead of crossing the Delaware River to capture the Hessian soldiers \non Christmas Day, George Washington would have stayed on his side of \nthe river and built a bureaucracy.\n  During the Civil War, President Lincoln would dismiss one general \nafter another until he found one capable of building a better \nbureaucracy.\n  Perhaps what we are lacking to make this new idea really resonate \nwith the American people is a powerful, stimulating slogan--a dramatic \nslogan such as the kind of slogan that we politicians slap on bumper \nstickers, one that would serve to inspire and unite our soldiers and \nour citizens.\n  Maybe we could draw from history to see how our new lust for a huge \nbureaucracy would fair.\n  I can picture Nathan Hale saying: I regret that I have but one \nbureaucracy to lose. I regret that I have but one life to give for my \nbureaucracy.\n  I can hear Captain John Paul Jones on September--I believe it was \nSeptember 23, 1779--shouting: I have not yet begun to fight for my \nbureaucracy.\n  I can think of Commodore Oliver Perry hoisting his famous flag upon \nhis ship with the motto: Don't give up the bureaucracy.\n  I can just imagine Commodore Stephen Decatur returning from the war \non the Barbary Coast, offering his famous toast: My bureaucracy, right \nor wrong.\n  It just gives me chills to think of the people of Texas remembering \nthe Alamo and being inspired to fight with the restoring battle cry: \nRemember the bureaucracy.\n  What about the professorial President Woodrow Wilson taking us into \nWorld War I with the proclamation: The world must be made safe for \nbureaucracy.\n  I was born during his administration. Nonsense, of course. But it has \nbeen said that necessity is the mother of invention. I guess then that \npolitical expediency has now become the mother of bureaucracy.\n  I don't think there is much doubt that the Senate will pass this \nlegislation to restructure our homeland defense agencies. But my point \nis that the administration's plan is a sham. It is a sham. It is a \npolitical ploy. It worked well during the campaign. It was worked up in \nhaste and for the wrong reasons.\n  Homeland security is a serious and dangerous matter involving the \nlives and the livelihoods of millions of Americans. We ought to be \nashamed of ourselves to offer our people a quick bureaucratic pacifier \ninstead of taking our time and working thoughtfully and carefully on an \neffective and lasting plan for the protection of the American people.\n  What we ought to be even more ashamed of, however, is the manner in \nwhich we are passing this bill. Prior to our recessing, hundreds of \namendments were filed to make changes to the pending bill that had been \nreported by the Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  There were hundreds of amendments up at that desk. Yet Senators are \nchoosing not to call up amendments. We are told that any amendments to \nthis bill would force a conference with the House.\n  Now, get this. We are told that if we amend this bill, it will force \na conference with the House of Representatives and could delay or even \nkill this bill. So Senators are being urged not to call up their \namendments. And in many instances, they are choosing not to call up \ntheir amendments.\n  Is the Senate afraid of its own shadow? Are we afraid to think, to \ndebate, to ask questions, to stand for something? Are we afraid to \nstand for something? Are we afraid to stand against a President of the \nUnited States? Is the Senate afraid to stand up against an \nadministration, a political administration? Is the Senate afraid? Are \nSenators afraid to stand up against the President, to be the loyal \nopposition at this time of great distress?\n  It is a dangerous thing when a President believes that he is so right \nthat he should be given any and all powers he deems necessary to \nachieve his ends. That is a dangerous thing. It is dangerous when a \nPresident believes that he possesses the people's consent to freely \ntamper with their rights and their liberties.\n  But it is considerably more dangerous when the elected officials such \nas ourselves, whose duty it is to protect the people's liberties \nagainst the excesses of an overreaching Executive, an overreaching \nWhite House, accede to a President's every request. Shame on us. Shame \non us.\n  And it is even worse when we not only fail to impose restraint but \nactually aid and abet the Executive in a brazen power grab. That is \nexactly what this is.\n  The American people feel unsettled. They are nervous. They are \njittery. They are scared. And they have every right to be. Their \nPresident has spent months and loads of taxpayers' dollars frightening \nthem. Their Government has issued an unceasing proliferation of \nwarnings about potential violence.\n  But the threats to our homeland go well beyond terrorist attacks. Our \nNation is threatened, perhaps most seriously threatened, by a mentality \nthat says that Presidents should have a free hand to do whatever they \ndeem necessary whenever they deem to do it as necessary.\n  Our President has been speaking a great deal in recent months about \nour enemies and how they hate our freedoms. Mr. President, I doubt that \nthey hate our freedoms. They hate our arrogance. They do not hate our \nfreedoms. They hate our arrogance.\n  Our President has made protecting our freedoms a rallying cry. I have \nbeen working at protecting our freedoms for 50 years in this Congress. \nFifty years come January 3 I have been working at protecting our \nfreedoms. I have been helping to appropriate the moneys for our men and \nour women who serve in our military services.\n  The President has touched a raw nerve with the public, in speech \nafter speech after speech about foreign terrorists who are attacking \ntheir liberties, and yet, in many ways, it is this President's \nproposals that are the most serious threats to the liberties of \nAmericans.\n\n[[Page S11035]]\n\n  We should be standing up and fighting for what is right in this \nlegislation. That is the place to start to fight. That is where we \nstart to fight to protect this land of ours, these people of ours, its \ninstitutions, the institutions of our country.\n\n  We should be standing up and fighting for what is right in this \nlegislation. We talk about justice. Justice is fine. But what is right? \nWe should be debating, offering amendments, and telling the American \npeople like it is. We should be honest enough to admit that this new \nDepartment is a massive undertaking that is far more likely to provide \npolitical security for its proponents than to provide domestic security \nfor the American people out there, at least for the foreseeable future.\n  I do not believe this is a time for us or for the American people to \ncower in a corner. I do not believe this is a time for the elected \nrepresentatives of the American people to run like whipped dogs. This \nis a time for us to seize the power that was established for us by the \ncourageous Founders of our Nation.\n  Mr. President, were it not for this Constitution, which I hold in my \nhand, you would not be presiding over this body at this moment. I say \nthat to every Senator who sits in this body. And I say that for the \npeople on the staffs of Senators. You would not be here. You would not \nbe here, I would not be here were it not for this Constitution and for \nthe great compromise--talk about a compromise--the great compromise \nwhich was entered into on July 16, 1787, out of which came this Senate, \nand the equality of votes of every State that is represented in this \nbody.\n  This is not a time to be voiceless. This is not a time to be silent. \nThis is not a time to vote for cloture and to hurry away home. This is \nnot a time to give in and to give up on the ideals that led to the \ncreation of our country.\n  Far too many Americans failed to go to the polls on election day and \nvote--far too many. I spoke of Nathan Hale, who said: ``I only regret \nthat I have but one life to lose for my country.'' And how many \nAmericans did not even walk around the corner to cast a vote? They did \nnot give one vote for their country. Far too many felt that the outcome \nof the election was beyond their control, that their votes would make \nno difference.\n  Today, I see far too many Members in this Senate falling into the \nsame desultory way of thinking. Our votes matter, if we have the guts \nto make them matter. But, no, we are going to tuck our tails between \nour legs and run like whipped dogs and vote for cloture and go home. \nThat is not right.\n  The American people have a right to know what is in these 484 pages. \nMy constituents have a right to know. Your constituents, Mr. President, \nhave a right to know. The constituents of every Senator on both sides \nof the aisle have a right to know what is in this bill.\n  We Senators have a right to know what is in this bill. We Senators \nought to insist that we not invoke cloture on tomorrow but that we \nwait. Invoking cloture is all right down the road somewhere, maybe a \nweek from now, but we ought to take the time to study this bill. Our \nstaffs ought to know what is in this bill. We ought to know what is in \nthis bill before we cast our votes.\n  Yes, I admit the handwriting on the wall is all too obvious. But I \nwill do what is right in my frail way of thinking and seeing things. I \nwill vote against this bill, unless it is amended--unless it is \namended.\n  (Mr. CORZINE assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. BYRD. I will probably vote against it, anyhow, because we are \nbeing pressured into voting for something that has not had a committee \nhearing, not a single hearing, 484 pages. There has not been a single \nhearing on this bill. There have been no witnesses called to testify in \nsupport of this bill. There have been no witnesses who have had an \nopportunity to stand before a committee and oppose this bill.\n  That is no way to legislate. Yet we are going to pass one of the most \nfar-reaching pieces of legislation that we have passed in my 50 years \nin Congress.\n  It will provide for a massive shift of power. To whom? To the \nPresident of the United States. If he were a Democrat, I would oppose \nthis just as vociferously, just as strongly, just as bitterly as I \noppose this piece of legislation right here. I don't oppose it because \nwe have a Republican President. I am going to oppose it because it \ngives away the powers of the people. It provides for a massive shift of \npower to the executive branch. It upsets that delicate balance of power \nthe Framers provided to the American people over 200 years ago.\n  The popularity of a President is a fleeting thing, a fleeting thing. \nOur duty to our Nation is not.\n  One serious problem with the legislation before the Senate is the \nexpanded authority it gives to the executive branch to conduct its \nactions in secret. Here is where I hope the press, the fourth estate, \nwill pay close attention.\n  I have great respect for a free press. I have not always been happy \nwith what the free press has written about me, but in my 50 years, I \nthink overall the press has been very fair to me. I have no complaints. \nSome of the things the press has said that I didn't like I deserved. I \nam for a free press.\n  One serious problem with the legislation currently before the Senate \nis the expanded authority that this legislation gives to the executive \nbranch to conduct its actions in secret, protected from the oversight, \nprotected from the scrutiny of the Congress, the media, and the \nAmerican people.\n  An example of this expanded secrecy that has been added in this new \nbill can be found in the exemptions that it provides from the Federal \nAdvisory Committee Act. This is section 871 of the new substitute that \nwe have just been given, the substitute that fell like manna from \nheaven. But this didn't come from heaven, I can assure you. It fell \ninto our laps about 48 hours ago without any warning, and we are asked \nto invoke cloture on this thing tomorrow.\n  Let me say that again. An example of this expanded secrecy that has \nbeen added in this new bill can be found in the exemptions it provides \nfrom the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Section 871 of this new \nsubstitute we have just been given provides the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity blanket authority--get that, blanket authority--to exempt all \nadvisory committees in the Department from existing public disclosure \nrules.\n  That is pretty serious. This provision was not included in Senator \nLieberman's substitute, but it has been slipped into this new bill \nwhich was made available to us, as I said, late Tuesday night of this \nweek. I am told it was 5 in the morning. It appeared on the web site of \nthe House Rules Committee, I believe, the night before, Tuesday night. \nIt was made available to us just within these last 48 hours with the \nhope that Senators will not have enough time to scrutinize \nthis dramatic change to an existing statute.\n\n  The statute I am talking about here, the Federal Advisory Committee \nAct, applies to the ad hoc committees that are often used in the \nexecutive branch to formulate policy. This statute, the Federal \nAdvisory Committee Act, which has been on the books for 30 years now, \nrequires the advice provided by these advisory committees is objective \nand accessible to the public.\n  The purpose of making this information available to the public is to \nallow the Congress, the media, and groups outside of Government to know \nhow the executive branch is making important policy decisions. The role \nof this oversight and scrutiny from the public and a free press is \ncentral to upholding the principles of our government, of our \nconstitutional system. It ensures that the people--the people--will be \nthe ultimate judges of the wisdom of the policies of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I understand this new Homeland Security Department will be wrestling \nwith many issues of national security that should not be subjected to \npublic disclosure rules. Sometimes these advisory committees will be \ndealing with classified intelligence information or with sensitive \nsecurity policy, and making this information available to the public \nmight compromise national security and the fight against terrorism. I \nunderstand that. But that is exactly why existing law allows the \nPresident of the United States, be he a Democrat or a Republican, to \nwaive these public disclosure rules for any advisory committee for \nnational security reasons.\n  The President can do that on a case-by-case basis in the current law. \nSo the President has this authority today. He\n\n[[Page S11036]]\n\nwill have it tomorrow. And he will be able to use it to protect any \nadvisory committee in the Homeland Security Department from having to \ndisclose information when national security information is involved. \nBut he will be accountable for that. He will be responsible for that.\n  So why do we see an expansion of this authority given to the \nSecretary in this bill? Why do we see an expansion of this authority \ngiven to the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security in this \nbill?\n  Advisory committees can already be exempted from public disclosure \nrules for national security reasons by the President on a case-by-case \nbasis. So why does this bill, then, allow the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity to exempt any committee, regardless of whether national \nsecurity is pertinent?\n  Why is it in there? Why do we see this new blanket authority in this \nbill? I will tell you why. It is because this administration wants to \nshield itself from any scrutiny of the public. This administration has \nmade it very clear that it does not want anyone meddling in executive \nbranch decisions--not the Congress, not the media, not the American \npublic.\n  Since the first day this administration took office, all we have seen \nis a concerted effort to prevent outside criticism of its policies and \nconduct. The White House has refused to share information or cooperate \nwith the Congress at every turn--maybe not at every turn, but at all \ntoo many turns.\n  The Vice President has refused to release documents concerning a \nsecret energy working group, even after court orders demanding that he \ndo so. We have read in the newspapers that the Attorney General is \ntrying to expand the powers of the Justice Department to operate in \nsecret, appealing another court decision that rejected his new secrecy \nrule. Even Tom Ridge, the President's top man in the war on terrorism, \nrefused to testify before Congress about the steps that the \nadministration was taking to protect the American people.\n  With the President's support, top officials in this administration \nhave stonewalled Congress--stonewalled the Congress. Tom Ridge \nstonewalled the Appropriations Committee of the U.S. Senate. I know; I \nam the chairman of that committee. Invitation after invitation was \nextended by my colleague, Senator Stevens, and myself for him to appear \nbefore the Appropriations Committee to testify. The answer was no. With \nthe President's support, top officials in the administration have \nstonewalled Congress, stonewalled the media, and they have stonewalled \nthe American public. Now they are hoping to expand their ability to \noperate in secret, to allow even less public scrutiny. There it is. It \nis in the bill.\n  The provisions in the bill allow the Secretary to use ad hoc advisory \ncommittees to craft policy in secret, without making specific findings \nthat such secrecy is necessary in any particular instance. This \nunnecessary new blanket authority will give the President carte blanche \nto expand the culture of secrecy that now permeates this White House.\n  This substitute language that we have just been given also provides \nthe same blanket exemption from disclosure rules for the Justice \nDepartment's new Office of Science and Technology. This new exemption \nwill allow John Ashcroft, the Attorney General, to conduct even more of \nhis duties in secret, even after the courts and the press have recently \nrebuked the Justice Department for secrecy abuses. This Senate is being \nasked to authorize the Attorney General to cloak even more of the \nJustice Department's activities in secrecy.\n  I am worried that exempting this new Science and Technology Office \nwill allow the Justice Department to provide special treatment for \ncorporate campaign contributors who are pushing new technologies.\n  Let me say that again. I am worried that exempting this new Science \nand Technology Office will allow the Justice Department to provide \nspecial treatment for corporate campaign contributors who are pushing \nnew technologies. These exemptions are unnecessary and they are a \ndanger to our people's liberty.\n\n  I believe that I have a duty to the people I represent to do what I \ncan to improve this legislation. So I hope to offer an amendment to \nstrike these exemptions from the bill. I will do whatever I can do to \nimprove the legislation and keep the people and the press from being \nlocked out of the process. The people have a right to know.\n  I am not among those who are willing to let this Senate be beaten \ninto rubber stamping the language sent to us by the House. It is our \njob as legislators to see that the Senate protects the interests of the \npeople who sent us here and who will foot the bill for this behemoth \ndepartment.\n  The public disclosure exemptions in this bill are a license for \nabuse. I do not believe that they are worthy of the Senate's approval. \nSo I am doing everything I can to see that this Senate does not roll \nover at the command of any President--whether he is a Democrat or a \nRepublican or an Independent--when there are dangerous provisions \nremaining in this bill that ought not be put into law.\n  These issues are too fundamental to let slide with the vain hope that \nwe will get a chance to revisit them next year. Don't forget, it is \neasier to pass a law than it is to repeal that law. We only need a \nmajority in each body to pass a law and have the President sign it. \nOnce that law is on the books, in order to repeal it, a President can \nveto the repeal. And, then, if only one-third plus one in either body \nuphold that President's veto, that is the end of it. There won't be any \nrepeal.\n  The Senate must act, and act responsibly, and we ought not to be in \nall that hurry to pass this legislation.\n  Having been up until almost 2 o'clock this morning, I am tired. I \nwant to speak a little longer. I won't be able to speak tomorrow. The \nSenate is going to vote on cloture in the morning. And as I wet my \nfinger and hold it to the wind, I sense that the pressure is going to \nbe on tomorrow to invoke cloture on this bill.\n  Here it is, 484 pages. It has only seen the light of 2 days--\nyesterday and today. It has not been before a committee; there has not \nbeen a single hearing on this bill; not a single witness has appeared \nbefore any committee in support of this 484-page bill. I doubt that any \nSenator in this body knows everything there is to know about this bill. \nI do believe that the great majority of Senators know very little about \nthis bill, and what little most Senators know about this bill comes \nabout as a result of some of the provisions in the bill that have been \nlifted out of the legislation that was reported out of Senator \nLieberman's committee when the bill was reported earlier this year.\n  Mr. President, the pressure is on. We are going to be asked to vote \nfor cloture tomorrow. I will be surprised if the Senate does not vote \nfor cloture. But I appeal to Senators on both sides of the aisle not to \nvote for cloture. Nathan Hale regretted that he had but one life to \nlose for his country. I hope Senators will take the same view about \ntheir responsibilities to the people.\n  They have a responsibility to stay until they know what is in this \nbill, and not to invoke cloture on it until they know what is in it, \nuntil their staffs know what is in it, and until they, Senators, have \nhad an opportunity to offer amendments to make corrections in the bill.\n  I daresay many Senators will find provisions in this bill they have \nnot seen in any bill before, that are new to this bill, that are new to \nthe Senate, and that they, those Senators, dislike. They have a duty to \ntheir constituents. I do not have to tell other Senators what their \nduties are to their constituents. They have the same duties to their \nconstituents that I have to my constituents. But I have a duty to my \nconstituents not to roll over and play dead, not to roll over and \nappear to be oblivious to what is in the bill, just pass it and go home \nand say: We have passed a bill creating the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. Whoopee. This will make us all safer.\n  This will not make us one whit, not one tiny whit safer.\n  That bill, if it passed tomorrow, would not be implemented for \nanother year. It will take another 12 months before it is implemented. \nThe same people who will be out there protecting the homes of the \nAmerican people a year from today, if they are out there a year from \ntoday, will be out there tomorrow. They are out there tonight.\n\n[[Page S11037]]\n\nThey are out there on the borders--the northern border, the southern \nborder--the Atlantic coastline, the Pacific coastline, the gulf \ncoastline, the ports of this country, the ports of entry.\n  They are out there tonight protecting the airports. They are \nprotecting the ports of entry all over this country. They are \nprotecting the nuclear facilities, the nuclear plants. They are \nstanding at their stations in the law enforcement agencies. They are \nstanding at their stations in the fire departments. They are standing \nat their stations in the health departments. They are out there now. \nThey are out there tonight. When I go home to sleep tonight and pray \nthe Lord my soul to keep, they will be out there. I will be asleep; \nthey will be there.\n  This bill is not what is putting them there. They are already there, \nand they are being put there by the taxpayers' money that flows through \nthe Appropriations Committee in this Senate. So they are there. Do not \nthink for a moment that this country has to have this bill creating \nthis massive bureaucracy in which there will be at least 28 agencies \nthat will be crammed into a new Department--170,000 people employed.\n  May I say to the people sitting back here on the benches--I am \ntalking to these staff people right back here--pay attention here--\n170,000 people employed in this new agency. They are not employed by \nvirtue of these 484 pages in this bill.\n  The Senate apparently is on a path to rush to consider this \nlegislation, and we can all say: Whoopee, let's go home now. We have \ncreated a Department of Homeland Security. Everybody is safer now.\n  But don't you believe it.\n  The Senate's legislative counsel did not finish drafting this \nbehemoth bill until the wee hours of yesterday morning, and now \nSenators are being pressured to pass it without question and without \ncomment. What a shabby way to treat the security and safety of the \nAmerican people, those people who are looking right at us through those \nelectronic lenses.\n  As I have said all along, this new Department likely will take many \nyears to become effective. We should not simply put a new name on a \nhodgepodge of agencies and claim that the Nation is, ipso facto, \ninstantly safer. What a sham. What a sham. A lot of Senators who vote \nfor this are going to come to realize that when it is too late to \nchange their votes. What a sham. Yet this legislation is being bull-\nrushed through Congress and is being hailed as the great homeland \nsecurity panacea.\n\n  This new bill is 484 pages long. Here it is. I have not weighed it, \nbut it weighs as heavy as 484 pages. Yet we will not be one whit closer \nto homeland security if it passes.\n  If the House and Senate wanted to provide true protections, we would \nbe working to complete action on the appropriations bills instead of \nplaying this gargantuan shell game. If the President wanted to do more \nthan score political points in a rehashed retread of a stump speech, he \nwould loose the bonds, he would cut the handcuffs from the House \nleadership and urge them to pass appropriations bills which contain \ncritical homeland security funds that could provide real protection for \nour people, and provide it quickly.\n  Those dollars could make a difference today. Those dollars and the \nprotections they would fund could save people's lives. We need not wait \nfor a new Department to set up yet another huge bureaucracy. Instead, \nthe House leadership is stuck in concrete. The appropriations bills may \nnever see the light of day. There are 11 of them--11 of them--that have \nbeen reported from the Senate Appropriations Committee. They may never \nsee the light of day, and the security of American people continues to \nbe at risk.\n  How many tape recordings of Osama bin Laden do we need to hear before \nwe start to take immediate action to protect ourselves in a meaningful \nway, not in a sham, sham legislative procedure that will produce \nanother massive bill, massive shift of power, in a massive new \nbureaucracy? How many more threats do we need to hear? How many more \nthreats need to be made?\n  Just in recent times, in recent hours the newspapers are reporting \nthat U.S. intelligence officials believe that terrorist groups may be \nplanning a new wave of attacks on Western targets. According to these \nreports, our intelligence agencies have detected a significant spike in \nintelligence chatter during the last 10 days that strongly indicate new \nassaults are being planned.\n  What more warning do we need? Do we have to wait until the chatter \nturns into screams of terror? Do we really believe this new Department \nof Homeland Security will provide the immediate protections that are so \ndesperately needed? We are not only fooling ourselves, we are also \njeopardizing the lives of the American people.\n  The new Department of Homeland Security will provide no immediate \nsecurity--none. The legislation gives the President another year in \nwhich to put the pieces of this Department together. That is a year \nwithout any significant improvements to our Nation's protections. Maybe \nwe should rename this the Department of Homeland Security Delay.\n  The appropriations bills, on the other hand, that are languishing in \nthe other body controlled by the President's party would provide real \nsecurity right now. All we have to do is just enact them.\n  The Senate Appropriations Committee reported appropriations bills for \nfiscal year 2003 that contained a total of $25.6 billion for homeland \ndefense funding.\n  That is a lot of money, $25.6 billion for homeland defense. That is \nreal money for the real defense of our homeland that could be available \nnow, under our committee-reported bill, if the House Republican \nleadership on the other side of the Capitol could get White House \npermission to complete action on those appropriations bills. It could \nbe done now.\n  The House is getting ready to leave town. They do not have to leave \ntown. They could stay in town. We ought to pass those appropriations \nbills. That is money available now to protect lives and prevent future \nattacks. But under this constant stream of continuing resolutions, many \nhomeland defense investments cannot take place.\n  The Commerce Justice State appropriations bill, the Treasury \nappropriations bill, the Agriculture appropriations bill, the VA/HUD \nappropriations bill, the Labor, Health and Human Services \nappropriations bill, these are fancy names that probably do not mean \nthat much to anyone listening, but to the security and safety of the \nAmerican people, these bills mean a whole lot more than a new \nletterhead on the same old Government stationery, which will come about \nas a result of the passage of this 484-page bill.\n  Instead, we are being told to create this new bureaucracy and put \nfunding for homeland security on autopilot with a constant stream of \ncontinuing resolutions. It is an irresponsible path and one I hope \nCongress has the wisdom to avoid. The Senate's VA/HUD and Commerce \nJustice State appropriations bills provide more than $3.5 billion for \npolice officers, for firefighters, and for other first responders. That \nis $3.5 billion that could be made available next week. All that has to \nbe done is for the House to get the signal from the executive branch \nwhich controls the Republican leadership in the House. All that is \nneeded is for the White House to unloose the shackles that are on the \nHouse leadership and say, pass that appropriations bill. We restored \nover $1 billion of cuts the President proposed for State and local law \nenforcement programs. That is real safety, without any delay.\n\n  What is the administration's response? The administration says we are \nspending too much money on the security of the American people.\n  Mr. President, you cannot place a price tag on homeland security. You \ncannot protect lives on the cheap.\n  The Senate Labor, Health and Human Services appropriations bill \nprovides $3.8 billion to protect against biological and chemical \nweapons. We know that terrorists have them. We are fools if we do not \ninvest in defenses against these weapons. The funds in these \nappropriations bills help to provide real savings now, without delay. \nYou do not have to wait on passing a 484-page bill which cannot be \nimplemented for another 12 months.\n  What is the President's response? Hold the line on the \nappropriations, he says. Hold the line. He has stopped the House \nRepublican leadership from allowing these investments in homeland \nsecurity to move forward.\n\n[[Page S11038]]\n\n  Mr. President--I am talking to the President at the other end of the \navenue--you cannot place a price tag on homeland security. You cannot \nprotect lives on the cheap.\n  The Senate Agriculture appropriations bill includes more than $150 \nmillion for the Food and Drug Administration to ensure our food supply \nis protected from terrorism and to accelerate the development and \napproval of medicines and tests to protect Americans from bioterrorism \nagents. This is a real saving. There is no delay here. Just pass the \nappropriations bill. We stand ready. But the administration has the \nhandcuffs on the House leadership.\n  Apparently the administration thinks a safe food supply and vaccines \nto counter anthrax are too expensive. I say once again, a price tag \ncannot be placed on homeland security. You cannot protect lives on the \ncheap.\n  Take the Senate Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill. It funds \nnew FBI agents. The Treasury appropriations bill funds critical border \nsecurity initiatives. These bills represent billions of dollars for \nhomeland security. They help to provide real safety without delay, but \nregrettably the White House says no deal. According to this \nadministration, the price is too high.\n  In my 50 years in Congress, if the Lord lets me live a few more days, \nthis is the most cynical and potentially most devastating political \ngame any administration has ever played. I am talking about \nadministrations under Republican Presidents and under Democratic \nPresidents.\n  While funding battles are not uncommon and while many Congresses and \nadministrations have not agreed on all the priorities, there has never \nbeen such a dispute that threatens the security of the American people. \nThis administration would rather protect its political backside than \nthe lives of this Nation's citizens. It is a calculated, cynical, \nmanipulative, and irresponsible approach that I pray does not result in \nlost lives.\n  It disgusts me that the President has worked with the House \nRepublican leadership to delay these appropriations bills. That is \nexactly what has happened. You mark my word. After the new year, when \nthere is a new administration that takes over and this body goes under \nRepublican control, as the other body will be under Republican control, \nyou watch how fast those appropriations bill will pass. They will then \npass, and this administration will be able to say; see now how things \nwork under this new administration, how fast we get things done. I \nthink that is the game we will see.\n\n  In fact, at the administration's urging, the House of Representatives \nhas not considered a regular appropriations bill in 16 weeks. That is 4 \nmonths. And the White House machinations have not stopped at the \nregular appropriations bills. At the direction of the administration, \n$8.9 billion for homeland security investments were squeezed out of \nsupplemental appropriations bills approved unanimously by the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, made up of 15 Democrats and 14 Republicans. \nIf the President were serious about homeland security, we would do far \nmore than simply pass a feel-good bill of 484 pages that creates a new \ndepartment. We would pass these appropriations bills. We would train \nour first responders. We would provide them with equipment to carry out \ntheir mission of protecting the American people. We would put more \nagents on the borders. We would close the security loopholes in our \nports. We would buy vaccines and increase our capacity to handle an \nattack using a biological weapon. We would invest in immediate homeland \nsecurity initiatives and not rely on a campaign slogan to protect us 6 \nmonths or 1 year or even 5 years from now.\n  I hope we will not try to sell the American people this bill of goods \non homeland security. It is nothing but snake oil. A new department \nwould be welcome, but it will not be enough. We need to do much more \nand we need to do it quickly.\n  The Senate Appropriations Committee reported appropriations bills for \nfiscal year 2003 that contained a total of $25.6 billion for non-DOD \nhomeland defense funding, an increase of $5 billion over the levels \napproved last year. That is real money for the defense of our homeland \nthat could be available now, under our committee-reported bills for \nfiscal year 2003, if the White House would but take off the shackles \nfrom the House Appropriations Committee and let it work, let it \ncomplete action on the bills in the regular manner.\n\n  This authorizing bill we are debating right now provides nothing \nimmediately for homeland defense. It has a 12-month transition period \nbuilt into it. It sounds good. It will make a good headline. But it \ndoes nothing immediately to increase the security of our country. The \nappropriations bills, on the other hand, would do something \nimmediately. Right now, all we have to do is enact. That is real money \nfor real protection.\n  Under the continuing resolution we are operating under now, the \nsignificant increases for homeland defense funding that we approved in \nour committee bills cannot take place. Let me give some examples of \nwhat will not be funded under the continuing resolution.\n  Under the continuing resolution, only $651 million will be available \nfor the Office of Domestic Preparedness to train and equip State and \nlocal law enforcement personnel to handle biological and chemical \nweapons, this compared to $2 billion that would be available in the \nSenate Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill. Crucial bioterrorism \nresearch will be postponed. The Senate Labor-HHS appropriations bill \nprovided nearly $1.5 billion for bioterrorism activities at the \nNational Institutes of Health. This would fund research and \ninfrastructure improvements necessary to develop countermeasures \nagainst smallpox, anthrax, and other deadly pathogens. Bioterrorism \nfunding for NIH under a long-term continuing resolution would be \nlimited to approximately $107 million.\n  The fiscal year 2003 Senate bill contains a large increase for \nhospital preparedness funding. Why worry about local hospitals? Again, \njust today news accounts detail a warning from the FBI to hospitals in \nHouston, San Francisco, Chicago, and Washington, DC, that they may be \ntargets of a terrorist threat perhaps from anthrax. That is getting \nclose to home, Washington, DC. The $593 million worth of grants in the \nSenate appropriations bill are necessary to make sure hospitals have \nthe proper equipment, the staff, and the training to handle a \nbioterrorism attack. A long-term continuing resolution, however, would \nprovide only $129 million in fiscal year 2003 for this activity. In \ntotal, a long-term continuing resolution for the Labor-HHS bill would \nprovide only $1.8 billion for bioterrorism preparedness in fiscal year \n2003. This is $2 billion less than the committee-reported \nappropriations bill. What a difference.\n  Under the continuing resolution, only $540 million would be available \nto local fire departments, from FEMA, for training and equipping \nfiremen for weapons of mass destruction. For fiscal year 2003, the \nSenate committee VA-HUD appropriations bill provided a total of $900 \nmillion for the fire grant program.\n  On September 11, 2001, in New York City, we learned that fire and \npolice could not communicate by radio, undermining the response to \nthose vicious terrorist attacks. This is a nationwide problem. We found \nthat out as we conducted testimony on our appropriations bills earlier \nthis year in hearings conducted by the Senate Appropriations Committee. \nWe included $180 million in the committee bill for grants for \ninteroperable communications equipment for firefighters, none of which \nwould be available under the continuing resolution. Under the \ncontinuing resolution, $180 million that the committee approved for \ngrants to upgrade State and local emergency operation centers would not \nbe funded and $75 million for grants to upgrade FEMA's 28 research and \nrescue teams would not be funded.\n\n  The Coast Guard is also one of the largest agencies to be included in \nthe new Department of Homeland Security. The Coast Guard just signed \nthe largest procurement contract in the history of the entire \nDepartment of Transportation, the so-called deep water capability \nreplacement project. It is a comprehensive effort to modernize the \nCoast Guard's aging fleet of ships, planes, and helicopters so that the \nagency can better execute its homeland security and other missions.\n\n[[Page S11039]]\n\n  Under the continuing resolution--that is what we will be operating \nunder--the Coast Guard will have to start delaying the procurement of \nlong-range aircraft as soon as December. In fact, due to the absence of \nadequate funding, the Coast Guard will have to start paying contract \npenalties totaling $500,000 per month.\n  So at the same time as the Coast Guard is being merged into the new \nhomeland security agency, the inadequate funding provided under the \ncontinuing resolution will mean the Coast Guard will delay the \nprocurement of critical homeland security aircraft while simultaneously \nwasting half a million of the taxpayers' dollars every month on \ncontract penalties.\n  The Senate committee Treasury-general government bill added $18 \nmillion to the Customs Service for container security administration. \nThis funding allows for inspection of shipping containers before they \nreach U.S. ports. Currently, only 2 percent of the containers that come \ninto this country are inspected. Yet this funding will not be available \nunder the continuing resolution.\n  The Senate committee energy and water bill includes $64 million to \nprovide for the security guards at critical Corps of Engineer \ninfrastructure sites. Under a long-term continuing resolution, this \nfunding would not be available. Pass the appropriations bill. There is \nthe money. It is available.\n  This Congress faces a choice. Despite its myriad problems, we will \nlikely pass this legislation to create a Department of Homeland \nSecurity. The President will make his speeches to try to convince the \nAmerican people to feel good. My, we can feel good about this new \nDepartment we will have created. What the President will not tell the \nAmerican people is that the shiny new Department will not be effective \nuntil far into the future. What he will not tell the American people is \nthat in the interim, they--the American people--may be less safe rather \nthan more safe because of the chaos and confusion inherent in massive \nGovernment reorganizations. What he will not tell the American people \nis that he continues--he, the President--to block investments that \nwould help to protect the American people from terrorist attacks today.\n  If we truly want to protect our constituents, if we truly want to \nmake a difference in our constituents' lives, we will provide the funds \nthat are so critically needed. We will support the FBI. We will support \nthe police officers. The funds will support our firefighters in our \nhometown. We will strengthen our border patrols and our port security. \nWe will take steps to fight terrorism today. We will not wait until the \nstation is ready at the new Department of Homeland Security. The price \nof continued delay is simply too great to fathom.\n\n  Mr. President:\n\n       The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,\n       Moves on; nor all your Piety nor Wit\n       Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,\n       Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it.\n\n  So, Mr. President, tonight I am writing the record. I will not have \nthat opportunity tomorrow because on tomorrow the Senate will vote to \ninvoke cloture. I urge Senators not to do that, not to vote to invoke \ncloture tomorrow. Senators should give themselves more time, give their \nstaffs more time to study these 484 pages in this new bill, this bill \nthat has not seen a committee witness, this bill that has not been in a \ncommittee room, this bill that was unknown to the Members of this \nSenate 48 hours ago--a massive bill providing for a massive shift of \npower to the President of the United States. And once that power is \nshifted, Senators, remember, it is going to be very difficult to \nretrieve that power. Yet the legislative branch is just about to do \nthat.\n  The executive branch never hesitates to stand up in defense of its \nprerogatives. The judicial branch never hesitates to stand up in \ndefense of its prerogatives. But the same cannot be said of the \nlegislative branch. Nearly always in the legislative branch, half of \nthe branch is made up of supporters of the administration. If it were a \nmonarchy, these would be supporters of the king. If it were in the days \nof the Revolution, they would be Tories. Half the legislative branch \nstands up in the defense of the king, in the defense of the executive \nbranch. Only half, if that many, stand up in defense of the legislative \nbranch. Yet we all in this legislative branch, whether we are members \nof the party that controls the administration or not, we stand before \nthat desk up there and we lift our hand to Almighty God and we put a \nhand upon the Holy Bible and we swear an oath to support and defend the \nConstitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and \ndomestic.\n  Are we doing that? Are we supporting and defending this Constitution \nwhich provides for a balance of powers, a separation of powers, three \ndepartments equally balanced? Is that what we are supporting? That is \nwhat we swore to support. That is what we swore we would support. But \nnot all of us are going to vote that way.\n  There are half of us in the two bodies, roughly speaking, who are \nalways ready to run to the executive branch and uphold the executive \nbranch against our own nest, against the legislative branch. I hope it \nwill not be that way tomorrow. I hope that Senators will say whoa, \nwhoa, whoa, just hold on here; let's just wait a little bit. Let's \ndon't vote for cloture today. Let's have a few more days to debate this \nlegislation, see what's in it, offer amendments to it, clean it up, \nprotect the American people, their liberties and their rights. I call \nupon Senators to do that.\n  I have watched the Senate floor today. I have heard the assertion \nmade that the Senate has been considering the pending homeland security \nbill for 7 weeks now. Let's be clear about that. The Senate just \nreceived this homeland security bill, not 7 weeks ago but just the \nnight before yesterday. We have had access to it for 36 to 48 hours, \nperhaps. The Senate did spend 7 weeks debating another homeland \nsecurity bill, but that bill is no longer before the Senate. That bill \nis no longer before the Senate. All of those weeks of debate and \namendments have been thrown out the window. In its place we are now \ndebating a new bill, crafted in secret, crafted behind the shades and \ncurtains of darkness; a new bill which many of us have not had the time \nto read because we just received it. I haven't had time to read it. I \nhave only read parts of it. I haven't had time to read this bill.\n\n  We were not involved in drafting this bill. I had nothing to do with \nthe drafting of that bill. It did not go through the committee process. \nThere were no hearings, no markups. It was drafted, not unlike the \nPresident's plan, behind closed doors and hidden away from the eyes of \nthe American public. So I must say I am a little distressed when I hear \nSenators saying that the Congress should pass this bill quickly because \nwe have exhausted debate on it.\n  I grow even more distressed when I read in this morning's papers that \na number of controversial provisions had been quietly inserted into \nthis new bill in the hopes that no one would notice them before the \nbill passed.\n  Congress Daily reported this morning that provisions have been \ninserted into this bill to eliminate or reduce a manufacturer's product \nliability. Sure enough, title VIII of the new bill would authorize the \nnew Homeland Security Secretary to provide manufacturers with liability \nprotections for a broad range of items, from drugs to life preservers, \nin case such equipment malfunctions or does not work. According to the \nDemocratic staff of the Governmental Affairs Committee, even if \nmanufacturers sold equipment, technology, or drugs that they knew would \nnot work as intended, the manufacturer could not be held liable for \npunitive damages unless he knowingly participated in the terrorist act \ngiving rise to the injuries.\n  Do Senators know that? Do Senators know that this bill does just \nthat? Exactly. Do Senators know that?\n  Congress Daily reports that limited liability protections already in \nplace for vaccines would be expanded in this bill to include vaccine \ncomponents such as the preservative Thimerosal, manufactured by Eli \nLilly and Company. These drugs, I am informed, are already the subject \nof class action lawsuits by parents who claim the product's high \nmercury levels have caused their children's autism.\n  I have heard other Senators expressing dismay about these provisions \nthat have been slipped into this bill. I have heard other Senators \nexpressing puzzlement, dismay, consternation, surprise--to find such \nprovisions, to find\n\n[[Page S11040]]\n\nthis bill as it is. And yet we are being asked to invoke cloture \ntomorrow, invoke cloture so that we limit ourselves in future debate to \n30 hours, a total of 30 hours on this bill.\n  The American people out there don't know this. The American people \nare being told that this is a great bill, this is a good bill, we are \nabout to create a Department of Homeland Security and you will all be \nsafer, ladies and gentlemen, out there in the hills and the prairies \nand the valleys and the mountains. You will all be safer.\n\n  The American people are being hoodwinked. We are complicitous in \ngoing along with the idea--going along with this sham. We are all \nguilty of going along with this. Yet we are going to invoke cloture on \nourselves. We are going to invoke the gag rule.\n  We hear that this Senate is the greatest deliberative body in the \nworld--greatest deliberative body in the world, the Senate of the \nUnited States. Yet we have been on this bill now parts of 2 days--just \nparts--and tomorrow morning we are going to put the gag rule on. We are \ngoing to invoke cloture so that we will deprive ourselves of the \nopportunity and we will deprive ourselves willingly of the opportunity \nto expose the weaknesses of this bill--to expose to the people who send \nus here, the judges of our political fortunes. We are going to say no \nto the people who send us here when we put this gag rule into effect \nand say to ourselves that we are not going to be interested in debating \nthis longer than 30 hours, if that much time is used. We are saying to \nthe American people who send us here we are putting the gag rule on \nyou. We are putting the blindfolder on you.\n  How many of us would like to go to the American people in the next \ncampaign for reelection and tell them that we believe in blindfolding \nthem, and we don't believe they should know what is in this bill. It \nhas some good provisions, I am sure, but we are willing to shut \nourselves off here.\n  This is a bad bill--bad because there are some provisions in it that \nare bad--not all but some provisions in it are bad. Some provisions we \ndon't even know about. We intend to vote on it--pig in a poke, \nblindfold ourselves, gag ourselves. We are willing to do that.\n  Are we willing to draw our moneys, our salaries? The American people \npay us to represent them, to protect them, to protect their liberties, \nto protect their Constitution. If the American people knew that there \nwere certain provisions in here of which some Senators were just \nbecoming aware, the American people would say to all of us: Hold up. \nTake a look at that bill. Don't you vote for that homeland security \nbill until you fully know what you are doing. They would say: Hold up \nhere. Don't you come back to me asking for my vote again if you are \ngoing to vote to hoodwink the American people by shutting off debate so \nyou can get out of there, so you can go home. We ought to be right \nhere. Here is where we ought to be until we know what is in this bill. \nWe ought not pass this bill now. We ought to pass the appropriations \nbills that provide real homeland security for the American people.\n  So these drugs, as I say, are already the subject of class action \nlawsuits by parents who claim the products with high mercury levels \nhave caused their children's autism. Is this what the President's \nhomeland security proposal is really all about--exempting multibillion-\ndollar pharmaceutical companies from lawsuits when the products they \nsell to the American public do not function properly or, even worse, \ninjure or kill somebody--multibillion-dollar companies from lawsuits \nwhen the technological products they sell to the American people do not \nfunction properly? What is this? Is this a payoff for those companies \nfor their contributions in the past election?\n  Yet another provision in the bill would require liability claims \nagainst smallpox vaccine manufacturers to go through the Federal tort \nsystem.\n  Let me say that again.\n  Yet another provision in the bill would require liability claims \nagainst smallpox vaccine manufacturers to go through the Federal tort \nsystem. The Federal Government would pay the damages. And punitive \ndamages would be banned.\n\n  The new bill also would limit liabilities for airport screening \ncompanies and high-tech firms that develop equipment for domestic \nsecurity. It would aid the airline industry by extending aviation war-\nrisk insurance for a year, and giving airports another year to install \nbaggage screening equipment.\n  I wonder how many Senators know that provision is in this bill.\n  According to the New York Times, the bill would reverse an earlier \nmeasure and allow American companies that have moved offshore in order \nto evade taxes to contract with the Homeland Security Department.\n  How about that? How many Senators know that? Let me say that again.\n  The bill would reverse an earlier measure and allow American \ncompanies that have moved offshore in order to evade taxes to contract \nwith the Homeland Security Department.\n  These kinds of provisions underscore just how ridiculous this \nhomeland security debate has become. Anyone who opposes this \nlegislation will be labeled unpatriotic. You can count on that. The \nsting of that political attack is enough to allow gobs of complete and \nutter junk to be shoved in this bill and shoved through the Congress \nwith lightning speed. The fear of being subjected to utterly vile \ncampaign political attacks is allowing a slew of dangerous provisions--\nprovisions that would never ever get through on their own--to be pushed \nalong with hardly a glance. Just hold your nose, pinch it, and vote for \ncloture and vote for this bill. Go home feeling good. Oh, we passed \nsome feel-good legislation. Whoopee, great, hot diggedy dog. We passed \na piece of feel-good legislation.\n  The American people should be afraid. The American people should be \nvery afraid not only of Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein but of the \nmonumental cynicism driven by this White House, and regrettably \nunopposed by this body.\n  Mr. President, I apologize to the Senate, to the staff, to the pages, \nall who work in this body--they work hard; they work long hours--for \ndetaining you from going home early and getting an early supper. We \ncall it supper down in West Virginia. Call it dinner, if you wish. We \nhave kept you waiting, and I apologize for my part. Who else has done \nit? I am the one rascal here who has kept you waiting. I apologize for \nthat.\n  Had we not been faced with a cloture vote tomorrow, I could have \nwaited until tomorrow and said these things. But when else am I \nsupposed to say it? If cloture is invoked tomorrow, I will have no \nopportunity to say it. Then we only have 30 hours--all of us, 100 \nSenators have 30 hours--and I suppose that is an hour each at most.\n  There is a record standing. There is a record that stands with him \nwho holds the waters in his hands; there is a record that stands. That \nrecord will be written, and it will be there for the next thousand \nyears for all who want to read it.\n  I believe the American people expect us to oppose this way of \nlegislating. It is not as our children are being told the way to make \nlaws.\n  Mr. President, I end my remarks, as I began them earlier today, by \nreading from 1st Corinthians, chapter 14, verse 8 and verse 9:\n\n       For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall \n     prepare himself to the battle?\n       So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to \n     be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? For ye \n     shall speak into the air.\n\n  Mr. President, that is the way I began my remarks. If we pass this \nbill, we are going to be the trumpet that gives forth an uncertain \nsound. The American people are going to be told, and they are going to \nbelieve, that they are made more safe, but we will have sent forth an \nuncertain sound. The people will not be made more safe by this piece of \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have two short statements that I would \nlike to make concerning this legislation. The first deals with the use \nof appropriated funds.\n  As my colleagues know, one of the major issues confronting Congress \nwith respect to establishing the Department of Homeland Security was \nthe extent to which the Homeland Secretary would be given the authority \nto transfer funds between appropriations accounts or among the \norganizations and programs within the new Department.\n\n[[Page S11041]]\n\n  Underlying this issue are two critical questions--how best to give \nthe Homeland Secretary the flexibility he or she needs to organize and \noperate the new Department, and how best to preserve the Congress's \nconstitutional authority to appropriate funds and to oversee their use.\n  Previous versions of the Homeland Security Department legislation \nincluded extensive language governing how the Department would allocate \nand use appropriated funds and funds generated through property \ndisposal or gifts from outside the Federal Government.\n  The compromise embodied in the final version of the Homeland Security \nDepartment legislation now before us takes a somewhat different \napproach, but the net effect is the same: Congress's appropriations \nauthorities are maintained. Transferred funds must be used for the \npurposes for which they were appropriated, and Congress must approve, \nin advance, the reallocation of transferred funds away from their \noriginally intended purposes.\n  Language added to the final bill reinforces the requirement that \npersonnel, assets, and obligations transferred to the new Department \nshall be allocated in accordance with section 1531(a)(2) of title 31, \nUnited States Code. That section of permanent law requires that funds \ntransferred within or between Executive branch agencies to finance \ntransferred functions or activities must be used for a purpose for \nwhich the appropriation was originally available.\n  During the final negotiations on this bill, any language dealing \ndirectly with use of the general authority to transfer funds was \ndropped, since it is an authorization act. That authority will be \nincluded in the continuing resolution that I hope we will pass to keep \nthe Federal Government functioning after we adjourn or recess this \nyear. Since virtually every annual appropriations act includes general \ntransfer authority language, the negotiators agreed that it was more \nconsistent and effective to include the new Department's transfer \nauthority in an appropriations act. The continuing resolution is our \nfirst appropriations opportunity to accomplish this objective. I intend \nto see to it that it will be in the resolution if at all possible, and \nI believe it is already agreed to.\n  The negotiators did retain in the authorization bill the language \nregarding property disposal and gifts. The language also requires that \nthe new Department submit a detailed budget request annually beginning \nwith fiscal year 2004. That will be the request we receive next year.\n  The continuing resolution language provides general transfer \nauthority of $500 million for fiscal year 2003 and the same amount in \nfiscal year 2004. It stipulates that this authority may not be used \nunless for higher priority items, based on unforeseen homeland security \nrequirements, than those for which originally appropriated and in no \ncase where the item for which funds are requested has been denied by \nthe Congress. The language provides an additional $140 million in \ntransfer authority for fiscal year 2003 for the salaries and expenses \nassociated with the initiation of the Department.\n\n  The appropriations language further requires that the Senate and \nHouse Committees on Appropriations receive 15 days' advance notice \nbefore any funding transfer is made, and it establishes that the new \nDepartment will submit formal reprogramming requests to these \ncommittees for any proposed funding transfer. The language further \nstipulates that, of the total amount of transfer authority provided, \nand except as otherwise specifically authorized by law, not to exceed \ntwo percent of any appropriations available to the Home Secretary may \nbe transferred between appropriations. I am satisfied those meet our \ngeneral requirements, although they are not in the original request I \nmade in the Governmental Affairs Committee on which I serve.\n  In many respects, these provisions mirror language that is included \nannually in every Department of Defense Appropriations Act. In \naddition, use of transfer authority would be subject to approval or \ndisapproval in writing by the Committees on Appropriations, which would \nreview reprogramming requests submitted and considered under \nestablished procedures based on the reprogramming procedures used by \nthe Defense Department and Congress for defense transfer authority \nactions. We intend to mirror the procedure that has been used so \nsuccessfully with regard to defense matters when we are reviewing \nnational security matters.\n  Finally, the authorization bill includes a provision intended to help \nCongress to assess the long-term funding requirements for the new \nDepartment. That provision requires annual submission of a Future Years \nHomeland Security Program that projects spending requirements for at \nleast five fiscal years. This detailed, multi-year document is due \nbeginning with the fiscal year 2005 budget request.\n  The final authorization language, and the language in the continuing \nresolution, preserve the statutory and administrative requirements \nneeded to ensure that any funds made available to the new Department \nare used effectively and efficiently and according to the will of the \npeople as reflected through their elected Senators and Representatives.\n  This language, and the annual appropriations process, ensure that the \nHomeland Security has the appropriate authorities to organize and \noperate the new Department, and that Congress will remain directly \nengaged in deciding how appropriated funds are used, or reallocated, by \nthe Executive branch.\n  In so doing, I believe, and it has been my intent working with the \ndistinguished chairman, that this language preserves Congress's \nConstitutional and rightful role in our government--a role that the \nFounding Fathers intended and that our constituents demand. Our \nconstitutional oath requires Members to assure that our constituents' \ndemand for our oversight will be fulfilled.\n  I have a second short statement. I have been very interested in \npreserving the Coast Guard's non-homeland security mission performance \nunder this bill. I will discuss for the Senate today a vitally \nimportant section of the homeland security legislation that we consider \nhere.\n  This section--Section 888--is entitled ``Preserving Coast Guard \nMission Importance,'' and its implementation is essential to \nmaintaining without significant reduction the Coast Guard's non-\nhomeland security capabilities and missions.\n  We all recognize the critical homeland security missions the Coast \nGuard performs. However, it is just as critical to the United States \nthat the Coast guard effectively and successfully accomplish its non-\nhomeland security missions. The criticality of these non-homeland \nsecurity missions extends far beyond the 30 coastal and Great Lake \nstates. These non-homeland security missions affect the maritime \nsafety, law enforcement, environmental conditions, and economic \nsecurity of our entire nation.\n  The Coast Guard's non-homeland security missions are marine safety, \nsearch and rescue, aids to navigation, living marine resources--\nincluding fisheries law enforcement, marine environmental protection, \nand ice operations.\n  All these missions are critical to the well-being of Alaskans, and we \nrely on the Coast Guard virtually every day for protection and \nassistance in these mission areas. I am confident that my colleagues \nwho also will speak on this section of the bill will attest further to \nthe importance to their states and to the rest of the nation of \npreserving the Coast Guard's vital non-homeland security capabilities \nand missions.\n  Preserving these missions and capabilities is the fundamental intent \nand purpose of Section 888.\n  The Coast Guard cannot accomplish its non-homeland security missions \neffectively and successfully unless its current capabilities in these \nareas are preserved intact and without significant reduction. Section \n888 mandates the preservation of these capabilities, and of the Coast \nGuard's authorities and functions in these areas, unless Congress \nspecifies otherwise in subsequent acts.\n  I would add at this point that, since September 11, 2001, the Coast \nGuard has assumed greatly expanded homeland security responsibilities \nwithout seeing a reduction in its non-homeland security requirements. \nThis is a strong justification for allocating even more total resources \nto the Coast Guard on an annual and long-term basis.\n\n[[Page S11042]]\n\n  Section 888 further reinforces and protects the Coast Guard's non-\nhomeland security missions and capabilities by preventing the diversion \nof any mission, function, or asset--including ships, aircraft, and \nhelicopters--to the principal and continuing use of any other \norganization, unit, or entity of the Homeland Security Department. This \nrestriction is intended to minimize, if not eliminate, any prospect of \nthe diversion from the Coast Guard of the personnel, equipment or other \nresources needed to perform its non-homeland security missions. \nPersonnel details or assignments that do not reduce the Coast Guard's \ncapability to perform these missions are permitted.\n  Section 888 further prohibits the Homeland Secretary from reducing \nthe Coast Guard's non-homeland security missions and capabilities \nsubstantially or significantly unless Congress specifies otherwise in \nsubsequent Acts.\n  The Homeland Security Secretary may waive this restriction for no \nmore than 90 days, but he or she must first declare and certify to \nCongress that a clear, compelling, and immediate need exists for such a \nwaiver.\n  If he or she exercises the waiver authority, the Homeland Secretary \nmust submit to Congress a detailed justification. Thus, the elected \nSenators and Representatives of the American people will have an \nopportunity to determine whether they agree or disagree with the \nwaiver. We will have the opportunity to assess the impact of such a \nwaiver on the Coast Guard's non-homeland security missions and to make \nour views known should there be any cause for concerns.\n  The language in Section 888 does provide more flexibility than the \nCoast Guard-related language in the earlier versions of the Homeland \nSecurity Department bills that we have been debating since July. \nHowever, this latest language still will protect the Coast Guard from \nany major changes to its non-homeland security missions and \ncapabilities because it clearly does not provide the authority to make \nwholesale and sweeping changes in these areas.\n  This final language also includes other important provisions that \nwill contribute to the Coast Guard's overall well-being and \neffectiveness as part of the new Homeland Security Department, as well \nas help preserve its non-homeland security missions and capabilities. \nThese provisions have been carried over from at least one of the \nprevious versions of the legislation, or they have been crafted to \nfurther enhance the Coast Guard's position in the new Department.\n  These provisions include language transferring the Coast Guard to the \nnew Department as a freestanding and distinct entity that is not under \nthe jurisdiction of any of the Department's new directorates, and \nlanguage ensuring that the Service's Commandant shall report directly \nto the Homeland Secretary without being required to report through any \nother departmental official.\n  Take separately and together, these subsections strengthen the \ninstitutional position of the Coast Guard and the Commandant within the \nDepartment, thus enhancing the Service's ability to compete for \nresources and to influence policy in both the non-homeland security and \nhomeland security areas. They are an unambiguous statement by the \nCongress about the importance of the Coast Guard and all its missions \nwithin the Department.\n  Another subsection requires the new Department's Inspector General to \nreport annually to Congress on the mission performance of the Coast \nGuard, with a particular emphasis on the non-homeland security \nmissions. This information should help Congress identify whether \nadditional actions are needed to preserve these non-homeland security \nmissions and capabilities.\n  The Homeland Secretary also is required by another subsection to \nreport to Congress not later than 90 days after enactment of the Act on \nwhether the procurement rate in the Service's top-priority \nmodernization program--the integrated deepwater system--can be \naccelerated by 10 years. Timely implementation of the Deepwater program \nis essential to maintaining and improving the Coast Guard's \ncapabilities to accomplish all its missions. Congress should consider \nwhether accelerating the program is an affordable and cost-effective \nway to accomplish these objectives, especially in the non-homeland \nsecurity area.\n  A final subsection ensures that the conditions and restrictions in \nSection 888 shall not apply when the Coast Guard operates as a service \nin the Navy under section 3 of title 14, United States code. It would \nbe inappropriate to apply these conditions and restrictions under such \ncircumstances. Under section 3 of title 14, the Coast Guard becomes \npart of the Navy in Wartime or as directed by the President.\n  In summary, Section 888 resulted from productive negotiations with \nthe White House and our House colleagues during which all sides strived \nto make reasonable compromises that would enable Congress to pass a \nfinal version of the Homeland Security Department legislation during \nthis post-election session. Refinements suggested by the Coast Guard \nalso are included in the language.\n  The language maintains the structural and operational integrity of \nthe Coast Guard, the authority of the Commandant, the non-homeland \nsecurity missions of the Coast Guard, and the Service's capabilities to \ncarry out these missions even as it is transferred to the new \nDepartment. The language is clearly intended to assure that the \nimportant homeland security priorities of the new Department will not \neclipse the Coast Guard's crucial non-homeland security missions and \ncapabilities.\n  Section 888 strikes the right balance at this time between \nmaintaining the Coast Guard's vital non-homeland security missions and \ncapabilities and permitting it to carry out important homeland security \nresponsibilities.\n  Just as importantly, this language and the annual appropriations \nprocess, ensure that Congress will remain directly engaged in deciding \nthe extent to which any significant changes occur in the future to the \nCoast Guard's non-homeland security missions and capabilities. \nCongress's continued and direct engagement in such matters is essential \ngiven the importance to the American people of these missions and \ncapabilities.\n  And again, these missions and capabilities are vital to my State of \nAlaska.\n  I thank my distinguished friend for allowing me to make these two \nstatements. I am late to a meeting. I wanted to make sure we explained \nto the Senate what we have done in modifying this bill.\n  I know it does not meet totally the requirements and approval of my \nfriend from West Virginia. But I do think, under the circumstances, \nthat we will have this continued role of supervision and we will retain \nthe same type of control over reprogrammings of the new Homeland \nSecurity Department that we have over the Department of Defense. We \nshould be able to continue in the future the same kind of Congressional \nconnection to the changes in the use of funds--and there will be \nchanges, based on changing priorities, changing circumstances--and we \nare part of that process. It will not be done without the prior \napproval of Congress.\n  I think I can assure my friend, in my judgment, we have preserved to \nthe maximum extent possible our constitutional role in this process as \nit goes forward. There is no question every appropriations bill \nannually will address this issue and we will address it as we have in \nconnection with defense matters in the past.\n  I thank my friend from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator is welcome. I \nappreciate what he has said. I hope the Senator's assurances--I know \nthey are sincerely given--will prove to be direct and true. I must say \nI have great concerns about this legislation as it is written as to the \nverbiage that we find in this new package that is on our desks today. \nIt made its appearance yesterday. I hope the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska is accurate and that he is correct, and that the assurances \nwhich he has been given and which he is giving will prove to be the \ncase.\n  I have a great deal of confidence in my friend from Alaska. I have \nimplicit confidence in him. I have never had that confidence shaken. \nBut that confidence I have in him does not extend beyond him, I have to \nsay truthfully, to the people in this administration. But I do trust my \nfriend and I know he will try to his level best to see to it that the \nadministration deals fairly\n\n[[Page S11043]]\n\nand squarely with us in the appropriations process.\n  With that, I again thank him.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield----\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I give the Senator my assurance we will continue to work \ntogether to assure we maintain our constitutional role in the \nactivities of this new Department. But I also feel it is absolutely \nnecessary that this bill be passed this year because if it is not, \nregardless of the size of the bill, it will literally die at the end of \nDecember and we will have to start all over again. With the tensions \nfacing the world and challenges our Government faces to maintain \nhomeland security, it is absolutely essential we start forward. We have \na slight disagreement on that. But I do believe this bill gives us a \nframework to work with this subject.\n  I think the ongoing responsibility to assure the new Department will \ncontinue to be effective will primarily rest with the appropriations \nprocess. This will be an enormous demand, a new demand on our Treasury, \nto fund a wholly new type of homeland security.\n  We are consolidating a whole series of agencies, hopefully bringing \nabout some new efficiencies. But it will require increased money.\n  Senator Byrd and I have, will continue to have, the role of seeing to \nit the Senate's operations with regard to the appropriations process \nare fully understood by the new homeland security department and its \npersonnel, and that we will work effectively to see to it we fulfill \nour constitutional responsibility with regard to control of the \npeople's money.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator. I have \nnever seen anything in the demeanor of the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska, anything in his words, anything in his daily activities, the \nrecord he has made here, that would create any doubt, as far as I am \nconcerned, in him and his intention to carry this out. I have to say I \ndon't have the same kind of confidence in the people at the other end \nof the avenue. I think we are making a huge mistake in passing this \nbill at this time.\n  I think the appropriations the distinguished Senator from Alaska and \nI have worked together in making possible, along with the other members \nof our committee--I think those appropriations, which have not been \nsigned into law by the President, some of which have not passed the \nother body, and most of which have been held in check by the other body \nat the behest of the administration--those would have given to the \nAmerican people far more security than would this bill. But as to the \nSenator, my trust in him--as I said it before and I will say it again--\nis implicit. I have no doubt he intends to do the best he can to see \nthis appropriations process goes along as the Framers and as our \npredecessors have intended.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the critical distinctions \nbetween the legislation as reported out by the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee and the House passed bill, creating a Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  I think it is wise to proceed cautiously when creating a mega-\nDepartment of Homeland Security which would encompass approximately 22 \nagencies and involve about 170,000 employees. We all recognize that we \nface new threats, and we all recognize the need to better coordinate \nefforts to protect Americans from these threats. However, it is also \ncritically important, as the distinguished senior Senator from West \nVirginia has repeatedly noted, to consider carefully what is being \nproposed to ensure that any legislation enhances our security and does \nnot detract from it.\n  William Safire describes in Thursday's New York Times how the House \nproposed Homeland Security Act will create a computerized dossier on \nthe private life of every American citizen. I urge my colleagues to \nread Mr. Safire's prescient column entitled, ``You Are a Suspect''. His \narguments are one reason why we should proceed cautiously to creating a \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  The President compares the reorganization of agencies within the \nfederal government into a new Department of Homeland Security to the \ncreation of the Department of Defense after World War II. But the two \ndepartments that were combined to create the Department of Defense, the \nDepartment of the Army and the Department of the Navy, had the same \nprimary mission, to defend the United States. They had similar cultures \nand management priorities. This is not true of the proposed new \nDepartment of Homeland Security. Many of the agencies, such as the \nCoast Guard, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency, have varying missions, priorities \nand cultures.\n  Any far-reaching change to the structure of the federal government \ndemands thorough and open discussion. Senator Lieberman has done a \ngreat service to his country by holding hearings and debating \nextensively the structure of such a department. But there needs to be \nfurther debate and amendment to the proposal offered by the \nRepublicans.\n  Let me make a dozen points as to why the legislation reported out by \nour Governmental Affairs Committee, which was subjected to numerous \npublic hearings, represents an improvement over legislation passed by \nthe House last night and why the House proposal, supported by the \nPresident, is seriously flawed.\n  First, the House proposal raises serious concerns about the \ncollection, use, and dissemination of private information, the issue \naddressed by Mr. Safire. It gives the Secretary broad access to \ninformation relating to investigations and places restrictions on the \nauthority of the inspector general to conduct inquiries into the new \ndepartment's operations. Our committee substitute corrected this \noversight by creating both a strong Civil Rights Officer and a strong \nChief Privacy Officer.\n  The privacy officer would assist the Department with the development \nand implementation of policies and procedures to ensure that privacy \nconsiderations and safeguards are incorporated and implemented in \nprograms and activities, and that information is handled in a manner \nthat minimizes the risks of harm to individuals from inappropriate \ndisclosure. Such officers are necessary to protect Americans from \nencroachments on their civil liberties.\n  The committee-reported legislation created a powerful civil rights \nofficer, ensuring compliance with all civil rights laws, coordinating \nwith the administration, assisting in the development and \nimplementation of civil rights policies, and reporting to the Inspector \nGeneral on matters warranting further investigation. In contrast, the \nnew bill just passed by the House would only require the Civil Rights \nOfficer to review and assess alleged abuses and report to Congress. In \nthe House bill the Secretary appoints the officer and in the \nGovernmental Affairs committee-reported bill the President appoints and \nthe Senate confirms the officer, ensuring greater accountability. The \nCommittee alternative worked to ensure that civil rights were not \nviolated in the first instance.\n  The threat of a ``Big Brother'' new department cannot be \noveremphasized. With the President proposing programs like the \nTerrorism Information and Prevention System, Operation TIPS, a national \nprogram to encourage volunteers to report suspect activities to the \nDepartment of Justice, and the Department of Defense's new ``Total \nInformation Awareness,'' we need strong protections against violations \nof Americans' privacy and civil rights. The first defense of our \nfreedom comes from a system with checks and balances. The House \nproposal, supported by the President, does not contain sufficient \nchecks and balances.\n  Second, under the first House-passed bill and the President's \noriginal proposal, whistleblowers were not protected. Merit Systems \nProtection Board, MSPB, appeal rights as well as Office of Special \nCounsel, OSC, enforcement were not included. I am pleased to say that \nunder the proposal before us today, whistleblowers retain most of their \nrights. However, the bill does not go far enough. Due to the waiver of \ncollective bargaining rights, third-party arbitration may not be \nprotected for those federal employees who are union members and blow \nthe whistle. Third party arbitration is an effective way to resolve \nwhistle blower cases due to the hostile decisions of the Federal \nCircuit.\n  Third, the administration proposal transfers the Transportation \nSecurity\n\n[[Page S11044]]\n\nAgency, TSA, into the new department. Baggage screeners are our first \nline of defense against terrorism on our airlines, and they need to \nhave the same protections as our border patrol agents, INS employees, \nand custom inspectors so that they can come forward to disclose risks \nto our public health and safety. The committee's bill, as a result of \nan amendment offered by Senator Levin and myself, gave full \nwhistleblower rights to baggage screeners and their supervisors and to \ncontract screeners. This is something that the House proposal fails to \ndo.\n\n  Fourth, the new administration-supported bill gives minimal \nassurances that non-homeland security functions in the 22 agencies to \nbe absorbed in the new Department will be preserved and not eliminated \nor diminished. The committee's amendment, which I offered with Senator \nCarper, required that all non-homeland security functions of each \nagency be identified, along with the resources needed to preserve these \nfunctions, and the additional changes needed to ensure that non-\nhomeland security functions would not be diminished. The new proposal \ndrops this critical reporting requirement. In fact, the new bill \nremoves all reports to Congress which would allow Congress to monitor \nclosely the creation of the new department and to ensure vital non-\nhomeland security functions are preserved.\n  Fifth, the committee-reported bill provided critical management \nguidance to the development of an effective homeland security mission. \nAgencies need specific guidance on how to achieve success. There are \nover 40 federal agencies with homeland security missions--some to be \nwithin the new department but others to remain outside. For many, \nhomeland security is a new responsibility that must be added to \nexisting missions. Agencies will need to rationalize their new homeland \nsecurity missions with their existing responsibilities. The committee's \namendment provided for a process for ensuring that this occurs. The \nHouse proposal does not.\n  Sixth, the House-passed bill creates a new Under Secretary for \nInformation Analysis and Infrastructure Protection with two subordinate \ndirectorates, including one for intelligence which is given \nextraordinary access to sensitive information, both domestic and \nforeign. Under the House formulation as supported by the President, the \nnew Secretary can trump the authority of the Director of Central \nIntelligence. The new directorate will duplicate work already being \nperformed by the CIA's Counter Terrorism Center. Furthermore, Section \n202 of the President's bill requires all agencies to provide all \ninformation to the new Department, including information which might \npertain to intelligence sources and methods, without the Secretary even \nhaving to request that information. This gives this new office \nunprecedented access with few checks and balances, suggesting that the \nnew office may have the capability to intrude to an extraordinary \nextent into the private lives of individual American citizens. These \nare very worrisome developments. The new formulation risks endangering \nour individual, as well as our national, security. Senator Thompson, \nSenator Lieberman, Senator Levin and I had worked out an amendment \nwhich was contained in the committee bill. This amendment should have \nbeen accepted by the President. I am deeply troubled concerning the \nadministration's new mission for the Department's intelligence \ndirectorate.\n  Seventh, the latest proposal does not address the serious \nshortcomings across the Federal Government in communicating security \nthreats to the public. The American people are confused and frustrated \nby threat advisories without direction and repeated statements by the \nadministration that future terrorist attacks are inevitable. The \ncommittee bill ensured that the Secretary of the new Department worked \nwith state and local officials to develop more effective alert systems, \nmore useful warnings, and improved communication with the public and \nprivate sector. In short, the Governmental Affairs Committee's \nlegislation would have empowered the American people to play a role in \nthe war on terrorism.\n  Eighth, this new proposal transfers the Plum Island Animal Disease \nCenter from the Department of Agriculture to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. However, many potential agriculture terrorism diseases, such \nas anthrax, are not studied at Plum Island. Rather than pulling off one \npiece of the Department of Agriculture's much needed and \nunderappreciated laboratory network, the Governmental Affairs Committee \nalternative left Plum Island where it was and instead ensured \ncoordination and consultation between the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and Agriculture on bioterrorism research priorities.\n  Ninth, the House proposal does not address serious shortfalls in \nemergency preparedness and response capabilities for agricultural \nterrorism. The Lieberman alternative acknowledged the importance of \nagriculture to our national economy and the dangers that an infectious \nanimal or plant disease could pose to human health, rural America, and \nour Nation's economy. A large scale agricultural disease outbreak, \nwhether of natural or deliberate origin, will require rapid and \ncoordinated efforts by the Department of Agriculture, the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency, the Environmental Protection Agency, the \nDepartments of Health and Human Services, Transportation, Defense, and \nJustice, and local and State emergency managers. The committee's \namendment ensured that agricultural health diseases were considered in \nsecurity assessments and that the animal health and agriculture \ncommunities would be included in planning, training, and response \nactivities.\n  Tenth, in the name of flexibility, the President's initial proposal \nwaived all of the provisions of title 5 leaving federal employees \nwithout protection from discrimination or whistleblower retaliations. \nThe House proposal maintains most of title 5; however, it allows for \nthe waiver of provisions affecting collective bargaining rights and \nappeal rights. One of the key factors to the so-called success of the \nFederal Aviation Administration, FAA, and the Internal Revenue Service, \nIRS, two agencies that have managerial flexibilities, is the strong \nrole federal labor unions play in the shaping of the personnel system \nand in resolving employee disputes through third-party arbitration. \nThis third-party arbitration is even more critical since cases \ninvolving coercion to participate in political activity, violations of \nveterans preference rights, giving unlawful preference or advantage to \nany employee, or other prohibited personnel practices can no longer be \nappealed to an independent body such as the Merit Systems Protection \nBoard, MSPB. The personnel system at the FAA removed MSPB appeal rights \nin 1996 only to have them reinstated by Congress in 2000 at the urging \nof Federal employees and managers.\n\n  While the merit system principles are designed to ensure that Federal \nemployment is efficient, fair, open to all, and free from political \ninterference, the civil service rules of title 5, reinforced by \ncollective bargaining rights, provide the framework for implementing \nand enforcing merit principles. Without such laws in place, the \nprinciples we all strive for cannot be reached. The Governmental \nAffairs Committee's reported bill preserved all of title 5, protected \ncollective bargaining rights, and provided additional flexibilities \ngovernmentwide.\n  Some 25 years ago, the Civil Service Reform Act, CSRA, of 1978 \nresponded to the same issues confronting our Government today. The act \nestablished the principles of openness and procedural justice that \ndefine the civil service today. It created the Merit Systems Protection \nBoard and the Office of Special Counsel to protect the rights of \nFederal employees. The Federal Labor Relations Authority was created to \noversee labor-management practices. The act provided a statutory basis \nfor the collective bargaining rights of Federal workers. It prohibited \nreprisals against employees who expose government fraud, waste and \nabuse. Those in the Federal workforce demonstrate their loyalty and \ndedication not just to their employer but to their country every day. \nOn September 11, the Federal workforce responded with courage, \ndedication, and sacrifice. Why is the President repaying their \nsacrifice by undermining their rights and our civil service by \nproposing these changes?\n  Eleventh, the House legislation fails to protect veterans by allowing \nthe\n\n[[Page S11045]]\n\nwaiver of chapter 77 of title 5 relating to appeals. This would make \nveterans go to an agency management-operated process to challenge anti-\nveteran personnel actions by the same agency management. Under current \nlaw, veterans who believe that they have been denied a position or have \nbeen subject to a ``designer'' Reduction-In-Force, RIF, action in \nviolation of veterans' preference requirements can challenge such \nwrongful actions through the Merit Systems Protection Board or through \na union grievance procedure. This will no longer be possible under the \nHouse bill. The Committee's bill would have preserved MSPB review of \nveterans' preference complaints. Ironically, as we are in the midst of \na war on terrorism and have authorized a war against Iraq, the \nAdministration is weakening veterans' preference rights. This is \nfundamentally wrong.\n  Twelfth, the House proposal and the Governmental Affairs Committee-\nreported bill include provisions protecting the confidential sharing of \ncritical infrastructure information. With cyber attacks on the rise, \ngovernment and industry leaders have been seeking a way to facilitate \nthe sharing of information related to cyber vulnerabilities and \nattacks. Sharing such information is important because 85 percent of \nthe Nation's infrastructure is controlled by private utility, \ntelecommunications, or other similar companies. Despite the need to \nfacilitate information sharing, I question the extent to which such \ninformation will be protected and the impact of such protections on \nenvironmental and public health laws.\n  In general, the owners and operators of critical infrastructure are \nconcerned about the type and scope of information they are being asked \nto submit to the government. This data deals with vulnerabilities, \nincidents, and remedies which, if made available to business \ncompetitors or to the general public, could compromise their \ncompetitive position, expose them to liability, disclose sensitive \ninformation to terrorists and others who might wish to disrupt the \nfunction of their infrastructure, or harm their public relations.\n  However, current law provides adequate protection to the private \nsector for disclosing this type of information to the Federal \nGovernment. Nonetheless, industry has expressed its concern over non-\nbinding case law that could be overturned. As such, the Governmental \nAffairs Committee bill provided a narrow exception to the Freedom of \nInformation Act which closely follows current law. This provision was \ndesigned to facilitate the sharing of information with the Federal \nGovernment, while at the same time providing citizens with necessary \ninformation on public health and environmental issues. The Committee \nbill was careful not to provide an inadvertent safe harbor for those \nwho violate Federal health and safety statutes.\n  For these reasons, I believe that the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee's legislation offered a more effective approach to guarding \nhomeland security than the proposal advocated by the President who \nrecently stated that ``our job--our government's greatest \nresponsibility is to protect the American people. ``I agree with the \nPresident, but I do not agree that by voting for the President's flawed \nproposal we will be adequately protecting the American people.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to commend Senator Corzine \nfor his efforts to address the serious issue of chemical site security. \nThe Chemical Security Act, S. 1602, which I cosponsored, would require \n``high priority'' facilities to improve security and reduce hazards. \nThe bipartisan and strong support for this issue was demonstrated last \nJuly when the bill unanimously passed the Senate Environment and Public \nWorks Committee.\n  Across the country, thousands of industrial facilities use dangerous \nchemicals in amounts that could endanger nearby communities if the \nfacilities were attacked by terrorists. According to the Environmental \nProtection Agency's Risk Management Planning program, there are 123 \nfacilities where a release of chemicals could threaten more than 1 \nmillion people. There are also more than 700 facilities from which a \nchemical release could threaten more than 100,000 residential \nneighbors. Yet there is no Federal security standard for chemical \nfacilities, no Federal guidelines on facility proximity to neighboring \ncommunities, and no Federal agency overseeing the operations and safety \nof these facilities.\n  This bill is not intended to address chemical accidents. The Clean \nAir Act already provides existing authority. However, a review of the \nchemical accident data provides clear insight into the dangers \nassociated with chemical releases from these facilities. Federal data \nsuggests that in 1998 there were almost 50,000 incidents--fires, spills \nand explosions--over 100 deaths, and nearly 5,000 injuries, related to \nchemical industrial accidents in the United States. Some analysts \nsuggest that for each catastrophic chemical accident that causes a \nfatality, there are 300 recordable incidents and 30,000 near misses. \nOne estimate suggests that U.S. chemical accidents cost about $15 \nbillion a year.\n  In 1999, Congress required the Department of Justice to issue, within \n3 years, a report to Congress on the vulnerability of chemical \nfacilities to criminal and terrorist activity. For over a year, the \nSenate Environment and Public Works Committee has been asking for this \nreport. Beyond a very thin and useless preliminary draft, the \nadministration has not complied with this requirement of the Clean Air \nAct amendments. The Justice Department claims that funding constraints \nhave impacted their work. This excuse is completely unacceptable, as is \nthe administration's delay in addressing what may be this Nation's \nbiggest terrorist vulnerability. Three years ago, Congress recognized \nthe potential risks to our Nation's chemical security. Not 1 more year \nor month should pass with this issue unresolved.\n  Press reports highlight the public's frustration. In September, \nNewsweek reported a failing grade to the Federal Government in \nprotecting chemical plants and other hazardous materials. I believe the \narticle accurately described the forces blocking action: ``industry \nlobbyists and infighting among a multitude of government agencies \ntrying to defend their turf have combined to hold (Governor) Ridge's \noffice and the Environmental Protection Agency at bay.''\n  I ask my colleague to step beyond bureaucratic delays and special \ninterest pressures to think of the families that could be impacted by \nour inaction here today. We must act on this issue as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schumer). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I extend my appreciation to the Senator from \nIowa who has other things to do, but he has agreed to be here for a few \nminutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/14/senate-section/article/S11045-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11045-S11052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. REID.

Rogers\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, last night, the Senate voted to confirm \nthe nomination of John Rogers who is nominated to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Sixth Circuit. By confirming this nomination, we are \ntrying to move forward in providing help to the Sixth Circuit. Earlier \nthis year, we held a hearing for Judge Julia Gibbons to a seat on the \nSixth Circuit, who was confirmed by the Senate on July 29, 2002 by a \nvote of 95 to 0. With last night's vote, the Democratic-led Senate \nconfirmed the 15th judge to our Federal Courts of Appeal and our 98th \njudicial nominee since the change in Senate majority in July 2001. I \nhave placed a separate statement in the Record on the occasion of \nconfirming that many of this President's judicial nominees in just 16 \nmonths.\n  Republicans often say that almost half of the seats on the Sixth \nCircuit are vacant but what they fail to acknowledge is that most of \nthose vacancies arose during the Clinton Administration and before the \nchange in majority last summer. None, zero, not one of the Clinton \nnominees to those current vacancies on the Sixth Circuit received a \nhearing by the Judiciary Committee under Republican leadership. With \nthe confirmation of Professor Rogers, we have reduced the number of \nvacancies on that court to six, but four of those remaining lack home-\nState consent due to the President's failure to address the legitimate \nconcerns of Senators in that circuit whose nominees were blocked by \nRepublicans during the period of Republican control of the Senate.\n  The Sixth Circuit vacancies are a prime and unfortunate legacy of the \npast partisan obstructionist practices under Republican leadership. \nVacancies on the Sixth Circuit were perpetuated during the last several \nyears of the Clinton administration when the Republican majority \nrefused to hold hearings on the nominations of Judge Helene White, \nKathleen McCree Lewis and Professor Kent Markus to vacancies in the \nSixth Circuit.\n  One of those seats has been vacant since 1995, the first term of \nPresident Clinton. Judge Helene White of the Michigan Court of Appeals \nwas nominated in January 1997 and did not receive a hearing on her \nnomination during the more than 1,500 days before her nomination was \nwithdrawn by President Bush in March of last year. Judge White's \nnomination may have set an unfortunate record.\n  Her nomination was pending without a hearing for more over 4 years--\n51 months. She was first nominated in January 1997 and renominated and \nrenominated through March of last year when President Bush chose to \nwithdraw her nomination. Under Republican control, the committee \naveraged hearings on only about eight Courts of Appeals nominees a year \nand, in 2000, held only five hearings on Courts of Appeals nominees all \nyear.\n  In contrast, Professor Rogers was the fifteenth Court of Appeals \nnominee of President Bush to receive a hearing by the committee in less \nthan a year since the reorganization of the Senate Judiciary Committee. \nIn 16 months we held hearings on 20 circuit court nominations. \nProfessor Rogers was being treated much better than Kathleen McCree \nLewis, a distinguished African American lawyer from a prestigious \nMichigan law firm. She never had a hearing on her 1999 nomination to \nthe Sixth Circuit during the years it was pending before it was \nwithdrawn by President Bush in March 2001.\n  Professor Kent Markus, another outstanding nominee to a vacancy on \nthe Sixth Circuit that arose in 1999, never received a hearing on his \nnomination before his nomination was returned to President Clinton \nwithout action in December 2000. While Professor Markus' nomination was \npending, his confirmation was supported by individuals of every \npolitical stripe, including 14 past presidents of the Ohio State Bar \nAssociation and more than 80 Ohio law school deans and professors.\n  Others who supported Professor Markus include prominent Ohio \nRepublicans, including Ohio Supreme Court Chief Justice Thomas Moyer, \nOhio Supreme Court Justice Evelyn Stratton, Congresswoman Deborah \nPryce, and Congressman David Hobson, the National District Attorneys \nAssociation, and virtually every major newspaper in the state.\n  In his testimony to the Senate in May, Professor Markus summarized \nhis experience as a federal judicial nominee, demonstrating how the \n``history regarding the current vacancy backlog is being obscured by \nsome.'' Here are some of things he said:\n\n       On February 9, 2000, I was the President's first judicial \n     nominee in that calendar year. And then the waiting began. . \n     . .\n       At the time my nomination was pending, despite lower \n     vacancy rates than the 6th Circuit, in calendar year 2000, \n     the Senate confirmed circuit nominees to the 3rd, 9th and \n     Federal Circuits. . . . No 6th circuit nominee had been \n     afforded a hearing in the prior two years. Of the nominees \n     awaiting a Judiciary Committee hearing, there was no circuit \n     with more nominees than the 6th Circuit.\n       With high vacancies already impacting the 6th Circuit's \n     performance, and more vacancies on the way, why, then, did my \n     nomination expire without even a hearing? To their credit, \n     Senator DeWine and his staff and Senator Hatch's staff and \n     others close to him were straight with me.\n       Over and over again they told me two things: (1) There will \n     be no more confirmations to the 6th Circuit during the \n     Clinton Administration[.] (2) This has nothing to do with \n     you; don't take it personally it doesn't matter who the \n     nominee is, what credentials they may have or what support \n     they may have--see item number 1. . . . The fact was, a \n     decision had been made to hold the vacancies and see who \n     won the presidential election. With a Bush win, all those \n     seats could go to Bush rather than Clinton nominees.\n\n  As Professor Markus identified, some on the other side of the aisle \nheld these seats open for years for another President to fill, instead \nof proceeding fairly on the consensus nominees pending before the \nSenate. Some were unwilling to move forward, knowing that retirements \nand attrition would create four additional seats that would arise \nnaturally for the next President. That is why there are now so many \nvacancies on the Sixth Circuit.\n  Had Republicans not blocked President Clinton's nominees to this \ncourt, if the three Democratic nominees had been confirmed and \nPresident Bush appointed the judges to the other vacancies on the Sixth \nCircuit, that court would be almost evenly balanced between judges \nappointed by Republicans and Democrats. That is what Republican \nobstruction was designed to avoid, balance. The same is true of a \nnumber of other circuits, with Republicans benefitting from their \nobstructionist practices of the preceding six and a half years. This \ncombined with President Bush's refusal to consult with Democratic \nSenators about these matters is particularly troubling.\n  Long before some of the recent voices of concern were raised about \nthe vacancies on that court, Democratic Senators in 1997, 1998, 1999, \nand 2000 implored the Republican majority to give the Sixth Circuit \nnominees hearings. Those requests, made not just for the sake of the \nnominees but for the sake of the public's business before the court, \nwere ignored. Numerous articles and editorials urged the Republican \nleadership to act on those nominations.\n  Fourteen former presidents of the Michigan State Bar pleaded for \nhearings on those nominations. The former Chief Judge of the Sixth \nCircuit, Judge Gilbert Merritt, wrote to the Judiciary Committee \nChairman years ago to ask that the nominees get hearings and that the \nvacancies be filled. The Chief Judge noted that, with four vacancies--\nthe four vacancies that arose in the Clinton administration the Sixth \nCircuit ``is hurting badly and will not be able to keep up with its \nwork load due to the fact that the Senate Judiciary Committee has acted \non none of the nominations to our Court.'' He predicted: ``By the time \nthe next President is inaugurated, there will be six vacancies on the \nCourt of Appeals. Almost half of the Court will be vacant and will \nremain so for most of 2001 due to the exigencies of the nomination \nprocess. Although the President has nominated candidates, the Senate \nhas refused to take a vote on any of them.''\n  However, no Sixth Circuit hearings were held in the last three full \nyears of the Clinton administration--almost his\n\n[[Page S11048]]\n\nentire second presidential term--despite these pleas. Not one. Since \nthe shift in majority last summer, the situation has been exacerbated \nfurther as two additional vacancies have arisen.\n  The committee's April 25th hearing on the nomination of Judge Gibbons \nto the Sixth Circuit was the first hearing on a Sixth Circuit \nnomination in almost 5 years, even though three outstanding, fair-\nminded individuals were nominated to the Sixth Circuit by President \nClinton and pending before the Committee for anywhere from one year to \nover four years. Judge Gibbons was confirmed by the Senate on July 29, \n2002, by a vote of 95 to 0. We did not stop there, but proceeded to \nhold a hearing on a second Sixth Circuit nominee, Professor Rogers, \njust a few short months later in June.\n  Just as we held the first hearing on a Sixth Circuit nominee in many \nyears, the hearing we held on the nomination of Judge Edith Clement to \nthe Fifth Circuit last year was the first on a Fifth Circuit nominee in \nseven years and she was the first new appellate judge confirmed to that \nCourt in six years.\n  When we held a hearing on the nomination of Judge Harris Hartz to the \nTenth Circuit last year, it was the first hearing on a Tenth Circuit \nnominee in six years and he was the first new appellate judge confirmed \nto that Court in 6 years. When we held the hearing on the nomination of \nJudge Roger Gregory to the Fourth Circuit last year, it was the first \nhearing on a Fourth Circuit nominee in three years and he was the first \nappellate judge confirmed to that court in three years.\n  A number of vacancies continue to exist on many Courts of Appeals, in \nlarge measure because the recent Republican majority was not willing to \nhold hearings or vote on half--56 percent--of President Clinton's \nCourts of Appeals nominees in 1999 and 2000 and was not willing to \nconfirm a single judge to the Courts of Appeals during the entire 1996 \nsession.\n  From the time the Republicans took over the Senate in 1995 until the \nreorganization of the committee last July, circuit vacancies increased \nfrom 16 to 33, more than doubling. Democrats have broken with that \nrecent history of inaction. In the last 16 months, we have held 26 \njudicial nominations hearing, including 20 hearings for circuit court \nnominees.\n  Professor Roger's nomination was also the fourth judicial nomination \nfrom Kentucky to be considered by the committee in its first year, and \nthe eighth nomination from Kentucky overall. There are no judicial \nvacancies left in the State.\n  Professor Rogers of the University of Kentucky College of Law has \nexperience as an appellate litigator and a teacher, and is a prolific \nauthor on a number of difficult legal topics. It is important to note \nthat aspects of his record raise concerns. As a professor, he has been \na strong proponent of judicial activism. No Clinton judicial nominee \nwith such published views would ever have been confirmed during the \nperiod of Republican control. In his writings, Professor Rogers has \ncalled on lower court judges to reverse higher court precedents, if the \nlower court judge thinks the higher court will ultimate reverse its own \nprecedent. Such an activist approach is inappropriate in the lower \nfederal courts. The Supreme Court itself has noted that lower courts \nshould follow Supreme Court precedent and not anticipate future \ndecisions in which the Supreme Court may exercise its prerogative to \noverrule itself.\n  Prognostications about how the Supreme Court will rule often turns \nout to be wrong. For example, some predicted that the Supreme Court \nwould overturn Miranda, but the Supreme Court, in an opinion by Chief \nJustice Rehnquist, declined to do so. Similarly, people like Professor \nRogers have called on the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade, but \nthus far the Supreme Court has rejected calls to reverse itself in this \nimportant decision regarding the rights of women and has resisted calls \nto return this country to the awful period of dangerous back alley \nabortions.\n  Professor Rogers also suggested in his academic writings that lower \ncourt judges should consider the political views of Justices in making \nthe determination of when lower courts should overrule Supreme Court \nprecedent. In his answers to the committee, Professor Rogers \nacknowledged that he had taken that position but he now says that lower \ncourts should not look to the views of Justices expressed in speeches \nor settings other than their opinions. Also, in his answers to the \ncommittee, Professor Rogers said he would give great weight to Supreme \nCourt dicta, or arguments that are not part of the holding of the case. \nI would like to take this opportunity to urge him to take seriously the \nobligation of a judge to follow precedent and the holdings of the \nSupreme Court, rather than to look to dicta for views that may support \nhis own personal views. I would also urge him resist acting on his \nacademic notion that a judge should diverge from precedent when he \nanticipates that the Supreme Court may eventually do so.\n  Professor Rogers has assured us that he would follow precedent and \nnot overrule higher courts, despite his clear advocacy of that position \nin his writings as a scholar. He has sworn under oath that he would not \nfollow the approach that he long advocated. As with President Bush's \nEighth Circuit nominee Lavenski Smith, who was confirmed earlier this \nsummer, I am hopeful that Professor Rogers will be a person of his \nword: that he will follow the law and not seek out opportunities to \noverturn precedent or decide cases in accord with his private beliefs \nrather than his obligations as a judge.\n  I would also note that during his tenure at the Justice Department, \nProfessor Rogers appeared to support an expansive view of the power of \nthe executive branch vis-a-vis Congress. I am hopeful, however, that \nProfessor Rogers will recognize the important difference between being \na zealous advocate for such positions and being a fair and impartial \njudge sworn to follow precedents and the law.\n  When he was asked to describe any work he had handled which was not \npopular but was nevertheless important, he said that the case which \ncame to mind was one in which he defended the CIA against a lawsuit \nseeking damages for the CIA's illegal opening of the private mail of \ntens of thousands of U.S. citizens during this 1970s or 1980s. Those \nwere dark days of overreaching by the intelligence community against \nthe rights of ordinary law-abiding American citizens. Although times \nhave changed forever since the tragic events of September 11, I think \nit is important that the American people have access to judges who will \nuphold the Constitution against government excesses while also giving \nacts of Congress the presumption of constitutionality to which our laws \nare entitled by precedent.\n  Professor Rogers has repeatedly assured the committee, however, that \nhe would follow precedent and not seek to overturn decisions affecting \nthe privacy of women or any other decision of the Supreme Court. \nSenator McConnell has also personally assured me that Professor Rogers \nwill not be an activist but is sincerely committed to following \nprecedent if he is confirmed. I sincerely hope that his decisions on \nthe Sixth Circuit do not prove us wrong.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I am particularly pleased today to speak \nin support of the confirmation of John M. Rogers to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Sixth Circuit. As we know, there is a judicial vacancy \ncrisis in the Sixth Circuit and the addition of Mr. Rogers to the bench \nrepresents a positive step in alleviating that regrettable situation.\n  John M. Rogers is currently the Thomas P. Lewis Professor at the \nUniversity of Kentucky College of Law, where he has taught since 1978. \nHe is a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Stanford University and an Order of \nthe Coif graduate of the University of Michigan Law School, where he \nserved on the Michigan Law Review. He is an expert in international, \nadministrative, and constitutional law and a respected teacher and \nscholar.\n  Prior to teaching, Professor Rogers was an appellate attorney in the \nCivil Division of the United States Department of Justice. This work, \nand a later stint at DOJ, led to his being awarded a Special \nCommendation for Outstanding Service to the Civil Division of the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice. Rogers has twice been a Fulbright Senior \nLecturer in the People's Republic of China, and is a member of the \nCouncil on Foreign Relations. He has also\n\n[[Page S11049]]\n\nserved this country for 28 years as a reserve officer in the U.S. Army \nReserve and the Kentucky Army National Guard.\n  All of these accomplishments and contributions explain why the \nAmerican Bar Association has rated Professor Rogers unanimously \nqualified. I agree with that judgment, I applaud President Bush for \nmaking this nomination, and I urge all of my colleagues to confirm \nProfessor Rogers to the Sixth Circuit. I am confident he will serve \nwith distinction as a Federal judge.\n\n\n              nominations of u.s. district court nominees\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise in support of the fine group of \ndistrict court nominees who are being confirmed tonight. I have \nreviewed their individual records and I find all of them to be \nexcellent choices for the Federal bench. Permit me a moment to \nhighlight the merits of each nominee.\n  U.S. Magistrate Judge Stanley R.

In this capacity, she served as the nationwide prosecutor of \nlabor law violations, overseeing election processes, representing the \nNLRB before State and Federal courts, and overseeing agency personnel \nand budget matters. Since 1989, Ms. Collyer has been a partner at \nCrowell & Moring in Washington, D.C. Her specialization has been in \nlabor law and employment law.\n  A July 22, 2002 Legal Times article reported that Ms. Collyer is \n``well-regarded by her fellow labor lawyers.'' One colleague asserted, \n``She cares about getting it right. She is definitely capable of \nnavigating complex cases.''

His academic \nrecord is superb. A Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Berea College in \nKentucky, he went on to attend Vanderbilt Law School, my own alma \nmater, on a full academic scholarship. While at Vanderbilt, he was an \neditor of the Law Review and received the Dean's Award for Best Senior \nDissertation.\n  Upon finishing law school, Judge Phillips joined the Army Judge \nAdvocate General's Corps, which awarded him its Outstanding Appellate \nAdvocacy Award and the Army Commendation Medal in 1973. While serving \nin the Army, Judge Phillips also received a master of laws degree from \nGeorge Washington University Law School here in Washington.\n  In 1973, Judge Phillips returned to Tennessee and entered the private \npractice of law. Public service called him back, however, and in 1976, \nJudge Phillips was elected as County Attorney for Scott County. Between \n1976 and 1991, Judge Phillips continued to serve as Scott County \nAttorney, being re-elected four times, while continuing to engage in \nprivate law practice with his own firm in his home town, Oneida. During \nthis period, he tried hundreds of cases.\n  In 1991, Judge Phillips was appointed by the judges of the Eastern \nDistrict of Tennessee to serve as a Magistrate Judge in Knoxville, the \nposition he continues to hold. During the time he has served as \nMagistrate Judge, he has earned the respect of all who have appeared \nbefore him for his demeanor, courtesy, and intellect. During the \nrigorous screening process that Senator Frist and I undertook to review \nthe records of interested candidates for this judgeship, we heard \nuniformly and highly favorable comments about Judge Phillips.\n  I think the record before the committee demonstrates his outstanding \nqualifications. I cite just one example. In over 11 years on the bench, \nout of thousands of decisions and recommendations, Judge Phillips has \nbeen reversed on just two occasions, and on only one occasion has a \nDistrict Judge rejected his recommendations.\n  Judge Phillips has excelled not only in his professional career, but \nin his commitment to his community as well. He has promoted legal \neducation by serving as a member of the Inns of Court and by teaching \nat the University of Tennessee Law School. He is an Elder of the \nHuntsville Presbyterian Church, a member of the American Legion, and a \nleader of the American, Tennessee, Scott County, and Knoxville Bar \nAssociations. In private practice, Judge Phillips provided extensive \npro bono services and served on the boards of Scott County Hospital and \nOpportunities for the Handicapped.\n  I would be remiss if I failed to note the importance of moving \nforward with this nomination. Traditionally, two district judges sit in \nKnoxville, Tennessee's third largest city. Late last year and early \nthis year, Judge Jordan and Judge Jarvis respectively assumed senior \nstatus, leaving the district court in Knoxville with no active judges. \nI\n\n[[Page S11052]]\n\nwant to express my thanks and appreciation to both senior judges for \nthe service they rendered for many years on the Federal bench in \nKnoxville.\n  I am confident that there is no one better qualified to fill the \nlarge hold left by Judge Jordan and Judge Jarvis than Judge Phillips. I \nam pleased to endorse Judge Phillips and urge my colleagues to support \nhis nomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/14/senate-section/article/S11052-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             NOMINATION OF EUGENE SCALIA--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

FINDINGS.\n\n       [Congress finds that--\n       [(1) the crime of identity theft is the fastest growing \n     crime in the United States;\n       [(2) the Federal Trade Commission reports that between \n     March and June of 2001, the total number of identity theft \n     victims in the Commission's Complaint Clearinghouse System, \n     tallied from November 1999, increased from 45,593 to 69,370;\n       [(3) consumer inquiries and complaints to the Federal Trade \n     Commission Identity Theft Hotline increased from 68,000 to \n     over 97,000 over the same 3-month period, and consumer calls \n     into the Hotline increased in the same period from 1,800 \n     calls per week to over 2,000;\n       [(4) the Federal Trade Commission estimates that the call \n     volume to the Identity Theft Hotline represents only 5 to 10 \n     percent of the actual number of victims of identity theft;\n       [(5) victims of identity theft often have extraordinary \n     difficulty restoring their credit and regaining control of \n     their identity because of the viral nature of identity theft;\n       [(6) identity theft may be ruinous to the good name and \n     credit of consumers whose identities are misappropriated, and \n     victims of identity theft may be denied otherwise well-\n     deserved credit, may have to spend enormous time, effort, and \n     sums of money to remedy their circumstances, and may suffer \n     extreme emotional distress including deep depression founded \n     in profound frustration as they address the array of problems \n     that may arise as a result of identity theft;\n       [(7) victims are often required to contact numerous \n     Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies, consumer \n     credit reporting agencies, and creditors over many years, as \n     each event of fraud arises;\n       [(8) the Government, business entities, and credit \n     reporting agencies have a shared responsibility to assist \n     identity theft victims, to mitigate the harm that results \n     from fraud perpetrated in the victim's name;\n       [(9) victims of identity theft need a nationally \n     standardized means of--\n       [(A) reporting identity theft to law enforcement, consumer \n     credit reporting agencies, and business entities; and\n       [(B) evidencing their true identity to business entities \n     and credit reporting agencies;\n       [(10) one of the greatest law enforcement challenges posed \n     by identity theft is that stolen identities are often used to \n     perpetrate crimes in many different localities in different \n     States, and although identity theft is a Federal crime, most \n     often, State and local law enforcement agencies are \n     responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crimes; and\n       [(11) the Federal Government should assist State and local \n     law enforcement agencies to effectively combat identity theft \n     and the associated fraud.\n\n     [SEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the crime of identity theft is the fastest growing \n     crime in the United States;\n       (2) victims of identity theft often have extraordinary \n     difficulty restoring their credit and regaining control of \n     their identity because of the viral nature of identity theft;\n       (3) identity theft may be ruinous to the good name and \n     credit of consumers whose identities are misappropriated, and \n     victims of identity theft may be denied otherwise well-\n     deserved\n\n[[Page S11054]]\n\n     credit, may have to spend enormous time, effort, and sums of \n     money to remedy their circumstances, and may suffer extreme \n     emotional distress including deep depression founded in \n     profound frustration as they address the array of problems \n     that may arise as a result of identity theft;\n       (4) victims are often required to contact numerous Federal, \n     State, and local law enforcement agencies, consumer credit \n     reporting agencies, and creditors over many years, as each \n     event of fraud arises;\n       (5) the Government, business entities, and credit reporting \n     agencies have a shared responsibility to assist identity \n     theft victims, to mitigate the harm that results from fraud \n     perpetrated in the victim's name;\n       (6) victims of identity theft need a nationally \n     standardized means of--\n       (A) reporting identity theft to consumer credit reporting \n     agencies and business entities; and\n       (B) evidencing their true identity and claim of identity \n     theft to consumer credit reporting agencies and business \n     entities;\n       (7) one of the greatest law enforcement challenges posed by \n     identity theft is that stolen identities are often used to \n     perpetrate crimes in many different localities in different \n     States, and although identity theft is a Federal crime, most \n     often, State and local law enforcement agencies are \n     responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crimes; and\n       (8) the Federal Government should assist State and local \n     law enforcement agencies to effectively combat identity theft \n     and the associated fraud.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Madam President, the Senate today is considering S. 1742, \nthe Identity Theft Victims Assistance Act of 2002. This is an important \nissue, and it is proper for the Senate to be giving it consideration. \nWhile the text of this bill is seriously flawed and needs careful work \nand refinement in order for it to have a significantly positive effect \nin curbing identity theft, I believe that passage of this legislation \nby the Senate will be seen as an indication of the importance that the \nSenate attaches to relieving the disruption caused in the lives of \nvictims of these crimes.\n  When the Senate returns to this issue in the next Congress, I hope \nthat the problems with this bill can be resolved, that the complexity \nof the issues involved can be adequately considered so that the \nlegislation focuses on the real culprits without penalizing law-abiding \ncitizens and businesses, and without the substantial confusion to the \nenforcement responsibilities of federal financial regulators that the \ndraft before us would cause. The text in its current form would also \nexpand opportunities for predatory lawsuits, creating new\n\n[[Page S11056]]\n\nvictims, and we must avoid that. We do little good for the country that \nway.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senators Cantwell and Grassley and others \nhave an amendment at the desk. I ask that that amendment be considered \nand agreed to; that the committee substitute, as amended, be agreed to; \nthe bill, as amended, be read the third time and passed, and the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table; and that any statements be \nprinted in the Record, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4954) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, \nwas agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1742), as amended, was read the third time and passed, \nas follows:\n  (The bill will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me say I have been working in recent \nhours with the Senator from Washington, Ms. Cantwell. She has worked \ntirelessly on this piece of legislation. She has given a number of \nstatements on the floor related to this issue, dealing with what has \ntaken place and what she knows regarding identity theft. I commend and \napplaud her for her diligence and perseverance. The burden is now on \nthe House of Representatives. They are still in session. There is no \nreason in the world that they cannot pass this most important piece of \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/14/senate-section/article/S11056-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11056-S11057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         PROMOTIONS DISCHARGED\n\n  Mr. REID.

I ask unanimous consent that the injunction of secrecy be \nremoved from the following treaties transmitted to the Senate on \nNovember 14, 2002, by the President of the United States:\n  Convention with Great Britain and Northern Ireland regarding Double \nTaxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion (Treaty Doc. 107-19); and\n  Protocol Amending Convention with Australia regarding Double Taxation \nand Prevention of Fiscal Evasion (Treaty Doc. 107-20).\n  I further ask that the treaties be considered as having been read the \nfirst time; that they be referred, with accompanying papers, to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed; and that the \nPresident's message be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The messages of the President are as follows:\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith, for Senate advice and consent to ratification, \nthe Convention Between the Government of the United States of America \nand the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern \nIreland for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of \nFiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Gains, \nsigned at London on July 24, 2001, together with an exchange of notes, \nas amended by the Protocol signed at Washington on July 19, 2002 (the \n``Convention''). I also transmit the report of the Department of State \nconcerning the Convention.\n  The proposed Convention transmitted herewith would replace the \nConvention Between the Government of the United States of America and \nthe Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern \nIreland for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of \nFiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital Gains, \nsigned at London on December 31, 1975, as modified by a subsequent \nagreement and protocols.\n  This Convention, which is similar to tax treaties between the United \nStates and other developed nations, provides for maximum rates of tax \nto be applied to various types of income, protection from double \ntaxation of income, and for the exchange of information. The Convention \nalso contains rules making its benefits unavailable to persons who are \nengaged in treaty shopping. The proposed Convention is the first U.S. \nincome tax convention to provide a zero rate of withholding on certain \ndirect investment dividends.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthis Convention, and that the Senate give its advice and consent to \nratification.\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith, for Senate advice and consent to ratification, a \nProtocol Amending the Convention Between the Government of the United \nStates of America and the Government of Australia for the Avoidance of \nDouble Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to \nTaxes on Income, signed at Canberra on September 27, 2001 (the \n``Protocol''). I also transmit, for the information of the Senate, the \nreport of the Department of State concerning the Protocol.\n  The Convention, as amended by the Protocol, would be similar to \nrecent tax treaties between the United States and other developed \nnations. It provides maximum rates of tax to be applied to various \ntypes of income and protection from double taxation of income. The \nConvention, as amended by the Protocol, also provides for resolution of \ndisputes and sets forth rules making its benefits unavailable to \nresidents that are engaged in treaty shopping.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthis Protocol, and that the Senate give its advice and consent to \nratification.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/14/senate-section/article/S11057-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TREATY WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF HONDURAS FOR THE RETURN \n         OF STOLEN, ROBBED, OR EMBEZZLED VEHICLES AND AIRCRAFT\n\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, before formally making the unanimous \nconsent request, I wish to thank Senator Nickles for his understanding \nand cooperation in reaching this point this evening. I very much \nappreciate his willingness, and that of his staff, to work with us \nthroughout today. And I am very personally grateful for his leadership \nand good advice and counsel.\n  This unemployment insurance extension is being sponsored, in addition \nto myself, by the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Washington, who \nhas been a tremendous advocate, by Senator Fitzgerald of Illinois, and \nSenator Specter of Pennsylvania.\n  The commitment of all of the sponsors, and others, have made it \npossible for us to agree this evening to pass a bill that will be \nextremely welcomed by about 2.1 million Americans who will be able to \ntake advantage of this extension that runs through the end of March. \nThis will also specifically help approximately 177,000 New Yorkers as \nthey enter the holiday season.\n  Obviously, this is not all that the Presiding Officer and I would \nhave wanted. Perhaps it is more than some would have thought we should \ndo. But I think it works out to be an acceptable compromise in bringing \nthis about at this time.\n  Again, I personally thank Senator Nickles for his extraordinary \nassistance.\n  So, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the substitute \namendment at the desk be agreed to, the act, as amended, be read a \nthird time, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate; and that any statements \nrelated thereto be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4960) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n       Section 1. Section 114 of Public Law 107-229 is amended by \n     striking ``the date specified in section 107(c) of this joint \n     resolution'' and inserting ``March 31, 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF THE TEMPORARY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT \n                   COMPENSATION ACT OF 2002.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 208 of the Temporary Extended \n     Unemployment Compensation Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-147; \n     116 Stat. 30) is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 208. APPLICABILITY.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b), an \n     agreement entered into under this title shall apply to weeks \n     of unemployment--\n       ``(1) beginning after the date on which such agreement is \n     entered into; and\n       ``(2) ending before April 1, 2003.\n       ``(b) Transition for Amount Remaining in Account.--\n       ``(1) In General.--Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), in \n     the case of an individual who has amounts remaining in an \n     account established under section 203 as of March 29, 2003, \n     temporary extended unemployment compensation shall continue \n     to be payable to such individual from such amounts for any \n     week beginning after such date for which the individual meets \n     the eligibility requirements of this title.\n       ``(2) No Augmentation after March 26, 2003.--If the account \n     of an individual is exhausted after March 29, 2003, then \n     section 203(c) shall not apply and such account shall not be \n     augmented under such section, regardless of whether such \n     individual's State is in an extended benefit period (as \n     determined under paragraph (2) of such section).\n       ``(3) Limitation.--No compensation shall be payable by \n     reason of paragraph (1) for any week beginning after June 28, \n     2003.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall take effect as if included in the enactment of the \n     Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2002 \n     (Public Law 107-147; 116 Stat. 21).\n\n  The bill (H.R. 3529), as amended, was read a third time and passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I thank my colleague and friend from \nNew York for working with us. I think we have worked out an acceptable \ncompromise. Senator Fitzgerald and Senator Specter were very much \ninterested in passing this bill so we were happy to accommodate them.\n  In contrast to the previous legislation, which was a significant \nexpansion over current law, of which efforts had been made to pass by \nunanimous consent earlier today, this is an extension of current law. \nIt is a lot less expensive. This is an extension for 3 months.\n  We also did something else I think is important. We eliminated the \ncliff. In other words, current law would say by January 1 the 13-week \nFederal program would be terminated. This says, no, there is a \nphaseout. So there is not a cliff. At the end of March, if people are \nalready into the system, they can complete their 13-week program. So I \nthink it is responsible.\n  Also, for the benefit of my colleagues--and some have reservations \nabout this program because, legitimately, they are wondering whether, \nif you continue to pay out unemployment benefits, they will stay \nunemployed. And I happen to appreciate many of those concerns.\n  Now we will not be wrapped up with this beginning in January. So this \nwill give Congress a chance and hopefully offer some assistance to \nthose people who really need it and also offer Congress a chance to get \noff to a good start without wrestling and debating this issue.\n  I have debated this issue more than I want to debate it. And I \nappreciate our colleagues on both sides willing to compromise.\n  The House passed a 1-month extension. This is a 3-month extension \neliminating the cliff. I think it is a more orderly and more well-\nthought-out program that makes sense.\n  So I will not object to its passage and appreciate our colleagues \nfrom New York and Washington, as well as Illinois and Pennsylvania, for \ntheir cooperation in making this happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. As I was listening to the Senator from Oklahoma explain \nwhy this makes sense, and particularly to eliminate the cliff that, \nfrankly, people would have fallen off at the end of the year, right at \nthe beginning of a new year--and hopefully providing new hope for \npeople--I could not help but think of our colleague, Paul Wellstone. I \nthink he is smiling down on us. I think he is up there waving his arms, \npacing around, and saying, good work, and thanks for doing that.\n  To me, this is tremendous evidence of the kind of cooperation that \ncan come about to bring us together to help people.\n  Again, I thank my friend from Oklahoma.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have been on this floor many, many times \nwhen there have been speeches on both sides on extending unemployment \ninsurance going back several months. This is what legislating is all \nabout, the art of compromise. Not everyone got what they wanted. But we \ngot something, and it is very important and very positive.\n  I extend my appreciation to the Presiding Officer, the Senator from \nWashington, who worked on this diligently, and, of course, the Senator \nfrom New York, who has worked on this very hard.\n  No one has been on the floor more than the Senator from Oklahoma, and \nhe needs to be complimented because he certainly could have stopped \nthis in the last few hours of the session. He chose not to do that. He \nchose to move forward on a positive note.\n  I, not only for the Senate, but for the respective States and the \nwhole country, extend my appreciation to the three of you, all fine \nlegislators.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Thank you.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S11061]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I would like to take the opportunity \nto congratulate my colleagues on the passage of the unemployment \nextension bill which we just did by unanimous consent.\n  This really was a bipartisan effort by the Senator from Oklahoma and \nfrom two of our colleagues, the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Fitzgerald, \nand the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, who played a very \nimportant role in communicating the needs of unemployment benefit \nextensions in their States.\n  I thank the Chair, the Senator from New York, Mrs. Clinton, who has \nsince July advocated passage of this legislation, talked about the \nimportance of making sure that as our economy has faced a downturn, we \ncontinued to make sure the opportunities for income and stimulus in our \neconomy were there.\n  As she fought for the State of New York, which has been gravely \nimpacted by the events of 9/11 and the downturn in the economy where \njobs are just not being created, the Senator got all of us in the \ncountry to realize how critical the issue was for us moving forward at \na time when the economy has not returned to positive growth.\n  Obviously the State of Washington has been greatly impacted by that \nsame downturn, in the aerospace industry, in high tech. This \nlegislation will actually help over 75,000 Washingtonians who will get \nthe benefit of having an extension of a program and, being a high \nunemployment State, will qualify for the benefits of that program. This \nis actually something I think a few Washingtonians tonight, maybe a few \nSeattlites, will be sleeping a little bit better from, knowing that in \nthe impending months, as we struggle to get the economy going again, \nthey will actually be able to meet those mortgage payments, pay those \nhealth care bills, and continue to move forward.\n  Economists have said this kind of stimulus has a two-to-one effect; \nthat for every dollar spent on unemployment benefits, it generates \nabout $2.15 into the local economy. We have done a good service for my \nState's economy and for New York's and Pennsylvania and Illinois, for \nthe whole country, because we will be stimulating those individuals' \ndisposable income.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from New York for her hard work and \nvision, pointing out last summer the need to do it, being diligent in \nthis process. And tonight, because of this bipartisan support, there \nwill be more Americans sleeping better as we approach the tough \nchallenges ahead in getting our economy moving but knowing that we have \nnot left workers behind, workers who would rather have a paycheck than \nan unemployment check, but at least now they will be continuing to add \nto the economy.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell).

Madam President, today I offer my condolences to all the \nfriends, family members and admirers of Paul Wellstone. As has been \nsaid many times, Paul Wellstone was fiercely proud of the causes with \nwhich he associated himself. Certainly, to have Paul Wellstone \narticulately and strongly arguing on one's behalf was a great asset. \nHis many friends are forever grateful for his wrestler's tenacity as he \nadvocated for those issues in which he so emotionally believed.\n  Several years ago a candidate for Congress in Rhode Island retired \nfrom the campaign because of a shortage of funds, declaring that no \nlonger could ``Mr. Smith go to Washington.'' Paul Wellstone proved that \nyes, indeed, Mr. Smith could go to Washington. In 1990 he challenged an \nincumbent who possessed a huge financial advantage in what many assumed \nto be a quixotic and hopeless campaign. In November of that year Paul \nWellstone was the only challenger to beat an incumbent, providing \ninspiration forever to long shots.\n  Three cheers for the people of Minnesota who have shown a propensity \nfor embracing people of divergent philosophies. In the last few years \nMinnesota has elected Rod Grams, Jesse Ventura and Paul Wellstone; \npublic servants with very different approaches to the issues of the \nday. I join Minnesotans and Americans in mourning the death of the \npassionate and good-natured Paul Wellstone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/14/senate-section/article/S11061-3", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11061-S11062]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR MAX CLELAND\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I am honored to pay tribute and \nrecognize the leadership, dedication to public service and hard work of \nmy colleague from Georgia, Senator Max Cleland. Few Members of the \nSenate have sacrified so much for their country.\n  Senator Cleland has had a remarkable 30-year career in public service \nincluding a tour of duty in Vietnam in 1967 in which he was awarded the \nBronze and Silver Stars for meritorious service. Max started his career \nin the military soon after graduating from Stetson University, where he \nwas a member of the Army ROTC. In 1967, he volunteered for duty in \nVietnam. He quickly worked his way up the ranks, earning a promotion to \nCaptain in 1968. In April of the same year, he was seriously wounded in \na grenade explosion, which cost him both of his legs and his right arm. \nOne month before his tour was up, he was sent home to recover from his \ninjuries.\n  His dedication to public service continued when he won a seat in the \nGeorgia State Senate. As the youngest state senator, he pushed for a \nState law making public facilities accessible to the disabled. In 1975, \nSenator Cleland began his lifelong mission of improving the lives of \nthe men and women in the military. Max was asked to work for the Senate \nVeterans Affairs Committee, and 2 years later he accepted the position \nto head up the U.S. Veterans Administration. He was the youngest \nadministrator and only Vietnam veteran to ever head up the agency. \nDuring his time with the Veterans Administration, Max instituted the \n``Vets Center Program,'' which for the first time provided \npsychological counseling to combat veterans. This program has now led \nto over 200 Vet Centers around the country.\n  Senator Cleland continued his public service for the people of \nGeorgia in 1982, when he was elected Secretary of State. During his \ntime in this position, he fought relentlessly for campaign finance \nreform and to reduce telemarking fraud. Senator Cleland also played a \nkey role in the implementation of the National Voter Registration Act, \nor Motor Voter, in the State of Georgia. This in turn allowed an \nincrease in access to government by getting nearly 1 million citizens \nof Georgia registered to vote.\n  Max was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1996; he filled the spot that \nwas vacated by the retiring Sam Nunn. The 6 years that he spent in the \nSenate were marked by his passion and drive to accomplish what was of \nimportance to the people he served. He was a proponent for the \nPatients' Bill of Rights and doggedly battled for the improvement of \neducation by way of increased resources for teacher training and \ncertification.\n  As a former military man who served his country in Vietnam, Senator \nCleland brought an understanding to the Senate Chamber, of the \nsacrifices made by individuals in the armed forces. This understanding \nled him to champion military causes. As chairman of the Personnel \nSubcommittee of the Armed Services Committee, he fought for \nimprovements in the quality of life of our active-duty, reserve, and \nretired military personnel through enhancement of the Montgomery G.I. \nBill\n\n[[Page S11062]]\n\nand improvement of retirement benefits. All his hard work has not gone \nunnoticed, Senator Cleland has been recognized nationally as the \n``Minute Man of the Year,'' an award given by the Reserve Officers \nAssociation of America to two individuals annually for their tremendous \nleadership in the areas of military and national security. There is no \ndoubt that on and off the battlefield, Max was a leader for the Armed \nForces.\n  Senator Cleland also provided support to military personnel stationed \nat the Grand Forks Air Force Base in North Dakota. In 1997, during the \ndevastating floods in North Dakota, several hundred active duty \npersonnel from the Grand Forks base were unable to access disaster \nrelief because Federal law limited assistance to personnel living on \nthe base. Senator Cleland, as a member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, was instrumental in amending the law to enable those \nservicemen living off base to be eligible for this critical disaster \nassistance.\n  Max's bravery, courage, and passion for these issues and many others \nwill be missed. It has been an honor to serve with somebody who \nrepresents his constituents with such energy, drive and passion. I \nwould like to join my colleagues in wishing the Senator and his family \nthe best in the future and paying tribute to his outstanding public \nservice. I wish him well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/14/senate-section/article/S11062-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11062]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO REPRESENTATIVE JAMES V. HANSEN\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise to pay tribute to my long-time \nfriend and colleague, Representative James V. Hansen. After 22 years of \ndedicated service to his country and to the State of Utah, Jim has \nchosen to end his career as a Member of Congress and return home to \nUtah and to his grandchildren.\n  I am pleased that Mr. Hansen will be able to enjoy his retirement, \nbut we will miss him. Utah has never been better served by a Member of \nCongress. Just this year he was described by a national media source as \none of the 10 most powerful Members of the House of Representatives. \nConsidering the number of Members of that body, that is really saying \nsomething. Representative Hansen has had a very positive impact on our \nNation, but his impact on Utah and Utahns is truly incalculable.\n  Mr. Hansen was the first Representative from Utah to chair a full \ncommittee. Due in large part to the respect he earned among his \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, he was appointed to chair the \nhigh-profile Committee on Standards of Official Conduct.\n  As some of my colleagues may know, Utah is made up of about 70 \npercent public lands which includes national parks, Bureau of Land \nManagement lands, national forests, national monuments, national \nwildlife refuges, and vast military holdings. As a very senior member \nof the House Armed Services Committee and the Chairman of the Committee \non Natural Resources, Representative Hansen has the protector and \npromoter of so many of Utah's interests.\n  Mr. Hansen's service to the public has spanned more that four \ndecades. He spent the first 12 years of his public service career on \nthe City Council of Farmington, UT. Following that, he served for four \nterms as a member of the Utah House of Representatives, including one \nterm as the Speaker of the House. In 1980, Mr. Hansen was elected to \nCongress where he has served diligently until today.\n  Mr. Hansen's honesty, hard work, and strong character have made him a \nlawmaker that we will never forget. I am one of many who will sorely \nmiss his plain talking leadership and his wisdom on matters of public \npolicy. On behalf of my colleagues in the Senate and the people of \nUtah, I would like to publicly thank Jim and his wonderful wife Ann for \ngiving so much of themselves to their State and to their Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/14/senate-section/article/S11062-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11062]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                GRATITUDE FOR NEW ZEALAND'S FIREFIGHTERS\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I rise today, on behalf of my \nState of Oregon, to express our deepest gratitude for the New \nZealanders who put their lives on the line this last summer in fighting \nthe ravenous wildfires experienced in the West.\n  Even as the rains of fall settle into the forests of the Pacific \nNorthwest, it is not difficult to remember the fiery infernos that \nengulfed the West only a few months ago. The year 2002 was the second \nworst fire season in 50 years. Nationwide 21 lives were lost and 6.7 \nmillion acres were burned.\n  It was one of the Nation's largest fires, called the Biscuit Fire, \nthat drew a cadre of international firefighters to Oregon, the world's \nbest sent to join the fight against our worst disaster. The Biscuit \nFire, the largest wildfire in Oregon in over a century, eventually \nburned 500,000 acres in southwestern Oregon. At times, firefighters put \nthe chances of losing one or all of the Illinois Valley's four towns at \n75 percent. However, 7,000 of the world's best firefighters beat the \nodds and staved off an exploding fire that threatened hundreds of \nsquare miles and thousands of homes. As a result of their relentless \nwork, no lives were lost and structural loss was virtually nonexistent.\n  On behalf of my State of Oregon, I want to thank and commend the \nbrave New Zealand firefighters who helped win that battle against \nwildfire. They are John Barnes, Darryl Robson, John Sutton, Richard \nMcNamara, Paul Tolladay, Phil Wishnowsky, Robin Thompson, Trevor Tiday, \nJock Darragh, and Ross Hamilton.\n  While I hope that such perilous circumstances will never call these \nfirefighters back to Oregon or elsewhere, I know that forest fires will \ncontinue to burn and brave firefighters will continue to put their \nlives between the fire and ours. We will never forget that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/14/senate-section/article/S11062-3", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11062]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO SENATOR BOB SMITH\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I take this opportunity to pay tribute \nto and recognize the hard work of my colleague from New Hampshire, \nSenator Bob Smith. Since joining the Senate in 1990, he has fought with \nhonesty and commitment for the issues that he believed to be most \nimportant.\n  As the ranking member and former chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, he focused great attention on reforms of the \nCorps of Engineers and funding to expand and improve transportation \ninfrastructure. Also, as a senior member of the Armed Services \nCommittee, Senator Smith fought passionately for a strong military, and \nalways made national security a top priority.\n  I had the pleasure of working with Bob Smith in his efforts to \nestablish accountability measures for missing MIAs and POWs. In his \ncapacity as a member of the Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs, \nSenator Smith was very helpful in answering and addressing questions \nabout Vietnam POWs from North Dakota. He also helped North Dakotans on \nPOW issues from the cold war era.\n  I also had the privilege of serving with Senator Smith on the Ethics \nCommittee, which he chaired. I found him to be completely fair and non-\npartisan in his conduct of his duties.\n  He also was one of the first of my colleagues to console me on the \nuntimely death of my chief of staff, Kent Hall.\n  Mr. President, it has been an honor to serve in the Senate with Bob \nSmith. I have the utmost respect for his service to the people of New \nHampshire. While sitting in the historic desk of Daniel Webster, he has \nmade contributions not only to the Senate but also to our Nation. I \nwould like to join my colleagues in wishing Senator Smith and his \nfamily the best in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/14/senate-section/article/S11062-4", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11062-S11063]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I rise today to speak about \nhate crimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of \nlast year. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred December 28, \n2001 in Marshfield, MA. According to police, a teenage assailant beat a \nman because the assailant thought the victim was gay. The victim was \nstanding outside a local store when a car containing three men pulled \ninto the parking lot. One of\n\n[[Page S11063]]\n\nthe men in the car yelled anti-gay obscenities at the victim. The \nvictim entered the store with two friends, and upon exiting, was beaten \nby the assailant. The assailant yelled anti-gay epithets while punching \nand kicking the victim, continuing the beating even after the victim \nfell to the ground.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/14/senate-section/article/S11063-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11063-S11066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  21ST CENTURY DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE APPROPRIATIONS AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I thank the Senate for voting to end \ndebate and to pass the bipartisan 21st Century Department of Justice \nAuthorization Act conference report. I commend the Majority Leader for \nbringing this important legislation the floor and filing cloture in \norder for the Senate to take final action on the conference report.\n  I regret that consideration and a vote on final passage on this \nimportant measure was delayed, but I thank the overwhelming majority of \nmy colleagues for supporting cloture and passage of the conference \nreport.\n  This measure was passed by the House, by a vote of 400 to 4, last \nThursday. All Democrats were prepared to pass the conference report \nthat same day last week and any day this week. Given the Republicans' \nobjection to proceed to a vote and given the refusal to agree to a time \nagreement, the Majority Leader was required to file cloture. I am glad \nthat the filibuster is over.\n  This legislation is truly bipartisan. It passed the House 400 to 4. \nThe conference report was signed by every conferee, Republican or \nDemocrat, including Senator Hatch and Representatives Sensenbrenner, \nHyde, and Lamar Smith.\n  Senators from both sides of the aisle spoke in favor of the \nlegislation. In particular, I thank Senator Hutchison for coming to the \nfloor on Tuesday to support this conference report. Senator Hutchison \nhas spoken to me many times about the need for more judgeships along \nthe Texas border with Mexico to handle immigration and criminal cases.\n  The conference report includes three new judgeships in the conference \nreport for Texas, one more than was included in the bill reported to \nthe Senate by the Senate Judiciary Committee and passed by the Senate \nlast December.\n  I thank Senator Sessions for his statements on Tuesday and today in \nsupport of this bipartisan conference report.\n  Although he opposes Senator Hatch's legislation regarding automobile \ndealer arbitration, which enjoys more than 60 Senate cosponsors and 200 \nHouse cosponsors and was included in the conference report, Senator \nSessions is supporting this conference report because it will improve \nthe Department of Justice and support local law enforcement agencies \nacross the nation. I appreciate Senator Sessions' work on the \nprovisions in the conference report on the Paul Coverdell Forensic \nSciences Improvement Grants and the Centers for Domestic Preparedness \nin Alabama and other States.\n  Senator Brownback also spoke in favor of certain immigration \nprovisions in this bill that he worked on with Senator Kennedy, the \nChairman of the Immigration Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee. In \nparticular, the conference report includes language sought by Senators \nConrad and Brownback to reauthorize the program allowing foreign \ndoctors educated in the United States to remain here if they will \npractice in underserved communities. This is a crucial provision to \nensure that residents in some of our most rural states receive adequate \nmedical care.\n  The conference report also contains another important immigration \nprovision to permit H-1B aliens who have labor certification \napplications caught in lengthy agency backlogs to extend their status \nbeyond the sixth year limitation or, if they have already exceeded such \nlimitation, to have a new H-1B petition approved so they can apply for \nan H-1B visa to return from abroad or otherwise re-obtain H-1B status. \nEither a labor certification application or a petition must be filed at \nleast 365 days prior to the end of the 6th year in order for the alien \nto be eligible under this section.\n\n  The slight modification to existing law made by this section is \nnecessary to avoid the disruption of important projects caused by the \nsudden loss of valued employees. At a time when our economy is weak, \nthis provision is intended to help. I thank Senator Kennedy and Senator \nBrownback for their work on this provision and their contributions to \nthe conference report. I thank Senator Feinstein for her excellent \nspeech earlier this week in support of this conference report. Senator \nFeinstein has been a tireless advocate for the needs of California, \nincluding the needs of the federal judiciary along the southern border. \nShe has led the effort to increase judicial and law enforcement \nresources along our southern border. I am proud to have served as the \nchair of the House-Senate conference committee that unanimously \nreported a bill that includes five judgeships for the Southern District \nof California. Long overdue relief for the Southern District of \nCalifornia could be on the way once this conference report is adopted.\n  Senator Biden also contributed a great deal to this conference \nreport. He has fought doggedly to authorize a new Violence Against \nWomen Office at the Justice Department, and his efforts have borne \nfruit in this legislation. He has also been one of the Senate's best \nadvocates for reauthorizing the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency \nPrevention Act, which we do here. In addition, he was a cosponsor of \nthe Drug Abuse Education, Prevention, and Treatment Act, and we have \nincluded many provisions from that bill in this conference report.\n  I also would like to thank Senator Durbin for statements on the \nSenate floor and his dedicated efforts to authorize a new Violence \nAgainst Women Office, to expand the number of Boys and Girls Clubs in \nour nation, and to create new judgeships in Illinois.\n  Senator Kohl was a tremendous help in our efforts to reauthorize the \nJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, especially Title V of \nthat Act, which provides for crucial prevention programs for our \nnation's youth.\n  Senator Carnahan deserves the credit for the inclusion of the Law \nEnforcement Tribute Act in this conference report. That provision \nprovides Federal assistance for local communities seeking to honor \nfallen law enforcement officers. Without her tireless work, we would \nnot have been able to include that provision in this conference report.\n  For his part, Senator Feingold was able to include his and Senator \nHatch's Motor Vehicle Franchise Contract Arbitration Fairness Act in \nthis conference report. That bill will ensure that auto dealers will \nhave a level playing field in their disputes with the auto \nmanufacturers.\n  Finally, I also thank Senator Reid for his helpful comments and \nsupport throughout the debate on the legislation.\n  Of course, our bipartisanship is evidenced by our including \nauthorization for additional judgeships not only in California but also \nin Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, North Carolina, Illinois and \nFlorida. I have tried to improve on the record we inherited.\n  In the six and one-half years that they controlled the Senate, the \nRepublican majority was willing to add only eight judgeships to be \nappointed by a Democratic President, and most of those were in Texas \nand Arizona, States with two Republican Senators. We have, on the other \nhand, proceeded at our earliest opportunity to increase federal \njudgeships by 20, including in the border States where they are most \nneeded, well aware these positions will be filled with appointments by \na Republican President who has shown little interest in working with \nDemocrats in the Senate. These include a number of jurisdictions with \nRepublican Senators.\n  I also commend the senior Senator from California for her leadership \non the ``James Guelff and Chris McCurley Body Armor Act,'' the State \nCriminal Alien Assistance Program reauthorization, and the many anti-\ndrug abuse provisions included in this conference\n\n[[Page S11064]]\n\nreport. She spoke eloquently on the floor of the Senate regarding many \nof the important provisions she has championed in this process.\n  This conference report will strengthen our Justice Department and the \nFBI, increase our preparedness against terrorist attacks, prevent crime \nand drug abuse, improve our intellectual property and antitrust laws, \nstrengthen and protect our judiciary, and offer our children a safe \nplace to go after school.\n  This conference report is the product of years of bipartisan work. By \nmy count, the conference report includes significant portions of at \nleast 25 legislative initiatives. This legislation is neither \ncomplicated nor controversial. It passed the House overwhelmingly and \nin short order with a strong bipartisan vote.\n  I thank my colleagues again for supporting the cloture motion and \nfinal passage of this conference report so that all of this bipartisan \nwork and all the good that this legislation will do, will reach the \nPresident's desk. I particularly want to thank Senator Hatch, who \nworked very hard to help construct a good, fair and balanced conference \nreport as did all of the conferees. Likewise, I want to thank Chairman \nSensenbrenner and Representative Conyers of the House Judiciary \nCommittee for working with us to conclude this conference report \nsuccessfully.\n  The staffs of these Members must also be thanked for working through \nthe summer and over the last month to bring all the pieces of the \nconference report together into a winning package. In particular, the \nHouse Judiciary Committee staff has been enormously helpful, including \nPhil Kiko, Will Moschella, Blaine Merritt, Perry Apelbaum, Ted Kalo, \nSampak Garg, Bobby Vassar, and Alec French. I would also like to thank \nthe staff of the House Education and Workforce Committee, including Bob \nSweet and Denise Forte. The Senate Judiciary Committee staff has shown \nits outstanding professionalism and I want to thank Bruce Cohen, Beryl \nHowell, Ed Pagano, Tim Lynch, Jessica Berry, Robyn Schmidek and Phil \nToomajian, Makan Delrahim, Leah Belaire, Michael Volkov, Melody Barnes, \nEsther Olavarria, Robert Toone, Neil MacBride, and Louisa Terrell.\n  I appreciate that not all Members were or could be conferees and \nparticipate in the conference, but after a full opportunity to study \nthe conference report passed last week in the House by a vote of 400 to \n4, I hope that even those Members who raised objection will conclude \nthat on the whole this is a good, solid piece of legislation.\n  Although the debate is over, I want to address the objections raised \nby a few Members to this legislation. I thank these Members for coming \nto the floor to discuss their views and concerns, and want to show them \nthe respect they deserve by responding to those objections. I should \nnote that even in posing an objection to and delaying passage of the \nconference report--as is their rights as Senators--these Members \nacknowledged that there were parts of this bill they liked or may like \nupon review.\n  Contrary to those who may argue that this legislation is not a \npriority, it is. Congress has not authorized the Department of Justice \nin more than two decades. While the Justice Department would certainly \ncontinue to exist if we were to fail to reauthorize it, that is not an \nexcuse for shirking our responsibility now. I know that Senator Hatch \nand Representatives Sensenbrenner and Conyers share my view. It is long \npast time for the Judiciary Committees of the House and Senate--and the \nCongress as a whole--to restore their proper oversight role over the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  Through Republican and Democratic administrations, we have allowed \nthe Department of Justice to escape its accountability to the Senate \nand House of Representatives and through them to the American people. \nCongress, the people's representative, has a strong institutional \ninterest in restoring that accountability. The House has recognized \nthis, and has done its job. I am glad that we have done ours.\n\n  I agree with those Members who say that we need to give anti-\nterrorism priority, but not lose sight of the other important missions \nof the Department of Justice. The conference report takes such a \nbalanced approach. Those critics who say that there is nothing new in \nthis legislation to fight terrorism, have missed some important \nprovisions in the legislation as well as my floor statements over the \npast week outlining what the conference report contains to help in the \nanti-terrorism effort.\n  Let me repeat the highlights of what the conference report does on \nthis important problem.\n  The conference report fortifies our border security by authorizing \nover $20 billion for the administration and enforcement of the laws \nrelating to immigration, naturalization, and alien registration. It \nalso authorizes funding for Centers for Domestic Preparedness in \nAlabama, Texas, New Mexico, Louisiana, Nevada, Vermont and \nPennsylvania, and adds additional uses for grants from the Office of \nDomestic Preparedness to support State and local law enforcement \nagencies. These provisions have strong bipartisan support. I thank \nSenator Sessions, Senator Shelby and Senator Specter for supporting \ncloture on the conference report and for final passage.\n  Another measure in the bill would correct a glitch in a law that \nhelps prosecutors combat the international financing of terrorism. I \nworked closely with the White House to pass the original provision to \nbring the United States into compliance with a treaty that bans \nterrorist financing, but without this technical, non-controversial \nchange, the provision may not be usable. This law is vital in stopping \nthe flow of money to terrorists. Worse yet, at a time when the \nPresident is going before the U.N. emphasizing that our enemies are not \ncomplying with international law, by blocking this minor fix, we leave \nourselves open to a charge that we are not complying with an anti-\nterrorism treaty.\n  I agree with other Members that we should do more to help the FBI \nDirector in transforming the FBI from a crime fighting to a terrorism \nprevention agency and to help the FBI overcome its information \ntechnology, management and other problems to be the best that it can \nbe. The Judiciary Committee reported unanimously the Leahy-Grassley FBI \nReform Act, S. 1974, over six months ago to reach those goals, but this \nlegislation has been blocked by an anonymous hold from moving forward. \nThis conference report contains parts of that bipartisan legislation, \nbut not the whole bill, which continues to this day to be blocked to \nthis day.\n  Since the attacks of September 11 and the anthrax attacks last fall, \nwe have relied on the FBI to detect and prevent acts of catastrophic \nterrorism that endanger the lives of the American people and the \ninstitutions of our country. Reform and improvement at the FBI was \nalready important, but the terrorist attacks suffered by this country \nlast year have imposed even greater urgency on improving the FBI. The \nBureau is our front line of domestic defense against terrorists. It \nneeds to be as great as it can.\n  Even before those attacks, the Judiciary Committee's oversight \nhearings revealed serious problems at the FBI that needed strong \ncongressional action to fix. We heard about a double standard in \nevaluations and discipline. We heard about record and information \nmanagement problems and communications breakdowns between field offices \nand Headquarters that led to the belated production of documents in the \nOklahoma City bombing case. Despite the fact that we have poured money \ninto the FBI over the last five years, we heard that the FBI's computer \nsystems were in dire need of modernization.\n  We heard about how an FBI supervisor, Robert Hanssen, was able to \nsell critical secrets to the Russians undetected for years without ever \ngetting a polygraph. We heard that there were no fewer than 15 \ndifferent areas of security at the FBI that needed fixing.\n  The FBI Reform Act tackles these problems with improved \naccountability, improved security both inside and outside the FBI, and \nrequired planning to ensure the FBI is prepared to deal with the \nmultitude of challenges we are facing.\n  We are all indebted to Senator Grassley for his leadership in the \narea. Working with Republicans and Democrats on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee we unanimously reported\n\n[[Page S11065]]\n\nthe FBI Reform Act more than six months ago only to be stymied in our \nbipartisan efforts by an anonymous Republican hold.\n  The conference report does not contain all of the important \nprovisions in the FBI Reform Act that Senator Grassley and I, and the \nother members of the Judiciary Committee, agreed were needed, but it \ndoes contain parts of that other bill.\n  Among the items that are, unfortunately, not in the conference report \nand are being blocked from passing in the stand-alone FBI Reform bill \nby an anonymous Republican hold are the following: Title III of the FBI \nReform bill that would institute a career security officer program, \nwhich senior FBI officials have testified before our Committee would be \nvery helpful;\n  Title IV of the FBI Reform bill outlining the requirements for a \npolygraph program along the lines of what the Webster Commission \nrecommended;\n  Title VII of the FBI Reform bill that takes important steps to fix \nsome of the double standard problems and support the FBI's Office of \nProfessional Responsibility, which FBI Ethics and OPR agents say is \nvery important; and\n  Title VIII to push along implementation of secure communications \nnetworks to help facilitate FISA processing between Main Justice and \nthe FBI. These hard-working agents and prosecutors have to hand-carry \ntop secret FISA documents between their offices because they still lack \nsend secure e-mail systems.\n  The FBI Reform bill would help fix may of these problems and I would \nhope we would be able to pass all of the FBI Reform Act before the end \nof this Congress. These should not be controversial provisions and are \ndesigned to help the FBI.\n  During the debate on this conference report, some Members complained \nit included provisions that were not contained in either the Senate or \nHouse bills. Now, each of the proposals we have included are directly \nrelated to improving the administration of justice in the United \nStates. We were asked to include many of them by Republican members of \nthe House and Senate.\n  Let me give you some examples. The conference report reauthorizes the \nState Criminal Alien Assistance Program, which President Bush has \nsought to eliminate. On March 4 of this year, Senator Kyl and Senator \nFeinstein sent me a letter asking me to include an authorization for \nSCAAP--which was not authorized in either the House- or Senate-passed \nbill--in the conference report. That proposal had been considered and \nreported by the Judiciary Committee but a Republican hold has stopped \nSenate consideration and passage. I agreed with Senator Kyl that we \nshould authorize SCAAP. I still believe that it is the right thing to \ndo.\n  In addition to including the reauthorization of SCAAP, the conferees \nalso authorized an additional judge for Arizona. Members have been \narguing for years that their States need more judges. We took those \narguments seriously, and added another new judge for Arizona on top of \nthe two that were added in 1998 and the third that was added in 2000. \nAs I said before, we have added 20 additional judicial positions in \nthis conference report.\n  Some have been critical of the conference report's authorization of \nfunding for DEA police training in South and Central Asia, and for the \nUnited States-Thailand drug prosecutor exchange program. I believe that \nboth of these are worthy programs that deserve the Senate's support.\n  I have listened to President Bush and others in his Administration \nand in Congress argue that terrorist organizations in Asia, including \nAl Qaeda, have repeatedly used drug proceeds to fund their operations. \nThe conferees wanted to do whatever we could to break the link between \ndrug trafficking and terror, and we would all greatly appreciate the \nSenate's assistance in that effort.\n  Beyond the relationship between drug trafficking and terrorism, the \nproduction of drugs in Asia has a tremendous impact on America.\n  For example, more than a quarter of the heroin that is plaguing the \nnortheastern United States, including my State of Vermont, comes from \nSoutheast Asia. Many of the governments in that region want to work \nwith the United States to reduce the production of drugs, and these \nprograms will help. It is beyond me why any Senator would oppose them.\n  Some have complained that the conference report demands too many \nreports from the Department of Justice and that this would interfere \nwith the Department's ongoing counterterorism efforts. It is true that \nour legislation requires a number of reports, as part of our oversight \nobligations over the Department of Justice. I assure the Senate, \nhowever, that if the Department of Justice comes to the House and \nSenate Judiciary Committees and makes a convincing case that any \nreporting requirement in this legislation will hinder our national \nsecurity, we will work out a reasonable accommodation. I think, \nhowever, that such a turn of events is exceedingly unlikely, as no one \nat the Department has mentioned any such concerns.\n  Some Members have complained that the conference report includes \npieces of legislation that had not received Committee consideration. \nLet me deal with some of the specific proposals that have been cited.\n  The Law Enforcement Tribute Act was mentioned as a provision not \nconsidered by the Judiciary Committee, but this is incorrect. In \nreality, the Committee reported that bill favorably on May 16. Its \npassage has been blocked by an anonymous Republican hold.\n  Complaints have been made about inclusion of the motor vehicle \nfranchise dispute resolution provision in the conference report for \nbypassing the Committee. But, again, that is incorrect. The Judiciary \nCommittee fully considered this proposal and reported Senator Hatch's \nMotor Vehicle Franchise Contract Arbitration Fairness Act last October \n31. It has been stalled from the Senate floor by anonymous Republican \nholds.\n  A section allowing FBI danger pay was cited as a proposal that \nbypassed Committee consideration, but, again, the Judiciary Committee \ndid consider this proposal as part of the original DOJ Authorization \nbill, S. 1319.\n  Some have complained that the Federal Judiciary Protection Act, which \nis included in the conference report, had not come before the \nCommittee, but on the contrary, this legislation, S. 1099, was passed \nthe Judiciary Committee and the Senate by unanimous consent last year \nand in the 106th Congress, as well.\n  A complaint was raised on the floor about a provision on the U.S. \nParole Commission being included in the conference report. That was \nincluded because the Bush Administration included it in its budget \nrequest.\n  A complaint was also raised about the conference report's provision \nestablishing the FBI police to provide protection for the FBI buildings \nand personnel in this time of heightened concerns about terrorist \nattacks. Contrary to the critics, this proposal was considered by the \nJudiciary Committee as part of the FBI Reform Act, S. 1974, which was \nreported unanimously on a bipartisan basis but has been blocked by an \nanonymous hold.\n  Similarly, a complaint was made on the floor about bypassing the \nCommittee with the provision in the conference report for the FBI to \ntell the Congress about how the FBI is updating its obsolete computer \nsystems. Again, this is incorrect. This provision was included in the \nFBI Reform Act, S. 1974, which was considered by the Judiciary \nCommittee and unanimously reported without objection.\n  Some critics have complained that the conference report includes \nintellectual property provisions that have passed neither the House or \nthe Senate. It is not for lack of trying to pass these provisions \nthrough the Senate, but anonymous Republican holds have held up for \nmonths passage of the Madrid Protocol Implementation Act, S. 407. This \nlegislation has passed the House on three separate times in three \nconsecutive Congresses. Let us get it passed now in the conference \nreport.\n  The conference report also contains another intellectual property \nmatter, the Hatch-Leahy TEACH Act, to help distance learning. Contrary \nto the critics' statements, this passed the Senate in June, 2001.\n  The Intellectual Property and High Technology Technical Amendments \nAct, S. 320, contained in this conference report, was passed by the \nSenate at the beginning of this Congress,\n\n[[Page S11066]]\n\nin February, 2001. It is time to get this done.\n  The criticism made on the floor that the juvenile justice provisions \nin the conference report never passed the House or Senate is simply \nwrong. The conference report contains juvenile justice provisions \npassed by the House in September and October of last year, in H.R. 863 \nand H.R. 1900.\n  The criticism that the conference report contains criminal justice \nimprovements that were passed by neither the House or the Senate \nglosses over two important points: First, that many of the provisions \nwere indeed passed by the House, and, second, that others have been \nblocked from Senate consideration and passage by anonymous Republican \nholds. Let me give you some examples.\n  The conference report contains the Judicial Improvements Act, S. 2713 \nand HR 3892, that passed the House in July, 2002, but consideration by \nthe Senate was blocked after the Senate bill was reported by the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  The Antitrust Technical Corrections bills, H.R. 809, had the same \nfate. After being passed by the House in March, 2001, and reported by \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, consideration was blocked in the \nSenate.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n  This conference report is a comprehensive attempt to ensure the \nadministration of justice in our nation. It is not everything I would \nlike or that any individual Member of Congress might have authored.\n  It is a conference report, a consensus document, a product of the \ngive and take with the House that is our legislative process. It will \nstrengthen our Justice Department and the FBI, increase our \npreparedness against terrorist attacks, prevent crime and drug abuse, \nimprove our intellectual property and antitrust laws, strengthen and \nprotect our judiciary, and offer our children a safe place to go after \nschool.\n  The conference report merits the support of the United States Senate \nto help the Justice Department and the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/14/senate-section/article/S11066-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11066-S11067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            FY 2003 DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise today to speak briefly about my \nsupport for the fiscal year 2003 National Defense Authorization \nConference Report and would like to particularly endorse its name as \nthe Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 \nin recognition of the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee's \n25 years of distinguished service to that Committee.\n  I also acknowledge the senior Senator from Michigan, Mr. Carl Levin, \nthe chairman of the Armed Services Committee, for the leadership he \nprovided in support of the authorization bill, and, of course, the \nranking member, Senator John Warner of Virginia, whose tireless efforts \non behalf of veterans led to the final agreements that brought this \nbill to the floor.\n  Let me recognize the efforts of every Senator on the Committee. As a \nformer member of that committee, I well understand the long hours and \npersistent effort needed to move this vital bipartisan legislation.\n  The conference report takes great strides toward improving the \nquality of service for our dedicated men and women of the military, \nmodernizing our armed services, and making our homeland safe.\n  Because we recognize that our service members are our most valuable \nasset, this legislation makes a solid investment in their quality of \nlife by increasing pay and enhancing educational and health care \nopportunities for our active duty military members and their family \nmembers. And that is only right, for today we are asking a great deal \nof our gallant young men and women as they guard our Nation at home and \nabroad in this dangerous and deadly post-September 11 world.\n  This legislation recognizes that we also owe a continuing debt to \nthose who have served honorably by finally granting combat-wounded \nmilitary retirees the same benefit available to every other retired \nFederal employee--the ability to collect full retirement pay and \ndisability entitlements without offsets. There is much work to be done \nbefore we achieve the full equity of concurrent receipt for all \ndisabled military retirees, but as Senator Warner has appropriately \nnoted, we have established a ``beachhead'' for this issue.\n  I do find it regrettable, however, that the conference report does \nnot complete the job of overturning the ban on privately funded \nabortion services in overseas military hospitals for military women and \ndependents based overseas, which was reinstated in the Fiscal Year 1996 \nauthorization bill.\n  This is a ban that, without merit or reason, puts the reproductive \nhealth of these women at risk . . . a ban that the Senate voted to \noverturn in June by a vote of 52-40. Sadly, this is the second time \nthat this policy change, which has been supported by the majority of \nthe Senate, has fallen victim to the conference committee process.\n  This ban continues to be a threat to more than just the freedoms of \nAmerican military women overseas, it's also a threat to their health \nbecause it places them at the mercy of the local health care \ninfrastructure in whatever country that they are based. While I support \nthis conference report, I remain deeply disappointed that the \nconference did not include this critical change of policy regarding \nthis arbitrary ban.\n  As for modernizing our forces, let me speak on an area that is \ncritical to the security of the Nation--shipbuilding. We are learning \nthat in order to effectively engage the forces of terror wherever they \nhide, we must have the ability to project our power immediately to any \npart of the globe. Today, we can do that by dispatching our forces in \ncarrier battle groups or amphibious ready groups. However, as a former \nchair of the Seapower Subcommittee, I remained concerned, as I know the \ncommittee is, about the continuing decline in shipbuilding investments \nmade by the Navy.\n  I note the conferees included detailed language about the Navy's ship \nacquisition program and completely agree with their conclusion that, \nwithout a fully vetted long range ship-building program, we will be \nfaced with a Navy that is unable to carry out the missions assigned to \nthem in both the short-term and the long-term.\n  To quote the report, ``Absent more immediate investment, DOD will \nhave to reduce the number or scope of missions assigned to Navy ships. \nWitnesses have testified that, if neither course is incorporated in \nfuture Navy budget programs, the men and women of the Navy and the \nMarine Corps will bear the burden of these decisions through some \ncombination of longer deployments and less time at home between \ndeployments.''\n  I find that very troubling indeed in these dangerous times.\n  Therefore, I am encouraged this legislation mandates stronger \nshipbuilding funding and construction in the future years. Provisions \nsuch as section 1022 that requires the Navy to submit an annual 30 year \nshipbuilding plan with their budget request will not only assist us in \nunderstanding the Navy's ship recapitalization plan but will ensure \nthat the Department of Defense and Navy are committed to buying the \nnumber and type of ships necessary to fulfill all of their missions.\n  I am also pleased that this authorization provides $2.4 billion for \nthe construction of two DDG-51 Arleigh-Burke class destroyers and \nextends through fiscal year 2007 the multi-year procurement authority \nfor that class. For it is these ships, along with cruisers and \nfrigates, that provide protection to the carriers and amphibious ships \nwe are deploying to the Persian Gulf to prosecute the war on terrorism. \nSurface combatants are the backbone of our Navy and I support section \n1021 that requires the Secretary of the Navy to notify Congress should \nthe number of active and reserve surface combatant ships drop below \n116.\n  The legislation also looks to the future by authorizing almost $970 \nmillion for the development of technologies to be incorporated into the \nnext generation of surface combatant, the DD(X) land attack destroyer. \nMoreover, it adds $5 million for the DDG Destroyer Optimized Manning \nInitiative, a Navy effort to enhance the operational effectiveness of \nAegis destroyers with new technologies, policies and procedures to \nsignificantly reduce crew workload and improve readiness.\n  The legislation authorizes $10.4 billion, $376 million more than \nrequested, for science and technology programs\n\n[[Page S11067]]\n\nincluding many that will be performed in Maine to protect our troops \nand our homeland such as the project designed to help identify and \naddress the needs of military personnel in the event of a biowarfare \nattack.\n  Of potentially significant value to the Navy, it authorizes $1 \nmillion for research at the University of Maine aimed at developing a \nspecialized structural reliability analysis process to optimize the use \nof polymers in future ship construction, and provides $5 million in \nfunding for development of a Small Kill Vehicle Technology, aimed at \nimproving the accuracy of missile and anti-missile technology.\n  Furthermore, among the more critical provisions of this legislation \nare those aimed at protecting our homeland. It provides the President \nwith $10 billion for the war against terrorism including $4.3 billion \nfor military operations and $1 billion for equipment replacement and \nupgrades to military capabilities.\n  And finally, the legislation includes almost $1 billion for Chem-Bio \nprograms designed to provide advanced individual protection and \nequipment to detect and decontaminate chemical and biological agents, \nas well as an additional $480 million for DoD homeland security and \nconsequence management.\n  This authorization provides the men and women of our armed forces \nwith the equipment they need to accomplish their mission, the quality \nof life they have earned and security for their families. I have been \nproud to support this legislation because in a year when our Nation is \nfacing unprecedented security challenges and dangers, we can do no \nless.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/14/senate-section/article/S11067-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11067-S11069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE PIPELINE SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2002\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I am pleased that last night the \nSenate unanimously passed pipeline safety legislation in the form of \nH.R. 3609, the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002. This bill is \nthe product of over three years of bipartisan work and compromise, and \nI thank my colleague, Senator McCain, for his leadership on this \nimportant issue.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would like to thank my many colleagues for joining us \nin supporting this important legislation. This bill will result in \nimprovements in the safety regulatory program at the Department of \nTransportation, increased levels of safety throughout our national \npipeline system, and in the communities through which pipelines run. \nThis bill contains several important improvements, including: \nrequirements for minimum standards for pipeline integrity management \nprograms, requirements for public education programs, and requirements \nthat the Office of Pipeline Safety and the Research and Special \nPrograms Administration comply with safety recommendations made by the \nNational Transportation Safety Board and the Department of \nTransportation Inspector General, many of which have already been \nstarted.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. To expedite enactment of the significant pipeline \nsafety reforms included in this bill, the leadership of the Senate \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation has worked with the \nHouse Committees on Transportation and Infrastructure and Energy and \nCommerce in developing the compromise agreement. This Joint Explanatory \nStatement therefore represents the views of the Chairman and Ranking \nMember of the Senate Commerce Committee, along with the Chairmen and \nRanking Members of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and \nthe Energy and Commerce Committee. This Joint Explanatory Statement \nwill provide legislative history for interpreting this important \npipeline safety legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this statement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n   Section 1. Short title; amendment of title 49, United States Code\n\n       This section designates the act as the ``Pipeline Safety \n     Improvement Act of 2002.''\n\n               Section 2. One-call notification programs\n\n       This section requires that state one-call notification \n     programs provide for the participation of government \n     operators and contract excavators. Section 2 also requires \n     that state one-call notification programs document enumerated \n     items set forth in the statute. Additionally, the requirement \n     that the Secretary of Transportation include certain \n     information in reports submitted under section 60124 of Title \n     49 is made permanent. Authorizations for appropriations for \n     grants to states for fiscal years 2003 through 2006 are \n     provided at $1,000,000 per year, and grants for \n     administration in section 6107(b) are updated for fiscal \n     years 2003 through 2006. This section also amends section \n     6105 of Title 49 by requiring the Secretary of Transportation \n     to encourage the states, operators of one-call notification \n     programs, operators of underground facilities, and excavators \n     (including government and contract excavators) to use the \n     practices set forth in the best practices report entitled \n     ``Common Ground,'' as periodically updated, and requires the \n     Secretary of Transportation to provide technical assistance \n     to a non-profit organization specifically established for the \n     purpose of reducing construction-related damage to \n     underground facilities. Authorizations for appropriations for \n     fiscal years 2003 through 2006 are provided at $500,000 per \n     year, but would not be derived from user fees collected under \n     section 60301 of title 49.\n\n         Section 3. One-call notification of pipeline operators\n\n       This section provides for the enforcement of one-call \n     notification programs by a state authority if the state's \n     program meets the requirements set forth in the statute. The \n     application of the term ``person'' who intends to engage in \n     an activity necessitating the use of the one-call system is \n     expanded to include government employees or contractors.\n       This section amends section 60123(d) of Title 49 by \n     rearranging the phrase ``knowingly and willfully'' to address \n     the problem raised when a court interpreted existing law to \n     require a knowing and willful standard to, not only engaging \n     in an excavation activity, but also to subsequently damaging \n     a pipeline facility. The consequence of the court's \n     interpretation makes prosecutions more difficult by requiring \n     the government to show the defendant knew subsequent damages \n     would result from excavation activity and that the \n     defendant's conduct was willful. This section of the bill \n     corrects the court's interpretation by now requiring that the \n     ``knowingly and willfully'' standard apply only to engaging \n     in an excavation activity.\n       This section also provides that penalties under the \n     criminal penalties section can be reduced if the violator \n     promptly reports a violation.\n\n                    Section 4. State oversight role\n\n       This section amends section 60106 of Title 49 to allow the \n     Secretary of Transportation to make an agreement with a state \n     authority authorizing the state authority to participate in \n     the oversight of interstate pipeline transportation including \n     incident investigation, new construction, and other \n     inspection and investigatory duties. However the Secretary \n     shall not delegate the enforcement of safety standards for \n     interstate pipeline facilities to a state authority. This \n     section further provides that the Secretary may terminate \n     agreements with the State authorities if a gap results in \n     the State authority's oversight responsibilities of \n     intrastate pipeline transportation, the State authority \n     fails to meet requirements set forth in this section, or \n     continued participation in the oversight of interstate \n     pipeline transportation would not promote pipeline safety. \n     Existing state agreements shall continue until a new \n     agreement between the state and the DOT is executed or \n     December 31, 2003, whichever is sooner.\n\n                  Section 5. Public education programs\n\n       Section 5 amends section 60116 of Title 49 to include \n     hazardous liquid pipeline facilities in this section \n     requiring a continuing program to educate the public on the \n     use of one-call notification systems, the possible hazards \n     associated with unintended releases, and how to tell if an \n     unintended release occurred, what steps should be taken for \n     public safety in the event of a pipeline release, and how to \n     report such an event. This section also requires owners and \n     operators to review existing public education programs for \n     effectiveness and to modify their programs as necessary. In \n     addition, the section allows the Secretary to issue standards \n     prescribing the elements of public education programs and \n     develop materials for use in such programs.\n       Previous versions of Senate-passed pipeline safety \n     legislation also included a provision calling for the \n     coordination of emergency preparedness between operators of \n     pipeline facilities and state and local officials, as well as \n     to provide for public access to certain safety information. \n     Agreement was not reached on how safety information could be \n     accessed by the public in a manner that would protect \n     security-sensitive information from distribution. The \n     managers agreed that this issue would be better dealt with in \n     the context of the pending homeland security legislation.\n\n     Section 6. Protection of employees providing pipeline safety \n                              information\n\n       This section adds provisions for the protection of \n     employees who are discharged or otherwise discriminated \n     against with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or \n     privileges of employment for (1) providing information to the \n     federal government about alleged violations of Federal law \n     relating to pipeline safety; (2) refusing to participate in \n     any practice made illegal by Federal law relating to pipeline \n     safety; or (3) assisting or\n\n[[Page S11068]]\n\n     participating in any proceeding to carry out the purposes of \n     pipeline safety legislation. This section establishes the \n     procedural framework in which complaints are handled by the \n     Secretary of Labor and the remedies available to the \n     prevailing party.\n       This section contains a provision that essentially says if \n     a preliminary order provides that an employee must be allowed \n     to return to work, the filing of an objection by the employer \n     ``shall not operate to stay any reinstatement remedy \n     contained in the preliminary order.'' The intention of this \n     language is to assure that the mere filing of an objection \n     would not work as an automatic stay, thus precluding an \n     employee from returning to work pending the outcome of the \n     matter. However, this language would not preclude an employer \n     from filing an independent motion for a stay if sufficient \n     grounds exist for the filing of such a motion.\n\n                        Section 7. Safety orders\n\n       Section 7 adds a paragraph to section 60117 of Title 49 to \n     give the Secretary of Transportation authority to order an \n     operator of a facility to take corrective action if the \n     Secretary decides that a potential safety-related condition \n     exists. The Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) requested this \n     provision so that corrective action could be taken \n     immediately rather than waiting until a facility is \n     classified as ``hazardous'' prior to requiring corrective \n     action.\n\n                          Section 8. Penalties\n\n       This section modifies the existing penalties provision set \n     forth in section 60112 of Title 49 to allow the Secretary of \n     Transportation to decide if the operation of a pipeline \n     facility, is ``or would be'' hazardous to life, property, or \n     the environment. The purpose of the modification is to give \n     the Secretary authority to take action prior to the facility, \n     the construction of the facility, or any component of the \n     facility actually becoming hazardous, thereby establishing a \n     framework of preventative actions, rather than actions only \n     in response to an imminent hazard.\n       In subsection (a)(1) of section 60122, the amounts of the \n     penalties have been increased. The per day, per incident, \n     amount has been increased from $25,000 to $100,000. The \n     maximum civil penalty for a related series of violations has \n     been increased from $500,000 to $1,000,000. This section of \n     the bill also provides that, in determining the amount of a \n     civil penalty, the Secretary of Transportation shall consider \n     as an additional consideration in section 60122(b) of Title \n     49, the adverse impact on the environment. The Secretary of \n     Transportation may consider the economic benefit gained from \n     the violation without reduction because of subsequent \n     damages.\n       This section also modifies the enforcement section of the \n     statute (section 60120(a)(1) of Title 49) by specifically \n     providing that the court may award appropriate relief, \n     including a temporary or permanent injunction, punitive \n     damages, and the assessment of civil penalties. The current \n     statutory language specifying that the Attorney General \n     may proceed only at the request of the Secretary of \n     Transportation remains in effect.\n       Section 8 also requires that the Comptroller General \n     conduct a study of the actions, policies, and procedures of \n     the Secretary of Transportation for assessing and collecting \n     fines and penalties.\n\n      Section 9. Pipeline safety information grants to communities\n\n       Section 9 requires the Secretary of Transportation to make \n     grants for technical assistance to local communities and \n     groups of individuals (not including for-profit entities) \n     relating to the safety of pipelines in local communities. The \n     purpose of this provision is to provide grants to communities \n     for technical assistance such as engineering or scientific \n     analysis of pipeline safety issues. Applicants must compete \n     for the grants in a procedure established by the Secretary of \n     Transportation, who shall also establish the criteria for the \n     recipients. Additionally, the Secretary must establish \n     procedures to ensure that the funds have been properly \n     accounted for and spent in a manner consistent with the \n     purpose of the grants. Any one-grant recipient may not \n     receive more than $50,000. The grant funds cannot be used for \n     lobbying or in direct support of litigation. This section \n     authorizes the appropriation of $1,000,000 for each of the \n     fiscal years 2003 through 2006.\n\n           Section 10. Operator assistance in investigations\n\n       This section requires the operator of a pipeline facility \n     to make available information and records to the Secretary of \n     Transportation or the National Safety Transportation Board \n     (NTSB) in the event of an accident, subject to constitutional \n     protections for operators and employees. Actions taken by an \n     operator pursuant to this section shall be in accordance with \n     the terms and conditions of any applicable collective \n     bargaining agreement.\n\n         Section 11. Population encroachment and rights-of-way\n\n       This section requires the Secretary of Transportation, \n     along with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) \n     and other federal agencies and state and local governments, \n     to study land use practices and zoning ordinances, as well as \n     the preservation of environmental resources, with regard to \n     pipeline rights-of-way. Based upon the purposes set forth in \n     this section, a report is to be written that identifies \n     successful practices, ordinances, and laws addressing \n     population encroachment on pipeline rights-of-way, being \n     mindful of protecting the public safety, pipeline workers, \n     and the environment. The report must be completed within one \n     year from the date of enactment and provided to Congress, \n     appropriate federal agencies, and the States for further \n     distribution to the appropriate local authorities.\n\n Section 12. Pipeline integrity, safety, and reliability research and \n                              development\n\n       This section requires the heads of the participating \n     agencies to carry out a program of research, development, \n     demonstration, and standardization to ensure the integrity of \n     pipelines. The Secretary of Energy, Secretary of \n     Transportation, and the Director of the National Institute of \n     Standards and Technology (NIST) each have defined roles. The \n     Secretary of Transportation, in coordination with the \n     Secretary of Energy and the Director of the National \n     Institute of Standards and Technology, shall prepare and \n     submit to Congress a 5-year plan to guide the activities \n     under this section. The plan shall also be submitted to the \n     Technical Pipeline Safety Standards Committee and the \n     Technical Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Standards \n     Committee for review. The section authorizes appropriations \n     for the fiscal years 2003 through 2006 in the following \n     amounts: Secretary of Energy: $10,000,000; the Secretary of \n     Transportation: $10,000,000; and the National Institute of \n     Standards and Technology: $5,000,000. Any sums authorized \n     pursuant to this section shall not be derived from user fees. \n     In addition $3,000,000 from the Oil Spill Liability Trust \n     Fund shall be transferred to the Secretary of Transportation, \n     as provided in appropriations Acts, to carry out programs for \n     detection, prevention, and mitigation of oil spills for each \n     of the fiscal years 2003 through 2006.\n       Even though the Secretary of Transportation does not \n     regulate gathering lines, the participating agencies are \n     encouraged to include such lines in their research, \n     development, demonstration, and standardization efforts on \n     the integrity of gathering lines.\n\n              Section 13. Pipeline qualification programs\n\n       This section requires the Secretary of Transportation to \n     require operators of pipeline facilities to develop \n     qualification programs for their personnel who perform \n     covered tasks (as defined in the Code of Federal \n     Regulations). This section also requires the Secretary to \n     have in place standards and criteria for such qualification \n     programs, including a method for examining or testing the \n     qualifications of individuals who perform covered tasks. Such \n     method may include written examination, oral examination, on-\n     the-job training, simulations, observation during on-the-job \n     performance, and other forms of assessment. The method may \n     not be limited to observation of on-the-job performance, \n     except with respect to tasks where the Secretary has \n     determined specifically that such observation is the best \n     method of examining or testing qualifications. Further, the \n     Secretary must ensure that the results of any such on-the-job \n     performance observations are documented in writing. The \n     Secretary may waive or modify requirements if not \n     inconsistent with pipeline safety. The Secretary is required \n     to verify each operator's qualification program, including \n     modifications to previously verified programs. In the event \n     the Secretary fails to establish standards and criteria as \n     set forth in this section, pipeline facility operators are \n     required to develop and implement qualification programs \n     based on the requirements of this section. The Secretary is \n     required to report to Congress within 5 years on the \n     status and results of personnel qualification regulations. \n     A pilot program is established for the certification of \n     individuals who operate computer-based systems for \n     controlling the operations of pipelines. The pilot program \n     seeks the participation of 3 pipeline facilities.\n\n  Section 14. Risk analysis and integrity management programs for gas \n                               pipelines\n\n       This section requires operators of pipeline facilities \n     subject to section 60109 of Title 49 to adopt and implement a \n     written integrity management program to reduce risks to each \n     facility. Within 12 months of the enactment of the bill, this \n     section requires the Secretary of Transportation to prescribe \n     standards to direct each operator's conduct of a risk \n     analysis and adoption and implementation of an integrity \n     management program, which must occur within 24 months from \n     the enactment of the section. Minimum requirements are set \n     forth in this section for integrity management programs and \n     for the rule regulating the same, which include a baseline \n     integrity assessment of each of an operator's facilities \n     which must be completed within 10 years after the enactment \n     of the section (at least 50 percent of such facilities shall \n     be assessed no later than 5 years after the date of enactment \n     of this section), and a reassessment of each facility at a \n     minimum of once every 7 years, with prioritization being \n     based on all relevant risk factors, including any previously \n     discovered defects or anomalies and any history of leaks, \n     repairs, or failures.\n       The Secretary of Transportation is required to issue a rule \n     on integrity management programs, and each operator of a \n     pipeline facility subject to section 60109 of Title 49 is \n     required to adopt and implement an integrity management \n     program, even if the Secretary does not issue a rule. This \n     section does not apply to natural gas distribution lines \n     because section 60109 of Title 49 does not, nor was it \n     intended to, apply to natural gas distribution lines.\n\n[[Page S11069]]\n\n       Section 14 authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to \n     grant waivers and modifications pursuant to section 60118(c) \n     of Title 49 for any requirement for reassessment of a \n     facility for reasons that may include the need to maintain \n     local product supply or the lack of internal inspection \n     devices. The waivers or modifications shall not be \n     inconsistent with pipeline safety.\n       This section also requires that the Comptroller General \n     conduct a study to evaluate the 7-year reassessment interval \n     required by this section. The study is to be completed and \n     transmitted to Congress no later than 4 years from the date \n     of enactment.\n       In this section, each operator of a gas pipeline facility \n     is required to conduct a risk analysis for facilities located \n     in high consequence areas and to adopt and implement an \n     integrity management program for each such facility to reduce \n     associated risks. This section requires each operator to \n     prioritize facilities for integrity assessment based on \n     all risk factors, including any history of leaks, repairs, \n     or failures, and directs the operator to give priority to \n     facilities with the highest risks.\n       The Department of Transportation's Research and Special \n     Programs Administration (RSPA) issued a final rule defining \n     ``high consequence areas'' on August 6, 2002. The managers \n     strongly support RSPA's regulation defining high consequence \n     areas, although recognize that the definition could be \n     subject to alteration by future regulatory action by RSPA.\n       Pipeline safety regulations have long required gas \n     operators to survey and patrol along their pipeline rights-\n     of-way to classify areas of population. The new definition of \n     high consequence areas builds on the existing classification \n     of areas where the potential consequences of a gas pipeline \n     accident may be significant or may do considerable harm to \n     people and their property, and includes current class 3 and 4 \n     locations, facilities with persons who are mobility impaired, \n     confined, or hard to evacuate, and places where people gather \n     for recreational and other purposes.\n       In the July 2002 Technical Pipeline Safety Standards \n     Committee meeting to consider the proposed definition, RSPA \n     made clear its intent to include in its definition known \n     areas where people gather, such as the Pecos River pipeline \n     crossing near Carlsbad, New Mexico, which was commonly used \n     by campers and fishermen and was the location of a pipeline \n     rupture in August 2000 that resulted in 12 fatalities. The \n     managers support is expressed for this new definition of high \n     consequence areas and expect RSPA to further clarify the \n     application of the definition in the substantive rule to be \n     issued on integrity management programs.\n\n              Section 15. National Pipeline Mapping System\n\n       Section 15 requires operators of pipeline facilities, \n     except distribution lines and gathering lines, to provide to \n     the Secretary of Transportation geospatial data appropriate \n     for use in the National Mapping System, the name and address \n     of the person with primary operational control, and a means \n     for a member of the public to contact the operator for \n     additional information about the facilities. There is a \n     requirement to update the information as necessary.\n\n           Section 16. Coordination of environmental reviews\n\n       Section 16 requires the President to establish an \n     interagency committee for the purpose of developing and \n     ensuring the implementation of a coordinated environmental \n     review and permitting process in order for pipeline operators \n     to complete all activities necessary to carry out pipeline \n     repairs within any time periods specified by rule by the \n     Secretary of Transportation.\n       The chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality shall \n     chair the Interagency Committee, which shall consist of \n     representatives of Federal agencies with responsibilities \n     relating to pipeline repair projects. The Interagency \n     Committee shall evaluate Federal permitting requirements and \n     shall examine the access, excavation, and restoration \n     practices of the pipeline industry for the purpose of \n     developing a compendium of best practices used by the \n     industry to access, excavate, and restore the site of a \n     pipeline repair. Based upon the evaluation conducted, the \n     members of the Interagency Committee shall enter into, by \n     unanimous consent, a memorandum of understanding to provide \n     for the coordinated and expedited pipeline repair permit \n     review process so that pipeline operators may commence and \n     complete pipeline repairs within any time periods imposed on \n     the repair projects by rules promulgated by the Secretary of \n     Transportation. Each agency represented on the Interagency \n     Committee is required to revise its regulations to implement \n     the provisions of the memorandum of understanding.\n       This section also provides for the implementation of \n     alternative mitigation measures to be used by operators of \n     pipeline facilities until all applicable permits have been \n     granted. To the extent necessary, the Secretary of \n     Transportation is required to revise the regulations of the \n     Department to accommodate such implementation. However, such \n     revisions shall not allow an operator of a pipeline facility \n     to implement alternate mitigation measures unless to do so \n     would be consistent with the protection of human health, \n     public safety, and the environment; the operator has applied \n     for and is diligently and in good faith pursuing all required \n     Federal, state, and local permits necessary to carry out the \n     repair project; and is compatible with pipeline safety.\n       The Secretary of Transportation is required to designate an \n     ombudsman to assist in expediting pipeline repairs and \n     resolving disagreements between Federal, state, and local \n     permitting agencies and the operator of a pipeline facility. \n     The actions of the ombudsman must be consistent with the \n     protection of human health, public safety, and the \n     environment.\n       The Secretary of Transportation is required to encourage \n     states and local governments to consolidate their respective \n     permitting processes for pipeline repair projects that are \n     subject to any time periods for repairs specified by rule by \n     the Secretary of Transportation.\n\n             Section 17. Nationwide toll-free number system\n\n       Section 17 requires the Secretary of Transportation to work \n     in conjunction with the Federal Communications Commission \n     (FCC), facility operators, excavators, and one-call \n     notification system operators for the establishment of a \n     nationwide toll-free 3-digit telephone number system to be \n     used by state one-call notification systems.\n\n    Section 18. Implementation of Inspector General recommendations\n\n       Section 18 requires the Secretary of Transportation to \n     respond to each of the recommendations of the Department of \n     Transportation Inspector General contained in RT-2000-069 \n     every 90 days and to submit the responses to the appropriate \n     committees of Congress.\n\n                Section 19. NTSB safety recommendations\n\n       Section 19 requires RSPA and OPS to respond to \n     recommendations received from the NTSB within 90 days from \n     receipt of such recommendations. Such responses shall state \n     the intentions of the OPS with respect to the recommendations \n     and shall state the timetable for completing the procedures \n     and reasons for refusals to do so. The responses shall be \n     made available to the public. The OPS is required to submit \n     an annual report describing each recommendation received and \n     the OPS response to each recommendation for the previous \n     year.\n\n                  Section 20. Miscellaneous amendments\n\n       Section 20 amends section 60102(a) of Title 49 by adding \n     language expressing that the purpose of the chapter is to \n     provide adequate protection against risks to life and \n     property posed by pipeline transportation pipeline facilities \n     by improving the regulatory and enforcement authority of the \n     Secretary of Transportation.\n       This section also modifies the qualifications of the \n     individuals selected to serve on the Technical Safety \n     Standards Committees pursuant to section 60115 of Title 49 so \n     that none of the individuals selected for committee \n     membership from the general public ``may have a significant \n     financial interest in the pipeline, petroleum, or gas \n     industry.'' The intent of this provision is to prevent \n     industry employees and individuals with a sizable stake in \n     the pipeline industry from serving as representatives from \n     the general public, not prevent service from individuals who \n     have pipeline, petroleum, or gas industry stock interests in \n     their retirement plans.\n\n                    Section 21. Technical amendments\n\n       Section 21 makes technical amendments to correct previous \n     drafting errors in the existing legislation.\n\n              Section 22. Authorization of appropriations\n\n       Section 22 authorizes appropriations for the Department of \n     Transportation and state grants for safety programs for the \n     fiscal years 2003 through 2006.\n\n              Section 23. Inspections by direct assessment\n\n       Section 23 requires the Secretary of Transportation to \n     issue regulations prescribing standards for inspections of a \n     pipeline facility by direct assessment.\n\n         Section 24. State pipeline safety advisory committees\n\n       Section 24 requires the Secretary of Transportation to \n     respond within 90 days after receiving recommendations from \n     advisory committees appointed by the Governor of any state.\n\n                 Section 25. Pipeline bridge risk study\n\n       Section 25 requires the Secretary of Transportation to \n     conduct a study to determine whether cable-suspension \n     pipeline bridges pose structural or other risks. The \n     Secretary may only use funds specifically appropriated to \n     carry this section.\n\n   Section 26. Study and Report on Natural Gas Pipeline and Storage \n                       Facilities in New England\n\n       Section 26 requires the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission, in consultation with the Department of Energy, to \n     conduct a study on the natural gas pipeline transmission \n     network in New England and natural gas storage facilities \n     associated with that network and report back to the relevant \n     House and Senate Committees within a year of the date of \n     enactment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/14/senate-section/article/S11069-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11069-S11075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            AVERTING A BREAKDOWN IN FEDERAL TAX ENFORCEMENT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, many have said they want the next \nCongress to work on tax reform. Any tax reform effort we undertake, \nhowever, needs to address the grave warning recently provided by IRS \nCommissioner Charles O. Rossotti about the need for immediate steps to \navert a breakdown in federal tax enforcement.\n\n[[Page S11070]]\n\n  Mr. Rossotti has just completed 5 years of work to restore confidence \nin the effectiveness and fairness of the IRS. He left the \nadministration last week after submitting a report to the IRS Oversight \nBoard summarizing his efforts and the current state of the IRS. His \noverall conclusion was that, while the IRS made significant progress \nover the last 5 years in revamping its procedures and improving \ninteractions with average taxpayers, the IRS is ``losing the war'' on \nstopping tax cheats.\n  Mr. Rossotti wrote that while the size and the complexity of the Tax \nCode have continued to increase, IRS enforcement resources have \ncontinue to diminish. He described the IRS as ``outnumbered'' and \nfacing a huge and growing gap ``between the number of taxpayers whom \nthe IRS knows are not filing, not reporting or not paying what they \nowe, and our capacity to require them to comply.'' Using specific facts \nand figures, he provides data supporting the shocking statistic that \nfour out of five U.S. tax cheats will likely escape detection and \ncorrection action due to the IRS' limited resources to enforce the tax \nlaws.\n  Mr. Rossotti also summarized what is happening among tax \nprofessionals to enable so-called sophisticated taxpayers to escape \npaying their fair share, and what the likely consequence is for honest \ntaxpayers left footing the bill. Here is what he said:\n\n       Recognizing the IRS' diminished capacity, promoters and \n     some tax professionals are selling a wide range of tax \n     schemes and devices designed to improperly reduce taxes to \n     taxpayers based on the simple premise that they can get away \n     with it. When this perception becomes increasingly \n     widespread, the essential pillar or our tax system is lost--\n     namely, the belief of honest taxpayers that if someone does \n     not pay what he or she owes, then the IRS will do something \n     about it.\n\n  Mr. Rossotti's full analysis appears in the report he filed with the \nIRS Oversight Board, and I ask unanimous consent for the complete text \nof that report to appear in the record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. This report not only sets out the scope and causes of the \ngrowing enforcement problems at the IRS, it also identifies practical \nand immediate steps that can be taken by Congress to avert an \nenforcement breakdown. Essentially, it comes down to Congress' \nproviding the IRS with a steady increase of 2 percent per year over the \nnext 5 years in resources for audits, investigators, and enforcement \nactions. This increase is not only modest, the numbers show that it \nwill more than pay for itself through the collection of taxes that have \nimproperly been withheld.\n  Federal tax reform is an important goal, but any reform effort must \ninclude a clear-eyed recognition of the growing problem of tax \ncompliance and the need to revitalize the agency charged with ensuring \nall Americans pay their fair share. Mr. Rossotti was scheduled to bring \nthe enforcement problem to the attention of Congress at a hearing in \nOctober, but that hearing was cancelled after, according to press \nreports, he was asked by the administration not to disclose his report \nor recommendation for increased enforcement resources.\n  To further contribute to an understanding of the scope and nature of \ntax noncompliance, my staff on the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations has been digging into the problems of offshore tax \nevasion and tax promoters shopping improper tax shelters. I hope to \nhave more to report on these issues early next year.\n  In the meantime, I urge all my colleagues to read Mr. Rossotti's \nreport in full and take its warnings and advice to heart as we approach \ntax reform issues in the coming year.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n Report to the IRS Oversight Board--Assessment of the IRS and the Tax \n                                 System\n\n       As the Board requested, and as my term of office draws to a \n     close, I want to share with you my thoughts on the current \n     state of the IRS, our tax administration system, as well as \n     the opportunities and challenges that the agency and new \n     commissioner will face.\n       The IRS is today capable of executing its mission with \n     increasing effectiveness and efficiency. We made measurable \n     progress on a number of high priority areas, such as e-\n     filing, telephone and in-person taxpayer service, protection \n     of taxpayer rights and burden reduction. We stabilized and \n     refocused our key compliance activities to make the best use \n     of our limited resources and are identifying and attacking \n     systematic areas of non-compliance, such as the promotion and \n     use of abusive tax devices. Financial management improved, as \n     evidenced by unqualified audit opinions. Internal morale, \n     which was heavily affected by criticism and internal and \n     external change, turned around. Perhaps most importantly, we \n     regained the confidence of the public and other stakeholders.\n       For the longer term, the IRS created a firm foundation upon \n     which to make further progress. It includes: a modern \n     organization structure with clear accountability for meeting \n     the widely varying needs of specific taxpayer segments; \n     information systems and support organizations capable of \n     supporting operations efficiently while managing \n     modernization; and a planning and management process for \n     allocating resources, assigning goals to managers and \n     measuring progress.\n       Our Business System Modernization Plan is beginning to \n     deliver tangible benefits to taxpayers and practitioners. \n     Equally important, we have a complete vision and architecture \n     to guide the continuing modernization of every IRS business \n     process and supporting technology.\n       The plans in place for FY 2003 and FY 2004 reflect \n     aggressive but achievable productivity gains, exceeding those \n     that were historically achieved in the private financial \n     sector.\n       Taken together, these achievements demonstrate the progress \n     we made over the past five years in the entire way we serve \n     taxpayers, although finishing the job will still take the \n     full decade I originally projected.\n       However, amidst what I believe is justified optimism for \n     continued improvements in the performance of the IRS lies a \n     critical problem. We are winning the battle, but losing the \n     war. Over the last ten years, the size and complexity of the \n     tax system increased enormously. Beyond the simple increase \n     in number of taxpayers and revenue dollars, the majority of \n     tax revenues now come from sources that are more subject to \n     manipulation by those who wish to pay less than the law \n     requires and much more difficult and time consuming for our \n     agents to uncover. Meanwhile, the size of the IRS \n     declined, not just relatively but in absolute terms, \n     because of budget constraints.\n       The cumulative effect of these conflicting trends over a \n     10-year period has been to create a huge gap between the \n     number of taxpayers whom the IRS knows are not filing, not \n     reporting or not paying what they owe, and our capacity to \n     require them to comply.\n       Recognizing the IRS' diminished capacity, promoters and \n     some tax professionals are selling a wide range of tax \n     schemes and devices designed to improperly reduce taxes to \n     taxpayers based on the simple premise they can get away with \n     it. When this perception becomes increasingly widespread, the \n     essential pillar of our tax system is lost--namely, the \n     belief of honest taxpayers that if someone does not pay what \n     he or she owes, then the IRS will do something about it.\n       If the trend of the last ten years is allowed to continue, \n     it is only a matter of time until this problem will emerge \n     into the forefront of public consciousness, likely leading to \n     an eruption of criticism such as has occurred periodically in \n     the last 50-year history of the IRS.\n       Fortunately, it is not too late to solve this problem, nor \n     is it an open-ended problem. In fact, in the past year we \n     succeeded in quantifying better than ever the resources we \n     need. Modernization and internal productivity improvements \n     will provide a major part of the needed gains. However, these \n     alone will not be sufficient to close the gap, even if we \n     assume greater productivity gains than the private sector was \n     able to achieve over a decade.\n       To succeed, we need more trained personnel to close the \n     known compliance gap while continuing to protect taxpayer \n     rights and provide essential services. Specifically, we must \n     add approximately 2 percent annual net increase in staffing \n     over five years. Even with this increase, the size of the IRS \n     by 2010 would be smaller than it was 20 years earlier in 1990 \n     while the economy will have increased 86 percent.\n       Over the same period, we must also fund adequate increases \n     for computer modernization programs to accelerate the \n     delivery of key projects and benefits that will provide for \n     greater service, efficiency and productivity.\n       Together with effective management of the IRS, this modest \n     level of resources can reverse the dangerous trend the tax \n     system is currently taking--but only if it is consistently \n     provided. If, on the other hand, the trend of the past ten \n     years is maintained, in which the demands on tax \n     administration increase and the capacity of the IRS declines, \n     the eventual cost for our nation is certain to be enormous.\n\n\n                             Starting Point\n\n       Before I discuss the opportunities and challenges that lie \n     ahead, it is helpful to place them in their proper historical \n     context.\n       By the mid-1990s, the public, Congress and most key \n     stakeholders had lost confidence in the IRS. According to the \n     Roper Starch surveys, favorable public opinion of the IRS \n     steadily declined since the early 1980s, reaching an all-time \n     low of 32 percent in 1998. The results of the American \n     Customer Satisfaction Index of key federal agencies were \n     similarly alarming. The IRS measured the lowest of any agency \n     or institution in both surveys.\n       Taxpayers were not alone in their negative perceptions. \n     Congress and many of our\n\n[[Page S11071]]\n\n     stakeholders also lost confidence in the agency's ability to \n     do its job at an acceptable level. In 1995, the Tax Systems \n     Modernization program was terminated after several billion \n     dollars were spent. Handling complaints about IRS treatment \n     of constituents became a time-consuming duty in many \n     congressional offices, and many stakeholders, especially \n     those representing small business, had an adversarial \n     relationship with the agency.\n       Poor quality service to taxpayers over the telephone or in \n     person contributed to the public's low perceptions. At the \n     nadir in the mid-1990s, the IRS registered 400 million busy \n     signals a year on its toll-free lines, and when taxpayers did \n     reach the IRS, the likelihood of getting an accurate answer \n     or resolution to a problem was low.\n       A number of external factors also buffeted the IRS. Budget \n     and staff cuts, rapid economic growth and the shift in the \n     tax base from middle-income wage earners and domestic \n     corporations to upper-income entrepreneurs, passthrough \n     entities and global corporations, all contributed to a \n     diminished capacity to cope with service and compliance \n     demands.\n       The IRS responded to this pressure by emphasizing \n     enforcement revenue and statistics as a way of justifying its \n     budget. The IRS measured the success of its compliance \n     activities by direct enforcement revenues. This is like a \n     police department assessing its success by the number of \n     traffic tickets written rather than by the safety and \n     security of the community it serves. As we well know from the \n     ensuing fallout, this grave mistake further alienated the \n     public, yet failed to address the systematic, emerging \n     compliance and budget problems.\n       While emphasizing enforcement statistics, the IRS was also \n     slow to update its compliance practices, such as models used \n     to select returns for audits and the management of the exam \n     and collection processes. Until we changed it recently, \n     $100,000 was the highest income class used by the IRS in \n     assigning exam cases, although people with incomes over \n     $100,000 pay more than 60 percent of the income tax.\n       Moreover, although exam coverage was declining, many of \n     these examinations concentrated on relatively straightforward \n     issues of deductions or timing differences, such as the use \n     of cash versus accrual accounting by small businesses. Very \n     little emphasis was placed on partnerships and trusts, high-\n     income individuals or offshore accounts, although vast sums \n     of income flow through these entities. There was no specific \n     program to identify and combat promoters of abusive tax \n     devices. The IRS succeeded in winning some tax shelter court \n     cases, but there was no overall strategy for dealing with \n     corporate tax shelters.\n\n                         achieving a turnaround\n\n       The IRS addressed, although certainly not completely \n     solved, the major problems and internal constraints it faced \n     five years ago. Some are resolved; clear plans are in place \n     to correct the remaining ones over the next five years. This \n     work provided the foundation for steady improvement in the \n     effectiveness and efficiency with which the IRS carries out \n     its mission.\n       Public confidence in the IRS rebounded. The Roper Starch \n     surveys found our rating increased each of the past three \n     years after 1998's historic low. The University of Michigan's \n     American Customer Satisfaction Index survey released in \n     December 2001 showed greatly improved customer satisfaction \n     among individual taxpayers--the largest favorable gain of the \n     30 federal agencies surveyed.\n       In May 2002, the Federal Performance Project, a \n     collaboration of Government Executive Magazine and George \n     Washington University's Department of Public Administration, \n     released its scorecard on federal agencies. The IRS earned a \n     ``B-'', as compared to a ``C'' three years ago. While the \n     trend is good, much more remains to be done. The IRS can be \n     and should be managed at the ``A'' level and is on its way to \n     achieving this.\n       This turnaround in public confidence reflects the clear \n     progress in five distinct areas: (1) customer service, (2) \n     stakeholder relations, (3) compliance, (4) internal \n     management, and (5) technology and modernization.\n\n                            Customer service\n\n       The customer service improvements were the most visible to \n     individual taxpayers. The upward trend in telephone service \n     was particularly important given how far we had to climb. By \n     the end of the 2002 filing season, taxpayers were receiving \n     correct responses to 83.6 percent of tax law questions and \n     89.9 of account questions. Access to service and time spent \n     waiting, while still below private sector standards, improved \n     substantially. Average wait time is down 26 percent from the \n     previous year. Assistor access rose from 56 percent only two \n     years ago to nearly 70 percent this year.\n       Last year, Web site usage smashed all records with 2.7 \n     billion hits and 336 million files downloaded. We are well on \n     our way to a new record this year. Also, in January 2002, we \n     introduced a newly designed and more accessible Web site.\n       E-filing tripled over the past five years, and this filing \n     season, was up 16 percent over the previous one. We are \n     systematically removing the remaining barriers to e-filing. \n     For example, this year, virtually all 1040 forms and \n     schedules could be filed electronically, and no paper \n     signature document was required. Improved electronic tax \n     administration is also critical to better serving business \n     taxpayers, especially given the number of forms and payments \n     they must file and make. In September 2001, we launched \n     Electronic Federal Tax Payment System On-Line that allows \n     businesses large and small to save precious time by making \n     their federal payments on-line.\n       We are also building a new e-file system that will grow and \n     serve taxpayers for years to come. Scheduled to start in \n     2004, it will address the current system's problems. For \n     example, it will accept complex business returns, such as \n     1120s, eliminate software barriers and resolve \n     standardization issues, such as reject codes and validations.\n       Service in local taxpayer assistance centers, which was \n     extremely poor in many places, improved in both quality and \n     consistency. However, it will still take several more years \n     to reach fully acceptable standards. Taxpayers can now \n     schedule appointments in more than 400 locations for face-to-\n     face meetings with IRS employees to resolve account or case \n     problems. This helps make the well-received idea of ``Problem \n     Solving Days'' a regular part of IRS everyday operations. \n     While making these improvements, we are also requiring fewer \n     personnel details from the compliance functions to filing \n     season duty--an expensive and very unpopular practice.\n       Within the limits of a complex and changing Tax Code, the \n     IRS acted to reduce taxpayer burden. For example, we \n     simplified forms, such as the Schedule D for reporting \n     capital gains. We also rewrote and simplified procedures, \n     such as those for distributions from qualified retirement \n     plans. We removed 2.6 million small business taxpayers from \n     the time-consuming reporting and record-keeping requirements \n     of reconciling tax returns with balance sheets. We \n     eliminated the need for most small businesses to use the \n     more burdensome accrual method of accounting for tax \n     purposes. We implemented a new and much more reliable way \n     of measuring taxpayer burden. In the newly created Office \n     of Taxpayer Burden Reduction, we also have an organization \n     dedicated to continuously measuring and reducing burden.\n       The IRS implemented 71 taxpayer rights provisions of RRA \n     98, including such major provisions as collection due \n     process, expanded innocent spouse relief, third party \n     notification and expanded opportunities for offers in \n     compromise. The Taxpayer Advocate Service was established as \n     an effective independent entity within the IRS. It assists \n     taxpayers with hardship cases and makes recommendations to \n     improve the way IRS works for them. Because of these efforts, \n     the number of taxpayers with serious unresolved cases, such \n     as those that generate a need for intervention by a \n     congressional office, declined. More generally, our improved \n     service helped to reduce the numbers of cases needing TAS \n     intervention. In 2002, case receipts fell from 194,790 to \n     169,390 compared with the same 9-month period in 2001.\n\n                         Stakeholder relations\n\n       In the past, relations with IRS stakeholders were often \n     strained and adversarial. Through improved communications and \n     frequent, substantive meetings, our relationship with \n     Congress, oversight bodies and business groups--especially \n     small businesses--greatly improved. Congressional hearings, \n     once contentious, have been almost universally positive and \n     constructive--although not without tough questioning. Much \n     closer relationships were formed with organizations \n     representing practitioners and small businesses. A consortium \n     was forged with the software industry on the thorny issue of \n     no-cost e-filing.\n       One of our basic strategies is to develop the kind of \n     stakeholder relationships that can improve the efficiency and \n     effectiveness of our services. Over the past few years, we \n     developed a method of engaging stakeholders as part of our \n     decision-making process. We call the new approach, ``Engage \n     and Then Decide'' as contrasted with ``Decide and Then \n     Explain.'' Seriously engaging key stakeholders as a regular \n     part of the decision-making process has shown that it \n     improves the final product, shortens the time for decisions \n     and implementation, and strengthens relationships.\n       Although we successfully used this engagement approach, and \n     have much experience with the hazards and costs of the \n     opposite approach, IRS top management must continue to work \n     hard to ensure that it is employed in all decision-making \n     processes because it is so different from traditional \n     practice in the federal government.\n\n                               Compliance\n\n       As the Board is well aware, we do not have the resources to \n     attack every case of non-compliance. Therefore, we must apply \n     our resources to where non-compliance is greatest while still \n     maintaining adequate coverage in other areas. We must also \n     use carefully, but effectively, the enforcement tools \n     available to us.\n       After careful study, we identified some of the most serious \n     and current compliance problem areas. These include: (1) \n     promoters of tax schemes of all varieties, (2) the misuse of \n     devices such as trusts and offshore accounts to hide or \n     improperly reduce income, (3) abusive corporate tax shelters, \n     (4) underreporting of tax by higher-income individuals, and \n     (5) accumulation and the failure to file and pay large \n     amounts of employment taxes by some employers.\n       To address these problems, we revamped our compliance \n     programs to refocus our resources and to use a full scope of \n     tools and\n\n[[Page S11072]]\n\n     techniques. They range from educating the public, to \n     systematically identifying promoters and participants, to \n     reinvigorating enforcement actions such as summons \n     enforcement, injunctions and criminal investigation of \n     promoters.\n       If we can eliminate confusion and errors before a return or \n     form is ever filed, America's taxpayers will be spared \n     countless numbers of notices and communications with the IRS. \n     If we can warn taxpayers not to participate in ``too good to \n     be true'' tax schemes, we can save taxpayers from penalties \n     and more. Moreover, the agency will be in a better position \n     to use its limited compliance resources on the most serious \n     cases of non-compliance.\n       To achieve these purposes, we created dedicated taxpayer \n     education and pre-filing organizations in our operating \n     divisions, e.g., TEC and SPEC in SB/SE and W respectively, \n     and pre-filing technical staffs in LMSB and TEGE. We also \n     created new pre-filing tools, such as pre-filing agreements \n     and industry issue resolution published guidance. We greatly \n     stepped up our output of traditional forms of published \n     guidance, including revenue rulings and notices, by \n     increasing their emphasis in Chief Counsel and forging an \n     effective working relationship with Treasury's Office of Tax \n     Policy.\n       For example, this past year, both the TEC and SPEC \n     organizations worked to raise public awareness about the \n     slavery reparation schemes. Materials were distributed \n     nationally and locally to African-American churches and \n     religious coalitions, fraternities, sororities and \n     associations, including the NAACP and the Urban League. As a \n     result, the average weekly number of incoming slavery \n     reparation claims declined from 1,538 in CY 2001 to 63 this \n     year.\n       Although these preventive measures hold great promise, we \n     must still detect, correct and deter non-compliance. We must \n     focus resources, improve efficiency and use our enforcement \n     powers appropriately, all of which we are doing.\n       As identified through our research and strategic planning, \n     both SB/SE and LMSB are directing their examination resources \n     at the most important cases and issues. Exam and collection \n     reengineering are focused on improving the efficiency with \n     which these cases are carried out. For example, SB/SE is \n     tackling business tax cases, such as unpaid, in-trust taxes, \n     including employment and withholding taxes, much earlier than \n     in the past.\n       Within two years, our new Filing and Payment compliance \n     modernization program will begin to reduce from several years \n     to six months or less the time required to resolve most \n     collection cases.\n       Other initiatives, first outlined in our Strategic Plan, \n     are taking effect. Earlier this year, we began matching \n     information reported on Schedule K-1 with income or losses \n     reported on Form 1040 and other schedules. We also \n     reinvigorated the use of long dormant enforcement tools that \n     are needed to deal with serious cases of non-compliance, and \n     especially, promoted tax schemes. For example, we are \n     aggressively identifying promoters and schemes through \n     summonses of records, including John Doe summonses on credit \n     card accounts in offshore tax havens and vendor summonses to \n     refine that data.\n       Multiple approaches were taken to aggressively attack the \n     use of abusive tax shelters. The LMSB organization initiated \n     43 contacts of promoters to uncover lists of taxpayers \n     participating in their shelters. In addition, a tax shelter \n     disclosure initiative was launched earlier this year. As of \n     August 1, 2002, the IRS processed 1,664 disclosures from \n     1,206 taxpayers who came forward. These disclosures cover \n     2,264 tax returns and involved more than $30 billion in \n     claimed losses or deductions. Moreover, we announced a new \n     policy in June 2002 to request tax accrual work papers when \n     we audit returns that claim a tax benefit from certain tax \n     avoidance transactions that we identified as abusive.\n       Civil and Criminal Lead Development Centers (LDC) were also \n     established to identify cases of abusive tax promoters. For \n     example, the Civil LDC works leads received from within the \n     IRS, or from external sources, and conducts Internet searches \n     looking for abusive tax promoters and promotional materials.\n       Also, the Webster Report gave a detailed blueprint for \n     making Criminal Investigation a more effective component of \n     tax administration. The need to refocus CI's resources on tax \n     cases was the centerpiece of this report. CI's top priority \n     is now investigating promoters and participants in illegal \n     tax schemes. We also established a closer working \n     relationship between field counsel and the operating \n     divisions on compliance work.\n       This new emphasis on action against promoters has already \n     shown results. The numbers of actions related to promoters \n     went from ``none'' to a vigorous program. As of July 8, 2002, \n     we had nine promoter injunctions granted, 11 promoter \n     injunctions pending in District Court and three pending at \n     the Department of Justice, 150 promoter exams and information \n     requests underway, and 51 ongoing criminal investigations \n     (numbers are for FY 01 through 02).\n       Also, key to successfully executing our compliance program \n     is better data. As I discussed, the IRS failed to detect new \n     areas of non-compliance in part because of a reliance on \n     increasingly obsolete data from the old Taxpayer Compliance \n     Measurement Program. (TCMP was last conducted in 1988.) In \n     addition, we designed and are now implementing a National \n     Research Program that will obtain the essential information \n     with far less burden on the taxpayer. New scoring models are \n     being developed using 21st century techniques, with interim \n     models already deployed.\n       Obviously, our success in compliance also depends on a \n     cadre of highly qualified trained individuals to perform \n     tasks that require a high level of judgment. After a freeze \n     of nearly six years, recruitment for professional \n     occupations, such as revenue agent and revenue officer, \n     restarted; training was completely revamped and improved; and \n     employee engagement became part of balanced measures and \n     everyday management.\n\n                          Internal management\n\n       The IRS successfully made the transition to a modern \n     customer-focused organization in which a management team has \n     clear responsibility for meeting the needs of a specific set \n     of taxpayers. The service needs and compliance issues of the \n     90 million taxpayers with wage and investment income are \n     vastly different from those of large and mid-sized \n     businesses, which in turn are different from those of small \n     businesses and tax-exempt organizations. One team now works \n     full time to understand and meet the needs of each set of \n     taxpayers and has nationwide authority to execute its plans, \n     eliminating the historically deep and counterproductive \n     organizational separation between the ``field'' and the \n     ``national office.''\n       Supporting these operating divisions are specialized \n     functional units and shared services organizations to provide \n     information technology and common support services throughout \n     the organization.\n       As part of the reorganization, the number of management \n     layers was reduced and the role of executives and senior \n     managers is being redirected towards substantive engagement \n     in tax administration, rather than predominantly \n     administrative duties. A new model of executive recruitment \n     was successfully established, which includes a recruitment of \n     a limited number of highly experienced top executives from \n     private industry and other government agencies to complement \n     our internally-developed executives.\n       Many specialized programs, ranging from processing business \n     returns to handling innocent spouse claims to answering tax \n     law calls, are being consolidated into fewer locations with \n     fewer management layers. This enables greater standardization \n     and faster implementation of improvements.\n       An entirely new system of balanced measures has been \n     designed and implemented, aligning goals throughout the \n     organization down to the territory and site level.\n       The gains in service and the widespread redirection of \n     compliance programs over the last two years reflect the \n     benefits of a more customer-focused and accountable \n     organization. The major benefits are still to come, in the \n     form of continuous improvements in productivity and quality \n     in every major program.\n       The improvements in customer service and other programs can \n     also be linked to increased employee engagement in our \n     mission and goals, increased and improved training and \n     heightened focus on employee concerns. Among the most \n     important of these concerns was the fair and careful \n     administration of Section 1203--the so called ten deadly \n     sins--so that no employee was wrongly disciplined under this \n     section. In addition, legislative proposals were formulated \n     and are under consideration by Congress to alleviate employee \n     anxiety over Section 1203.\n       Because of these actions and focus, and according to a \n     recent Gallup survey of IRS employees, the level of \n     engagement within the Service increased from 49th to the 56th \n     percentile of all public sector organizations tracked by the \n     organization.\n       The IRS is also the steward of massive taxpayer revenue and \n     budget and financial resources, and we are expected to \n     properly account for the government's money and property. To \n     this end, internal accounting standards were raised to a \n     higher level. For the past two fiscal years, we received \n     unqualified GAO opinions on our financial statements for both \n     the Revenue and Administrative accounts. This year, we have \n     plans in place to close the books months earlier than in \n     prior years and to address remaining material weaknesses over \n     the next two years.\n       As our FY 2003 and 2004 budget requests demonstrate, \n     strategic planning, budgeting, resource allocation and \n     performance goals were aligned. For the first time, we fully \n     integrated development of our budget with the establishment \n     of performance measures.\n\n                      Technology and modernization\n\n       Critical to our success was better managing our massive \n     technology and Business Systems Modernization program. From \n     15 separate information systems operations, we created one \n     MITS organization that has the job of serving all of our \n     operating units and managing our modernization program.\n       As part of this major transition, standards were \n     established and largely implemented for hardware and \n     software. We consolidated mainframes from 12 centers to three \n     and established one standard for desktop and laptop hardware \n     and software. We implemented a nationwide e-mail and voice \n     messaging systems, standard office automation software, and \n     security certifications and standards. We deployed important \n     interim applications systems, including Intelligent Call \n     Routing, Integrated Case Processing and the Integrated \n     Collection System.\n\n[[Page S11073]]\n\n       Business Systems Modernization laid the foundation for \n     success of this massive program. Both the long-term vision \n     and enterprise architecture were established and embedded as \n     a living blueprint for all business and technology \n     improvement programs.\n       BSM began delivering projects with tangible and meaningful \n     benefits to taxpayers, such as moving the first set of \n     taxpayers to a modern, reliable database early next year. \n     Over the next five years, all individual taxpayers will be \n     moved to it, cutting times for refunds on e-filed returns to \n     less than a week and allowing us to provide taxpayer and \n     employees with up-to-the-minute accuracy on their accounts. \n     Of paramount importance, we implemented the first project on \n     our new security system, which provides one standard for \n     ensuring the security of all future IRS data and systems.\n       All major management processes, which are needed to manage \n     this program on a continuing basis, were improved. Our goal \n     is to obtain certification in the near future as only the \n     second agency in the federal government to reach Level Two in \n     the Software Engineering Institutions Capability Maturity \n     Model.\n\n\n              Steady Progress Can Continue Year after Year\n\n       The aforementioned progress and achievements do not mean \n     that the IRS solved all of its problems, or that there are no \n     more opportunities to improve. Rather, it means that the IRS \n     addressed the major impediments and obstacles that previously \n     stood in the way of progress and has a clear committed plan \n     to continually reach even higher levels of performance. There \n     should be no doubt that the IRS can be raised to a level of \n     quality and efficiency comparable to the best managed \n     financial services organizations.\n\n\n                 Winning the Battle but Losing the War\n\n       Despite significant improvements in the management of the \n     IRS, the health of the federal tax administration system is \n     on a serious long-term downtrend. This is systematically \n     undermining one of the most important foundations of the \n     American economy.\n       The source of this problem is two conflicting long-term \n     trends: one, ever increasing demands on the tax \n     administration system due to rapid growth in the size and \n     complexity of the economy; and two, a steady decline in IRS \n     resources due to budget constraints. The cumulative effect of \n     these conflicting trends over a 10-year period has been to \n     create a huge gap between the number of taxpayers who are not \n     filing, not reporting or not paying what they owe, and the \n     IRS' capacity to require them to comply.\n       As seen in the next chart, ``Trends in Indicators of IRS \n     Workload and Resources,'' from 1992 to 2001, weighted average \n     returns filed, a measure of overall IRS workload, increased \n     by 16 percent because of the economy's growth. However, \n     during this same period, FTEs dropped 16 percent from 115,205 \n     in FY 1992 to 95,511 in FY 2001. Since more and more of the \n     IRS' declining resources are required to perform essential \n     operational functions--such as processing returns, issuing \n     refunds and answering taxpayer mail--a disproportionate \n     reduction occurred in Field Compliance personnel, falling \n     28 percent from 29,730 in FY 1992 to 21,421 in FY 2002.\n       In assessing these trends, it is extremely important to \n     recognize a critical fact: tax administration workload \n     increases every year because of increased filings by \n     taxpayers related to the long-term growth of the economy. \n     These workload increases affect every facet of tax \n     administration, from processing returns to answering \n     correspondence to collecting delinquent returns to accounting \n     for payments and refunds. In addition to this growth related \n     to the economy, tax legislation often adds additional \n     workload.\n       Looking more closely at the most recent five years (see \n     chart), we see that the number of income tax returns \n     increased by 12 million, while 19 tax bills were passed that \n     changed 292 tax code sections and required 515 changes to \n     forms and instructions. On the average, IRS workload grows at \n     a compounded rate of 1.8 percent per year. Therefore, just to \n     handle this increased workload, the IRS would either have to \n     add staff--which is what occurred fairly consistently for the \n     45-year period from 1950 through 1995--or would have to \n     increase productivity by 1.8 percent per year just to stay \n     even.\n\n\n  Federal Tax System Has Been Growing and Changing Rapidly From 1997 \n                              Through 2002\n\n     Volume of activity has been growing rapidly\n       Income Tax Returns: 12 Million Increase--9.4%.\n       IRS Gross Collections: $527 Billion Increase--32.5%.\n       IRS Refunds Issued: $121 Billion Increase--61.3%.\n     Tax Code has been changing rapidly\n       19 Public Laws passed.\n       293 Tax Code provisions changed.\n       171 (58%) of provisions with concurrent or retroactive \n     effective dates.\n       515 completed changes to forms and/or instructions.\n     Restructuring and Reform Act added many taxpayer rights\n       71 taxpayer rights.\n       1,900 implementing actions.\n       Hundreds of thousands of new transactions per year.\n       Innocent spouse.\n       Collection due process.\n       Offers in compromise.\n       Third party notification.\n       Section 1203 allegations.\n     Special events created additional activity and change\n       Century date change required massive three year project.\n       Advance rate reduction credit--126 million notices, 91 \n     million taxpayers, $39 billion.\n       Returns of political organizations (section 527)--new \n     reporting to IRS.\n       September 11th terrorist attack--victims relief, IRS \n     security response, money laundering task forces.\n       Anthrax threat--rapid response required prior to 2002 \n     Filing Season.\n     Globalization is increasing international tax activity\n       U.S. controlled foreign corporations up 25%.\n       Foreign controlled corporations up 31%.\n     Resources have been shrinking\n       IRS full-time equivalent personnel: -2,952.\n       This is no different from a car company producing 1.8 \n     percent more cars or a hospital servicing 1.8 percent more \n     patients. But, rather than increasing staff, IRS staff \n     decreased during this period, creating a major gap in IRS \n     capacity to administer the tax system.\n       In addition to growth in raw numbers, the tax revenue \n     stream is now dominated by sources that provide greater \n     opportunities for manipulation by those who wish to take \n     advantage of the decline in IRS compliance resources. For \n     example, returns for taxpayers with incomes exceeding \n     $100,000 grew by 342 percent over 1991 levels. The enormous \n     amounts of money that flow through ``passthrough'' entities--\n     such as partnerships, trusts and S-corporations--also adds to \n     the complexity of tax administration and increases the \n     opportunities for underreporting of income. In Tax Year 2000, \n     these ``passthrough'' entities filed 4.78 million returns \n     with gross revenue of $6 trillion and income to partners/\n     shareholders of more than $660 billion.\n       The IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 added major \n     new or expanded taxpayer rights programs, such as innocent \n     spouse relief, third party notification and collection due \n     process. The rights are very important to taxpayers but \n     created very substantial additional resource demands on the \n     IRS to process hundreds of thousands of new transactions and \n     additional steps in existing audits and collection actions.\n       Business globalization creates another administration \n     complexity and more opportunities for reducing U.S.-reported \n     income. From 1997-2002, U.S.-controlled foreign corporations \n     and foreign-controlled corporations grew respectively by 25 \n     and 31 percent.\n       Looking at this imbalance, one fact emerges. The IRS is \n     simply out-numbered when it comes to dealing with the \n     compliance risks. As noted, IRS employment (FTEs), and in \n     particular, Field Compliance FTE steadily declined.

These \n     numbers, therefore, represent not general estimates or \n     assumptions, but specific taxpayer cases. Based on the \n     information available to the IRS, they should and could be \n     treated as cases of non-compliance through collection, audit \n     or other actions.\n       However, as can be seen from the chart, only a fraction of \n     each category of case, even the most serious, can be worked \n     with available resources. The ``gap'' represents the number \n     of cases that should be, but cannot be worked because of \n     resource limitations. These cases represent tens of billions \n     of dollars per year that could be, but are not collected. \n     More importantly, they represent a failure of fairness to the \n     millions of honest taxpayers whose commitment to paying their \n     taxes is based on the assumption that the IRS will act if \n     they or their neighbors do not pay their fair share.\n       Tax professionals, promoters, sophisticated taxpayers and \n     even some ordinary taxpayers are becoming more aware of our \n     deteriorating ability to deal with compliance. Increasingly, \n     this issue is being reported by publications ranging from The \n     Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, Fortune and Forbes, \n     and even on national television.\n       Recognizing the IRS' diminished capacity, promoters and \n     some tax professionals are selling a wide range of schemes \n     and devices to taxpayers based on the simple premise they can \n     probably get away with it. When this perception becomes \n     increasingly widespread, the essential pillar of the fairness \n     of our tax system is lost.\n       Our John Doe summonses of records for credit cards issued \n     by offshore banks in tax haven countries revealed one facet \n     of the problem. Just one of these summons, issued in 2000 to \n     MasterCard, yielded a large database of transactions by those \n     using cards issued by banks in Antigua, Barbuda, the Bahamas \n     and the Cayman Islands. Many of these taxpayers were \n     solicited through various channels by a variety of promoters.\n       Indeed, some sophisticated tax professionals, including \n     those in accounting and law firms and investment banks, are \n     aggressively marketing tax shelters to their clients. Some of \n     these turn out to be abusive tax avoidance transactions \n     prohibited by the Treasury Department.\n       Demand is also driving up supply. There is widespread \n     anecdotal evidence from honest practitioners about clients \n     demanding that their return preparer find a way to reduce \n     reported income, to the point of refusing advice from honest \n     professionals to comply with required reporting and \n     disclosure. In effect, they are saying, ``Get me one of these \n     deals or I will take my business elsewhere.'' This has \n     reached the point where recently a former IRS Commissioner \n     was faxed a solicitation from a ``Senior Investment Manager'' \n     that began, ``As we approach December 31st, you may have a \n     large income tax liability for the year 2002. The amount you \n     pay could be up to you.''\n       Although it is impossible to prove conclusively that \n     attitudes towards tax compliance shifted, we must make \n     informed judgments about behavior and trends. The only \n     responsible conclusion I can draw is that the trend in \n     attitudes of taxpayers and tax professionals poses a real \n     threat to the health of the tax system and ultimately to the \n     American economy.\n       If these problems and conditions are left unaddressed, we \n     could face an enormous crisis in confidence in the tax \n     administration system. It would not be surprising if this \n     problem emerged into the forefront of public concern, causing \n     an eruption about the IRS similar to those that occurred \n     periodically over the last 50 years. The long-term impact on \n     the economy and our nation of not reversing this trend will \n     be extremely high.\n\n\n                             What Is Needed\n\n       What is the answer? Fortunately, the problem is not open-\n     ended and can be solved with a reasonable amount of \n     resources. We need what the National Commission on \n     Restructuring the IRS argued for five years ago: a steady and \n     consistent budget. It must consist of two items over the next \n     five years. The first is a steady growth in staff in the \n     range of 2 percent per year. The second is steadily increased \n     funding for modernization until this program levels off \n     several years from now.\n       Together with aggressive increases in productivity, as \n     called for by the IRS Strategic Plan, this combination can \n     solve the problem by the end of this decade. In fact, as \n     shown in the ``Closing the Gap'' chart below, a combination \n     of 2 percent per year staff growth with 3 percent per year \n     productivity growth will keep up with increasing demand and \n     close the gap by 2010. But without both elements--modest but \n     steady staff growth and aggressive productivity increases--\n     the trend will not be reversed.\n       Computer systems alone, even with the most aggressive \n     reasonable assumptions about the productivity gains from \n     modernization, cannot solve the problem. Trained and \n     effective staff is also required. However, modernization will \n     allow the IRS to perform the tax administration function with \n     proportionately fewer staff than in the past. If the IRS \n     staff grew by 2 percent per year through 2010, the total \n     staff would still be smaller than it was 20 years earlier \n     (1990), while the economy is projected to be 86 percent \n     larger in real GDP and the tax system far more complex.\n       There is another critical point. Sufficient funding must be \n     provided to fund the actual projected staffing. There is no \n     ``extra'' funding lying around to ``absorb'' items that are \n     mandated, but not paid for. As shown below, the IRS dollar \n     budget consistently under-funded advertised staffing levels. \n     The actual number of FTEs is lower every year than proposed \n     in the budget. This is the effect of making unrealistically \n     optimistic assumptions about such items as pay raises, \n     inflation and other mandates, including specific mailing and \n     notification requirements.\n\n                    IRS DOLLAR BUDGET HAS CONSISTENTLY UNDER-FUNDED ADVERTISED STAFFING LEVEL\n                               [Full Time Equivalent [FTE] Personnel without EITC]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                 FY 2000   FY 2001   FY 2002   FY 2003   FY 2004\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFY 2000 President's Budget....................................    96,767  ........  ........  ........  ........\nFY 2001 President's Budget....................................    95,523    98,051   *99,873  ........  ........\nFY 2002 President's Budget....................................    95,155    97,273    99,116  ........  ........\nFY 2003 President's Budget....................................  ........    95,511    97,548    98,727  ........\nFY 2004 Treasury Submission...................................  ........  ........    97,423    96,182   98,182\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n* Includes 1,822 FTE for STABLE Annualization.\n\n\n[[Page S11075]]\n\n       Our plan already requires very rapid and sustained \n     productivity growth of over 3 percent per year--in excess of \n     the 2 to 2.4 percent achieved in the private sector. It \n     supposes complete success of BSM, aggressive reallocation of \n     internal resources, such as eliminating some submissions \n     processing centers, rapid growth of e-filing, and use of \n     productivity enhancing techniques, such as competitive \n     sourcing for some activities. These items make it possible to \n     cope with growth in filings and filling the gap in required \n     workload with very limited staff growth, but do not make it \n     possible in addition to ``absorb'' unfunded but required line \n     items.\n\n\n                        Simplifying the Tax Code\n\n       Most informed observers are justifiably horrified at the \n     complexity of the Tax Code. The cost of taxpayer compliance \n     with this code is over $80 billion per year, more than eight \n     times the cost of the IRS budget. The sheer size and \n     complexity in itself can be a source of disrespect for the \n     law. Therefore, it is a worthy, though difficult and \n     uncertain, challenge to pursue simplification to the maximum \n     extent possible.\n       However, there is no proposal that has been seriously \n     advanced for simplification that would have any significant \n     effect in the foreseeable future on the problem of IRS \n     resources.\n       Apart from the fact that even simplifying changes take time \n     and effort to develop, pass in Congress and to implement, the \n     reality is that the gap in IRS resources is so large that \n     nearly all of our resources are required to perform the basic \n     operations of the tax system and to pursue the clearest and \n     most important cases of non-compliance.\n       With the exception of some resources in the large corporate \n     sector, the IRS redirected nearly all compliance resources \n     away from less significant technical tax issues to cope with \n     current operational requirements and the most serious cases \n     of non-filing, non-payment or underreporting of income. Even \n     then, resources are far below what is required.\n       The only reasonable course is to pursue parallel paths: to \n     address the practical problem the tax administration system \n     faces by gradually closing the gap in the capacity of the IRS \n     to perform its essential tasks, while pursuing a parallel \n     path attempting tax simplification.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       Five years ago, the IRS embarked on a new direction. \n     Following it, we achieved much progress for America's \n     taxpayers, although we have much more left to do to improve \n     the entire way the IRS works. Today, we are faced with a \n     growing crisis--in our ability to do our job and the fairness \n     of our tax system. We cannot turn our back on this crisis or \n     believe that it will go away, because it will not. But like \n     five years ago, I believe the problem is solvable. We know \n     the right course of action and we should have the courage and \n     resolve to take it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/14/senate-section/article/S11075-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO GUIDE DOGS\n\n Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, after reading an article in The \nSaturday Evening Post about the Germans training dogs to aid veterans \nblinded during World War I, a blind man living in Tennessee named \nMorris Frank wrote to the author, ``Thousands of blind like me abhor \nbeing dependent on others. Help me and I will help them. Train me and I \nwill bring back my dog and show people here how a blind man can be \nabsolutely on his own.'' The author, Dorothy Harrison Eustis agreed to \nMr. Frank's request, and Mr. Frank's dog Buddy became the first guide \ndog in America.\n  That was 1929 and today, there are more than 7,000 guide dogs serving \nin America, and two performed miracles in New York on September 11.\n  That morning, Roselle, a yellow Labrador Retriever and her owner, \nMichael Hingson, went to the office on the 78th floor of the World \nTrade Center. While Mr. Hingson worked, Roselle slept underneath his \ndesk. Then the plane hit the South Tower, and what she did next was \nnothing short of heroic. She guided Mr. Hingson through the smoke and \nto the stairwell. Not only did Roselle help Mr. Hingson down 78 flights \nof stairs, but another woman who had been blinded by debris clutched \nRoselle's harness until they reached safety.\n  There was another yellow lab in the World Trade Center named Salty. \nHis owner, Omar Rivera, worked on the 71st floor of the Port Authority. \nAfter the planes hit, Salty refused to leave Omar's side and walked \nthrough the smoke-filled stairway, broken glass and debris to get Mr. \nRivera and a co-worker to safety. Even as the North Tower collapsed and \nthe debris cloud filled the streets, Salty remained calm, loyal, and \nfocused on guiding Mr. Rivera to a place free from danger.\n  These two guide dogs performed their jobs under the most extreme \ncircumstances. But what they did that day reinforced what guide dogs do \nevery day--they provide independence to individuals who are blind and \nvisually impaired so that they can live their life free from \nconstraints. To serve as another's set of eyes, to navigate busy city \nstreets, and to keep their owners from harm's way is a responsibility \nthat only a loyal dog would welcome with no questions asked.\n  Thorughout the United States and around the world, Guide Dog Schools \nhave given more than one hundred thousand people the chance to move \nabout the world with freedom and dignity. Each school offers their \nguide dogs at no cost to the owners. All they have to do is apply, \nattend training, and promise to care for their dog for the rest of his \nor her life. The success of each school is dependent upon thousands of \nstaff, volunteers, and generous supporters. Many people volunteer to \nraise puppies, socialize them and then give them up at the end of the \nyear. And we see these dogs every day sitting patiently on the subway, \nstopping at walk lights, and maneuvering people around hazards that \nprevent a safe, straight path. They wear bright colored vests that read \n``Guide Dog in Training.''\n  Not only did Morris Frank bring the first guide dog to America, he \nopened the first school in 1929, The Seeing Eye. Now in every State, \nguide dog schools provide an invaluable service. In California, The \nGuide Dog School just celebrated its 60th Anniversary, and in New York, \nThe Guide Dog Foundation in Smithtown, has assisted New Yorkers and \nothers from around the world since 1946. And Guiding Eyes for the Blind \nin Yorktown Heights has graduated more than 5,000 dogs and owners since \n1954.\n  Each success story is testament that one good idea can transform the \nlives of many. But the success of the guide dog schools would not have \noccurred without two key components: those who believed that the blind \nand visually impaired could lead more independent lives with the right \nkind of help, and the dogs, the Labrador Retrievers, the Golden \nRetrievers, the German Shepherds, and other breeds that are ready, \nwilling, and able to guide their owners through the world.\n  Every day, thousands of people grab on to the harness and place their \ntrust in their companion. Some have acted with remarkable heroism like \nthose on September 11, and we have all heard the stories about guide \ndogs waking their owners in the event of a fire and blocking them from \nthe path of a speeding car. But most go through their days with quiet \ndignity and they deserve our utmost respect. Whether they are named \nRoselle or Salty or Buddy, they all respond in the same way. That \nharness goes on, their eyes open, and they show us that it is possible \nto walk through this world with a profound desire to help another so \nthat life is limitless.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/14/senate-section/article/S11075-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11075-S11076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING MOTT CHILDREN'S HEALTH CENTER\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I wish to express my heartfelt \ncongratulations to the Mott Children's Health Center (MCHC), in Flint, \nMI, which has been selected by the American Lung Association of \nMichigan-Genesee Valley Region as the 2002 Corporate Health Advocate of \nthe Year.\n  The American Health and Lung Association of Michigan-Genesee Valley \nRegion grants this prestigious award to an organization that aspires to \nrestrict or ban smoking, offers employee programs for smoking \ncessation, or exhibits respect and sensitivity to those suffering with \nlung disease. Winners must demonstrate financial support to local non-\nprofit agencies as well as encourage employees to sit on local boards \nof directors for community based non-profit organizations. Recipients \nalso need to display a commitment to improving the quality of life of \nGenesee Valley's residents. MCHC has not only met but far surpassed the \nAmerican Health and Lung Association's criteria and is a worthy \nrecipient of this award.\n  Founded in 1939 by Charles Stuart Mott, MCHC's mission is to better \nthe lives of Genesee County's at-risk youth through health services and \ncommunity advocacy. As a health service provider, MCHC offers the \nGenesee County\n\n[[Page S11076]]\n\ncommunity both emotional and physical pediatric health services, \neducates families on health-related issues, and supports local schools \nand neighborhoods with on-site health care. In order to inform \ncommunity decision makers on issues related to Genesee County's \nchildren's health needs, MCHC sponsors events on matters affecting \nchildren's health, supports various state and local children's advocacy \norganizations, and develops educational materials on children's issues. \nIn its 63-year history, MCHC has expanded to become a principal in \nchild health advocacy in the Genesee Valley community and throughout \nMichigan.\n  MCHC is a recognized leader in the battle against childhood asthma, \nan illness that affects 15 percent of Genesee County's children. As \npart of the Childhood Asthma Task Force, (CATF), MCHC provides staff \nand other resources, including a home to CATF's three Mini Asthma \nResource Centers. MCHC nurses, who dedicate themselves to educating \nfamilies about asthma and available treatments, staff these CATF \ncenters. Additionally, in its continuing effort to highlight children's \nrespiratory health issues, last year MCHC sponsored the 29th Annual \nTuuri Day Conference, which addressed topics such as ``New Approached \nto Pediatric Asthma'' and ``Smoking Among Children and Families.''\n  MCHC has a long and impressive history of advocacy for the children \nof Genesee Valley. I know my colleagues join me in congratulating Mott \nChildren's Health Center for being named the 2002 Corporate Health \nAdvocate of the Year and wishing them continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/14/senate-section/article/S11076-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING GLORIA R. BOURDON\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I wish to express my sincerest \ncongratulations to Gloria R. Bourdon of Michigan who has recently been \nrecognized by the American Lung Association of Michigan-Genessee Valley \nRegion as the 2002 Individual Health Advocate of the Year.\n  The American Lung Association of Michigan-Genesee Valley Region \nawards this honor to an individual who has served as board member on a \nhealth association or participated in a health related activity for at \nleast 5 years. Recipients must contribute to the community's health, \neducation, and general well-being. The individual must have been \ninvolved in promoting health care research, contributing to articles on \nhealth care, and involved in lung health care advocacy. Gloria Bourdon \nhas not only met these criteria but has far exceeded them; for this she \nis a worthy recipient of this prestigious award.\n  Gloria Bourdon's promotion of children's health issues began in 1970 \nas a teacher in Pinconning and Linden Areas Schools, where she taught \nstudents to lead healthy lifestyles. As the Director of Health, Safety \nand Nutrition Services for the Genesee Intermediate School District, \nGloria is now responsible for the health and safety of the children in \n55 public schools, public academies, and private schools. She is also \nan active member of the community. She supports many coalitions \nincluding Priority Children, Childhood Asthma Task Force, and the \nGenesee County Curriculum Council. Her outstanding work and dedication \nhave been recognized by various organizations. Most recently, Gloria \nreceived the Genesee County Child Advocacy Award, the Michigan \nAssociation of School Board's Health and Safety Award, and the \nRainmaker Award from HealthPlus.\n  Gloria's dedication to children's health is evident in her writing \nand fundraising efforts. In 1998, she authored a Health Action Team \nManual for Substance Abuse Education, Physical Activity, Nutrition \nEducation, and Safe and Drug Free School Zones. She has assisted the \nAmerican Lung Association in efforts regarding asthma, tobacco and air-\nquality awareness. Gloria also encourages her nursing and teaching \nstaff to support the Association's goals.\n  I join the American Lung Association of Michigan-Genesee Valley \nRegion in congratulating Gloria on her great accomplishments in \npromoting the health and safety of the children in Genesee County and \nsurrounding areas. I know that my colleagues in the Senate will support \nme in thanking Gloria Bourdon for her efforts and wishing her well in \nher future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/14/senate-section/article/S11076-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/14/senate-section/article/S11076-3", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session, the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/14/senate-section/article/S11076-4", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:36 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 5710.

A bill to establish a grant program to provide comprehensive \neye examinations to children, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Children's \nVision Improvement and Learning Readiness Act.'' I am pleased to be \njoined by my colleague from Ohio, Senator DeWine, in this effort. \nVision disorders are the fourth most common disability in the United \nStates and the most prevalent handicapping condition among children. \nThis is a startling fact when one considers that eighty percent of what \nchildren learn is acquired through vision processing information and \nthe quality of children's eye health has a direct impact on their \nlearning and achievement.\n  It is estimated that almost ten percent of children have clinically \nsignificant vision impairment, which are associated with developmental \ndelays and the need for special education, vocational, and social \nservices. Specifically, studies have found that among the twenty \npercent of school age children who have a learning disability in \nreading, seventy percent have some form of visual impairment, such as \nocular motor, perceptual or binocular dysfunction, that could interfere \nwith their reading skills. The ``Children's Vision Improvement and \nLearning Readiness Act'' recognizes the importance of diagnosing vision \ndisorders in children at an early age so as to allow intervention at a \ntime when these disorders are highly responsive to treatment.\n  Unfortunately, too many children in school today live with an \nundiagnosed vision impairment and too many times these same children \nhave not had a comprehensive eye examination prior to entering school. \nIn fact, only one-third of all children have had an eye examination or \nvision screening prior to entering school despite evidence that the \nearlier a vision problem is diagnosed and corrected, the less the \npotential negative impact it may have on a child's development.\n  In addition, undiagnosed visual problems impose economic costs on our \nNation. In 1995, the economic impact of visual disorders and \ndisabilities was approximately $38.4 billion. Yet, early, comprehensive \neye exams in children can help reduce the economic and social costs \nassociated with undiagnosed eye disorders. Providing comprehensive eye \nexaminations to children before they enter school helps to decrease \nlong-term medical expenditures, prevent inappropriate placement of \nchildren in special education programs, and avoid social welfare \nspending by improving children's ability to learn and achieve a greater \ndegree of educational and economic attainment.\n  The ``Children's Vision Improvement and Learning Readiness Act'' \ngives the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to \nprovide grants to States for a variety of educational and outreach \nactivities related to improving and safeguarding the eye health and \nacademic success of our nation's children. Grants may be used for the \ndevelopment of a voluntary statewide school-based comprehensive eye \nexamination program for elementary school age children; the development \nof State-based education programs to increase public awareness of the \nbenefits of comprehensive eye examinations; and the flexibility of \nproviding comprehensive eye examinations through other related federal \nprograms, such as Head Start, the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act, the Child Care Block Grant, and the Consolidated Health \nCenters programs.\n  This important measure will help ensure that our nation's children \nhave access to comprehensive eye examinations from qualified health \nprofessionals so they can start school prepared for a lifetime of \nlearning and achievement. I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator \nDeWine in supporting this legislation that will help to boost the well-\nbeing and academic achievement of our nation's school children.\n\n[[Page S11081]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 3161. A bill to provide a definition of a prevailing party for \nFederal fee-shifting statutes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I am pleased today to introduce the \nSettlement Encouragement and Fairness Act of 2002. This bill provides \nthat when plaintiffs bring a lawsuit that acts as a catalyst for a \nchange in position by the opposing party, they will be considered the \n``prevailing party'' for purposes of recovering attorneys' fees under \nFederal law. The bill will help ensure that people who are the victims \nof civil rights, environmental, and worker rights' abuses can obtain \nlegal representation to enforce their rights.\n  Over the course of our history, Congress has often enacted laws \nencouraging private litigants to implement public policy through our \ncourt system. An integral part of many such laws are provisions that \nhelp individuals obtain adequate legal representation by providing that \nthe defendants will pay the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees in cases where \nthe plaintiff prevails. In laws involving public accommodations, \nhousing, labor, disabilities, age discrimination, violence against \nwomen, voting rights, pollution, and other areas, Congress has acted \nover and over again to empower private litigants in their pursuit of \njustice. Currently, there are over two hundred statutory fee-shifting \nprovisions that allow for some sort of payment of attorneys' fees to a \nprevailing plaintiff.\n  Until last year, in interpreting these fee-shifting statutes in cases \nwhere a settlement was reached before trial, nine circuit courts of \nappeals embraced the ``catalyst theory'' to determine whether \nattorneys' fees could be obtained. The catalyst theory required the \npayment of fees where the lawsuit caused a change in the position or \nconduct of the defendant. Only one circuit court, the Fourth Circuit, \napplied a more narrow definition of prevailing party, requiring a \njudgment or a court approved settlement in order for a plaintiff to \nobtain attorneys' fees.\n  In Buckhannon Board of Care & Home Inc. v. West Virginia Department \nof Health and Human Services, 2001, a case arising out of the Fourth \nCircuit, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, in a 5-4 decision, that \nplaintiffs may recover attorneys' fees from defendants only if they \nhave been awarded relief by a court, not if they prevailed through a \nvoluntary change in the defendant's behavior or a private settlement. \nThe Buckhannon ruling eliminated the catalyst theory for all fee \nshifting statutes in federal law.\n  The bill I introduce today restores the catalyst theory that the vast \nmajority of courts had approved prior to the Buckhannon decision as a \nbasis for seeking attorneys fees under Federal fee shifting statutes. \nIt provides a new definition of ``prevailing party'' for all such \nstatutes to encompass the common situation where defendants alter their \nconduct after a lawsuit has commenced but without waiting for a court \norder requiring them to do so. This critical change in the definition \nof ``prevailing party'' will allow attorneys representing clients who \ncannot otherwise afford to hire a lawyer to recover their costs and to \nbe paid a reasonable rate for their work.\n  The Buckhannon case itself illustrates the need for this legislation. \nBuckhannon Board and Care Home in West Virginia, an operator of \nassisted living residences, failed a state inspection because some \nresidents were incapable of ``self-preservation'' as defined by State \nlaw. After receiving orders to close its facilities, Buckhannon sued \nthe State seeking declaratory and injunctive relief that the ``self-\npreservation'' requirement violated the Fair Housing Amendments Act and \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act. While the lawsuit was pending but \nbefore the court ruled, the state legislature eliminated the ``self-\npreservation'' requirement.\n  Imagine how the plaintiffs felt when they learned that their lawsuit \nhad forced a change in the law not only for their own case but also for \nall of the other individuals who had been subject to the improper self-\npreservation doctrine. If ever there was a complete and total victory \ncaused by litigation, this was it. But, as Casey Stengel once said, \n``It ain't over 'till it's over.'' Once the State legislature changed \nthe law, the District Court granted defendant's motion to dismiss the \ncase as moot and denied Buckhannon's request for attorneys' fees. The \ncourt ruled that the legislative action did not amount to a judicially \nrequired change in position that would permit Buckhannon to be \nconsidered a ``prevailing party'' in the case. On appeal, the Court of \nAppeals for the Fourth Circuit and then the U.S. Supreme Court denied \nattorneys' fees for the plaintiffs, ruling that because the change in \nthe defendants' conduct was voluntary rather than ordered by the court, \nBuckhannon was not a prevailing party.\n  I believe the narrow definition of `prevailing party' endorsed by the \nBuckhannon decision will result in many injustices going unchallenged. \nIndeed, in calculating whether to take a case, an attorney for a \nplaintiff will have to consider not only the chances of losing, but the \nchances of winning too easily. If businesses or individuals are able to \nengage in egregious conduct, refuse to change their behavior without a \nlawsuit being filed against them, and then avoid paying attorneys' fees \nby changing their conduct on the eve of trial, the effect will be that \nsome lawyers will decide that they cannot afford to take a case even if \nthe claims are very strong.\n  Imagine a case involving a legitimate claim of housing discrimination \nwhere, after many months, perhaps even years of work, as the attorney \nfor the plaintiff prepares into the evening for opening statements, the \nattorney learns that the defendant has admitted its wrongful conduct \nand offered substantial compensation and a promise to change its \npractices. This offer came about only because of the spotlight the \nlawsuit put on the defendant and the possibility of a large jury \nverdict. This would be a complete victory for the plaintiff, but under \nBuckhannon, the attorney who labored for years to bring about this \nresult may not be paid. Later, if the same defendant returns to \ndiscriminatory practices, the next plaintiff might very well not be \nable to find competent counsel who will take the case.\n  Ironically, the failure to correct the Buckhannon decision could lead \nto plaintiffs' attorneys dragging out law suits out far beyond a point \nin time where the parties could reach a fair settlement, in order to \ninsure that they meet the Buckhannon definition of ``prevailing \nparty.'' This will increase the costs of litigation and discourage \nsettlement. Simply put, Buckhannon creates unnatural tensions between \nattorneys and clients and may even push attorneys to not act in the \nbest interest of their clients.\n  Certainly we can do better. Congress has passed important laws to \nprotect the public in the work place and in our communities; we must \nensure that these laws can be enforced, when necessary, in court. The \nSettlement Encouragement and Fairness Act of 2002 will help insure that \nall our citizens have the ability to meaningfully challenge injustice.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Cleland, \n        and Mr. Edwards):\n  S. 3162. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to enhance the \nsecurity of transporting high-level nuclear waste and spend nuclear \nfuel, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nimprove the safety of nuclear waste transportation across our Nation. \nThis bill, the Nuclear Waste Transportation Security Act of 2002, seeks \nto address the concerns raised by the Congress' decision earlier this \nyear to transport spent nuclear fuel to Yucca Mountain, NV, for \nunderground storage. Joining me in its introduction are Senators \nCleland, Edwards, and Nelson.\n  I voted in favor of moving nuclear waste to Yucca Mountain. My \ndecision was not a simple one; rather its ramifications required \nserious consideration. At that time, I predicated my `yes' vote on the \nwaste being transported safely and securely through my home State of \nIllinois and across our Nation, and I indicated that I would introduce \nlegislation to improve that safety and security. This is that \nlegislation.\n  The Nuclear Waste Transportation Security Act directs the Secretary \nof\n\n[[Page S11082]]\n\nTransportation to establish a comprehensive transportation safety \nprogram that considers terrorist threats and other potential dangers to \nthe safe transportation of this spent fuel. The Department of \nTransportation, the regulator of these shipments, will consult with \nnumerous cabinet and sub-cabinet offices, including the soon to be \ncreated Department of Homeland Security, to develop this program. After \none year, the Secretary will deliver a progress report to Congress on \nthe program's development and implementation.\n  To better assist State, local, and tribal governments in implementing \nthis program, our bill establishes a grant program at DOT related to \nthe transportation of nuclear spent fuel. First responders will be \neligible for these grants, which will emphasize frequently used routes. \nThe grants will be used for infrastructure improvements, drills and \ntraining, and other activities as determined by the Secretary. DOE and \nthe Federal Radiological Preparedness Coordinating Committee, FRPCC, of \nFEMA will consult on the grant program. For this purpose, the bill \nauthorizes $3,000,000 for fiscal year 2003 and additional funds as \nnecessary for fiscal years 2004 through 2012.\n  A key component of spent nuclear fuel transportation is ensuring the \nsafety and security of routes nationwide. Much of this fuel is likely \nto be transported through my own State of Illinois, right through the \ncenter of Chicago and Springfield, our State capitol. I want to be \ncertain that its transport does not endanger my constituents in any \nway. The Department of Energy ranks Illinois seventh in truck shipments \nunder what is called the ``mostly truck scenario,'' and sixth in rail \nshipments in the ``mostly rail scenario.'' Nearly half of Illinois' \nelectricity is generated from nuclear power. With seven nuclear power \nplants and two nuclear research reactors Illinois produces more nuclear \nwaste than any other State and is home to some of the busiest \ntransportation corridors in the Nation. The safety of Illinoisans is at \nstake. These stakes are too high for us to gamble. Safety must be a top \npriority.\n  To ensure this safety, my bill requires that the DOT consult with \nState governments in establishing routes and provide 14-days' notice to \ngovernors of shipments through their States. The bill requires \ndedicated trains for the waste with trained guards stationed at the \nfront and rear ends of each train. The bill provides the Secretary of \nTransportation and the Director of Homeland Security with waiver \nauthority for national or homeland security. Under my legislation, \ntrains must be equipped with communication systems providing continuous \naccess to first responders and must be equipped with the best available \ntechnology, including appropriate health monitoring systems. Finally, \nto ensure the safe transportation of passengers and shippers on our \nnation's waterways, nuclear waste shipments may not be made via the \ninland waterways or on the Great Lakes unless waived for national or \nhomeland security purposes. This is critical to adequately protect \nthese important natural resources.\n\n  Once the infrastructure is established and the routing determined, \nemployees must be certified to handle any such emergencies that may \nresult from this transportation and to mitigate their impact on local \npopulations. My bill amends certification requirements for hazmat \nemployees, requiring that certification be renewed every three years. \nCurrently, this certification, without renewals, is required by \nregulation but not codified in statute.\n  The bill directs hazmat employers to submit training programs to DOT \nfor review and approval and expands the definition of covered employees \nto include those who may be among the first responders to an accident \nbut who do not receive training under current regulations. To provide \nfunding for this additional training, the bill reauthorizes the \ntraining grant program for hazmat instructors who train hazmat \nemployees, and enables it to cover hazmat employee training as well. \nAppropriations are authorized at $3,000,000 for fiscal year 2003 and \nfor such sums as necessary for fiscal years 2004-2012.\n  The maximum civil penalties for violating hazmat laws regarding \nradioactive materials are increased from $25,000 to $100,000.\n  As a means of involving the public in these decisions affecting \nsafety and security, the bill establishes a public outreach program to \nprotect public health and safety. The program will be developed by FEMA \nin coordination with other agencies. In addition, the bill requires the \nEPA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct a \nstudy and report to Congress regarding the effects on public health of \nroutine transportation of nuclear waste and accidents involving its \ntransportation. The report is due one year after the date of enactment.\n  Especially important to my legislation is the establishment of \nrequirements for casks. Also known as packages, these casks contain the \nspent nuclear fuel that is being shipped. The bill requires the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission, which has authority over the casks, to execute a \ncomprehensive testing program in conjunction with DOT and DHS, and \nrequires them to conduct a survey of potential terrorist and other \nthreats that may be posed to casks. The NRC and DOT must jointly \ncertify the safety of the casks, which must be designed to handle head-\non collisions at any speed at which they will be transported, attempted \npuncture by armor-piercing ammunition, falls of the maximum distance to \nwhich the package could fall on likely routes, submersion in water to \nthe maximum depth to which the package could be submerged, continuous \nexposure to the maximum temperature to which the package is likely to \nbe subjected in an event involving fire, and other threats that may be \nidentified. The agencies involved in this effort must report to \nCongress every two years on these activities.\n  Finally, the bill amends current statute to exclude DOT and NRC \ncontractors from participating on the Nuclear Waste Technical Review \nBoard and enables the Board to review the activities of the DOT and NRC \nand to obtain documents from them as part of its existing investigative \npowers. This provision will prevent any conflicts of interest between \nthe reviewers and implementers of this law. The Board's termination \ndate is extended from one year after nuclear waste begins to be \ndeposited at a national repository to 10 years after such waste begins \nto be deposited.\n  I believe that our legislation alleviates many of the concerns of \nshippers, hazmat employees, the federal government, and affected \ncitizens regarding the transportation of nuclear spent fuel across our \nNation. In the course of its development, we consulted with shippers, \nrailroads, labor unions, the nuclear industry, federal regulators, the \nenvironmental community, and our colleagues in the Senate. The bill \nseeks to address the real threats we face and to take economic and \nsafety concerns into account, with the primary goal of increasing the \nsafety and security of these materials during their transportation to \nYucca Mountain. I appreciate the assistance that these groups have \nprovided. I remain open to their further input and look forward to \nworking with them to enact this critical legislation.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, \nSenator Durbin, Senator Edwards and Senator Cleland in introducing the \nNuclear Waste Transportation Security Act.\n  Ensuring the safe and secure transportation of our high-level nuclear \nwaste across this country is of paramount importance. The greatest \nconcern I had voting for the Yucca Mountain Resolution was the safe \ntransportation of our waste to Yucca.\n  This piece of legislation is the first step in what I see as \nCongress' ongoing duty to oversee and evaluate our Nation's transport \nof nuclear waste.\n  Specifically, this bill directs the Department of Transportation to \ndevelop and carry out a comprehensive safety program that considers, \namong other things, terrorist threats.\n  State and Federal cooperation is required. States must be consulted \nby DOT in making routing decisions and notified when shipments are \ntraveling through their State.\n  Dedicated trains, armed escorts and state of the art communication \nsystems must be employed.\n  Full-scale testing of casks to withstand the maximum temperature, \nwater depth and piercing likely to be encountered must also be carried \nout.\n\n[[Page S11083]]\n\n  The EPA and CDC must conduct a study and report to Congress on the \neffects, if any, on public health of routine transportation of nuclear \nwaste and accidents involving the transportation of nuclear waste.\n  And, the Federal Emergency Management Agency must administer a public \noutreach program on nuclear waste to educate the public on appropriate \nmeans of responding to an accident or attack involving high-level \nnuclear waste.\n  Employing the expertise of the DOT, NRC, FEMA, EPA and CDC to protect \nthe American people from any potential danger posed by nuclear waste \ntransport is the aim and goal of this legislation and I hope my \ncolleagues will support it.\n  The first shipments of nuclear waste to Yucca Mountain will not take \nplace until 2010. We need to use the time between now and then to \nensure that the transportation system that will carry this waste is a \nsafe as it can possibly be.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE:\n  S. 3163.

A bill to provide grants to States and outlying areas to \nencourage the States and outlying areas to enhance existing or \nestablish new statewide coalitions among institutions of higher \neducation, communities around the institutions, and other relevant \norganization or groups, including anti-drug or anti-alcohol coalitions, \nto reduce underage drinking and illicit drug-use by students, both on \nand off campus; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I join several of my colleagues today to \nintroduce a series of bills related to the reauthorization of the \nHigher Education Act, HEA. These five bills emphasize a number of \nissues that are vital to higher education, including teacher quality; \nloan forgiveness for social workers, family lawyers, and early \nchildhood teachers; and the reduction of drug use and underage drinking \nat our colleges and universities.\n  The quality of a student's education is the direct result of the \nquality of that student's teachers. If we don't have well trained \nteachers, then future generations of our children will not be well \neducated. That is why I am introducing a bill that would provide $200 \nmillion in grants to our schools of education to partner with local \nschools to ensure that our teachers are receiving the best, most, \nextensive training available before they enter the classroom.\n  The Secretary of Education's annual report on teacher quality \nreported that a majority of graduates of schools of education believe \nthat the traditional teacher preparation program left them ill prepared \nfor the challenges and rigors of the classroom. Part of the \nresponsibility for this lies in the hands of our schools of education. \nHowever, Congress also has a responsibility to give our schools of \neducation the tools they need to make necessary improvements. This new \nbill would create a competitive grant program for schools of education, \nwhich partner with low income schools to create clinical programs to \ntrain teachers. Additionally, it would require schools of education to \nmake internal changes by working with other departments at the \nuniversity to ensure that teachers are receiving the highest quality \neducation in core academic subjects. Finally, it would require the \ncollege or university to demonstrate a commitment to improving their \nschools of education by providing matching funds.\n  Another complex issue affecting the teaching force is the high \npercentage of disillusioned beginning teachers who leave the field. Our \nbill would help combat this issue, as well. Schools of education \nreceiving these grants would be responsible for following their \ngraduates and continuing to provide assistance after they enter the \nclassroom. The more we invest in the education of teachcers especially \nonce they have entered the profession the more likely they will remain \nin the classroom.\n  Today, I also would like to reintroduce the Early Care and Education \nLoan Forgiveness Act that Senator Wellstone and I had included in the \nlast higher education reauthorization bill. We had been working on this \nlegislation together before Paul's tragic death. I know he cared deeply \nabout this issue and about making sure that all children receive a \nquality education. He was passionate about that. And, in his memory, I \nwould like to rename our bill the ``Paul Wellstone Early Educator Loan \nForgiveness Act.''\n\n  This bill would expand the loan forgiveness program so that it \nbenefits not just childcare workers, but also early childhood \neducators. This loan forgiveness program would serve as an incentive to \nkeep those educators in the field for longer periods of time.\n  Paul Wellstone knew how important early learning programs are in \npreparing our children for kindergarten and beyond. Research shows that \nchildren who attend quality early childcare programs when they were \nthree or four years old scored better on math, language arts, and \nsocial skills in early elementary school than children who attended \npoor quality childcare programs. In short, children in early learning \nprograms with high quality teachers, teachers with a bachelor's degree \nor an associate's degree or higher, do substantially better.\n  When we examine the number and recent growth of pre-primary education \nprograms, it becomes difficult to differentiate between early education \nand childcare settings because they are so often intertwined, \nespecially considering that 11.9 million children younger than age five \nspend part of their time with a care provider other than a parent and \ndemand for quality childcare and education is growing as more mothers \nenter the workforce.\n  Because the bill targets loan forgiveness to those educators working \nin low-income schools or childcare settings, we can make significant \nstrides toward providing high quality education for all of our young \nchildren, regardless of socioeconomic status. The bill would serve a \ntwo-fold function. First, it would reward professionals for their \ntraining. Second, it would encourage professionals to remain in the \nprofession over longer periods of time, since more time in the \nprofession leads to higher percentages of loans forgiveness. The bill \nwould result in more educated individuals with more teaching experience \nand lower turnover rates, each of which enhances student performance.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in this effort to ensure that \ntruly no children, especially our youngest children, are left behind.\n  I also am working on two bills with my friend and colleagues from \nWest Virginia, Senator Jay Rockefeller. These bills would provide loan \nforgiveness to students who dedicate their careers to working in the \nrealm of child welfare, including social workers, who work for child \nprotective services, and family law experts.\n  Currently, there aren't enough social workers to fill available jobs \nin child welfare today. Furthermore, the number of social work job \nopenings is expected to increase faster than the average for all \noccupations through 2010. The need for highly qualified social workers \nin the child protective services is reaching crisis level.\n\n  We also need more qualified individuals focusing on family law. The \nwonderful thing about family law is its\n\n[[Page S11084]]\n\nfocus on rehabilitation, that is the rehabilitation of families by \nhelping them through life's transitions, whether it is a family going \nthrough a divorce, a family dealing with their troubled teenager in the \njuvenile system, or a child getting adopted and becoming a member of a \nnew family.\n  Across the United States, family, juvenile, and domestic relations \ncourts are experiencing a shortage of qualified attorneys. As many of \nmy colleagues and I know, law school is an expensive investment. In the \nlast 20 years, tuition has increased more than 200 percent. Currently, \nthe average rate of law school debt is about $80,000 per graduate. To \nbe sure, few law school graduates can afford to work in the public \nsector because debts prevent even the most dedicated public service \nlawyer from being able to take these low-paying jobs. This results in a \nshortage of family lawyers.\n  The shortage of family law attorneys also disproportionately impacts \njuveniles. The lack of available representation causes children to \nspend more time in foster care because cases are adjourned or postponed \nwhen they simply cannot find an attorney to represent their rights or \nthose of the parent or guardian. Furthermore, the number of children \ninvolved in the court system is sharply increasing. We need to make \nsure the interests of these children are taken care of by making sure \nthey have an advocate, someone working solely on their behalf.\n  By offering loan forgiveness to those willing to purpose careers in \nthe child welfare field, we can increase the number of highly qualified \nand dedicate individuals who work in the realm of child welfare and \nfamily law.\n  Finally, I am introducing a bill today with my friend and colleague \nfrom Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, that would help address an \nepidemic, the epidemic of underage drinking, binge drinking, and drug-\nrelated problems on college and university campuses across the United \nStates. Our bill would provide grants to states to establish statewide \npartnerships among colleges and universities and the surrounding \ncommunities to work together to reduce underage and binge drinking and \nillicit drug use by students.\n  According to a study by Boston University, over 1,400 students aged \n18-24 died in 1998 from alcohol-related injuries, more than 600,000 \nstudents were assaulted by another student, and another 500,000 were \nunintentionally injured while under the influence of alcohol. According \nto a 1999 Harvard University study, 40 percent of college students are \nbinge drinkers and according to the Department of Health and Human \nServices, nearly 10.5 million current drinkers were under the legal age \nof 21, and of these, over 5 million were binge drinkers.\n\n  Currently, 28 States, including my home State of Ohio, have \ncoalitions that deal specifically with the culture of alcohol and drug \nabuse on our Nation's college campuses. They work with the surrounding \ncommunities, including local residents, bar, restaurant and shop \nowners, and law enforcement officials, toward a goal of changing the \npervasive culture of drug and alcohol abuse. They provide alternative \nalcohol-free events, as well as support groups for those who choose not \nto drink. They also educate students about the dangers of alcohol and \ndrug-use.\n  Furthermore, the coalitions recognize that while it is important to \npromote an alcohol aware and drug-free campus community, if the \ncommunity surrounding the campus does not promote these initiatives, \nthere will be no long-term solutions. Therefore, these coalitions also \nhave worked to establish regulations both on and off campus, which will \nhelp our nation's youth to stay healthy, alive, and get the most out of \ntheir time at college. Some of these regulations include the \nregistration of kegs. This provides accountability for both the store \nand the student. This is just an example of one step that colleges, \nlocal communities, and organizations can take.\n  To help start the expansion of these coalitions, our bill would \nprovide $50 million dollars in grants. This is an important \ndemonstration project that would help lead to positive effects for our \nyoung people. It is up to us to change the culture, which has been \nperpetuated by years of complacency and a dismissal tone of ``that's \njust the way it is in college.'' We must protect the health and \neducation of our young people by changing this culture of abuse--and \nthat is exactly what this bill would do.\n  Next year when we consider the reauthorization of the Higher \nEducation Act, I encourage my colleagues to join in support of these \ninitiatives.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 3168. A bill to improve funeral home, cemetery, and crematory \ninspections systems to establish consumer protections relating to \nfuneral service contracts, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Federal Death \nCare Inspection and Disclosure Act of 2002, a bill which I believe will \ngo a long way in restoring the trust that Americans place in the \nfuneral and death care industries.\n  None of us like to think about death and dying. It is a painful and \nuncomfortable subject, and most Americans, understandably, choose not \nto confront matters related to the death of a loved one until the death \nactually occurs. And when a loved one does pass on, we turn to our \nfriends and family to grieve. Certainly, the last thing anyone wants to \ndo at such a painful time is to spend hours or days negotiating or \nshopping for a funeral, casket, or other goods and services. Instead, \nwe leave most of these arrangements in the hands of funeral service \nproviders, turning to them to ensure that our loved ones are cared for \nand treated with respect and dignity after their passing.\n  We place a great deal of trust in funeral service providers. A \nfuneral, after all, represents one of the largest purchases many \nconsumers will ever make, just behind a home, college education, and a \ncar. However, unlike these transactions, the purchase of funeral \nservices is most often done under intense emotional duress, with very \nlittle time to spare, and without the benefit of the type of consumer \ninformation generally available when making such a large purchase. As a \nresult, we trust funeral service providers to give us fair prices, to \nrepresent goods and services accurately, and to not take advantage of \nus during our moments of greatest grief and vulnerability.\n  For the most part, this trust is well deserved. I have no doubt, that \nthe majority of individuals working in the funeral industry are good \nmen and women who practice their profession with the honor and gravity \nit demands. However, recent revelations of abuses in the industry have \nshown us that not all members of the death care industry are honest and \nupstanding. We all remember hearing, earlier this year of the discovery \nof over 200 bodies strewn in the woods near a crematorium in Noble, GA. \nThere is also recent evidence of desecration of graves and remains at \ncemeteries in Florida, California, Hawaii, and my own State of \nConnecticut. These incidents, as well as developments in the funeral \nindustry as a whole, compel us to reexamine the regulatory structure we \ncurrently have in place for this industry.\n  Currently, the death care industry is regulated by a patchwork of \nState and local laws. These regulations may have been sufficient years \nago, but the character of the industry has changed substantially since \nmany of these laws were passed. The industry has become surprisingly \nlarge and diverse. Today, the death care industry generates annual \nrevenues of over $15 billion and employ over 104,000 Americans. The \n1990s saw the rise of multi-state ``consolidators'' who purchased local \nfuneral homes across the country. Even for small local firms, the \nbusiness has become increasingly complex. As more and more Americans \ntravel and live in places far from where they were born, the industry \nhas become one that frequently does business across State and county \nlines.\n  There have also been changes in Americans' cultural expectations of \nfuneral services. For example, the percentage of cremations has risen \nfrom 5 percent in the 1970s to 25 percent today. However, only 12 \nStates have substantive laws which cover cremation. In fact, in the \ncase in Georgia I mentioned earlier, the crematorium in question was \nstatutorily exempt from inspection, allowing the abuses to continue \nundiscovered.\n\n[[Page S11085]]\n\n  The only significant Federal regulation of the industry exists in the \nFederal Trade Commission's Funeral Rule, promulgated nearly 20 years \nago. Again, this rule has not kept up with the nature of the industry. \nPerhaps most importantly, the rule does not cover numerous sectors of \nthe industry such as cemeteries, crematories, and casket makers. It \nalso does not effectively regulate prepaid funeral contracts, which \nhave become an increasingly popular option in recent years.\n  Earlier this year, I chaired a hearing of the Subcommittee on \nChildren and Families in which we examined developments in the industry \nand how they have impacted American families. Since that hearing, I \nhave worked with both consumer and industry groups to craft legislation \nto protect Americans from potential abuse by funeral service providers. \nThe Federal Death Care Inspection and Disclosure Act of 2002 would \nprovide Federal funding to allow States to hire and train inspectors \nand give consumers the right to legal action against those who violate \nregulatory standards. In order to be eligible for funding, states would \nhave to adhere to standards which are outlined in the legislation. The \nact would also codify and strengthen the existing FTC regulations \ngoverning licensing and registration, recordkeeping, inspection, \nresolution of consumer complaints, and enforcement of State laws in the \nindustry. It would clarify regulations to prevent deceptive trade \npractices in the industry and ensure that consumers can make informed \ndecisions as they make funeral arrangements. Finally, the FTC rules \nwould be expanded to cover all segments of the death care industry.\n  I am aware that as we are in the closing days of this Congress, the \nSenate will not have the opportunity to consider this legislation this \nyear. However, I would like to take this opportunity to raise this \nissue with colleagues today in the hope that we will be able to move on \nthis issue when we reconvene for the 108th Congress. This legislation \nis bipartisan. A House companion bill is being sponsored by \nRepresentative Foley of Florida. He has been a leader in the effort to \nensure that dignity and respect prevail in all aspects of death care \nservices. I look forward to working with him and all of our colleagues \nin the 108th Congress to advance this same worthy objective.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 3169. A bill to provide for military charters between military \ninstallations and local school districts, to provide credit enhancement \ninitiatives to promote military charter school facility acquisition, \nconstruction, and renovation, and for other purposed; to the committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise to offer a bill which addresses a \ngrowing population who seek a distinct supportive voice: our military \ndependent children.\n  Education is an issue which many Senators on both sides of the aisle \nhave worked very hard to improve in every State in our union. This \nbill, however, is unique in that it strives to increase the quality of \neducation for hundreds of thousands of our children of members of the \nArmed Services by catering to their specific needs and frequent moves.\n  Let me begin by expressing my thanks to most members of this body for \nalways working diligently to introduce and pass great initiatives for \neducation. I firmly believe that we, at this juncture in our Nation's \ngreat history, have continued to bring family issues, such as education \nand the economy to the forefront of our discussion. Further, amid our \ncontinued discussion of the possibility of sending our military men and \nwomen into harm's way in Iraq, there is no better time to concentrate \non their children, children who have the added burden of worrying about \na deployed parent, or who must move to a new school many times as their \nparent or parents move to new assignments around the country.\n  This bill, I am proposing, will provide Stable Transitions I \nEducation for our Active Duty Youth. It is called the STEADY Act and is \nthe first step to a smoother educational career for military dependent \nchildren.\n  When I last spoke of this bill, I said that we in ``Congress are \nbecoming wiser and wiser on the issue of education'' by recognizing \nthat our future and our economy depend on the education of our \nchildren.\n  It truly is an issue of strengthening our Nation. We cannot have an \neconomically strong and militarily secure Nation moving in a \nprogressive way without an excellent school system. No matter where a \nchild is born, rural or urban, on the east coast or west coast, if we \ndo not do a better job as a Nation of giving our children a quality \neducation, the future of our Nation will not be as bright, and it could \nput us in jeopardy.\n  I also make the argument that for our military, the same holds true. \nit is not just about providing our military with the most extraordinary \nweapons. it is not just about training our military men and women tot \nhe highest levels. It is not just providing them the basics.\n  We have an obligation to recognize that when our men and women sign \nup to be in our military, they have willingly made sacrifices, but \ntheir families' quality of life should not be one of those sacrifices. \nWe need to provide them, between the Department of Defense and the \nDepartment of Education, a quality education for their children.\n  When we send our soldiers into battle, we want them focused on the \nbattle and mission at hand. We do not want them worried, as they \nnaturally would be, about spouses and dependents at home, about their \nhappiness, about their comfort, about their security. It makes our \nmilitary stronger when we provide good, quality-of-life initiatives for \ntheir families at home. One of the ways we can do that is by improving \nthe schools for military dependents. There are over 800,000 children \nwho are military dependents out of an overall force strength of 1.4 \nmillion adults connected to the military. Many of them are school-age \nchildren. Because of the specific demands of our military, which are \nvery unlike the civilian sector, many move every 2 years. Some military \nmembers move from the east coast to the west coast, moving families \nwith them. it is very difficult providing an excellent education \ngenerally, and yet the military has even more challenges.\n  What is the solution? I offer this bill to strengthen our military \nschools in the United States in a creative way. This bill will set up \nthe a pilot program to help create military charter schools around the \nNation in partnership with local public school systems to provide an \nopportunity not only for our military dependents, but this framework \nwill also help communities who have a large military presence. The \nbenefit overall is that the community gets a better school, a school \nthat has the opportunity to provide an excellent education, while being \nextremely flexible to accommodate the unique needs of a military \ndependent student.\n  The second benefit is that it gives children whose families might not \nhave any connection to the military, an introduction into who military \npeople and what military life can be like.\n\n  This is a partnership. It is a pilot program that will help establish \ncharter schools, will give important consideration to military children \nas they move from community to community, and will create for the first \ntime what we call an academic passport.\n  An academic passport will help to stabilize and standardize the \ncurriculum without micromanaging, without dictating what the curriculum \nshould be. It sets up a new approach or a new framework for our local \nelementary and secondary schools throughout the country to set up a \nstandardized curriculum to address the vast peaks and valleys \nencountered by military dependent students as they move from one \ndistrict to another. To illustrate: one school district might require 3 \nyears of a foreign language or 2 years of algebra or 1 year of algebra, \nor a whole different curriculum. That is part of this bill. It is \nsomething about which military families feel very strongly. I hope that \nwith this new pilot program to help create charter schools with a new \nacademic passport, we can begin to focus some of our resources, again, \nnot all within the Department of Defense; some of this is within the \njurisdiction of the Department of Education, to create something \nexciting and wonderful for these 800,000 children.\n  Madam President, 600,000 of these children are in public schools \ntoday, at\n\n[[Page S11086]]\n\ngreat stress to those public districts; 100,000 of these children are \neither in private schools or are home schooled; and only 32,000 of the \n800,000 are in Department of Defense schools. These schools are \nconcentrated in a few States. There are only 32,000 children, as I \nsaid, of 800,000 dependents in DDESS schools in New York, Kentucky, \nVirginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama.\n  As my colleagues can see, dependent children of military personnel \nare in public schools throughout the country. Sometimes they are good \npublic schools; sometimes they are not so good. We are working hard to \nmake every public school excellent, but I think we have a special \nobligation to our military families to make sure that those children, \nwith the added burdens they face, are getting an excellent education.\n  If you look at the general population, non-officers in our military, \n91.5 percent have a high school degree or GED, 91 percent. In our \ngeneral population, it is about 80 percent. This is a very upwardly \nmobile group of Americans. Theses are men and women with great \ndiscipline, great patriotism, great commitment to the Nation. \nObviously, they are serving their country, but they are committed to \ntheir families, their communities, and their education.\n  As one can see, the officers exceed the general population at large. \nAlmost 40 percent have advanced degrees; 99 percent or more have \nbachelor degrees. This is also a very upwardly mobile population. If we \ncan provide excellent schools and opportunities for the children of \nthis 91 percent, I think we will be doing a very good job in helping to \nstrengthen our military but also helping our country be a better place. \nIt is truly something on which we should focus more.\n  In conclusion, let me tell you of a school of which I am very proud. \nIt might be one of the first military charters, if not the first, in \nthe Nation. This is a school which opened in September and is an even \nlarger success than we anticipated. This is a state-of-the-art, brand \nnew charter school in Plaquemines Parish, which serves the military and \ncivilian community there. It has alleviated a huge burden on the local \nschool district, and is ready for its first expansion.\n  I think we can work all day long on pay raises, on building more \nships, on buying more tanks, and on building a stronger Air Force, but \ntruly I think focusing on educational opportunities for military \ndependent children, will help us build morale, help us improve \nretention, will help us strengthen our military in the intermediate and \nthe long term, and it is something that, with a little creativity, a \nlittle bit of thinking outside of the box, I am convinced we could \nfinance the construction of these schools through means laid out in the \nbill, and end up coming out with some excellent facilities around this \nNation to serve both our military and our nonmilitary families and do a \ngreat job for our Defense Department and a great job for our country. \nThat is what this bill would accomplish: again, it sets up a pilot \nprogram to establish military charter schools in the neediest areas of \nthe Nation. I would hope that it would be met with enthusiasm from my \ncolleagues who consistently support good education initiatives, and \nfrom all of us who know the value of military service to our great \nNation.\n  ``Every few years you make new friends, Then you're gone.

However, \n     if the statute, regulation, or other action has vested the \n     functions in the agency from which it is removed under the \n     reorganization plan, the function, insofar as it is to be \n     exercised after the plan becomes effective, shall be deemed \n     as vested in the agency under which the function is placed in \n     the plan.\n       (2) Pending legal proceedings.--A suit, action, or other \n     proceeding lawfully commenced by or against the head of an \n     agency or other officer of the United States, in the \n     officer's official capacity or in relation to the discharge \n     of the officer's official duties, does not abate by reason of \n     the taking effect of a reorganization plan under this \n     section.

The motion \n     is highly privileged and is not debatable. The motion shall \n     not be subject to amendment, or to any motion to postpone, or \n     a motion to proceed to the consideration of other business. A \n     motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed \n     to or disagreed to shall not be in order. If a motion to \n     proceed to the consideration of the resolution is agreed to, \n     the resolution shall remain the unfinished business of the \n     respective House until disposed of.\n       (2) Debate.--Debate on the resolution, and on all debatable \n     motions and appeals in connection therewith, shall be limited \n     to not more than 10 hours, which shall be divided equally \n     between individuals favoring and individuals opposing the \n     resolution. A motion further to limit debate is in order and \n     not debatable. An amendment to, or a motion to recommit the \n     resolution is not in order.

Mr. REID (for Ms. Cantwell (for herself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. \nEnzi, and Mr. Kohl)) proposed an amendment to the bill S. 1742, to \nprevent the crime of identity theft, mitigate the harm to individuals \nvictimized by identity theft, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Identity Theft Victims \n     Assistance Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the crime of identity theft is the fastest growing \n     crime in the United States;\n       (2) victims of identity theft often have extraordinary \n     difficulty restoring their credit and regaining control of \n     their identity because of the viral nature of identity theft;\n       (3) identity theft may be ruinous to the good name and \n     credit of consumers whose identities are misappropriated, and \n     victims of identity theft may be denied otherwise well-\n     deserved credit, may have to spend enormous time, effort, and \n     sums of money to remedy their circumstances, and may suffer \n     extreme emotional distress including deep depression founded \n     in profound frustration as they address the array of problems \n     that may arise as a result of identity theft;\n       (4) victims are often required to contact numerous Federal, \n     State, and local law enforcement agencies, consumer credit \n     reporting agencies, and creditors over many years, as each \n     event of fraud arises;\n       (5) the Government, business entities, and credit reporting \n     agencies have a shared responsibility to assist identity \n     theft victims, to mitigate the harm that results from fraud \n     perpetrated in the victim's name;\n       (6) victims of identity theft need a nationally \n     standardized means of--\n\n[[Page S11121]]\n\n       (A) reporting identity theft to consumer credit reporting \n     agencies and business entities; and\n       (B) evidencing their true identity and claim of identity \n     theft to consumer credit reporting agencies and business \n     entities;\n       (7) one of the greatest law enforcement challenges posed by \n     identity theft is that stolen identities are often used to \n     perpetrate crimes in many different localities in different \n     States, and although identity theft is a Federal crime, most \n     often, State and local law enforcement agencies are \n     responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crimes; and\n       (8) the Federal Government should assist State and local \n     law enforcement agencies to effectively combat identity theft \n     and the associated fraud.\n\n     SEC. 3. TREATMENT OF IDENTITY THEFT MITIGATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 47 title 18, United States Code, \n     is amended by adding after section 1028 the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 1028A.

Mr. REID (for Mr. Helms (for himself and Mr. Leahy)) \nproposed an amendment to the bill H.R. 5469, To amend title 17, United \nStates Code, with respect to the statutory license for webcasting; as \nfollows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Webcaster Settlement \n     Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Some small webcasters who did not participate in the \n     copyright arbitration royalty panel proceeding leading to the \n     July 8, 2002 order of the Librarian of Congress establishing \n     rates and terms for certain digital performances and \n     ephemeral reproductions of sound recordings, as provided in \n     part 261 of the Code of Federal Regulations (published in the \n     Federal Register on July 8, 2002) (referred to in this \n     section as ``small webcasters''), have expressed reservations \n     about the fee structure set forth in such order, and have \n     expressed their desire for a fee based on a percentage of \n     revenue.\n       (2) Congress has strongly encouraged representatives of \n     copyright owners of sound recordings and representatives of \n     the small webcasters to engage in negotiations to arrive at \n     an agreement that would include a fee based on a percentage \n     of revenue.\n       (3) The representatives have arrived at an agreement that \n     they can accept in the extraordinary and unique circumstances \n     here presented, specifically as to the small webcasters, \n     their belief in their inability to pay the fees due pursuant \n     to the July 8 order, and as to the copyright owners of sound \n     recordings and performers, the strong encouragement of \n     Congress to reach an accommodation with the small webcasters \n     on an expedited basis.\n       (4) The representatives have indicated that they do not \n     believe the agreement provides for or in any way approximates \n     fair or reasonable royalty rates and terms, or rates and \n     terms that would have been negotiated in the marketplace \n     between a willing buyer and a willing seller.\n       (5) Congress has made no determination as to whether the \n     agreement provides for or in any way approximates fair or \n     reasonable fees and terms, or rates and terms that would have \n     been negotiated in the marketplace between a willing buyer \n     and a willing seller.\n       (6) Congress likewise has made no determination as to \n     whether the July 8 order is reasonable or arbitrary, and \n     nothing in this Act shall be taken into account by the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit \n     in its review of such order.\n       (7) It is, nevertheless, in the public interest for the \n     parties to be able to enter into such an agreement without \n     fear of liability for deviating from the fees and terms of \n     the July 8 order, if it is clear that the agreement will not \n     be admissible as evidence or otherwise taken into account in \n     any government proceeding involving the setting or adjustment \n     of the royalties payable to copyright owners of sound \n     recordings for the public performance or reproduction in \n     ephemeral phonorecords or copies of such works, the \n     determination of terms or conditions related thereto, or the \n     establishment of notice or recordkeeping requirements.\n\n     SEC. 3. SUSPENSION OF CERTAIN PAYMENTS.\n\n       (a) Noncommercial Webcasters.--\n       (1) In general.--The payments to be made by noncommercial \n     webcasters for the digital performance of sound recordings \n     under section 114 of title 17, United States Code, and the \n     making of ephemeral phonorecords under section 112 of title \n     17, United States Code, during the period beginning on \n     October 28, 1998, and ending on May 31, 2003, which have not \n     already been paid, shall not be due until June 20, 2003.\n       (2) Definition.--In this subsection, the term \n     ``noncommercial webcaster'' has the meaning given that term \n     in section 114(f)(5)(E)(i) of title 17, United States Code, \n     as added by section 4 of this Act.\n       (b) Small Commercial Webcasters.--\n       (1) In general.--The receiving agent may, in a writing \n     signed by an authorized representative thereof, delay the \n     obligation of any 1 or more small commercial webcasters to \n     make payments pursuant to sections 112 and 114 of title 17, \n     United States Code, for a period determined by such entity to \n     allow negotiations as permitted in section 4 of this Act, \n     except that any such period shall end no later than December \n     15, 2002. The duration and terms of any such delay shall be \n     as set forth in such writing.\n       (2) Definitions.--In this subsection--\n       (A) the term ``webcaster'' has the meaning given that term \n     in section 114(f)(5)(E)(iii) of title 17, United States Code, \n     as added by section 4 of this Act; and\n       (B) the term ``receiving agent'' shall have the meaning \n     given that term in section 261.2 of title 37, Code of Federal \n     Regulations, as published in the Federal Register on July 8, \n     2002.\n\n     SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION FOR SETTLEMENTS.\n\n       Section 114(f) of title 17, United States Code, is amended \n     by adding after paragraph (4) the following:\n       ``(5)(A) Notwithstanding section 112(e) and the other \n     provisions of this subsection, the receiving agent may enter \n     into agreements for the reproduction and performance of sound \n     recordings under section 112(e) and this section by any 1 or \n     more small commercial webcasters or noncommercial webcasters \n     during the period beginning on October 28, 1998, and ending \n     on December 31, 2004, that, once published in the Federal \n     Register pursuant to subparagraph (B), shall be binding on \n     all copyright owners of sound recordings and other persons \n     entitled to payment under this section, in lieu of any \n     determination by a copyright arbitration royalty panel or \n     decision by the Librarian of Congress. Any such agreement for \n     small commercial webcasters shall include provisions for \n     payment of royalties on the basis of a percentage of revenue \n     or expenses, or both, and include a minimum fee. Any such \n     agreement may include other terms and conditions, including \n     requirements by which copyright owners may receive notice of \n     the use of their sound recordings and under which records of \n     such use shall be kept and made available by small commercial \n     webcasters or noncommercial webcasters. The receiving agent \n     shall be under no obligation to negotiate any such agreement. \n     The receiving agent shall have no obligation to any copyright \n     owner of sound recordings or any other person entitled to \n     payment under this section in negotiating any such agreement, \n     and no liability to any copyright owner of sound recordings \n     or any other person entitled to payment under this section \n     for having entered into such agreement.\n       ``(B) The Copyright Office shall cause to be published in \n     the Federal Register any agreement entered into pursuant to \n     subparagraph (A). Such publication shall include a statement \n     containing the substance of subparagraph (C). Such agreements \n     shall not be included in the Code of Federal Regulations. \n     Thereafter, the terms of such agreement shall be available, \n     as an option, to any small commercial webcaster or \n     noncommercial webcaster meeting the eligibility conditions of \n     such agreement.\n       ``(C) Neither subparagraph (A) nor any provisions of any \n     agreement entered into pursuant to subparagraph (A), \n     including any rate structure, fees, terms, conditions, or \n     notice and recordkeeping requirements set forth therein, \n     shall be admissible as evidence or otherwise taken into \n     account in any administrative, judicial, or other government \n     proceeding involving the setting or adjustment of the \n     royalties payable for the public performance or reproduction \n     in ephemeral phonorecords or copies of sound recordings, the \n     determination of terms or conditions related thereto, or the \n     establishment of notice or recordkeeping requirements by the \n     Librarian of Congress under paragraph (4) or section \n     112(e)(4). It is the intent of Congress that any royalty \n     rates, rate structure, definitions, terms, conditions, or \n     notice and recordkeeping requirements, included in such \n     agreements shall be considered as a compromise motivated by \n     the unique business, economic and political circumstances of \n     small webcasters, copyright owners, and performers rather \n     than as matters that would have been negotiated in the \n     marketplace between a willing buyer and a willing seller, or \n     otherwise meet the objectives set forth in section 801(b).\n       ``(D) Nothing in the Small Webcaster Settlement Act of 2002 \n     or any agreement entered into pursuant to subparagraph (A) \n     shall be taken into account by the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in its review of \n     the determination by the Librarian of Congress of July 8, \n     2002, of rates and terms for the digital performance of sound \n     recordings and ephemeral recordings, pursuant to sections 112 \n     and 114.\n       ``(E) As used in this paragraph--\n       ``(i) the term `noncommercial webcaster' means a webcaster \n     that--\n       ``(I) is exempt from taxation under section 501 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 501);\n       ``(II) has applied in good faith to the Internal Revenue \n     Service for exemption from taxation under section 501 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code and has a commercially reasonable \n     expectation that such exemption shall be granted; or\n       ``(III) is operated by a State or possession or any \n     governmental entity or subordinate thereof, or by the United \n     States or District of Columbia, for exclusively public \n     purposes;\n       ``(ii) the term `receiving agent' shall have the meaning \n     given that term in section 261.2 of title 37, Code of Federal \n     Regulations, as published in the Federal Register on July 8, \n     2002; and\n       ``(iii) the term `webcaster' means a person or entity that \n     has obtained a compulsory license under section 112 or 114 \n     and the implementing regulations therefor to make eligible \n     nonsubscription transmissions and ephemeral recordings.\n\n[[Page S11124]]\n\n       ``(F) The authority to make settlements pursuant to \n     subparagraph (A) shall expire December 15, 2002, except with \n     respect to noncommercial webcasters for whom the authority \n     shall expire May 31, 2003.''.\n\n     SEC. 5.

and\n       (4) in light of the special circumstances described in this \n     subsection, the uncertainty created by the regulations issued \n     by the Librarian of Congress, and the fact that all of the \n     interested parties have reached agreement, the voluntarily \n     negotiated arrangements agreed to among the parties are being \n     codified.\n       (b) Deductibility.--Section 114(g) of title 17, United \n     States Code, is amended by adding after paragraph (2) the \n     following:\n       ``(3) A nonprofit agent designated to distribute receipts \n     from the licensing of transmissions in accordance with \n     subsection (f) may deduct from any of its receipts, prior to \n     the distribution of such receipts to any person or entity \n     entitled thereto other than copyright owners and performers \n     who have elected to receive royalties from another designated \n     agent and have notified such nonprofit agent in writing of \n     such election, the reasonable costs of such agent incurred \n     after November 1, 1995, in--\n       ``(A) the administration of the collection, distribution, \n     and calculation of the royalties;\n       ``(B) the settlement of disputes relating to the collection \n     and calculation of the royalties;

PROMOTING SECURE DELIVERY OF HUMANITARIAN AND OTHER \n                   ASSISTANCE IN AFGHANISTAN AND EXPANSION OF THE \n                   INTERNATIONAL SECURITY ASSISTANCE FORCE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The President has declared his view that the United \n     States should provide significant assistance to Afghanistan \n     so that it is no longer a haven for terrorism.\n       (2) The delivery of humanitarian and reconstruction \n     assistance from the international community is necessary for \n     the safe return of refugees and is critical to the future \n     stability of Afghanistan.\n       (3) Enhanced stability in Afghanistan through an improved \n     security environment is critical to the functioning of the \n     Government of Afghanistan and the traditional Afghan assembly \n     or ``Loya Jirga'' process, which is intended to lead to a \n     permanent national government in Afghanistan, and also is \n     essential for the participation of women in Afghan society.\n       (4) Incidents of violence between armed factions and local \n     and regional commanders, and serious abuses of human rights, \n     including attacks on women and ethnic minorities throughout \n     Afghanistan, create an insecure, volatile, and unsafe \n     environment in parts of Afghanistan, displacing thousands of \n     Afghan civilians from their local communities.\n       (5)(A) On July 6, Vice President Haji Abdul Qadir was \n     assassinated in Kabul by unknown assailants.\n       (B) On September 5, 2002, a car bomb exploded in Kabul \n     killing 32 and injuring 150 and on the same day a member of \n     Kandahar Governor Sherzai's security team attempted to \n     assassinate President Karzai.\n       (6) The violence and lawlessness may jeopardize the ``Loya \n     Jirga'' process, undermine efforts to build a strong central \n     government, severely impede reconstruction and the delivery \n     of humanitarian assistance, and increase the likelihood that \n     parts of Afghanistan will once again become safe havens for \n     al-Qaida, Taliban forces, and drug traffickers.\n       (7) The lack of security and lawlessness may also \n     perpetuate the need for United States Armed Forces in \n     Afghanistan and threaten the ability of the United States to \n     meet its military objectives.\n       (8) The International Security Assistance Force in \n     Afghanistan, currently led by Turkey, and composed of forces \n     from other willing countries without the participation of \n     United States Armed Forces, is deployed only in Kabul and \n     currently does not have the mandate or the capacity to \n     provide security to other parts of Afghanistan.\n       (9) Due to the ongoing military campaign in Afghanistan, \n     the United States does not contribute troops to the \n     International Security Assistance Force but has provided \n     support to other countries that are doing so.\n       (10) The United States is providing political, financial, \n     training, and other assistance to the Afghan Interim \n     Authority as it begins to build a national army and police \n     force to help provide security throughout Afghanistan, but \n     this effort is not meeting the immediate security needs of \n     Afghanistan.\n       (11) Because of these immediate security needs, the \n     Government of Afghanistan, its President, Hamid Karzai, and \n     many Afghan regional leaders have called for the \n     International Security Assistance Force, which has \n     successfully brought stability to Kabul, to be expanded and \n     deployed throughout the country, and this request has been \n     strongly supported by a wide range of international \n     humanitarian organizations, including the International \n     Committee of the Red Cross, Catholic Relief Services, and \n     Refugees International.\n       (b) Statement of Policy.--It should be the policy of the \n     United States to support measures to help meet the immediate \n     security needs of Afghanistan in order to promote safe and \n     effective delivery of humanitarian and other assistance \n     throughout Afghanistan, further the rule of law and civil \n     order, and support the formation of a functioning, \n     representative Afghan national government.\n       (c) Implementation of Strategy.--\n       (1) Initial report.--Not later than 60 days after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act, the President shall provide the \n     Committee on International Relations and the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the Senate with--\n       (A) a strategy for meeting the immediate and long-term \n     security needs of Afghanistan in order to promote safe and \n     effective delivery of humanitarian and other assistance \n     throughout Afghanistan, further the rule of law and civil \n     order, and support the formation of a functioning, \n     representative Afghan national government, including an \n     update to the strategies submitted pursuant to Public Law \n     107-206; and\n       (B) a description of the progress of the Government of \n     Afghanistan toward the eradication of poppy cultivation, the \n     disruption of heroin production, and the reduction of the \n     overall supply and demand for illicit narcotics in \n     Afghanistan in accordance with the provisions of this Act.\n       (2) Implementation of strategy.--Every 6 months after the \n     enactment of this Act through January 1, 2007, the President \n     shall submit to the congressional committees specified in \n     paragraph (1) a report on the implementation of the \n     strategies for meeting the immediate and long-term security \n     needs of Afghanistan, which shall include the following \n     elements--\n       (A) since the previous report, the progress in recruiting, \n     training, and deploying an Afghan National Army and police \n     force, including the numbers and ethnic composition of \n     recruits; the number of graduates from military and police \n     training; the numbers of graduates retained by the Afghan \n     National Army and police forces since the previous report; \n     the numbers of graduates operationally deployed and to which \n     areas of the country; the degree to which these graduates are \n     assuming security responsibilities; whether Afghan army and \n     police units are establishing effective central governmental \n     authority over areas of the country, and which areas; and the \n     numbers of instances of armed attacks against Afghan central \n     governmental officials, United States or international \n     officials, troops or aid workers, or between the armed forces \n     of regional leaders;\n       (B) the degree to which armed regional leaders are \n     cooperating and integrating with the central government, \n     providing security and order within their regions of \n     influence, engaging in armed conflict or other forms of \n     competition that are deleterious to peace, security, and the \n     integration of a unified Afghanistan under the central \n     government;\n       (C) the amount of humanitarian relief provided since the \n     previous report to returnees, isolated populations and other \n     vulnerable groups, as well as demining assistance and \n     landmine survivors rehabilitation; and the numbers of such \n     persons not assisted since the previous report;\n       (D) the steps taken since the previous report toward \n     national reconstruction, including establishment of the \n     ministries and other institutions of the Government of \n     Afghanistan;\n       (E) the numbers of Civil Affairs Teams working with \n     regional leaders, as well as the quick impact infrastructure \n     projects undertaken by such teams since the previous report;\n       (F) efforts undertaken since the previous report to rebuild \n     the justice sector, including the establishment of a \n     functioning judiciary, a competent bar, reintegration of \n     women legal professionals and a reliable penal system, and \n     the respect for human rights; and\n       (G) a description of the progress of the Government of \n     Afghanistan with respect to the matters described in \n     paragraph (1)(B).\n       (d) Expansion of the International Security Assistance \n     Force.--\n       (1) Sense of congress.--Congress urges the President, in \n     order to fulfill the objective of establishing security in \n     Afghanistan, to take all appropriate measures to assist \n     Afghanistan establish a secure environment throughout the \n     country, including by--\n       (A) sponsoring in the United Nations Security Council a \n     resolution authorizing an expansion of the International \n     Security Assistance Force, or the establishment of a similar \n     security force; and\n       (B) enlisting the European and other allies of the United \n     States to provide forces for an expansion of the \n     International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, or \n     the establishment of a similar security force.\n       (2) Authorization of appropriations.--(A) There is \n     authorized to be appropriated to the President $500,000,000 \n     for each of fiscal years 2003 and 2004 to support the \n     International Security Assistance Force or the establishment \n     of a similar security force.\n       (B) Amounts made available under subparagraph (A) may be \n     appropriated

Funds appropriated pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall \n     be subject to the notification requirements under section \n     634A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.\n       On page 63, line 24, insert ``and the Committee on \n     Appropriations'' after ``Relations''.\n       On page 63, line 25, insert ``and the Committee on \n     Appropriations'' after ``Relations''.\n       On page 69, line 5, strike ``any other provision of law'' \n     and insert ``section 512 of Public Law 107-115 or any similar \n     provision of law''.\n       Beginning on page 69, strike line 6 and all that

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nto the consideration of H.R. 5469.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5469) to amend title 17, United States Code, \n     with respect to the statutory license for webcasting.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am pleased that the Senate is taking \nthe important step of passing H.R. 5469, the ``Small Webcaster \nAmendments Act of 2002.'' This legislation reflects hard choices made \nin hard negotiations under hard circumstances. I commend House \nJudiciary Chairman Sensenbrenner and Representative Conyers for \nbringing this legislation to a successful conclusion and passage in the \nHouse of Representatives in a timely fashion to make a difference in \nthe prospects of many small webcasters.\n  The Internet is an American invention that has become the emblem of \nthe Information Age and an engine for bringing American content into \nhomes and businesses around the globe. I have long been an enthusiast \nand champion of the Internet and of the creative spirits who are the \nsource of the music, films, books, news, and entertainment content that \nenrich our lives, energize our economy and influence our culture. As a \ncitizen, I am impressed by the innovation of new online entrepreneurs, \nand as a Senator, I want to do everything possible to promote the full \nrealization of the Internet's potential. A flourishing Internet with \nclear, fair and enforceable rules governing how content may be used \nwill benefit all of us, including the entrepreneurs who want us to \nbecome new customers and the artists who create the content we value.\n  The advent of webcasting--streaming music online rather than \nbroadcasting it over the air as traditional radio stations do--has \nmarked one of the more exciting and quickly growing of the new \nindustries that have sprung up on the Web. Many of the new webcasters, \nunconstrained by the technological limitations of traditional radio \ntransmission, can and do serve listeners across the country and around \nthe world. They provide music in specialized niches not available over \nthe air. They feature new and fringe artists who do not enjoy the few \nspots in the Top 40. And they can bring music of all types to listeners \nwho, for whatever reason, are not being catered to by traditional \nbroadcasters.\n  We have been mindful on this Committee that as the Internet is a boon \nto consumers, we must not neglect the artists who create and the \nbusinesses which produce the digital works that make the online world \nso fascinating and worth visiting. With each legislative effort to \nprovide clear, fair and enforceable intellectual property rules for the \nInternet, a fundamental principle to which we have adhered is that \nartists and producers of digital works merit compensation for the value \nderived from the use of their work.\n  In 1995, we enacted the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings \nAct, which created an intellectual property right in digital sound \nrecordings, giving copyright owners the right to receive royalties when \ntheir copyrighted sound recordings were digitally transmitted by \nothers. Therefore when their copyrighted sound recordings are digitally \ntransmitted, royalties are due. In the 1998 Digital Millennium \nCopyright Act, DMCA, we made clear that this law applied to webcasters \nand that they would have to pay these royalties. At the same time, we \ncreated a compulsory license so that webcasters could be sure of the \nuse of these digital works. We directed that the appropriate royalty \nrate could be negotiated by the parties or determined by a Copyright \nArbitration Royalty Panel--or CARP--at the Library of Congress.\n  Despite some privately negotiated agreements, no industry-wide \nagreement on royalty rates was reached and therefore a CARP proceeding \nwas instituted that concluded on February 20, 2002. The CARP decision \nset the royalty rate to be paid by commercial webcasters, no matter \ntheir size, at .14 cents per song per listener, with royalty payments \nretroactive to October 1998, when the DMCA was passed.\n  At a Judiciary Committee hearing I convened on this issue on May 15, \n2002, nobody seemed happy with the outcome of the arbitration and, in \nfact, all the parties appealed. The recording industry and artist \nrepresentatives feel that the royalty rate--which was based on the \nnumber of performances and listeners, rather than on a percentage-of-\nrevenue model--was too low to adequately compensate the creative \nefforts of the artists and the financial investments of the labels. \nMany webcasters declared that the per-performance approach, and the \nrate attached to it, would bankrupt small operations and drain the \nlarge ones. I said then that such an outcome would be highly \nunfortunate not only for the webcasters but also for the artists, the \nlabels and the consumers, who all would lose important legitimate \nchannels to connect music and music lovers online.\n  On appeal, the Librarian in June, 2002, cut the rate in half, to .07 \ncents per song per listener for commercial webcasters. Nevertheless, \nmany webcasters, who had been operating during the four-year period \nbetween 1998 and 2002, were taken by surprise at the amount of their \nroyalty liability. The retroactive fees were to be paid in full by \nOctober 20th and would have resulted in many small webcasters in \nparticular, going out of business.\n  In order to avoid many webcasting streams going silent on October 20, \nwhen retroactive royalty payments are due, I urged all sides to avoid \nmore expense and time and reach a negotiated\n\n[[Page S11139]]\n\noutcome more satisfactory to all participants than the Librarian's \ndecision. I also monitored closely the progress of negotiations between \nthe RIAA and webcasters. On July 31, I sent a letter with Senator Hatch \nto Sound Exchange, which was created by the RIAA to act as the agent \nfor copyright holders in negotiating the voluntary licenses with \nwebcasters under the DMCA and to serve as the receiving agent for \nroyalties under the CARP process. The letter posed questions on the \nstatus of the reported on-going negotiations between RIAA/Sound \nExchange and the smaller webcasters, the terms being proposed and \nconsidered, and how likely the outcome of those negotiations would be \nto produce viable deals for smaller webcasters, while still satisfying \nthe copyright community.\n  Reports on the progress of these negotiations were disappointing, \nwhich makes this legislation all the more important. As a general \nprinciple, marketplace negotiations are the appropriate mechanism for \ndetermining the allocation of compensation among interested parties \nunder copyright law. Yet, we have made exceptions to this general \nprinciple, as reflected in this legislation and the very compulsory \nlicense provisions it amends.\n  The legislation reflects a compromise for all the parties directly \naffected by this legislation--small webcasters that could not survive \nwith the rates set by the Librarian and copyright owners and performers \nwho under this bill will give certain eligible webcasters an \nalternative royalty payment scheme. This legislation does not represent \na complete victory for any of these stakeholders. Artists and music \nlabels may believe that they are forgoing significant royalties under \nthis legislation and I appreciate that they are those in the webcasting \nbusiness, who are either not covered or not sufficiently helped by the \nbill, who believe that this legislation should do more. As one analyst \nat the Radio and Internet Newsletter stated, in the October 11, 2002 \nissue, ``Clearly, the `Small Webcaster Amendments Act of 2002' (a/k/a \nH.R. 5469) is an imperfect bill that doesn't fix everything for \neverybody . . . Still, overall, does it do more good than harm for more \npeople? My belief is that many are helped one way or the other and \nvirtually no one is assured of being hurt. Thus, the answer, on the \nwhole, would be yes.''\n\n  I know that most webcasters share my belief that artists and labels \nshould be fairly compensated for use of their creative works. This \nlegislation provides both compensation to the copyright owners and \nhelps to support the webcasting industry by offering more variable \npayment options to small webcasters than the one-size-fits all per \nperformance rate set out in the original CARP and Librarian decisions. \nThe rates, terms and record-keeping provisions are applicable only to \nthe parties that qualify for and elect to be governed by this \nalternative royalty structure and no broad principles should be \nextrapolated from the rates, terms and record-keeping provisions \ncontained in the bill. The Copyright Office is presently engaged in a \nrule-making on record-keeping and this bill does not supplant that \nongoing process.\n  This legislation does three things to help small webcasters pay \nroyalties and stay in business. As one Vermont webcaster told me, \n``Although the percentage of revenue is too high, at least we have the \noption. A percentage of revenue deal will enable [us] to stay in \nbusiness moving forward, grow our audience, and compete.''\n  First, the Librarian royalty rate is based on a per performance \nformula, which has the unfortunate effect of requiring webcasters to \npay high fees for their use of music, even before the audience of the \nwebcaster has grown to a sufficient size to attract any appreciable \nadvertising revenues. Without any percentage of revenue option (as \nprovided by the legislation), the webcasting industry would be closed \nto all but those with the substantial resources necessary to subsidize \nthe business until the advertising revenue caught up to the per \nperformance royalty rate. The bill provides a percentage of revenue \noption for small businesses with less than $500,000 in gross revenue in \n2003 and $1.25 million dollars in 2004. The bill also provides for \nminimum fees and a percentage of expenses floor on the royalties, to \nassure that copyright owners and artists receive some payment for \nperformance of their music.\n  Second, for noncommercial webcasters, such as college webcasters, the \nbill corrects an anomaly in the Librarian's decision. Under that \ndecision, nonprofit entities held FCC licenses were given a lower per \nperformance rate than were commercial entities. However, the decision \nmade no such provision for noncommercial entities that were not FCC \nlicenses. The bill extends the lower rate to all nonprofit entities.\n  Finally, the bill reduces the retroactive burden on many of the small \ncommercial webcasters by allowing them to make their payments based on \na percentage of revenue or percentage of expense, but also allows both \nsmall commercial and noncommercial webcasters to pay these retroactive \nfees in three payments over the span of a year.\n  To accommodate the concerns of artists and the RIAA, the bill \nprovides for the reporting of information about which songs were played \nby the small commercial webcasters. This information will be used to \naccount properly for the distribution of the royalties to the copyright \nholders and the artists.\n  A number of concerns have been raised that the rate, terms and \nrecord-keeping provisions in the bill do not constitute evidence of any \nrates, rate structure fees, definitions, conditions or terms that would \nhave been negotiated in the marketplace between a willing buyer and \nwilling seller. This concern stems from the DMCA's statutory license \nfee standard directing the CARP to establish rates and terms ``that \nmost clearly represent the rates and terms that would have been \nnegotiated in the marketplace between a willing buyer and a willing \nseller,'' rather than a determination of ``reasonable copyright royalty \nrates'' according to a set of balancing factors. This new webcasting \nstandard may be having the unfortunate and unintended result that \nwebcasters and copyright owners are concerned that the rates and terms \nof any voluntary licensing agreements will be applied industry-wide. \nThe new webcasting standard appears to be making all sides cautious and \nreluctant to enter into, rather than facilitating, voluntary licensing \nagreements.\n  Passage of this legislation does not mean that our work is done. As \nthis webcasting issue has unfolded, I have heard complaints from all \nsides about the fairness and completeness of procedures employed in the \narbitration. Indeed, the concerns of many small webcasters were never \nheard, since the cost of participating in the proceedings was \nprohibitively expensive and their ability to participate for free was \nbarred by procedural rules. One thing is clear: Compulsory licenses are \nno panacea and their implementation may only invite more congressional \nintervention. To avoid repeated requests for the Congress or the courts \nto intercede, we must make sure the procedures and standards used to \nestablish the royalty rates for the webcasting and other compulsory \nlicenses produce fair, workable results. Next year, we should focus \nattention on reforming the CARP process.\n  Mr. REID.

The magnitude of the \n     devastation--natural and man-made--to institutions and \n     infrastructure make it imperative that there be close \n     coordination and collaboration among donors. The United \n     States should endeavor to assert its leadership to have the \n     efforts of international donors help achieve the purposes \n     established by this title.\n\n     [SEC. 104.

PROMOTING SECURE DELIVERY OF HUMANITARIAN AND \n                   OTHER ASSISTANCE IN AFGHANISTAN.\n\n       [(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       [(1) The President has declared his view that the United \n     States should provide significant assistance to Afghanistan \n     so that it never again becomes a haven for terrorism.\n       [(2) The delivery of humanitarian and reconstruction \n     assistance from the international community is necessary for \n     the safe return of refugees and is critical to the future \n     stability of Afghanistan.\n       [(3) Enhanced stability in Afghanistan through an improved \n     security environment is critical to the fostering of the \n     Afghan Interim Authority and the traditional Afghan assembly \n     or ``Loya Jirga'' process, which is intended to lead to a \n     permanent national government in Afghanistan, and also is \n     essential for the participation of women in Afghan society.\n       [(4) Incidents of violence between armed factions and local \n     and regional commanders, and serious abuses of human rights, \n     including attacks on women and ethnic minorities \n     throughout Afghanistan, create an insecure, volatile, and \n     unsafe environment in parts of Afghanistan, displacing \n     thousands of Afghan civilians from their local \n     communities.\n       [(5) The violence and lawlessness may jeopardize the ``Loya \n     Jirga'' process, undermine efforts to build a strong central \n     government, severely impede reconstruction and the delivery \n     of humanitarian assistance, and increase the likelihood that \n     parts of Afghanistan will once again become safe havens for \n     al-Qaida, Taliban forces, and drug traffickers.\n       [(6) The lack of security and lawlessness may also \n     perpetuate the need for United States Armed Forces in \n     Afghanistan and threaten the ability of the United States to \n     meet its military objectives.\n       [(7) The International Security Assistance Force in \n     Afghanistan, currently led by Turkey, and composed of forces \n     from other willing countries without the participation of \n     United States Armed Forces, is deployed only in Kabul and \n     currently does not have the mandate or the capacity to \n     provide security to other parts of Afghanistan.\n       [(8) Due to the ongoing military campaign in Afghanistan, \n     the United States does not contribute troops to the \n     International Security Assistance Force but has provided \n     support to other countries that are doing so.\n       [(9) The United States is providing political, financial, \n     training, and other assistance to the Afghan Interim \n     Authority as it begins to build a national army and police \n     force to help provide security throughout Afghanistan, but \n     this effort is not meeting the immediate security needs of \n     Afghanistan.\n       [(10) Because of these immediate security needs, the Afghan \n     Interim Authority, its Chairman, Hamid Karzai, and many \n     Afghan regional leaders have called for the International \n     Security Assistance Force, which has successfully brought \n     stability to Kabul, to be expanded and deployed throughout \n     the country, and this request has been strongly supported by \n     a wide range of international humanitarian organizations, \n     including the International Committee of the Red Cross, \n     Catholic Relief Services, and Refugees International.\n       [(11)(A) On January 29, 2002, the President stated that \n     ``[w]e will help the new Afghan government provide the \n     security that is the foundation of peace''.\n       [(B) On March 25, 2002, the Secretary of Defense stated, \n     with respect to the reconstruction of Afghanistan, that ``the \n     first thing . . . you need for anything else to happen, for \n     hospitals to happen, for roads to happen, for refugees to \n     come back, for people to be fed and humanitarian workers to \n     move on the country . . .

DECLARATION OF POLICY.\n\n       Congress makes the following declarations:\n       (1) The United States and the international community \n     should support efforts that advance the development of \n     democratic civil authorities and institutions in Afghanistan \n     and the establishment of a new broad-based, multi-ethnic, \n     gender-sensitive, and fully representative government in \n     Afghanistan.\n       (2) The United States, in particular, should provide its \n     expertise to meet immediate humanitarian and refugee needs, \n     fight the production and flow of illicit narcotics, and aid \n     in the reconstruction of Afghanistan.\n       (3) By promoting peace and security in Afghanistan and \n     preventing a return to conflict, the United States and the \n     international community can help ensure that Afghanistan does \n     not again become a source for international terrorism.\n       (4) The United States should support the objectives agreed \n     to on December 5, 2001, in Bonn, Germany, regarding the \n     provisional arrangement for Afghanistan as it moves toward \n     the establishment of permanent institutions and, in \n     particular, should work intensively toward ensuring the \n     future neutrality of Afghanistan, establishing the principle \n     that neighboring countries and other countries in the region \n     do not threaten or interfere in one another's sovereignty, \n     territorial integrity, or political independence, including \n     supporting diplomatic initiatives to support this goal.\n       (5) The special emergency situation in Afghanistan, which \n     from the perspective of the\n\n[[Page S11144]]\n\n     American people combines security, humanitarian, political, \n     law enforcement, and development imperatives, requires that \n     the President should receive maximum flexibility in \n     designing, coordinating, and administering efforts with \n     respect to assistance for Afghanistan and that a temporary \n     special program of such assistance should be established for \n     this purpose.\n       (6) To foster stability and democratization and to \n     effectively eliminate the causes of terrorism, the United \n     States and the international community should also support \n     efforts that advance the development of democratic civil \n     authorities and institutions in the broader Central Asia \n     region.\n\n     SEC. 102. PURPOSES OF ASSISTANCE.\n\n       The purposes of assistance authorized by this title are--\n       (1) to help assure the security of the United States and \n     the world by reducing or eliminating the likelihood of \n     violence against United States or allied forces in \n     Afghanistan and to reduce the chance that Afghanistan will \n     again be a source of international terrorism;\n       (2) to support the continued efforts of the United States \n     and the international community to address the humanitarian \n     crisis in Afghanistan and among Afghan refugees in \n     neighboring countries;\n       (3) to fight the production and flow of illicit narcotics, \n     to control the flow of precursor chemicals used in the \n     production of heroin, and to enhance and bolster the \n     capacities of Afghan governmental authorities to control \n     poppy cultivation and related activities;\n       (4) to help achieve a broad-based, multi-ethnic, gender-\n     sensitive, and fully representative government in Afghanistan \n     that is freely chosen by the people of Afghanistan and that \n     respects the human rights of all Afghans, particularly women, \n     including authorizing assistance for the rehabilitation and \n     reconstruction of Afghanistan with a particular emphasis on \n     meeting the educational, health, and sustenance needs of \n     women and children to better enable their full participation \n     in Afghan society;\n       (5) to support the Government of Afghanistan in its \n     development of the capacity to facilitate, organize, develop, \n     and implement projects and activities that meet the needs of \n     the Afghan people;\n       (6) to foster the participation of civil society in the \n     establishment of the new Afghan government in order to \n     achieve a broad-based, multiethnic, gender-sensitive, fully \n     representative government freely chosen by the Afghan people, \n     without prejudice to any decisions which may be freely taken \n     by the Afghan people about the precise form in which their \n     government is to be organized in the future;\n       (7) to support the reconstruction of Afghanistan through, \n     among other things, programs that create jobs, facilitate \n     clearance of landmines, and rebuild the agriculture sector, \n     the health care system, and the educational system of \n     Afghanistan; and\n       (8) to provide resources to the Ministry for Women's \n     Affairs of Afghanistan to carry out its responsibilities for \n     legal advocacy, education, vocational training, and women's \n     health programs.\n\n     SEC. 103. PRINCIPLES OF ASSISTANCE.\n\n       The following principles should guide the provision of \n     assistance authorized by this title:\n       (1) Terrorism and narcotics control.--Assistance should be \n     designed to reduce the likelihood of harm to United States \n     and other allied forces in Afghanistan and the region, the \n     likelihood of additional acts of international terrorism \n     emanating from Afghanistan, and the cultivation, production, \n     trafficking, and use of illicit narcotics in Afghanistan.\n       (2) Role of women.--Assistance should increase the \n     participation of women at the national, regional, and local \n     levels in Afghanistan, wherever feasible, by enhancing the \n     role of women in decisionmaking processes, as well as by \n     providing support for programs that aim to expand economic \n     and educational opportunities and health programs for women \n     and educational and health programs for girls.\n       (3) Afghan ownership.--Assistance should build upon Afghan \n     traditions and practices. The strong tradition of community \n     responsibility and self-reliance in Afghanistan should be \n     built upon to increase the capacity of the Afghan people and \n     institutions to participate in the reconstruction of \n     Afghanistan.\n       (4) Stability.--Assistance should encourage the restoration \n     of security in Afghanistan, including, among other things, \n     the disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of \n     combatants, and the establishment of the rule of law, \n     including the establishment of a police force and an \n     effective, independent judiciary.\n       (5) Coordination.--Assistance should be part of a larger \n     donor effort for Afghanistan. The magnitude of the \n     devastation--natural and man-made--to institutions and \n     infrastructure make it imperative that there be close \n     coordination and collaboration among donors. The United \n     States should endeavor to assert its leadership to have the \n     efforts of international donors help achieve the purposes \n     established by this title.\n\n     SEC. 104.

PROMOTING SECURE DELIVERY OF HUMANITARIAN AND OTHER \n                   ASSISTANCE IN AFGHANISTAN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The President has declared his view that the United \n     States should provide significant assistance to Afghanistan \n     so that it never again becomes a haven for terrorism.\n       (2) The delivery of humanitarian and reconstruction \n     assistance from the international community is necessary for \n     the safe return of refugees and is critical to the future \n     stability of Afghanistan.\n       (3) Enhanced stability in Afghanistan through an improved \n     security environment is critical to the fostering of the \n     Afghan Interim Authority and the traditional Afghan assembly \n     or ``Loya Jirga'' process, which is intended to lead to a \n     permanent national government in Afghanistan, and also is \n     essential for the participation of women in Afghan society.\n       (4) Incidents of violence between armed factions and local \n     and regional commanders, and serious abuses of human rights, \n     including attacks on women and ethnic minorities throughout \n     Afghanistan, create an insecure, volatile, and unsafe \n     environment in parts of Afghanistan, displacing thousands of \n     Afghan civilians from their local communities.\n       (5) The violence and lawlessness may jeopardize the ``Loya \n     Jirga'' process, undermine efforts to build a strong central \n     government, severely impede reconstruction and the delivery \n     of humanitarian assistance, and increase the likelihood that \n     parts of Afghanistan will once again become safe havens for \n     al-Qaida, Taliban forces, and drug traffickers.\n       (6) The lack of security and lawlessness may also \n     perpetuate the need for United States Armed Forces in \n     Afghanistan and threaten the ability of the United States to \n     meet its military objectives.\n       (7) The International Security Assistance Force in \n     Afghanistan, currently led by Turkey, and composed of forces \n     from other willing countries without the participation of \n     United States Armed Forces, is deployed only in Kabul and \n     currently does not have the mandate or the capacity to \n     provide security to other parts of Afghanistan.\n       (8) Due to the ongoing military campaign in Afghanistan, \n     the United States does not contribute troops to the \n     International Security Assistance Force but has provided \n     support to other countries that are doing so.\n       (9) The United States is providing political, financial, \n     training, and other assistance to the Afghan Interim \n     Authority as it begins to build a national army and police \n     force to help provide security throughout Afghanistan, but \n     this effort is not meeting the immediate security needs of \n     Afghanistan.\n       (10) Because of these immediate security needs, the Afghan \n     Interim Authority, its Chairman, Hamid Karzai, and many \n     Afghan regional leaders have called for the International \n     Security Assistance Force, which has successfully brought \n     stability to Kabul, to be expanded and deployed throughout \n     the country, and this request has been strongly supported by \n     a wide range of international humanitarian organizations, \n     including the International Committee of the Red Cross, \n     Catholic Relief Services, and Refugees International.\n       (11)(A) On January 29, 2002, the President stated that \n     ``[w]e will help the new Afghan government provide the \n     security that is the foundation of peace''.\n       (B) On March 25, 2002, the Secretary of Defense stated, \n     with respect to the reconstruction of Afghanistan, that ``the \n     first thing . . . you need for anything else to happen, for \n     hospitals to happen, for roads to happen, for refugees to \n     come back, for people to be fed and humanitarian workers to \n     move on the\n     country . . . [y]ou've got to have security''.\n       (b) Statement of Policy.--It should be the policy of the \n     United States to support measures to help meet the immediate \n     security needs of Afghanistan in order to promote safe and \n     effective delivery of humanitarian and other assistance \n     throughout Afghanistan, further the rule of law and civil \n     order, and support the formation of a functioning, \n     representative Afghan national government.\n       (c) Preparation of Strategy.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 45 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, and every\n\n[[Page S11147]]\n\n     six months thereafter through January 1, 2006, the President \n     shall provide the Committee on International Relations and \n     the Committee on Appropriations of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations and \n     the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate with--\n       (A) a strategy for meeting the immediate and long-term \n     security needs of Afghanistan in order to promote safe and \n     effective delivery of humanitarian and other assistance \n     throughout Afghanistan, further the rule of law and civil \n     order, and support the formation of a functioning, \n     representative Afghan national government; and\n       (B) a description of the progress of the Government of \n     Afghanistan toward the eradication of poppy cultivation, the \n     disruption of heroin production, and the reduction of the \n     overall supply and demand for illicit narcotics in \n     Afghanistan in accordance with the provisions of this Act.\n       (2) Form of information.--The initial provision of \n     information under paragraph (1) shall be made by transmittal \n     of a written report. Thereafter, the information required \n     under paragraph (1) may be provided in a written report or in \n     an oral briefing.\n\n     SEC. 207. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER AUTHORITY.\n\n       (a) Additional Authority.--The authority to provide \n     assistance under this title is in addition to any other \n     authority to provide assistance to the Government of \n     Afghanistan.\n       (b) Laws Restricting Authority.--Assistance under this \n     title to the Government of Afghanistan may be provided \n     notwithstanding any other provision of law.\n\n     SEC. 208. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING EXPANSION OF THE \n                   INTERNATIONAL SECURITY ASSISTANCE FORCE; \n                   AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       (a) Sense of Congress.--Congress urges the President, in \n     order to fulfill the objective of establishing security in \n     Afghanistan, to use the full diplomatic influence of the \n     United States to expand the International Security Assistance \n     Force (ISAF) beyond Kabul, Afghanistan by--\n       (1) sponsoring in the United Nations Security Council a \n     resolution authorizing such an expansion of that force;\n       (2) enlisting the European and other allies of the United \n     States to provide forces for an expanded International \n     Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan; and\n       (3) providing such financial and military assistance, \n     including personnel, as the President considers necessary to \n     achieve the expansion of the International Security \n     Assistance Force.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to the President $500,000,000 for each of \n     fiscal years 2003 and 2004 to provide the assistance \n     described in subsection (a)(3).\n\n     SEC. 209.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con.

Res. 155\n\n       Whereas the President has sought the support of the \n     international community in responding to the threat of \n     terrorism, violent extremist organizations, and states that \n     permit or host organizations that are opposed to democratic \n     ideals;\n       Whereas a united stance against terrorism and terrorist \n     regimes will likely lead to an increased threat to the armed \n     forces and law enforcement personnel of those states that \n     oppose these regimes of terror and that take an active role \n     in rooting out these enemy forces;\n       Whereas Congress has aided and supported a united response \n     to acts of terrorism and violence inflicted upon the United \n     States, our allies, and peaceful individuals all over the \n     world;\n       Whereas President Abraham Lincoln, at the outbreak of the \n     Civil War, proclaimed that the last Thursday in September \n     1861 should be designated as a day of humility, prayer, and \n     fasting for all people of the Nation;\n       Whereas it is appropriate and fitting to seek guidance, \n     direction, and focus from God in times of conflict and in \n     periods of turmoil;\n       Whereas it is through prayer, self-reflection, and fasting \n     that we can better examine those elements of our lives that \n     can benefit from God's wisdom and love;\n       Whereas prayer to God and the admission of human \n     limitations and frailties begins the process of becoming both \n     stronger and closer to God;\n       Whereas becoming closer to God helps provide direction, \n     purpose, and conviction in those daily actions and decisions \n     we must take;\n       Whereas our Nation, tested by civil war, military \n     conflicts, and world wars, has always benefited from the \n     grace and benevolence bestowed by God; and\n       Whereas dangers and threats to our Nation persist and in \n     this time of peril, it is appropriate that the people of the \n     United States, leaders and citizens alike, seek guidance, \n     strength, and resolve through prayer and fasting: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) November 27, 2002, should be designated as a day for \n     humility, prayer, and fasting for all people of the United \n     States; and\n       (2) all people of the United States should--\n       (A) observe this day as a day of prayer and fasting;\n       (B) seek guidance from God to achieve greater understanding \n     of our own failings;\n       (C) learn how we can do better in our everyday activities; \n     and\n       (D) gain resolve in how to confront those challenges which \n     we must confront.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/14/senate-section/article/S11147-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CLARIFYING THE REQUIREMENTS FOR ELIGIBILITY IN THE AMERICAN LEGION\n\n  Mr. REID.

After defeating the New York Yankees in the first round of the \nplayoffs and then going on to beat the Minnesota Twins for the American \nLeague Championship, the Angels battled my hometown team, the San \nFrancisco Giants, in an exciting all-California World Series. The \nAngels have proven to the world their outstanding ability to win and \nwork as a team.\n  Led by manager Mike Scioscia and players Scott Spezio, Garret \nAnderson, and Darin Erstad the Angels offense destroyed even the \nmightiest pitchers through October. Most Valuable Player Troy Glaus \nbatted an astounding .385 average with three homeruns in the seven-game \nseries.\n  Another key player in the Angels' march to glory is Troy Percival. \nThe veteran closing pitcher stifled the Giants' hitters in pivotal game \n7 and throughout the playoffs. Furthermore, Troy Percival would not \nhave been able to perform his masterful pitching had it not been for \nstarting pitcher John Lackey who pitched five strong innings in game 7.\n  Manager Mike Scioscia's leadership proved to be invaluable to the \nteam. His experience as a catcher with Southern California's other \nmajor league franchise, the Los Angeles Dodgers, helped the Angels \nthrough what started as Anaheim's worst season ever and turned it into \na glorious year.\n  The Anaheim Angels truly epitomize the importance of teamwork, as \nnearly every member of the roster contributed to their phenomenal \nseason. It should be noted that the championship could not have been \nwon without the dedication of the entire team: David\n\n[[Page S11149]]\n\nEckstein, Tim Salmon, Adam Kennedy, Bengie Molina, Brad Fullmer, Jarrod \nWashburn, Kevin Appier, Brendan Donnelly, Ben Weber, Ramon Ortiz, and \nFrancisco Rodriguez.\n  I also would like to congratulate chairman and CEO of the Walt Disney \nCompany Michael Eisner, General Manager Bill Stoneman and all of the \nAngels' staff on their hard work assembling Anaheim's first \nchampionship team. I should also congratulate Jackie Autry, widow of \nformer Angels owner Gene Autry. One of her husband's greatest dreams \nwas to see the Angels win a World Series.\n  And, most importantly, I would like to thank the Angels fans in \nSouthern California who have earned national recognition for their \nenthusiasm and unbridled support of their team.\n  Finally, it is nearly impossible to congratulate the Angels or their \nfans without mentioning the ``Rally Monkey,'' the adorable mascot that \nhas become Anaheim's symbol of resilience and refusal to give up hope \nin the most difficult situations.\n  The Angels have begun a new era of baseball in Southern California \nand will certainly defend their title with the same heart and \ndetermination that brought them to the World Series this year. The \nAnaheim Angels are a team with an unquenchable desire to win.\n  They have made the city of Anaheim, the county of Orange, and all of \nCalifornia proud.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution and preamble be agreed to en bloc; that the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate; and that any statements relating to the resolution be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 357) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 357\n\n       Whereas the Anaheim Angels have won the first World \n     Championship in the 42 year history of the franchise;\n       Whereas the Anaheim Angels completed their best season in \n     franchise history with 99 wins, staging one of the most \n     significant team improvements in Major League Baseball since \n     the 2001 season;\n       Whereas the 2002 World Series was the Anaheim Angels' first \n     appearance in the Fall Classic;\n       Whereas the Anaheim Angels have fielded such superstars as \n     Nolan Ryan, Rod Carew, Bobby Grich, Reggie Jackson, Jim \n     Abbott, Wally Joyner, Brian Downing, Jim Edmonds, Gary \n     DiSarcina, and now Troy Percival, Jarrod Washburn, Garret \n     Anderson, Troy Glaus, and Tim Salmon;\n       Whereas third baseman Troy Glaus received the World Series \n     Most Valuable Player Award for his stellar defensive plays, \n     .385 batting average, and 3 home runs during the series;\n       Whereas pitcher Francisco Rodriguez became the youngest \n     pitcher to win a World Series game and tied the postseason \n     record for games won with 5 outstanding wins;\n       Whereas Manager Mike Scioscia won his first World Series \n     title as a manager;\n       Whereas Tim Salmon made his first playoff appearance in 10 \n     seasons as a major league baseball player, the only current \n     player to have played that long without having reached the \n     postseason;\n       Whereas the spirit of Gene Autry, the ``Singing Cowboy'' \n     and former owner of the Angels, was undoubtedly ever-present \n     with the Anaheim players throughout the series as he was an \n     inspirational force to all who played for him and knew of his \n     legacy;\n       Whereas the Anaheim Angels battled another California team \n     deserving of acknowledgement: the San Francisco Giants;\n       Whereas the San Francisco Giants were a worthy rival for \n     the Anaheim Angels and set the stage for an exciting and \n     suspenseful World Series that was watched with great interest \n     by many Californians;\n       Whereas the Anaheim Angels epitomize California pride with \n     their incredible focus, dedication to winning, team \n     cohesiveness, and devotion to playing America's pastime with \n     class, athleticism, and enthusiasm; and\n       Whereas the Anaheim Angels demonstrate the rewards of \n     perseverance, discipline, teamwork, and championship as they \n     prepare to defend their title of World Champions: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate congratulates the Anaheim Angels \n     on winning the 2002 Major League Baseball World Series title.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/14/senate-section/article/S11149-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nEXPRESSING SENSE OF CONGRESS ABOUT PUBLIC AWARENESS AND EDUCATION ABOUT \n                   IMPORTANCE OF HEALTH CARE COVERAGE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Res. 94\n\n       Whereas census estimates indicate that some 42,000,000 \n     people in the United States are without health insurance \n     coverage, many of whom are among the most vulnerable and can \n     be financially devastated by serious illness, disease, or \n     accident;\n       Whereas studies have shown that people with health \n     insurance are healthier than those who are uninsured and \n     receive care through emergency rooms or safety net health \n     care services, because the insured are entitled to, and \n     receive, more preventive care, follow-up care, and care for \n     chronic conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure;\n       Whereas over 17,300,000 of the uninsured are employed but \n     are not offered health insurance through their employers;\n       Whereas such employers are small business owners who are \n     often unaware of the benefits of offering health insurance, \n     including that such benefits are tax deductible, reduce \n     employee turnover, and reduce employee sick days;\n       Whereas over 16,000,000 people in the United States, more \n     than \\1/3\\ of the uninsured, are in families where at least 1 \n     member of the family has been offered employer based health \n     care coverage but has declined coverage;\n       Whereas many individuals are eligible for public assistance \n     programs such as the State Children's Health Insurance \n     Program, known as SCHIP, and the medicaid program, but are \n     not currently enrolled due primarily to lack of outreach, \n     education, and accessible enrollment processes;\n       Whereas studies have shown that many individuals and small \n     businesses are unaware of the various options they have for \n     obtaining affordable health care coverage;\n       Whereas surveys have shown that many individuals who cite \n     expense as the reason for not purchasing insurance find \n     insurance affordable once they are informed of the true cost \n     of various options; and\n       Whereas education about health care coverage helps \n     uninsured individuals and employers understand the critical \n     value of health insurance as a preventive measure and the \n     ways to keep their health insurance premiums manageable once \n     they have health care coverage: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) a National Importance of Health Care Coverage Month be \n     established to--\n       (A) promote a multifaceted educational effort about the \n     importance of health care coverage;\n       (B) increase awareness of the many available health care \n     coverage options; and\n       (C) inform those eligible for public insurance programs on \n     ways to access those programs; and\n       (2) the President issue a proclamation calling on the \n     Federal Government, States, localities, citizens, and \n     businesses of the United States to conduct appropriate \n     programs, fairs, ceremonies, and activities to promote this \n     educational effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/14/senate-section/article/S11149-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11149-S11150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RELIEF OF SO HYUN JUN\n\n  Mr. REID.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Prosecutorial Remedies and \n     Tools Against the Exploitation of Children Today Act of \n     2002'' or ``PROTECT Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Obscenity and child pornography are not entitled to \n     protection under the First Amendment under Miller v. \n     California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973) (obscenity), or New York v. \n     Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 (1982) (child pornography) and thus may \n     be prohibited.\n       (2) The Government has a compelling state interest in \n     protecting children from those who sexually exploit them, \n     including both child molesters and child pornographers. ``The \n     prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse of children \n     constitutes a government objective of surpassing \n     importance,'' New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 757 (1982) \n     (emphasis added), and this interest extends to stamping out \n     the vice of child pornography at all levels in the \n     distribution chain. Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S. 103, 110 \n     (1990).\n       (3) The Government thus has a compelling interest in \n     ensuring that the criminal prohibitions against child \n     pornography remain enforceable and effective. ``[T]he most \n     expeditious if not the only practical method of law \n     enforcement may be to dry up the market for this material by \n     imposing severe criminal penalties on persons selling, \n     advertising, or otherwise promoting the product.'' Ferber, \n     458 U.S. at 760.\n       (4) In 1982, when the Supreme Court decided Ferber, the \n     technology did not exist to: (A) create depictions of virtual \n     children that are indistinguishable from depictions of real \n     children; (B) create depictions of virtual children using \n     compositions of real children to create an unidentifiable \n     child; or (C) disguise pictures of real children being abused \n     by making the image look computer generated.\n       (5) Evidence submitted to the Congress, including from the \n     National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, \n     demonstrates that technology already exists to disguise \n     depictions of real children to make them unidentifiable and \n     to make depictions of real children appear computer \n     generated. The technology will soon exist, if it does not \n     already, to make depictions of virtual children look real.\n       (6) The vast majority of child pornography prosecutions \n     today involve images contained on computer hard drives, \n     computer disks, and/or related media.\n       (7) There is no substantial evidence that any of the child \n     pornography images being trafficked today were made other \n     than by the abuse of real children. Nevertheless, \n     technological advances since Ferber have led many criminal \n     defendants to suggest that the images of child pornography \n     they possess are not those of real children, insisting that \n     the government prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the \n     images are not computer-generated. Such challenges will \n     likely increase after the Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition \n     decision.\n       (8) Child pornography circulating on the Internet has, by \n     definition, been digitally uploaded or scanned into computers \n     and has been transferred over the Internet, often in \n     different file formats, from trafficker to trafficker. An \n     image seized from a collector of child pornography is rarely \n     a first-generation product, and the retransmission of images \n     can alter the image so as to make it difficult for even an \n     expert conclusively to opine that a particular image depicts \n     a real child. If the original image has been scanned from a \n     paper version into a digital format, this task can be even \n     harder since proper forensic delineation may depend on the \n     quality of the image scanned and the tools used to scan it.\n       (9) The impact on the government's ability to prosecute \n     child pornography offenders is already evident. The Ninth \n     Circuit has seen a significant adverse effect on prosecutions \n     since the 1999 Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision in \n     Free Speech Coalition. After that decision, prosecutions \n     generally have been brought in the Ninth Circuit only in the \n     most clear-cut cases in which the government can specifically \n     identify the child in the depiction or otherwise identify the \n     origin of the image. This is a fraction of meritorious child \n     pornography cases. The National Center for Missing and \n     Exploited Children testified that, in light of the Supreme \n     Court's affirmation of the Ninth Circuit decision, \n     prosecutors in various parts of the country have expressed \n     concern about the continued viability of previously indicted \n     cases as well as declined potentially meritorious \n     prosecutions.\n       (10) In the absence of congressional action, this problem \n     will continue to grow increasingly worse. The mere prospect \n     that the technology exists to create computer or computer-\n     generated depictions that are indistinguishable from \n     depictions of real children will allow defendants who possess \n     images of real children to escape prosecution, for it \n     threatens to create a reasonable doubt in every case of \n     computer images even when a real child was abused. This \n     threatens to render child pornography laws that protect real \n     children unenforceable.\n       (11) To avoid this grave threat to the Government's \n     unquestioned compelling interest in effective enforcement of \n     the child pornography laws that protect real children, a \n     statute must be adopted that prohibits a narrowly-defined \n     subcategory of images.\n       (12) The Supreme Court's 1982 Ferber v. New York decision \n     holding that child pornography was not protected drove child \n     pornography off the shelves of adult bookstores. \n     Congressional action is necessary to ensure that open and \n     notorious trafficking in such materials does not reappear.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4664) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     years 2003, 2004, and 2005 for the National Science \n     Foundation, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I am pleased the Senate will consider \nand pass today, the National Science Foundation Doubling Act. This bill \nis the product of extensive bipaprtisan, bicameral negotiations among \nthe House of Representatives Committee on Science, the Senate Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, and the Senate Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation. It is based on S. 2817, which I \nintroduced with Senator Hollings, Senator Mikulski, and Senator Bond. I \ncommend them, together with Senator Gregg, Senator McCain, House \nScience Committee Chairman Boehlert, Congressman Nick Smith, and \nCongressman Ralph Hall for their leadership in crafting this important \nlegislation.\n  NSF performs two key functions for the federal governmnet and the \nbroader research community. It supports basic research and development \nin math, science, engineering, and technology, and it promotes math and \nscience learning at every level, from K-12 through post-graduate \neducation.\n  Few people realize how influential NSF has been to their daily lives. \nNSF has funded basic research leading to the creation of doppler \nweather radar, retail bar codes, speech recognition software, magnetic \nresonance imaging machines, and even World Wide Web browsers, such as \nNetscape and Microsoft's Internet Explorer. NSF education initiatives \nof the late 1980s were the forerunners of the standards-based school \nreform movement embraced throughout the Nation today and most recently \nin the new No Child Left Behind Act governing nearly all federal \nelementary and secondary education programs.\n  We can and should build on NSF's record in improving the lives of \nmillions of Americans. The 20th Century was the era of the industrial \nage, and the 21st Century will be the era of information technology and \nthe life sciences.\n  The bill before us doubles NSF's budget authority over the next five \nyears. It matches the growth of the National Institutes of Health over \nthe last five years. We double budget authority for research and \ndevelopment in the physical sciences and theoretical mathematics, \nbecause they support advances in the health sciences and because they \nare valuable in their own right.\n  I am particularly proud that the legislation before us authorizes a \nnew secondary school systemic initiative at NSF that will develop model \nschool reforms to improve high school student math and science \nperformance and better prepare all students for college-level and \ntechnical work. For too long, federal policy has paid scant attention \nto the needs of secondary school students. Senator Jeffords and I have \nbeen working extensively in this area. I commend him for his leadership \nand look forward to continued work with him on the needs of secondary \nstudents.\n  The bill before us supports model math and science partnerships \nbetween institutions of higher education and local school districts to \nimprove the knowledge and teaching techniques of current and future \nmath and science teachers. The math and science partnership provisions \nare based on proposals offered by the Administration, Senator Frist, \nSenator Roberts, Senator Rockefeller, and Senator Bingaman. They track \na strong body of educational research that emphasizes the importance of \ntraining math and science teachers to improve student performance in \nthose important subject areas.\n  This legislation supports institutions of higher education in \nincreasing the number of students, particularly women and minorities, \nwho study toward and obtain degrees in science, math, engineering, and \ntechnology. Senator Lieberman, Senator Mikulski, and Senator Bond are \nleaders on this issue, and I commend them as well. We have an economic \nneed and a national security imperative to increase the number and \nquality of students studying science, math, engineering, and technology \nat the post-secondary level.\n  Finally, the bill before us reforms NSF's program on major research \nand facilities equipment, to help prioritize projects and guard against \ncost overruns and approval of proposals that have not received adequate \nanalysis. This is an area of concern for Senator Clinton, Senator Bond, \nand Senator Mikulski, and I commend them for this initiative. Quality \nand merit should be the touchstones of our Nation's investment in the \nsciences.\n  The National Science Foundation Doubling Act is a thoughtful piece of \nbipartisan legislation that prepares us for the future. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, today, the Senate will pass \nlegislation that authorizes the doubling of the National Science \nFoundation budget by fiscal year 2007. As you all know, NSF is the \nnation's premier federal science agency that invests in basic research \nacross all disciplines. We rely on NSF research to open new frontiers \nof science, and I am proud that we can pass this important legislation \ntoday.\n  We have approached this legislation in concert with our friends on \nthe Health, Labor, Education, and Pensions Committee, Senators Kennedy \nand Gregg. Once again, it has been a pleasure to work with Chairman \nBoehlert and ranking member Ralph Hall of the House Science Committee. \nObviously, we could not have produced this product without Senator \nMcCain, Senator Rockefeller, and the other members of the Commerce \nCommittee. We were also pleased to work with our friends, Senators Bond \nand Mikulski, who have been leaders on the NSF.\n  This doubling bill is vital. The Hart-Rudman Commission on National \nSecurity, and former speaker Newt Gingrich, warned that our failure to \ninvest in science and to reform math and science education was the \nsecond biggest threat to our national security. NSF is well positioned \nto address this threat. After all, NSF invests in math and science \neducation from kindergarten all the way through to the post-doctoral \nlevel and beyond. This bill allows the Foundation to increase that \ninvestment, while reaffirming our commitment to women, minorities, and \npeople with disabilities. These underrepresented groups, together, make \nup more than half of our nation's work force and are only increasing. \nLetting these groups fall by the wayside would not only threaten our \neconomic competiveness, but also our national security.\n  It is often said that more than one-half of our nation's economic \ngrowth since World War I has stemmed from technology driven by science. \nLet me give just one example of how NSF's investments can spur our \neconomy. NSF is the leading agency in the National Nanotechnology \nInitiative. Nanotechnology--which is the science of manipulating matter \nat the atomic and molecular level--will cut across every scientific \ndiscipline, including materials and manufacturing, healthcare and \nmedicine, energy and the environment, agriculture, biotechnology, \ninformation technology, and national security. Worldwide, the market \nfor nanotechnology is expected\n\n[[Page S11156]]\n\nto be $1 trillion annually within 10 to 15 years. NSF's cross-\ndisciplinary approach, which includes groundbreaking research into the \nway society and this new technology will interact, will help this \nnation take advantage of Nanotechnology sooner, better, and with \ngreater confidence.\n  Finally, I want to note that NSF is responsible for the overall \nhealth and well-being of the research enterprise in this country. \nCongress is now completing its 5-year commitment to double funding for \nthe National Institutes of Health. We made that investment because we \nwant to cure and prevent disease. But increasingly, it's not just the \nbiomedical research that NIH supports that brings us breakthroughs. \nRecent advances in biomedical science have relied on advances in fields \nsuch as computer science, physics, and chemistry. For example, the \nsequencing of the human genome was enabled by powerful computers \nnetworked in innovative ways. The commitment that we are making today \nto science at NSF will build our base knowledge in non-medical fields \nto complement the research done at NIH.\n  NSF research is not just for large universities. The Foundation's \ncontinued support for the EPSCoR program supports the development of \nthe science and technology resources of individual states like South \nCarolina, through partnerships that involve the state's universities, \nindustry, government, and the Federal research and development \nenterprise. These partnerships put researchers in these states in a \nbetter position to compete and win NSF grants.\n  Mr. President, I think these arguments are solid, simple, and \nstraightforward. We can talk about NSF's past outstanding contributions \nto science. We can talk about the future and the importance of science \nand technology to our economy. But, Mr. President, where the rubber \nmeets the road, we have to stop talking and invest, with real money, in \nthe science and engineering enterprise that will guaranty the health, \neconomic viability, and security of our future. I, for one, appreciate \nthe hard work that NSF has done over the past 52 years promoting the \nprogress of science, and I thank my Senate colleagues for supporting me \nin providing this agency the resources needed to conquer tomorrow.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I am proud with my Senate colleagues, \nparticularly Senators Kennedy, Gregg, and Hollings, in expressing \nsupport for this historic legislation, which will help ensure that our \ncountry continues to be a leader in scientific and technological \ninnovation. I also want to extend my appreciation to Chairman Boehlert \nof the House Science Committee for his leadership in moving this \nstrongly bipartisan legislation.\n  The reality is that technological and scientific innovation is now \nwidely understood to be the major driver of economic growth, not to \nmention a critical factor in our military superiority. Education is \nessential to ensuring that the American workforce possesses the skills \nnecessary to meet these innovation needs. The provisions included in \nthis legislation will help give universities and colleges in \nConnecticut and nationwide the tools they need to boost our domestic \npool of brainpower--the next generation of people who will incubate and \nimplement the next generation of ideas to expand our economy.\n  I am extremely pleased that the bill passed today includes all of the \nkey elements of the Technology Talent Act of 2001 S. 1549, legislation \nthat I and my colleagues, most notably Senators Mikulski, Bond, Frist \nand Domenici, first proposed a year ago today. The Technology Talent \nAct of 2001, ``Tech Talent Act'', sought to stimulate economic growth \nby boosting the number of math, science, technology and engineering \ngraduates from U.S. institutions of higher learning. House Science \nCommittee Chairman Boehlert introduced similar legislation in the House \n, H.R. 3130, on October 16, 2001.\n  In keeping with the Tech Talent Act, the National Science Foundation \nAct of 2002 ``NSF Authorization Act approved today establishes a \nframework for a multi-year competitive grant program that would award \nperformance-based grants to institutions of higher learning to increase \nthe number of math, science, technology and engineering graduates. The \nlegislation will formally authorize an existing program at NSF that was \ninspired by and modeled after Tech Talent Act--the Science, \nMathematics, Engineering,and Technology talent Expansion Program, STEP. \nSTEP, has already received Federal appropriations for fiscal year 2002 \nand elicited more than 170 applications from interested colleges and \nuniversities, of which 16 were awarded grants. I am pleased that \nNaugatuck Valley Community College in my home state was selected to be \none of the first grantees under the program and have every confidence \nthat it will lead the Nation in developing creative and effective ways \nto build a 21st century workforce.\n  The provisions in the NSP Authorization Act before us today achieves \nthe same goals as were proposed in my Tech Talent Act. The following \nanalysis describes the growing talent gap that threatens America's \nleadership in science and technology and clarifies the goals, concepts, \nand themes underpinning both my original legislation and the STEP, or \nTech Talent, provisions of the NSF Authorization Act.\n  America's technological prowess is unequaled in the world today--\nwhich is why, despite our economic slowdown and the financial burdens \nof prosecuting the war against terror and ensuring our collective \ndefense, we still have the strongest, most vibrant economy on the \nplanet. However, our long-term competitive standing and economic \nsecurity could well be at risk if we do not address a troubling trend \nline in our workforce, the mismatch between the demand and supply of \nworkers with science and engineering training.\n  Studies show that the number of jobs requiring significant technical \nskills is projected to grow by more than 50 percent in the United \nStates over the next ten years. But outside of the life sciences, the \nnumber of degrees awarded in science and engineering has been flat or \ndeclining. This has helped fuel a well-chronicled shortage of qualified \nNew Economy workers.\n  We have tried to temporarily plug this human capital hole with a \nstopgap of foreign workers. Unfortunately, there is a broad consensus \namong high-tech leaders and policymakers that it would be a serious \nmistake to prolong this dependence and essentially render our GDP \ncontingent on the supply of H-1 B visa holders.\n  That may sound like a bit of an overstatement to some. But the \nreality is that technological innovation has been a key enabler of our \neconomic and military dominance over the last half century. It is \nwidely acknowledged, moreover, that we cannot continue to expand our \neconomy in the future if we don't take steps now to expand our domestic \npool of human intellectual capital.\n  Now, most answers to serious economic challenges flow from the \nprivate sector, which is where growth must occur. But there are things \nthat the Federal Government can do to help, particularly when it comes \nto educating and training our workforce. We can provide leadership, \nfocus, and not least of all resources, and that was the purpose of the \nTech Talent Act as introduced, and STEP as is included in this NSF \nlegislation.\n  Specifically, the Tech Talent program aims to fix a critical link in \nthis ``tech talent'' gap--undergraduate education in science, math, \nengineering, and technology. As established in our bill, it would \nprovide competitive grants to institutions of higher learning, from \nuniversities to community colleges, to encourage them to find creative \nmethods for increasing the number of graduates in these disciplines.\n  This is not another scholarship program, but a targeted, results-\ndriven initiative that goes straight to the gatekeepers. We're not \nasking them to change their admissions policies, but, in effect, to \ndesign new missions. Come up with effective ideas, and we will provide \nthe dollars to make them work.\n  For example, institutions could propose to add or strengthen the \ninterdisciplinary components of undergraduate science education. Or \nthey could establish targeted support programs for women and \nminorities, who are 54 percent of our total workforce, but only 22 \npercent of scientists and engineers, to increase enrollment and \ngraduation numbers in these fields. Or they could partner with local \ntechnology companies to provide summer industry internships for ongoing \nresearch experience.\n\n[[Page S11157]]\n\n  This initiative was conceived with strong bipartisan, bicameral \nsupport. The Tech Talent Act, as noted, was introduced last year by \nSenators Mikulski, Bond, Frist, Domenici, and myself; the House \ncompanion bill, H.R. 3130, was introduced by House Science Committee \nChairman Boehlert and Representative Larson. By the end of the year, \nCongress had agreed to appropriate $5 million for this fiscal year to \njumpstart the program in the form of NSF's STEP, even though our \nauthorizing legislation had not yet been passed. Most recently, the \nSenate VA-HUD Committee Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2003 \nincluded $20 million for the program.\n  The program also has extremely broad support outside the Congress. \nThe Administration has supported Tech Talent as a priority, including \nfunding for it in its budget request for FY 2003. In addition, the \nresponse from leaders in industry, academia, and educational \ncommunities, also has been tremendous, we have received letters of \nsupport from TechNet, Semiconductor Industry Association, National \nAlliance of Business, K-12 Science, Mathematics, Engineering & \nTechnology Coalition, American Association of State Colleges and \nUniversities, Texas Instruments, and the American Society for \nEngineering Education, to name but a few.\n  Even more encouraging are the preliminary data obtained from NSF's \nSTEP. NSF received 177 applications requesting a total of $59.7 million \nin aid, clear evidence of the vast interest in, and need for, the Tech \nTalent program among undergraduate institutions seeking to implement \nreforms in science and math education. In its first year, the program \nhas awarded 16 grants to colleges and universities.\n  The NSF Authorization Act passed today will do much to enhance the \nefforts already underway at NSF in this area and to permanently \nestablish ``Tech Talent'' as a national priority. I want to make clear \nthe intent of a few provisions in this legislation as their \nimplementation will be critical to the success of the program.\n  The intent of H.R. 4664, expressed in section (8)(a)(7)(A), is to \nprioritize funding for programs in fields of science, mathematics, \nengineering, and technology that have witnessed a period of stagnant of \ndeclining enrollment and degree conferrals, especially where such \ndeclines have resulted, or are likely to result, in adverse social, \neconomic, technological, or military costs. It deserves clarification \nthat a declining trend can be indicated not only through an absolute \ndecrease in the number of students enrolling or graduating in a \nparticular field, but through a relative decrease in the proportion \nthat students of a particular field constitute relative to the total \nnumber of students enrolled or graduating across all fields.\n  For example, statistics from the National Science Foundation, NSF, \ndemonstrate that between 1985 and 2000, the number of bachelor's \ndegrees awarded declined from 77,572 to 59,536 in engineering, and from \n16,270 to 14,580 in the physical sciences. Furthermore, the NSF \npredicts that the number of jobs requiring skills and backgrounds in \ninformation technology will vastly outstrip the number of people \ncapable of filling such positions over the next decade. The negative \nconsequences of such trends with respect to economic growth, \ntechnological innovation, and gainful employment have been widely \ndocumented and should represent near to medium-term priorities for Tech \ntalent funding.\n  In emphasizing the need to remediate stagnant or declining trends, we \nrecognize and appreciate previous criticisms regarding the difficulty \nof accurately modeling future employment scenarios and of forecasting \nareas of societal need. Nevertheless, we believe that investments must \nbear a relationship to desired outcomes if limited funds are to be \nallocated intelligently. The NSF is therefore expected to undertake \nefforts to the best extent it can to identify and account for broader \nsocial considerations, including generally anticipated industry \nrequirements or imbalances between the number of students graduating \nacross different fields, in determining fields appropriate for \nprioritization. To this end, the NSF may require applicants to specify \nthe specific societal needs being addressed by their proposals and to \narticulate how such proposals would further the remediation of targeted \nneeds.\n  The fundamental goal of the Technology Talent Act as introduced was \nto increase the number of graduates with expertise in math, science, \ntechnology and engineering to meet the critical needs of our U.S. \nbusinesses, industries, research community and military. As such, the \nintention of sections (8)(a)(7)(B) and (8)(a)(7)(D)(i) of H.R. 4664 is \nto require applicants to clearly establish measurable targets to both \nincrease the number of students studying toward degrees in science, \nmathematics, technology and engineering, and to increase the number of \nstudents who have completed degrees, concentrations, or certificates in \nthese fields. Therefore, it is intended that applicants that fail to \nestablish goals for both enrollment and completion shall be considered \ninadequate.\n  Likewise under section (8)(a)(7)(D)(ii), it is intended that the \nDirector shall terminate funding in the case of a grantee that has \nfailed to make substantial progress toward meeting the targets \nestablished in section (8)(a)(7)(D)(i) for increasing the number of \nstudents completing degrees, concentrations or certificates in science, \nmathematics, technology and engineering. However, I would encourage the \nDirector to work with grantees and provide technical assistance to help \nensure that grantees make substantial progress during the first three \nyears of the grant toward meeting the targets established in \n(8)(a)(7)(D)(i) and to achieve such targets by the end of the grant \nperiod. I further believe that it is inherent in this legislation that \ngrantees that successfully meet their targets established in \n(8)(a)(7)(D)(i) shall be eligible to compete for subsequent grants.\n  I believe that this NSF bill provides a real boost to efforts that \nare being undertaken in parts of the country to address our technical \nworkforce challenge. As such, it is the intention that innovative \nconsortias between institutions of higher education and non-profits, \nindustry or state or local governments are eligible to compete for \ngrants under the STEP program per section (8)(a)(7)(F). In particular, \nI believe that legislation under (8)(a)(7)(F)(iii) allows for non-\nprofits established on behalf of such high-quality and proven \nconsortias to apply directly for grants.\n  For example, the State of Texas passed legislation last year that \ncreated a consortium--the Texas Engineering and Technical Consortium, \nTETC, among private industry and 32 colleges and universities to \nincrease the number of students graduating from Texas schools with \ndegrees in electrical engineering and computer science. Grants are \nawarded to universities and colleges to support curriculum changes, \nbridge programs, and various forms of student and faculty support to \nhelp increase the retention rate of students pursuing degrees in these \nareas and to attract and retain more underrepresented groups. This \ncollaborative effort has received funding from Advance Micro Devices, \nTexas Instruments, Hewlett Packard, Motorola, Intel, Applied Materials \nand Sabre, with in-kind support from AeA and TechNet. The state matches \nprivate and other contributions up to $5 million per year.\n  In April, grants worth $5.3 million were awarded to fund 33 projects \nas 23 institutions. The appeal of this program is that industry, \nacademia and the state are working cooperatively and collaboratively to \naddress a pressing workforce need, rather than on a school-by-school or \ncompany-by-company basis. While it is still too early to determine the \nsuccess of these projects, which were funded at 64 percent of the \npotential grant amount, the institutions are projecting a 13 percent \nincrease in total student numbers in these programs for fall 2003. If \nfully funded, that increase could go as high as 23 percent. This is \njust the type of innovation that the Tech Talent is meant to encourage.\n  Finally, the real success the version of the ``Tech Talent'' program \nencompassed in this legislation will be based on the successful \nreplication and expansion of model programs supported through this \ngrant program at all of our higher education institutions. Therefore, I \nbelieve it is critical that the Director follow the intent of the \noriginal language as introduced in S.\n\n[[Page S11158]]\n\n1549, section (5)(a), and H.R. 3130, section (4)(d), and select an \nindependent evaluative organization to develop metrics for measuring \nthe impact of the program, particularly on the number of students \nenrolled, academic performance of students, persistence to degree \ncompletion, and placement in post-graduate education or career \npathways, and to identify the program approaches assisted under this \nprogram that are the most effective in increasing the number of \nstudents obtaining degrees in science, mathematics, technology and \nengineering.\n  In addition, both S. 1549 and H.R. 3130 intend for the Director to \nregularly disseminate information on the activities conducted by \ngrantees and the results of programs assisted under this grant program, \nincluding best practices, to participating institutions of higher \neducation and other interested institutions of higher education. \nSimilarly, I believe it is imperative to share the findings of programs \nassisted under STEP grants with Congress through interim and final \nreports so that we may make better policy decisions to enhance our \nnation's standing as a scientific and technological leader.\n  We all realize that solving the undergraduate problem is not going to \nsingle handedly close our talent gap. At the same time, we should also \nrealize that the talent gap cannot be closed without first solving the \nproblem at the undergraduate level. Therefore, I am pleased by the \nSenate's unanimous support today for the NSF Authorization Act of 2002, \nand the STEP, or Tech Talent, provisions encompassed therein. In doing \nso, we will be helping to ensure that the young minds of today will be \ncapable of mastering and fueling the high-tech economies of tomorrow.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise today to join with Senator \nKennedy, Senator Hollings, Senator Gregg, Senator McCain, and Senator \nBond  to urge passage of the National Science Foundation Doubling Act.\n  On July 12, 2002, Senator Kit Bond and I joined together and called \non our Senate colleagues to join us in an effort to double the budget \nof the National Science Foundation over five years. We said at that \ntime, that just as we worked collectively to double the NIH budget, now \nwas the time for a parallel effort on behalf of the fundamental \nresearch supported by the NSF.\n  NSF's impact over the past half century has been monumental--\nespecially in the field of medical technologies and research. The \ninvestments have also spawned not only new products, but entire new \nindustries, such as biotechnology, the internet, and e-commerce. \nMedical technologies such as biotechnology, the internet, and e-\ncommerce. Medical technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging, \nultrasound, digital mammography and genomic mapping could not have \noccurred, and cannot now improve to the next level of proficiency, \nwithout underlying knowledge from NSF-supported work in biology, \nphysics, chemistry, mathematics, engineering, and computer sciences.\n  Today, with this bill, we take an important step to ensure the well-\nbeing of this Nation and its citizens with passage of this bill to \ndouble the funding for the basic research and science education \nactivities of the National Science Foundation over the next five years.\n  Some might ask, ``Why should we do this now?'' Let me try and answer \nthat question.\n  We have seen some dramatic increases in research and development \ninvestments during the past decade, largely from industry. These \ninvestments have contributed to this country's standing as a global \neconomic powerhouse.\n  However, according to the National Science Board--in its latest \nreport on science indicators--developments abroad could affect U.S. \npreeminence in the years to come. The Board says that the United States \nfinances 44 percent of the total worldwide investment in R to \nthe combined total of Japan, the United Kingdom, Canada, France, \nGermany and Italy.\n  But other nations are increasing their R investments and focusing \non areas such as physical sciences and engineering, which receive \ncomparably less funding in the United States. Those changes could lead \nto the creation of new centers for research excellence abroad, which \nwill encourage many of those who have come here from other countries \nand have become a part of our science enterprise to return home.\n  The fact is that this country's future competitiveness rests on our \nability to develop a U.S. work force that has the skills necessary to \nmeet the increased competition coming from abroad.\n  In this country, R investments by U.S. industry have contributed to \na steady stream of innovations and economic growth. We are seeing new \npartnerships develop that connect firms and universities, nonprofit \norganizations and government.\n  Meanwhile, the balance of R investments continues to shift. As \nindustry R grew to nearly 75 percent of the national total by 2000, \nFederal expenditures remained essentially flat over the past decade.\n  At the same time federal research expenditures in life sciences have \ngrown, from 41 to 47 percent of the federal total between 1990 and \n2000. However, the combined share of physical sciences and engineering \nin federal research total dropped from 37 to 29 percent in the same \nperiod.\n  Changes in the U.S. economy have spilled into the workforce. \nInformation- and technology-based changes in the economy have created \nnew opportunities for highly trained workers.\n  Science and engineering occupational fields are growing faster than \nthe overall growth of the American work force. the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics predicts that during this decade, hi-tech occupations will \ngrow by 47 percent, compared to 15 percent for the labor force as a \nwhole.\n  Despite many state and national reforms initiated during the last \ndecade, the quality of mathematics and science education at the \nprecollege level is not where it should be. America's high school \nstudents continue to lag behind in international achievement measures \nin science and mathematics. U.S. high school students taking physics \nlag behind students in Norway, Sweden, the Russian Federation, Denmark, \nGermany, Australia and seven other countries.\n\n  A persistent issue in science and mathematics education remains the \nsize and adequacy of the teaching force. According to the National \nCommission on Mathematics and Science Teaching for the 21st Century, \nthe nation's schools will need to hire 2.2 million teachers, including \n240,000 middle and high school mathematics and science teachers, in the \nnext decade.\n  The need for teachers is most pronounced in urban and rural areas and \nwithin specific disciplines and grade levels of mathematics and \nscience. A survey of urban school districts, by the Council of the \nGreat City Schools and Recruiting New Teachers, Inc., in 1998-99, \nindicated that up to 95 percent of our urban school districts had an \nimmediate demand for high school science and mathematics teachers.\n  A high percentage of science and mathematics teachers lack even a \nminor in their teaching field, with 56 percent of public secondary \nstudents receiving instruction in the physical sciences from teachers \nwithout a major or minor in the physical sciences. And as many as 50 \npercent of new teachers in urban school districts leave the teaching \nprofession within their first three years, further exacerbating \nshortages.\n  Solving the problem of producing more high-quality, homegrown \nscientists and engineers--and a well educated workforce--depends upon \nsolving the math and science education problems we have at the \nelementary and secondary levels of our school system.\n  The bill before us today authorizes substantial growth in all areas \nof basic research--including the physical, engineering, biological, and \ncomputer sciences--fields vital for progress in just about every other \narea of science including biomedical research. The bill also puts a \nhigh priority on cutting edge programs such as information technology, \nnanotechnology and plant genome research.\n  Under this bill, the NSF budget would grow from today's level of $5 \nbillion to nearly $10 billion by fiscal year 2007 which should allow \nfor substantial growth in both the size of the average award as well \nincrease the number of awards NSF is able to make. Increasing the size \nof the grants will benefit those currently conducting research. \nIncreasing the number of awards should help\n\n[[Page S11159]]\n\nthose individuals who are just starting their careers in science as \nwell as attract more women and minorities into our science and \ntechnology enterprise.\n  In the area of math and science education, the bill firmly \nestablishes the President's Math and Science Partnership program at the \nNational Science Foundation. This is a new effort designed to create \nstrong connections between state and local school districts with our \ninstitutions of higher education.\n  This bill also includes a provision for a new undergraduate ``tech \ntalent'' program. The ``tech talent'' program is designed to provide \nfinancial support to undergraduate students to pursue bachelor degrees \nin science and engineering--all in an effort to help meet today's and \ntomorrow's workforce needs.\n  The funding in this bill will also help increase the graduate student \nstipends in both the NSF fellowship programs as well as in the support \ngraduate students receive as research assistants on the NSF research \ngrants. Under this bill, NSF's entire education and human resources \nprogram would grow from $875 million in fiscal year 2002 to almost $1.8 \nbillion by fiscal year 2007.\n  Finally, this bill includes two provisions that relate to the \nNational Science Board. These are ``good government'' provisions that \ngive the National Science Board, the policy making body of the \nFoundation, the authority and funding to hire its own staff. Our \nrationale is to ensure that the Board remains independent with respect \nto its policy making and oversight responsibilities. This is \nparticularly important as Congress attempts to double the NSF over the \nnext five years. Finally, it is equally important to know that these \nprovisions do not preclude the Board and the NSF from continuing to \nwork closely together as they have over the years such as in the \nstaffing of NSB committees, subcommittees, and task forces and the \ndevelopment of the biennial Science and Engineering Indicators report.\n  As a Nation, we have a big challenge ahead of us as we enter the new \nmillennium. Our world has changed and we must do what is necessary to \nmeet the new challenges that will surely come our way. The sustained \nand effective investment in our Nation's research and education \nenterprise is one of the keys to meeting those challenges. I urge all \nmy colleagues to join us in enacting this important investment in the \nfuture of our country.\n\n\n                 NSF reauthorization: NSF doubling act\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I see that in this legislation, there is an authorization \nfor the Plant Genome Project, a program that had previously been \nauthorized only in appropriations acts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Is the intent of the mangers in including this provision \nmerely to provide a permanent authorization for the Plant Genome \nProject, and not to state a preference by the Senate for plant genomics \nover other agricultural genomics programs when it comes to additional \nfunding provided through appropriations?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. That plant genomics language \nincluded in the NSF doubling legislations is only to establish an \nauthorization, it does not state a preference for plant genomics over \nother agricultural genomics programs that might be provided through \nlater appropriations acts.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator. I think that is an important point \nbecause Senator Lugar and I worked hard in the Agricultural Research, \nExtension, and Education Reform Act of 1998 to authorize an \nagricultural genomics program administered by the National Science \nFoundation because we felt a balanced genomics program was essential to \nkeeping U.S. agriculture productive and competitive.\n  While I think the plant genomics program is an excellent one, I \nsincerely hope that any further increases provided for agricultural \ngenomics be open to animal and microbiological research as will, not \njust plants. We need a balanced portfolio of agricultural research to \nbest capitalize on the resources devoted to agriculture-related \ngenomics research. I would not want anyone to think that the Senate was \nnow backtracking on the progress we made with the passage of the 1998 \nagricultural research legislation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It is certainly not the manager's intent to limit the \nAgricultural, Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for that.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 5557, which is now at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5557) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to provide a special rule for members of the uniformed \n     services and Foreign Service in determining the exclusion of \n     gain from the sale of a principal residence and to restore \n     the tax exempt status of death gratuity payments to members \n     of the uniformed services, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n\n\n            TAX STATUS OF SERVICE PERSONNEL ON DIEGO GARCIA\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The distinguished Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu \nhas raised an issue with respect to the legislation before us. That \nlegislation, H.R. 5557, deals with tax benefits for military service \npersonnel. Senator Landrieu would like clarification from the \nAdministration on the status of service men and women on the Island of \nDiego Garcia. These service personnel have participated in military \noperations as part of Operation Enduring Freedom and will participate \nin future military operations from that location. There is a question \nwhether these members of the armed forces are entitled to be treated in \nthe same manner as if such services were in a combat zone.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Let me respond to the distinguished chairman on this \npoint. At the request of the Senator from Louisiana, our staffs made \ninquiries of the administration on this question this evening. In \ndiscussion with Treasury officials, our staffs have been assured that \nthe Treasury Department will look into this matter and work\n\n[[Page S11160]]\n\nwith the Senator from Louisiana to address the questions raised by the \nSenator. We look forward to an expeditious response from the \nAdministration.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank my good friend from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I am pleased that we are passing the \nArmed Services Tax Fairness Act that will make a number of useful tax \nchanges benefitting our military personnel including the National Guard \nand Reserve. It includes a provision that I introduced that broadens \nthe allowable membership of veterans organizations so ancestors and \ndescendants can be members. This will allow veterans organizations, \nparticularly at the local chapter level to preserve as tax exempt a \nvariety of their activities which otherwise would be subject to tax as \nthe number of veterans who are members decline.\n  Unfortunately, because of opposition from the House, this measure \ndoes not include a provision passed by the Senate on an earlier version \nof the Armed Services Tax Fairness Act that I feel very strongly about. \nI introduced it earlier this year. It was companion to a measure \nintroduced by Congressman Rangel.\n  My bill blocks the ability of the very rich to reduce their taxes by \nrenouncing their U.S. citizenship. The Joint Tax Committee has \nestimated that it will raise $656 million from a very few people who I \ncall Benedict Arnolds. These are people who turn their back on their \ncountry which provided so well for them so they can avoid paying their \nfair share of U.S. taxes.\n  Under current law, there are special rules that apply to these former \ncitizens that appear to recover funds lost to the Treasury. But, they \nare full of holes. Under the current regime, for 10 years after a U.S. \ncitizen renounces his or her citizenship with a principal purpose of \navoiding U.S. taxes, the person is taxed at the rates that would have \napplied had he or she remained a citizen. Actually the tax is nominally \non a broader base of income and on more types of transactions. In \naddition, if the expatriate dies within 10 years of the expatriation, \nmore types of assets are included in his or her estate. But, the \nreality is that taxes are very often not paid.\n  The reality is that once a person has expatriated and removed U.S. \nassets from U.S. jurisdiction, it is extremely difficult to enforce the \ncurrent rules, particularly for an entire decade after the citizenship \nis renounced. The measure I introduced simply provides that the very \nact of renouncing ones citizenship triggers the recognition of tax. So, \nrather than collecting tax every time an asset is sold over the next \ndecade, my bill treats all of the assets of an expatriate as having \nbeen sold the day prior to when the person renounces their citizenship. \nThe taxes are due up front rather than over time. In regard to estate \ntaxes, rather than attempting to collect the tax from the estate of an \nexpatriate not in U.S. jurisdiction, my measure taxes the inheritance \nof an heir remaining in the U.S. in such a way as to remove any tax \nbenefit from the renouncement of citizenship.\n  Madam President, $656 million in revenue from these very few former \ncitizens is a lot of revenue that must be made up by loyal Americans or \nin higher debt that Americans will face. I intend to reintroduce my \nmeasure at the beginning of the next Congress and will be working hard \nfor its passage at the earliest possible point.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the Baucus amendment at the \ndesk be agreed to, the bill be read three times and passed, the motion \nto reconsider be laid on the table, and any statements be printed in \nthe Record, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4961) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of the \nAmendments.'')\n  The bill (H.R. 5557), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/14/senate-section/article/S11160-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. REID.
