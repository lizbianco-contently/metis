Walton, of the District of Columbia, to be \nUnited States District Judge for the District of Columbia.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill be a total of 20 minutes for debate on the two nominations, with \nthe time to be equally divided between the chairman and the ranking \nmember.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me first thank the distinguished \nmajority leader, Senator Daschle, and my dear friend the chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, for their support and efforts \nin moving this nomination and scheduling this vote\n\n[[Page S9562]]\n\ntoday. The nominees before us are both great people, but I am going to \nfirst chat about the nominee Sharon Prost.\n  She is no ordinary nominee. She is an extraordinary woman of \nintegrity and intellect who is the nominee to be an appellate judge on \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. She also happens to \nserve as the Republican Chief Counsel to the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, my chief counsel, Sharon Prost.\n  Many of us who have worked with Sharon either on the Judiciary or the \nLabor Committees know her well. Sharon grew up in an Orthodox Jewish \nhome, where the values of faith, family, and country were instilled in \nher. Simply put, Sharon embodies the American dream. Her parents were \nconcentration camp survivors who arrived in this country from Poland in \n1948. The pursuit of their own educations was derailed by the war, but \nthey nonetheless emphasized to Sharon the importance of education and \nhard work in achieving success--advice Sharon has followed throughout \nher life. And, as Sharon noted at her hearing, her parents instilled in \nher the love of community, love of family, and love of God.\n  Tragically, Sharon's father died when she was only 13 years old. Upon \nhis death, she had to support herself, and worked her way through high \nschool and college. But despite the obstacles life placed before her, \nSharon persevered. She and her sister Marlene became the first in their \nfamily to graduate from high school and go on to attend college. \nPerhaps one of the best-educated individuals ever to have worked in the \nSenate, Sharon holds four degrees, including a bachelor of science from \nan Ivy League university, a law degree, an LLM in tax, and an MBA. She \ngot three of her degrees at night while working full-time.\n  A labor lawyer at heart, Sharon first came to work for me 12 years \nago, after serving as acting solicitor of the NLRB. I sought Sharon out \nto work for me on the Senate Labor Committee because I learned of her \nintellect, her integrity, her exceptional legal skills, and her \nbackground in finance.\n\n  In her role as my chief counsel on the Judiciary Committee, she has \nbeen responsible for everything on the committee agenda, including \nmatters of immigration, antitrust, and patent law.\n  I cannot stress enough how indebted I am to her for her service over \nall of these many years. She is one of the most loyal, decent, and \nintelligent people with whom I have had the privilege to serve.\n  Sharon truly is something of a modern renaissance woman, with a \nbreadth and depth of knowledge in a variety of areas. Her background \nand education make her uniquely suited for service on the Federal \nCircuit, which, as you know, handles myriad issues ranging from \nveterans matters to patent cases to employment cases.\n  It has been said that ``[t]he value of government to the people it \nserves is in direct relationship to the interest citizens themselves \ndisplay in the affairs of state.'' Sharon has proved herself to be a \nvaluable asset to our Nation, having devoted much of her life to public \nservice.\n  I know that Sharon holds the other Members of this body in the \nhighest regard, and that those who have worked with her have the utmost \nrespect for her as well--a fact reflected by the standing ovation that \nthe Judiciary Committee members gave Sharon when they unanimously \napproved her nomination to be sent to the full Senate.\n  Sharon has been the primary counsel working for me on a number of \nbipartisan initiatives, including the Violence Against Women Act with \nSenator Biden and his staff, as well as the religious liberty bill that \nwas passed last year. And Sharon has worked closely with Senator \nKennedy's staff over the years on Labor Committee and immigration \nissues.\n\n  I would be remiss in talking about Sharon Prost and her many \naccomplishments without mentioning the role she considers most \nimportant of all: that of being the mother of her terrific sons, \nMatthew and Jeffrey. She is one of the most noble and fine people I \nhave ever known.\n  Let me close by noting that Sharon is not only an able counsel and \nwonderful mother, but she is a person with a good heart.\n  As Robert Traver wrote more than four decades ago,\n\n       Judges, like people, may be divided roughly into four \n     classes: judges with neither head nor heart--they are to be \n     avoided at all costs; judges with head but no heart--they are \n     almost as bad; then judges with heart but no head--risky but \n     better than the first two; and finally, those rare judges who \n     possess both head and a heart.\n\n  Sharon will serve this country as a judge with head and a heart. In \nfact, Matthew and Jeffrey will tell you that one of their mom's \nfavorite things to say is, when you use both your head and your heart, \nyou will do things right and do the right things.\n  These words are insufficient to express how much I respect and love \nher, and how much I will miss her and her skill and good counsel. I \ntruly have mixed emotions, but I have no doubt that confirming her to \nthe Federal Circuit will be the right thing for the country.\n  Let me also take a moment to express again my personal thanks to the \ndistinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy for \nmoving Sharon out of the committee and for the distinguished majority \nleader for scheduling this vote today. I also commend the President for \nrecognizing Sharon's skills and talent and selecting her for the \nprestigious and noble position of being a circuit judge.\n  I urge and thank my colleagues' support for Sharon's nomination.\n  Mr. President, I wish to say a few words in support of Judge Reggie \nB. Walton who has been nominated to be a district court judge for the \nDistrict of Columbia. Judge Walton is an excellent nominee for this \nposition who brings a wealth of talent and experience to the job.\n  Judge Walton began his legal career as a staff attorney in the \nDefender Association of Philadelphia from 1974 to 1976. There he served \nas defense counsel for indigent criminal defendants. Next he became an \nassistant U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia from 1976 to 1981, \nand he served as the executive assistant U.S. attorney for that office \nfrom 1980 to 1981.\n  In 1981, President Ronald Reagan appointed Judge Walton to the \nSuperior Court of the District of Columbia. He served as the deputy \npresiding judge of the Superior Court's Criminal Division from 1986 to \n1989. In 1989, Judge Walton was appointed by President George H.W. Bush \nas the Associate Director of the Office of National Drug Control \nPolicy, Executive Office of the President. Judge Walton served in this \nposition until 1991, when he was named by President Bush as the Senior \nWhite House Advisor for Crime. Judge Walton was reappointed to the \nSuperior Court bench by President Bush in 1991. Judge Walton served as \nthe presiding judge of the Superior Court's Domestic Violence Unit in \n2000. Since January 1, 2001, Judge Walton has served as the presiding \njudge of the Superior Court's Family Division.\n  Judge Walton has been active in legal education throughout his \nprofessional career. Currently, he serves as a faculty member at the \nNational Judicial College in Reno, NV, as an instructor at the Harvard \nUniversity Law School's Trial Advocacy Workshop, and as a faculty \nmember with the National Institute of Trial Advocacy.\n  In short, Mr. President, Judge Walton is a highly capable person of \ndemonstrated talent who deserves the vote of confirmation by this body.\n  I commend him to the Senate. And, above all, I commend Sharon Prost \nwho has given this body, the U.S. Senate, tremendous service, dedicated \nservice, good service, and intelligent service over the last number of \nyears for whom I could not have any greater respect. She is a terrific \nhuman being.\n  I hope both of these two judges-to-be will enjoy their service for \nour country in these very important positions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate is considering en bloc \nthe nominations of Sharon Prost and Reggie Walton. There are 20 minutes \nevenly divided. The Senator controls 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair, my distinguished friend from New \nEngland.\n  To reiterate, I commend the President of the United States for his \nspeech last night. I said to him after the speech that I thought, as \nmost people\n\n[[Page S9563]]\n\ndo, it was the finest speech of his public career. He spoke to us in \naccordance with constitutional provisions contained in article II, \nsection 3 of our Constitution to report to the Congress on the state of \nthe Union. But, more importantly, he spoke to all Americans.\n  I was there. My wife Marcelle was in the galleries. Millions upon \nmillions of Americans across the country and people all around the \nworld listened to the President. We knew America had been hit by \nmurderous terrorist acts in New York and at the Pentagon in Virginia, \nand at the plane crash in Pennsylvania.\n  The President was right in saying there are no easy answers; that we \nface a long and terrible fight.\n  I could not help but think as I listened to him that we will know our \ndefeats in the years ahead. Often we will not know our victories. That \nmakes the fight even more difficult. It is easier when you face a well-\nknown foe, as we have in other times. Here we will know when we lose \nsome battles. We will not always know when we win some.\n  The President should know that we have a United States behind us--a \nUnited States of America united more than at any time since I have \nserved in the Senate. We must use that unity to bring out what is the \nbest in our country, both in protecting our own liberties and our own \nrights as Americans--and we will do that--but also in demonstrating to \nthe rest of the world that we are not a defenseless giant.\n  I have served for many years with both the Majority Leader and the \nRepublican leader. In fact, I have been in the Senate throughout all of \ntheir careers. I commend Senators Daschle and Lott for their \nreinforcing reaction and response. I believe Senator Daschle and \nSenator Lott showed the best of the Senate last night and in these \ndifficult days.\n  The desk I sit in was once used by Senator George Vandenberg. Senator \nVandenberg said ``politics stops at the water's edge.'' And we showed \nthat last night.\n  I have been working with the President and the Attorney General to \nbring together a package of legislative proposals to aid in this \neffort, laws that can help without sacrificing the freedoms and \nconstitutional protections that define what is best in America. I want \npublicly to thank Attorney General Ashcroft for his cooperation. He and \nI have probably spoken more times in the past week and a half than we \nmight have in months when we served side by side in the Senate.\n  Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, the Judiciary Committee \nhas been devoting virtually undivided attention to the aftermath, the \ninvestigation and the proper legislative response. The exceptions have \nbeen the confirmation hearings we have conducted since the attacks for \nhigh-ranking law enforcement officials at the Department of Justice and \nfor judicial nominees. All will hopefully help. Today we are going to \nconfirm Sharon Prost and Judge Walton.\n  I spoke of the pride I had and all Senators had--both Democrat and \nRepublican--when Ms. Prost appeared before our committee, at our \nextraordinary hearings during the August recess.\n  I spoke about her not just as a person and as a lawyer and not just \nbecause I feel she will be a superb judge on this very important court, \nbut I also spoke of her as the mother of two wonderful young men. I was \ngratified in seeing the looks in the faces of those two young men as \nthey watched their mother testify but also the love that she showed to \nthem.\n  As we were reporting the Prost nomination from the Committee, she \nreceived a spontaneous standing ovation from all those assembled.\n  This morning the Senate will confirm Sharon Prost to be a Judge of \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. At that \nmoment, the Senate will have confirmed as many judges to our Courts of \nAppeals, since July of this year, as were confirmed in the entire first \nyear of the Clinton administration. We are moving forward very quickly. \nIn the first year of the Clinton administration, where they did not \nhave all the disruptions and distractions and shifts we have had here, \nthe first Court of Appeals judge was not confirmed until September 30 \nand the third was not confirmed until November. We have moved a lot \nfaster. Actually, we have moved a lot faster than the Senate did during \nthe first year of the first Bush administration, as well. That year, \n1989, the third Court of Appeals nominee was not confirmed until \nOctober 24.\n  With the reporting of the Prost nomination to the Senate earlier this \nmonth, we had reported as many Court of Appeals nominees as were \nreported all last year. Since then we have had a hearing on an \noutstanding nomination to the Second Circuit and I expect to be \nscheduling more hearings including Court of Appeals nominees in the \ndays ahead.\n  I recall the predictions when I was becoming Chairman in June that \nall the President's judicial nominations would be blocked and the \nSenate would not confirm a single nominee. By mid-July we had held \nhearings, the Committee had reported and the Senate had acted to \nconfirm Judge Roger Gregory to the Fourth Circuit and we have continued \nto work at a brisk pace throughout the summer and into the fall.\n  I recall published reports that the White House had predicted that \nthe Senate would be confirming only five judges all year. With the \nconfirmation of Judge Walton, we will confirm the sixth Federal judge \nsince July. A fair assessment of the circumstances of this year would \nlead to the conclusion that we have done what we said we would do and \nwhat the Senate should do, proceed to consider and confirm those \nqualified, consensus nominees that the President is nominating to help \nfill the vacancies on our federal courts.\n  We will also have the Attorney General before us on Tuesday morning. \nI intend to work with the Attorney General and the administration all \nday today, this evening, all day Saturday, all day Sunday, and all day \nMonday to try to bring together all the things necessary to get needed \nlegislation enacted. I noted a coalition of more than 150 \norganizations, ranging from the most conservative to the most liberal, \nthat have joined together to ask the Senate and our committee not to \ntrample on civil liberties as we do this. These groups range from the \nEagle Forum to the ACLU, all united, taking the same position. I can \nassure them that trampling the rights of Americans is not the intention \nof our committee. We will be very careful.\n  As the Attorney General said, we can operate within our Constitution. \nThe Constitution has been our greatest shield throughout our democracy. \nWe must honor it and operate within its confines and protections. We \nwill also protect ourselves against terrorism, both domestic and \nforeign.\n  I thank those Senators who stayed here with me last weekend, have \nworked with me evening after evening, and are committed to working with \nme this weekend, and their staffs. It is a great effort pulling all \nthis legislation together.\n  I hope that we can continue to show unanimity both for the American \npeople and for this Senate. For example, I want my colleagues to know \nthat early this morning, when most of us could barely keep our eyes \nopen, we reached agreement with the White House and with the House of \nRepresentatives on a victims' compensation program for the victims of \nthe terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. When we met with the White \nHouse and with the House leadership and, in particular, when I met with \nthe heads of the various airline companies, I said that we must have a \nvictims' compensation program.\n  I thank the majority leader, Senator Daschle; Senator Lott, the \nRepublican leader; Speaker Hastert; Leader Gephardt; Senator Hatch; \nSenator Kohl; Senator DeWine; Senator Schumer; and Senator Clinton for \ntheir bipartisan efforts. We have created a victims' compensation fund. \nPayments to these victims will be tax free. We will move forward \nquickly.\n  I thank Ed Pagano, John Dowd and Greg Cota of my staff for being \nwilling to work around the clock and Makan Delrahaim of Senator Hatch's \nstaff. I commend Mark Childress and Andrea LaRue of the Majority \nLeader's staff and Dave Hoppe of the Republican Leader's office, as \nwell as Victoria Bassetti, Pete Levitas, Jeff Berman and Leecia Eve. \nThis is extremely important. There is no higher priority. Again, this \nhas been an occasion where in a bipartisan effort working for long \nhours in good faith and with common\n\n[[Page S9564]]\n\nresolve, we have been able to forge a good agreement.\n  I see the time has arrived for the votes. I ask unanimous consent to \nprint in the Record the following relating to establishment of a \nvictims' compensation fund.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSenate Bipartisan Compromise: Establishment of a September 11 Victims' \n                           Compensation Fund\n\n\n       creation of the september 11 victims' compensation program\n\n       Congress shall authorize and appropriate such funds as may \n     be necessary to compensate any victims or their families with \n     physical injury or wrongful death claims arising out of the \n     terrorist-related airline crashes in the United States on \n     September 11, 2001.\n       To be eligible for compensation, applicants will need to \n     provide information about the harm they suffered or death \n     linked to the terrorist-related airline crashes on September \n     11, 2001. Applicants will not be required to prove negligence \n     or any other theory of liability.\n       The Department of Justice shall supervise the program and \n     the Senate shall confirm a Special Master to administer the \n     program to determine victim compensation.\n\n\n          quick review and payment of claims for compensation\n\n       The Special Master shall make a final determination of the \n     applicant's eligibility for compensation and appropriate \n     level of compensation within 100 days of having received the \n     application.\n       In all cases, the compensation shall be paid within 20 days \n     of the final determination.\n       Filing of a claim under the program will preempt all other \n     civil remedies available under federal or state law for the \n     same physical injury or wrongful death suffered as a result \n     of the September 11, 2001 terrorist acts.\n       Payments to victims will be tax free.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays on the nominees.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The yeas and nays have been \npreviously ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 1 \nminute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee for his \nsolid support of Sharon Prost and Reggie Walton and for the work he has \ndone. I also have enjoyed working with him as we have worked to \nfashion, along with all the people whose names he mentioned, and \ncertainly in the House of Representatives, the law enforcement changes \nand terrorism laws that really need to occur. I hope we can get that \ndone. I hope we can do it on a completely bipartisan basis. It has to \nbe done.\n  We have also worked very hard on the airline bill which he has \ndescribed adequately. I thank him for the efforts he is putting forth, \nand his staff and, of course, my staff. A number of these staff people \nworked all night long on some of this legislation. They deserve an \nawful lot of credit, along with the White House staff, staffs of both \nHouses, and the staff of both sides on this issue.

Mr. President, the majority and minority leaders have \nagreed that in the near future, the two managers, Senators Warner and \nLevin, will move forward with the Defense authorization bill. The \nopening statements will take some time because this\n\n[[Page S9565]]\n\nis such an important piece of legislation.\n  At some point later in the day, when the House, we hope, completes \ntheir work on the airlines legislation, which they have worked on \nduring the night, and we worked on during the night, we will move to \nthat. The managers understand that.\n  I hope that people will understand how hard these two veteran \nlegislators--Senator Levin and Senator Warner--have worked on this \nlegislation. I personally know of the time they have spent on this bill \nin the past week, and prior to that they spent much more time on it. \nThis is a very crucial time in the history of this country, and \nalthough it is always important, it is even more so now.\n  I hope Members will be very cautious in trying to make a Christmas \ntree out of this piece of legislation. The two leaders want as little \ncontroversy with this legislation as possible. We understand the Senate \nrules, that any person can do anything they want with this legislation. \nBut we certainly ask that they be very cautious with this legislation. \nWe have a timeframe within which we very badly need to complete this \nbill--as soon as possible. By next Wednesday at 2 o'clock, we not only \nhave to complete this legislation but also do the continuing resolution \nto get us past the fiscal year. So there is really a lot to do.\n  I repeat for the third time, I hope that Members will be very \ndiscrete in what they do with this legislation as it relates to these \ntwo managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me first thank the Senator from Nevada \nfor his very kind words and for his efforts and the leadership on both \nsides of the aisle in helping to bring this bill forward. Senator \nWarner and I have indeed worked very hard on it and, as always, we have \nworked together to bring a bill forward that hopefully the Senate can \npass and pass quickly. But without the support of our leadership, that \nwould not have been possible. As hard as we and our staffs work, it \ntakes leadership support to make it happen. We are grateful that \nSenator Reid is on the floor, and we thank all leaders not on the \nfloor.\n  Mr. WARNER. If the Senator will yield, I join that with respect to \nthe leadership provided by our distinguished majority whip. Yesterday \non the train, as we were going to New York, we had Senator Daschle, \nSenator Lott, Senator Reid, Senator Levin, and I, and I think we \nfinished up basically the procedural and, to some degree, the \nsubstantive points that remain, under the circumstances on which we \nconcluded on the eve of visiting ground zero.\n  That is an example of how, throughout the last six or seven days, \nSenator Levin and I have collaborated on bringing together a closure of \nthe differences that were experienced in the committee, when the \ncommittee for the first time in living memory had a partisan division \non reporting out a bill.\n  I commend our chairman and the leadership. I think we are prepared \ntoday to present to the Senate a very fine bill on behalf of the men \nand women of the Armed Forces, their families, and those who are \ndependent and work with our Armed Forces. It would be my hope that in \nthe course of the day, we can address such items as Members wish. But I \nthink on our side, having participated in our caucus this morning, \nthere is a feeling that we would like to move forward on this bill; and \ndepending on the number of hours today, quite possibly we can bring to \nclosure a number of issues and possibly begin to focus on when final \npassage could be achieved, subject to the leadership's desire for the \ntime of the vote.\n  I thank my colleague.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/21/senate-section/article/S9565-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9565-S9577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2002\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1598\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the managers' amendment is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for himself and Mr. \n     Warner, proposes an amendment numbered 1598.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider is laid upon the table.\n  The amendment (No. 1598) was agreed to.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL FUNDS.\n\n       (a) Authorization.--$1,300,000,000 is hereby authorized, in \n     addition to the funds authorized elsewhere in Division A of \n     this Act, for whichever of the following purposes the \n     President determines to be in the national security interests \n     of the United States--\n       (1) research, development, test and evaluation for \n     ballistic missile defense; and\n       (2) activities for combating terrorism.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this is no ordinary time in our country. In \nNew York and just across the Potomac in Virginia, our fellow citizens \ncontinue to sift through the ruins left by the most deadly attack ever \nagainst the United States. Our fury at those who attack innocents is \nmatched by our determination to protect our citizens from more terror \nand by our resolve to track down, root out, and relentlessly pursue the \nterrorists and those who would shelter or harbor them. The President \nspoke eloquently and forcefully last night setting out those goals.\n  Against this background, we bring the National Defense Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 2002 to the floor of the Senate. The bill \nauthorizes the full amount requested by the administration for national \ndefense, including the $18.4 billion requested by the President in his \namended budget request. The bill also addresses a number of important \npriorities identified by the Armed Services Committee.\n  I am pleased we were able to add a significant amount of money, over \n$700 million, to the budget request for compensation and quality of \nlife.\n  We added more than $1 billion to improve the readiness of the \nmilitary services to carry out their assigned missions.\n  We added a large amount of money to advance the transformation of the \nmilitary services and to improve the capability of the armed forces to \nmeet nontraditional threats, including terrorism.\n  Even in advance of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center and \nthe Pentagon, we gave particular attention to the problem of terrorism \nas reflected in our bill and in the report that accompanies it. Not \nonly did the committee fully fund the President's proposal for \ncombating terrorism, we were able to add funds for a new combating \nterrorism initiative to improve the ability of the U.S. forces to deter \nand defend against terrorism, including additional funds for research \nby the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy on the \ndetection, identification, and measurement of chemical and biological \nweapons, and funds to upgrade Army installations and make them less \nvulnerable to terrorism. Much more remains to be done in this area, and \nthat has surely been dramatized by the events of September 11.\n  We have already passed a $40 billion emergency supplemental for our \nwar on terrorism. I understand the Department of Defense will be coming \nforward\n\n[[Page S9566]]\n\nwith an additional supplemental budget request in the next several \nweeks, and our committee will review any such request.\n  The U.S. military is by far the most capable fighting force in the \nworld. From Europe to the Persian Gulf to the Korean peninsula, the \npresence of U.S. military forces and their contributions to regional \npeace and security reassure our allies and deter adversaries.\n  U.S. forces have excelled in every mission assigned to them, \nincluding the 1999 NATO air campaign over Kosovo and ongoing \nenforcement of the no-fly zones over Iraq, humanitarian operations from \nCentral America to Africa, and peacekeeping operations from the Balkans \nto East Timor.\n  The U.S. armed forces remain the standard against which all \nmilitaries are measured. Our armed forces are without peer today, and \nthis bill will help ensure they remain so for the foreseeable future. \nAt his confirmation hearing before the Armed Services Committee last \nweek, Gen. Richard Myers, the next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, testified that we have military forces and capability that we \nneed to respond to the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center and \nthe Pentagon.\n\n  We identified five priorities to guide our consideration of the bill: \nContinuing the improvements in the compensation and quality of life of \nthe men and women of the armed forces and their families; improving the \ncapability of the armed forces to meet nontraditional threats, \nincluding terrorism and unconventional means of delivery of weapons of \nmass destruction; sustaining the readiness of the military services to \ncarry out their assigned missions; encouraging the transformation of \nthe military services to lighter, more lethal, and more capable forces; \nand improving the efficiency of Department of Defense programs and \noperations.\n  Let me briefly address each of those areas.\n  One of our top priorities was to continue the improvements in the \ncompensation and quality of life for our men and women in uniform. In \nthis regard, we approved a pay raise of at least 5 percent for all \nmilitary personnel and targeted pay raises of between 6 and 10 percent \nfor enlisted personnel and junior officers, and we provided $17.9 \nbillion requested by the Department to fully fund the Defense Health \nProgram, including the significant new benefits we authorized last \nyear.\n  The committee approved a number of other important initiatives to \nimprove the quality of life for our military, and, in particular, the \nbill before us would authorize $30 million to improve retention efforts \nby allowing personnel with critical skills to transfer up to 18 months \nof unused benefits under the Montgomery GI bill to family members in \nreturn for a commitment to serve 4 additional years.\n  Senator Cleland has been fighting for that initiative since he came \nto the Senate, and I am delighted we were able to include it in our \nbill this year.\n  We added more than $450 million for family housing and other military \nconstruction to improve the facilities in which our military personnel \nwork and housing in which they and their families live.\n  We added more than $230 million to increase the basic allowance for \nhousing and eliminate all out-of-pocket housing costs for service \nmembers and their families by the year 2003, which is 2 years earlier \nthan the Department of Defense plan.\n  Finally, the bill includes a set of provisions offered by 18 members \nof the committee, led by Senators Landrieu, Allard, Cleland, and \nNelson, to ensure overseas voters and absent military voters have a \nmeaningful opportunity to exercise their voting rights as citizens of \nthe United States.\n  Another top priority of our committee was to improve the ability of \nthe United States and U.S. forces to deal effectively with \nnontraditional threats, including terrorism, unconventional means of \ndelivering weapons of mass destruction, and the proliferation of \nnuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. The Emerging Threats \nSubcommittee, under the leadership of Senator Mary Landrieu and Senator \nPat Roberts, took the lead in this effort.\n  Our committee added funds to the budget request to help address \nnontraditional threats. First, the bill adds funds for a combating \nterrorism initiative to improve the ability of U.S. forces to deter and \ndefend against terrorism, including almost $100 million for research by \nthe Department of Defense and the Department of Energy to detect and \nidentify chemical and biological weapons in advance of their use, and \nmore than $75 million to upgrade Army installations and make them less \nvulnerable to terrorism.\n  I am particularly pleased that we were able to add $13 million to the \nbudget for standoff explosive detection research and development, a \nproof-of-concept system for predetonation of explosive devices and hand \nheld explosive detectors for the U.S. Navy, all fulfilling the \nrequirements which were so urgently identified in the aftermath of the \nOctober 2000 attack on the U.S.S. Cole.\n  If we can develop that standoff explosive detection, if we can come \nup with the technology to do that, learning the lesson which we learned \nto our great expense, cost, and horror with the attack on the U.S.S. \nCole, we will make a very significant gain in the war against \nterrorism.\n  The bill would authorize the full $400 million requested by the \nadministration for cooperative threat reduction programs, to continue \ndestroying and dismantling nuclear warheads and missiles in the former \nSoviet Union, and we added more than $50 million to Department of \nEnergy programs to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction and related expertise.\n  Earlier this year, a bipartisan task force, chaired by former Senator \nHoward Baker and former White House counsel Lloyd Cutler, concluded the \nfollowing: The most urgent unmet national security threat to the United \nStates today is the danger that weapons of mass destruction or weapons-\nusable materiel in Russia could be stolen and sold to terrorists or \nhostile nation states and used against American troops abroad or \ncitizens at home.\n  With this funding, the committee has placed itself firmly on record \nin support of the continuing effort to reduce the threats posed by \noffensive nuclear weapons, their delivery systems, and related \nmaterial.\n  Another priority of the committee was to sustain the readiness of the \nU.S. military. Toward that end, we added approximately $1 billion to \nthe budget request to fund critical priorities of the military \nservices. These additions included the following: Almost $250 million \nto improve the readiness of Army aviation, including additional Black \nHawk helicopters, upgrades to Apache helicopters, and additional TH-67 \ntraining helicopters.\n  We added $125 million for upgrades to the B-2 and B-52 bombers and an \nadditional $100 million to maintain B-1 bombers to ensure we will \ncontinue to have a ready, capable bomber fleet.\n  We added more than $120 million to upgrade engines and reduce \nmaintenance costs for the F-15 and F-16 aircraft, and we added almost \n$100 million for the maintenance of surface ships and Navy and Marine \nCorps equipment.\n  The committee also added money to increase full-time manning in the \nArmy National Guard, to upgrade the Navy's electronic warfare aircraft, \nto improve the operational safety and capabilities of the test ranges \nand space launch facilities, and to continue modernizing the training \naircraft used by the Air Force and Navy for the training of new pilots.\n  Again, I emphasize these additions to the President's budget request \nwere all made before the events of September 11. There will be \nadditional ones I will list in a moment, but we will be receiving in \nthe next few days an amended budget request from the administration, or \na supplemental budget request, to add additional funds to those I am \noutlining.\n  We do not have that request before us yet, so we are unable to \nrespond to it. Of course, it will be mainly an appropriations request, \nbut we also hope as authorizers to have an opportunity to take a look \nat that request in the days ahead.\n  The committee also gave priority to continued support for \ntransformation of the U.S. military forces. To do this, we added more \nthan $800 million to the budget request to advance the transformation \nefforts of the military to a lighter, more lethal, and a more flexible \nforce. These additions included the\n\n[[Page S9567]]\n\nfollowing: Nearly $400 million to support Navy transformation, \nincluding more than $300 million to support conversion of four excess \nTrident missile submarines to carry Tomahawk cruise missiles; more than \n$200 million to increase the defense science and technology budget, \nincluding substantial increases for advanced materials and \nmanufacturing technologies, nanotechnologies, and cutting-edge \ncommunication technologies. We added almost $200 million for Army \ntransformation programs, including full funding for all of the \nobjective force priorities on the Army's list of unfunded requirements \nin fiscal year 2002, and more than $80 million to fund continued \nefforts to develop and field unmanned vehicles.\n\n  I want to give special credit to our ranking member, Senator Warner. \nHe has been an active advocate, for as long as I can remember, for \nputting additional funds in for our unmanned aerial vehicles and other \nunmanned vehicles. He has had a great deal of foresight in focusing on \nthe importance of doing that, and I have supported those efforts, but \nthe credit for the leadership really belongs to Senator Warner. The \nNation is in his debt for that and so many other actions on his part. \nIn future years and future decades, we will see the payoff for these \nkinds of investments now in these unmanned vehicles.\n  The money that is needed to fund these priorities was obtained \nthrough management and other efficiencies identified by the committee. \nIn particular, we determined the Department should be able to achieve \nsignificant savings through improved management of its purchases of \nservices, including--I emphasize this--the increased use of \nperformance-based service contracting, competition for orders under \nservice contract, program review spending analyses, and other best \npractices commonly used in the commercial sector.\n  In fact, the final report on an OMB pilot program 3 years ago \nconcluded Federal agencies should be able to save as much as 15 to 30 \npercent on their service contracts through the use of performance-based \nservice contracting alone. There has not been much done in that area. \nThere is a lot we can do, and we will harvest significant savings when \nwe do so, as this bill provides.\n  We are also able to achieve efficiencies by identifying programs in \nwhich the Department requested more money than it could wisely spend in \nfiscal year 2002. We approved a reduction of $592 million to the V-22 \ntilt rotor Osprey aircraft program because of continuing concerns about \nthe program and the recommendation of the V-22 review panel that \nproduction should be kept to a minimum sustaining rate in order to \nminimize the number of aircraft requiring retrofit after these programs \nhave been addressed.\n  Similarly, we approved a net reduction of about $250 million to the \nJoint Strike Fighter Program because of the likely delay of the launch \nof the engineering and manufacturing development phase of the JSF \nProgram.\n  The bill before us authorizes a new round of base alignments and \nclosures for the year 2003, and that will produce a significant \nincrease in the Department of Defense's savings that it has achieved \nthe four previous rounds. The civilian and military leadership of the \nDepartment of Defense has told us for years, through two \nadministrations, that the Department of Defense has excess \ninfrastructure and needs a new round of base closings to free up funds \nfor higher priority defense needs and to support the successful \ntransformation of our military and implementation of the Quadrennial \nDefense Review.\n  Senator McCain and I have been fighting for a new BRAC, as we call \nit, for more than 4 years. I am glad the committee endorsed by a 17-8 \nvote the proposal the administration sent to us.\n  Now we are asking the Department of Defense whether or not, in light \nof recent circumstances, there is any change in their position that \nthey want the tool of reducing excess infrastructure in order to make \nsavings so they can apply those savings in the years ahead to other \nvital needs of the Defense Department. That request has been sent to \nthe Department of Defense to see what their current position is in \nlight of the events of September 11. We will have discussions with our \ncolleagues relative to this matter in the hours and days ahead, and \nwith the Defense Department, because we do want to make sure the \nDefense Department position is still the same and that is still a tool \nthey consider to be essential for them in waging a war efficiently and \nin having resources needed to wage future efforts, such as the long \neffort that is going to be needed in the war against terrorism.\n  In short, we believe this is a strong and balanced bill that fully \nfunds the amount requested by the administration for national defense, \nand it goes a long way to meet the urgent needs of our military. In \nlight of recent events, we are obviously going to do more, as we have \nwith the enactment of $40 billion emergency supplemental appropriations \nbill last week. On top of that, in the next few days we will be \nreceiving a request for additional funds given the circumstances that \nhave unfolded.\n  As important as the funding that we provide is, there is something \nelse that is critically important. That is the unity of purpose that we \nshow as we enter into the current struggle. Debate on a bill such as \nthis is an inherent part of our democracy. While our democratic \ninstitutions are stronger than any terrorist attack, in one regard we \noperate differently in times of national emergency. We set aside those \ndifferences that we cannot bridge. We try to resolve differences that \nwe previously were unable to resolve. But in cases of other \ndifferences, we put them off for another day, where the effort or \nattempt to resolve them now would create dissent where we need unity.\n  There are a number of these issues that were in this bill. One had to \ndo with the question of national missile defense. We were able, by one \nvote in committee, to put into the original bill which came before this \nSenate a provision which would have required Presidential certification \nin the event that it was decided or determined there were activities \nthat were going to be funded that were in conflict with the arms \nreduction and arms control treaty that we entered into. It was a matter \nof major seriousness, regardless of what position people took on that \nissue, to just about every Member of this body. Rather than to have the \neffort made to resolve that issue now, we decided we would withhold \nthose provisions. That is why a few days ago I withdrew those \nprovisions from this bill and introduced under rule XIV a separate bill \nwhich contained those provisions.\n  Under that rule, today, that separate bill which contains these \nprovisions relative to national missile defense is on the calendar of \nthe Senate. It is available for the majority leader to call up, should \nhe choose to do so, for debate by this body. If and when--and I \nemphasize the ``if,'' not just the ``when''--the administration \ndetermines that an activity for which it is using funds from this bill \nconflicts with the arms control treaty, the ABM Treaty, it would then \nbe an option for the majority leader to call up the bill that is now on \nthe calendar which would then provide the opportunity for us to debate \nwhether or not we wanted to fund such activity. That was the way in \nwhich we preserved that option, delayed that debate that preserved the \nrights of people who feel strongly about that issue, including myself, \nto have such a debate should it be appropriate to do so.\n  To summarize what we have done relative to those provisions, relative \nto national missile defense, the specific provisions relative to \nactivities for which funds might be used from this bill in conflict \nwith the ABM Treaty, the provision which is now on a separate bill \nwould not have prohibited such activities but, rather, would have \ndeferred a congressional decision on funding them until we had a \ndetermination from the administration as to whether the activities \nwould be in conflict with the treaty.\n  For some Members, that is very important information. As the author \nof that provision, I believe very strongly that we have a \nresponsibility to determine whether or not a testing activity or \nfunding conflicts with an arms control agreement. Some might vote to \napprove the funding without regard to that arms control agreement. \nOthers would want additional information and the nature of the conflict \nbetween the treaty and the requested activity. Some Members would want \nto know the significance of the testing effort, to weigh whether or not \nthe value of the test which is in conflict with that arms\n\n[[Page S9568]]\n\ncontrol agreement outweighs some of the negative circumstances which \nmight be created by the unilateral withdrawal which would have to take \nplace before such a testing activity occurred.\n\n  It seemed to me, regardless of one's position relative to the issue \nof whether or not we should proceed with such activities in conflict \nwith the treaty, that was important information for all Members to \nhave. We don't have that information now. The Department has been \nunable to tell us whether or not any of the activities which funds are \nbeing asked for in this bill, and to be authorized in the bill, are in \nconflict with the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. They have been unable \nto tell us. The thought behind the language was that if and when the \ntime comes when they do determine there is such a conflict, at that \ntime Congress should have an opportunity to vote.\n  Again, I emphasize that language, subject of much debate and much \ndissent, has now been withdrawn from this bill by myself and put into a \nseparate bill which is now on the Senate calendar. This was a very \ndifficult decision, I tell my good friend from New Jersey.\n  While the Senator is presiding, I must say how extraordinarily moving \nhe and Senator Torricelli were in New Jersey yesterday, as many \nSenators visited New Jersey after our visit to ground zero in New York \nCity. It helped Members get a full picture by our visit to New Jersey \nwith the presentations which were made to us by Senator Corzine, \nSenator Torricelli, by the Governor of New Jersey, and by so many \nmayors who helped to round out exactly what the effect was of that \nattack upon us on September 11. I know I speak for all who were present \nyesterday in New Jersey when our Presiding Officer, Senator Corzine, \nand Senator Torricelli made such an effective presentation. Many of us \nwere not aware that perhaps half of the people killed in that terrorist \nattack were residents of New Jersey. While New York City was ground \nzero, and we had severe losses at the Pentagon, New Jersey and also \nmany from Connecticut and I believe from as many as 40 or 50 other \ncountries were attacked by those terrorists. There were many, many \ncountries symbolized on that attack on the World Trade Center when \ncitizens from so many countries were killed in that attack. I think \nBritain lost literally hundreds of its citizens.\n  What was so dramatically presented to us yesterday was the fact that \nNew Jersey's families are suffering in as great a number as any other \nplace, including New York, as a result of that attack. I just wanted to \nthank Senator Corzine for his role in bringing us to New Jersey, along \nwith Senator Torricelli. It makes a difference.\n  Just as important as it is that we stand together in these days, \ncoming together where we can on a bill which is so important to the \ndefense of this Nation and to our security--and where we cannot agree, \ntrying to defer those other issues to a different time and place--it is \nalso important that our colleagues join us in trying to focus on issues \nthat directly relate to this bill as this bill comes before the Senate.\n  Obviously, amendments are appropriate. They always are appropriate. \nBut there are some amendments currently being filed that really cannot \nbe appropriately considered on this bill. It is going to require all \nthe efforts of all of us to focus on the material in this bill and the \nsubject matter of this bill if we are going to get a bill passed as it \nshould be passed urgently; if not today, and that is unlikely--by \nMonday or Tuesday.\n  (Mr. CORZINE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Today may be possible.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Today may be possible, I am told by my good friend, \nSenator Warner. We should not even eliminate that possibility. But if \nwe all cooperate in the kind of spirit which we have in bringing this \nbill to the committee and trying to avoid amendments which are not \nrelated to the subject matter of this bill, we have a chance of passing \nthis bill as it should be passed, with great urgency and with great \nunity and with one voice.\n  Senator Warner and I have spent a lot of time in the last few days \nworking to do just that--to be able to bring a bill to the floor where \nwe can say together that we, the members of the committee, all support \nthis bill now.\n  We hope other Members of the Senate will join in this debate, offer \namendments as they must, which relate to the subject matter, but help \nus to pass this bill with the urgency which is required and the unity \nwhich, God knows, is appropriated in circumstances such as this.\n  I want to say one other thing to my friend from Virginia before I \nyield; that is, how grateful this Nation is to him for his leadership \nin bringing to our attention the losses, the personal losses and the \ntragedies that were involved in the attack on the Pentagon. I was able \nto personally join with Senator Warner on a number of these visits that \nhe has made. I know how many hours he has spent with, not only the \nfamilies of those who have lost loved ones at the Pentagon but with the \nleadership at the Pentagon focusing on how to restore the Pentagon, to \nlet the terrorists know we are going to restore New York, we are going \nto restore the Pentagon, and we are going to restore any other places \nthey were able to damage.\n  But I thank Senator Warner because he has played the leadership role \nin bringing to the attention of the Nation that the losses in New York \nare the largest losses numerically, assuredly, but that we had almost \n200 people between the people working in the Pentagon and the people on \nthe airplane that hit the Pentagon, lost in Virginia. I know how his \nheart goes out to those families.\n  I can only tell him--I know he already knows every Member of this \nSenate is with you and with your colleague from Virginia in your \nefforts to bring some peace and closure and then some restoration to \nthose families and to your State. I thank you for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. The morning of \nSeptember 11 was a moving moment in the life of every American. Senator \nLevin and I, within a very short time after learning of the attacks \nboth in New York and in Virginia, and of course the devastation that \noccurred in Pennsylvania and the peripheral tragic consequences that \ncame upon the States of New Jersey, Connecticut, Maryland and the \nDistrict of Columbia, in close proximity to these attacks--I called my \nfriend and I said I think you and I should show our support at this \npoint in time for the men and women of the Armed Forces and for the \nPresident and for the Secretary of Defense.\n  I made a call to the Pentagon which resulted in the Secretary of \nDefense saying, ``Your participation this day of the attack would be \nwelcome and helpful.''\n  The two of us met and went to the Department of Defense. Just a few \nhours after that attack, Senator Levin, the Secretary of Defense, and I \nstood right there, about 100 yards or so from where that plane crashed \ninto that edifice, the Pentagon, which represents, to our men and women \nin uniform, the epicenter of the command and control of their destiny.\n  I thank my colleague for joining me that morning in going to the \nDepartment. I think every time I have had the opportunity to address \nthe Senate since that period, I begin by saying that all of us in the \nSenate have in our minds, in our prayers, the victims who were lost in \nthese attacks and their families, no matter where they are, around the \nnation and around the world. Yes, we have them in our prayers. But, \nthose prayers are combined with prayers for literally thousands of men \nand women: firefighters, policemen, rescue squads, hospital and Red \nCross workers, construction workers--that realm of individuals that \nshun recognition but who selflessly responded to those sites, first in \nNew York and then in a fraction of time in Virginia, to try to help at \nthose sites where the attacks were inflicted.\n  That band of brothers and sisters, as one fireman said to me, whether \nthey are in Virginia or New York or Pennsylvania, or from any of the \nmany States and localities that sent help, represent the finest \ntraditions of this great Nation about how we respond and help each \nother in time of need, all of us.\n  Now the Nation is arm in arm united behind our President, moving \nforward--steadily, carefully, thoughtfully--to address the needs of the \nNation and the means by which we, seeking justice, will bring about a \nredress\n\n[[Page S9569]]\n\nof these criminal acts, perhaps with the use of force, which is likely \nto be necessary. Of course, last night, as our President spoke, I and \nothers had in mind the men and women in the uniform of the United \nStates Armed Forces and their families who will bear the brunt if and \nwhen that force is used.\n  Mr. President, I thank my chairman. We have worked together in this \nchamber for 23 years and now we face another challenge. We are \nfortunate to have on our committee men and women who are absolutely \ncommitted to do what is necessary and proper to help this country in \nthis hour of challenge and need.\n  I think it is appropriate, following the President's magnificent \naddress last night--and I know of no President in the history of the \nUnited States of America who has ever been faced with a more \nchallenging, a more complex framework of international security issues, \neconomic issues, and threats to the United States than has our \nPresident, President Bush--that we now take up and swiftly pass this \nDefense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 2002 that provides the \nPresident the resources he has asked for and that our armed forces \nneed.\n  The President not only rose to the occasion last night, but I think, \nif I may say, he exceeded in every way our hopes and prayers that he \nwould take command--as he did--and deliver a very clear message.\n  Today, as the Senate turns to the consideration of our national \ndefense authorization bill for the year 2002, in this time of national \nemergency, it is time we provide our President and the men and women of \nthe Armed Forces, and the thousands of civilians who support those men \nand women, the requirements that they have for the coming fiscal year \nas best we can judge them.\n  The chairman indicated that the President would be forthcoming any \nday now with an amendment to the 2002 bill. Our committee and other \ncommittees of the Senate will immediately turn to that, upon receipt. \nIt is my expectation that it can be incorporated in this legislation \nduring the course of the conference between the House and the Senate.\n  The events of September 11 have forever changed this world, and \nforever changed the United States. The one change that is clear is that \nwe are a stronger nation today. That inherent strength emerged not a \nsecond after the infliction of these grave attacks. The 11th, when we \nsaw the smoke billowing from our homeland, is a day forever etched into \neveryone's memory.\n  The initial shock was followed by a surging sense of new purpose and \nstrength and, a word that all of us understand--``patriotism''--love of \ncountry for the freedoms that we have.\n  Now a responsibility and a challenge fall upon the Congress--a \ncoequal branch our Government--to work with our President and to serve \nour citizens. It is vital that we very carefully--as we have done--and \nexpeditiously address this bill and, hopefully, act on it. The \nleadership has been tremendously supportive of Senator Levin, myself, \nand other members of the committee throughout the course of the past \nfew days as we have worked to bridge our differences and bring this \nbill to the floor.\n  I hope we can pass this bill, for this bill will communicate a \nmessage to our citizens and to the world that the U.S. resolves to do \nwhatever is necessary to protect our homeland and our forces abroad, to \nwork with our allies for their mutual protection, and to address the \nfull spectrum of threats that confront our Nation, the entire Western \nWorld, and, indeed, all of civilization. As we have all heard and felt, \nthis was not just an attack on America, but an attack on the world and \nthe fundamental principles of civilization.\n  All of us in this Chamber have recognized the fact that this is an \nincreasingly dangerous world. There will be a time to look back on \nevents and how well we were prepared, and how we were not prepared, to \ndeal with this crisis. But those debates are yet to come. Now is the \ntime for unity. We have it here today in the Senate.\n  I addressed my caucus this morning outlining what Senator Levin and I \nhave agreed upon. He addressed his caucus. We bridged the one remaining \ndifference early this morning between the hours of 8 and 9. This \nmanagers' amendment, which we have just adopted by unanimous consent, \nin my judgment, satisfactorily addresses the remaining differences we \nhad.\n  When the authorization bill was reported out by the Armed Services \nCommittee almost 2 weeks ago, there was a division among its members. \nThat was understandable because our side--the Republican side--was \nunified behind what we saw were clear and justified requests by our \nPresident. The bill, at that time, contained certain provisions which \nwe believed might impede his ability under the Constitution as the \nchief architect of foreign policy to continue and, hopefully, conclude \ncertain negotiations he has undertaken with Russia with regard to the \nAnti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.\n\n  Further, we thought the dollar amounts which our President requested \nof the Congress for the purpose of initiating new research, development \nand testing with regard to our Nation's absolute necessity to prepare \nourselves today, and most especially for future generations, against \nthe threat of a limited attack on us, were inconsistent with what I \nbelieve are the President's justifiable requests. For that reason, we \nwere not able to report out, as is the tradition of our committee, a \nbipartisan bill.\n  But in the aftermath of the tragic events of September 11, the \ndistinguished chairman and I, working with our Members on both sides, \nhave now bridged these differences in large measure. We agree at this \ntime, for reasons I have stated, that we feel that, in the aftermath of \nthese attacks, the justification for moving forward with new ways to \nprepare this Nation against a limited attack of missiles is enhanced by \nwhat we saw on the 11th. It brought to us the realization that, yes, \nwhile there was some thought it was remote that a missile could attack \nthis Nation someday, now we cannot ignore or eliminate any part of that \nfull spectrum of threats that may be directed towards this country.\n  So, as never before, we are strongly committed to support our \nPresident.\n  In my own many years on this committee, I have worked as ranking \nmember with Chairman Nunn, Chairman Stennis, and others. There were \nrare times when the chairman and the ranking member of the Armed \nServices Committee recognized, for whatever reason, that they could no \nlonger have bipartisanship. I am reminded of two instances between \nSenator Nunn and myself. One was when we had a difference of view on \nthe Tower nomination, and the other was the Gulf War resolution giving \nPresident George H. W. Bush the authority to utilize force in 1991.\n  History reflects the outcome of those two events. But I remember that \nSenator Nunn and I shook hands. We recognized we had to go our \ndifferent ways, and we did it. In the aftermath of both events, we \nrejoined as the chairman and ranking of the committee to work together. \nSenator Levin and I have likewise done so.\n  There came a point in the course of our deliberations--it was \nactually last weekend following a joint appearance--when we were on a \nnational television show that I told him I felt I had to go my separate \nway and introduce legislation which reflected very clearly what we \nRepublicans perceived as the essentials that the Commander in Chief, \nthe President, desired and needed. This included preserving his ability \nto continue negotiations regarding the ABM Treaty and to prepare for a \nfuture, limited missile attack. Hopefully, God will never let that \nhappen. Regardless, we must make preparations.\n  For a while we went our separate ways. But then in due course, \nSenator Levin introduced this bill we are acting on today. I say to my \ncolleagues that I believe, along with the managers' amendment, this \nbill satisfies the concerns we had with the bill originally reported to \nthe Senate by the committee, with regards to the ABM Treaty and \nequitable funding for ballistic missile defense. After careful \nconsultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Deputy Secretary, and \nmany others--consultations I have had at length every day this past \nweek--I can represent to our chairman and to all members that the \nadministration now supports this bill as it is drawn.\n  Proceeding on, we have, as managers of this bill, introduced \nlegislation\n\n[[Page S9570]]\n\nwhich we believe should meet the expectations of the Senate and that \nthe Senate, hopefully, will act swiftly upon this bill. I did not \nrealize we would have the opportunity to consider this bill today, and \nI thank our leaders for recognizing the importance and timeliness of \nthis important legislation.\n  I hope Members, having heard the deliberations in our caucuses this \nmorning regarding this bill, know those areas in which they are \ninterested. If they have amendments, they should bring them to the \nfloor. Hopefully they will be germane to the provisions of this bill \nand respectful of the spirit of discretion our leaders have asked for \nso that we can move expeditiously on this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in sending our President and our \nfellow citizens in the world a message of this resolve by passing this \nbill. I remember also Governor Bush, when he was a candidate, reminded \nus almost prophetically in the Citadel in the fall of 1999 that: ``The \nprotection of America itself will assume a high priority in a new \ncentury. Once a strategic afterthought, homeland defense has become an \nurgent duty.'' In that same Citadel speech, he called for ``anti-\nballistic missile systems, both theater and national, to guard against \nattack and blackmail.'' He also called for strengthening our \nintelligence community and developing the technologies to detect \nchemical, biological, and nuclear weapons threatening our shores. The \nthreat, as he perceived it then, required greater emphasis on homeland \ndefense.\n  Our committee, when I was privileged to be chairman several years \nago, with the help of my now chairman, Senator Levin, established a \nsubcommittee entitled ``Emerging Threats.'' The responsibility of that \nsubcommittee was to provide the full committee with the wide spectrum \nof issues as they saw it with regard to known, anticipated, and \nunanticipated threats. This subcommittee examines whether the current \nelements of the national defense we have in place need to be \nstrengthened or, indeed, new initiatives taken to strengthen, to \nhopefully deter, and, if necessary, to respond to these threats. This \nsubcommittee has done a lot of valuable work. Senator Roberts was \nchairman; now Senator Landrieu is chairman. They have continued to \nprovide very helpful assistance to the full committee, and the full \ncommittee has acted in many ways to protect our country from the \ngrowing threat of terrorism.\n  When the bill was adopted by the committee this year--and I commend \nthe chairman--the chairman actually, with his initiative, added another \n$200 million towards antiterrorist activities. As he mentioned earlier, \npart of that increase was expanding the scope of research and \ndevelopment of unmanned military vehicles. I thank the chairman for his \nrecognition of my modest role in that. I assure you, I could not have \nachieved those initiatives as chairman without his support and that of \nthe other members of the committee.\n  The President of the United States has committed significant \nresources to deal with the types of terrorists threats we witnessed a \nweek ago. For fiscal year 2002, President Bush requested $5.6 billion \nfor the Department of Defense for activities to combat terrorism. This \nis a $1 billion increase over last year's level of funding. Again, the \nchairman added another $215 million, for which I commend him. With the \ncommittee's support, we clearly have a bill that addresses homeland \ndefense, and supports this highest priority concern our President \nbrought to the attention of the Nation in the fall of 1999 at the \nCitadel.\n  Missile defense, in my judgment, is a critical component of that \nhomeland defense. The President stands by his vision to prepare America \nand begin now to look at new options by which to prepare us to \nhopefully deter and then defend against a limited attack. This is \nclearly the time to stand by our President.\n  I remember when the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, \nGeorge Tenet, came before our committee. He has repeatedly warned us \nthat ``America's superpower status does not bestow invulnerability upon \nus but in fact makes us a target for the angry and disaffected of the \nworld.''\n  That was in his testimony. We as a Nation have grown accustomed to \nbeing safe within our borders. While many of us recognized the growing \nvulnerability, this vicious attack on our homeland removed all doubts \nabout the full spectrum of the capabilities, military and otherwise, \nthat the terrorists can use to inflict damage upon us.\n  We have heard incredible stories of courage and heroism amidst the \ntragedy of the past week and a half. Our Nation today, as the President \nsaid last night, remains in danger. All American citizens should \nunderstand that. I remember so clearly in my past experience with the \nmilitary, there was occasionally that sign--the all clear, sound the \nall clear bell aboard ships. And at my airbase in Korea, the cold \nwinter of 1951-1952: The all clear siren had blown--We could rest easy.\n  Today, that siren has not blown. I don't know, nor does anyone else \nknow, when that siren can be blown across this Nation. We are in danger \nat this moment. We remain in danger. But the world should know that we \nare a much stronger Nation, and we are prepared, with the men and women \nof the Armed Forces today and the other many resources that we have, to \ndeter and hopefully not let another attack hit this Nation.\n  I hope those Members who have amendments will come to the floor. I \nsee other Members seeking recognition. I hope our members of the \ncommittee will likewise come and express their views about this bill \nand their active participation on the committee.\n  Again, I thank our chairman. I thank all members of our committee and \nour magnificent staff, on both sides. We have produced a commendable \npiece of legislation which is deserving of prompt consideration and \nenactment by the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank both the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee and the ranking Republican, Senator Warner, for \ntheir diligent efforts in reaching this compromise. It means a lot to \nme, to the State of Colorado, and particularly to the Nation. When you \nconsider the events that happened just 10 days ago, those tragic \nevents, it is imperative that we get a Defense authorization bill to \nmove forward.\n  The way the issue of missile defense started out in the subcommittee \non which I am the ranking Republican, it was a rocky road. The chairman \nof that strategic subcommittee, Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, is a \ntremendous chairman. I like working with him. There are a couple of \ncommittees on which I serve with him, where he is the chairman and I am \nthe head Republican. Our working relationship I describe as superb. He \nlistens, tries to work with the minority side. I try and do everything \nI can to work with him. We have a very good relationship.\n  It was with a heavy heart, when reporting out of that subcommittee \nour portion of the armed services bill, we had it reported out in a \ndivided mode. We had a strict partisan vote, Republicans voting against \nit, Democrats were for it, the chairman. It was over the issue of \nmissile defense. Then the issue went to the full Armed Services \nCommittee and that debate continued.\n  I know when it got to that point in the debate, people began to lock \nin their positions, and we would still be tied up today if it would not \nhave been for the tremendous leadership of our chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, Senator Levin, as well as the ranking Republican \nworking together on this most important issue.\n  There are many other important issues in this bill. I am particularly \npleased that we have moved forward with missile defense. I am pleased \nthe restrictive language in missile defense was taken out and the \nfunding is there with the flexibility to either use for missile defense \nor for terrorism. The President, in light of the recent changes in the \nlast 10 days, needed that flexibility. I, for one, was more than \nwilling to give it to him.\n  I appreciate the efforts in the area of defense environmental \nmanagement of my chairman, what has been in the committee; in \nparticular, the support in the bill for closure sites which would \nbenefit the sites' surrounding communities and the Nation as a whole. \nThis\n\n[[Page S9571]]\n\nwould provide a clean and safe environment at the sites of former \ndefense nuclear weapons facilities. It would free up scarce resources \nas these sites are cleaned up and closed down to help advance \nenvironmental cleanup and restoration at other environmental management \nsites.\n  In my subcommittee, we had basically two functions.\n  We have the armed services function, and then also we have the Energy \nDepartment function. So we deal with many of the nuclear programs, as \nwell as the bombing programs and missile defense and defense \nintelligence. So I think this was important to the country as well as \nthe State of Colorado.\n  I also appreciate the efforts for the National Nuclear Security \nAdministration. The National Nuclear Security Administration appears to \nbe making important strides. There are still enormous challenges ahead, \nbut I think the NNSA seems to be moving in the right direction. In \nintelligence matters, I was encouraged by the support for unmanned \naerial vehicles, sensor capabilities, and commercial satellite imagery. \nI am still concerned, however, that other critical components of the \nintelligence architecture did not receive similar support.\n  Processing and dissemination of intelligence products remains a \nweakness in the overall system. Current programs in intelligence are \nunderfunded and would greatly benefit from increased support. \nHopefully, we have taken care of much of that with some of the funding \napproved by the Senate in the past week.\n  I was pleased with the support for greater Department of Defense \ninvolvement in the development of reusable launch vehicles. However, I \nshould note that I was disappointed that the committee had opted not to \nimplement any of the reforms of the Space Commission. This is an area \nof particular interest to me and to another former member of the \nsubcommittee, Senator Bob Smith.\n  There was a lot of hard work put into the Space Commission report. So \nI was very disappointed that there wasn't more consideration taken on \nthose recommendations.\n  I was also a member of another commission, the NRO Commission. Many \nof the provisions we recommended in our commission were adopted in the \nIntelligence Committee and then subsequently adopted in my subcommittee \nand the full Armed Services Committee.\n  So I think we have set the stage for us to move forward at this point \nin time. I am supportive of the bill and am pleased the chairman and \nthe ranking member could work out our differences and move forward. I \nlook forward to the debate, and I thank the ranking Republican for his \ntremendous statement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado yields the floor. \nWho seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have been listening intently to our \nchairman, our ranking member, as well as the Senator from Colorado. I \nfind myself in agreement with virtually everything that has been said. \nI think it is important for us to realize something that really has not \nbeen said, which is that on Friday, September 7, we met--the Senate \nArmed Services Committee. We passed out of the Armed Services Committee \nour Defense authorization bill. Four days later, we find ourselves at \nwar. So there are some things that have changed; the dynamics have \nchanged--those things which we know are urgent to our Nation's defense \nand to our national security. They weren't there back on September 7 \nwhen we passed our authorization bill.\n  I have around 14 amendments at the desk. It is not my intention to \noffer any of them now or call for a resolution to those. But I will be \ndoing it when we get into the bill on Monday.\n  One is to give the President the authority to waive sanctions against \nallies in our war on global terrorism. This was something we didn't \nreally anticipate on September 7. It was just a matter of weeks ago \nthat we passed sanctions against both India and Pakistan, which receive \nboth military and economic aid. There are some conditions under which \nthe President can waive these sanctions, but they are not too well \ndefined. They put him in a position, when negotiating with countries, \nwhere he doesn't have that authority firmly planted within his powers \nto do it. So I am going to propose in an amendment, No. 1593, that we \nprovide for notification in a 30-day period of time to Congress. But \nthe President can say, if you do this, we are going to lift sanctions.\n  You might argue that there are vehicles in place to lift sanctions \nright now. But if it happens that we are in recess at that time, if it \nhappens that there is some ambiguity as to whether or not Congress \nwould go along with it, this way he can say, yes, we are going to lift \nthese sanctions or waive these sanctions. I don't think there will be a \nlot of opposition to this. It is something that would give power to the \nPresident, who last night, I believe, gave the defining speech of his \ncareer.\n  Second, it deals with something more technical, but I think we need \nto look at it differently now, and that is depot maintenance. Depot \nmaintenance refers to the type of maintenance of our military fighting \nequipment that has to be done in a publicly owned depot. The idea \nbehind it, which has always been our policy, was we should have the \ncapability of doing core maintenance--maintenance that would help us in \ntimes of war--so that we don't take the risk of being held hostage by a \nsingle supplier or contractor. So what I am going to be suggesting is \nto change our waiver policy. What we have done over the past several \nyears is say, well, we do want the depots to have the capability of \nmaintaining our vehicles.\n\n  Take, for example, aircraft, the air logistics centers; there are \nthree. There used to be five; now there are three. They are operating \nwith equipment put in place back during World War II. It is outdated. \nWe still have on the books a law that says 50 percent of the core \nmaintenance has to be done in a public depot. So we have been operating \non waivers now for several years. The waivers are put in there by the \nSecretary of the Air Force, in this case, or the Secretaries.\n  This power should be changed so that there is a new accountability. \nWe have gone waiver after waiver after waiver, with no hope that in the \nfollowing year we would be able to do it without a national security \nwaiver. I will suggest it be written into the bill that we give the \nPresident of the United States the authority to waive the performance \nof depot level maintenance instead of the Secretary of the Air Force. \nIf the President signs the waiver, he must deliver a report that lists \nwhy the waiver is necessary and what will be done to prevent the waiver \nfrom being required in the future.\n  The President, under the amendment I will be offering, may delegate \nthis to another party. The President has that responsibility. This is \nwhat is missing because right now it goes from administration to \nadministration without any interest in really resolving the problem or \nsaying what we are doing to increase the capability of our public \ndepots in order to make the maintenance that is prescribed by law.\n  There are several others. I want to say that even though I am hoping \nthat the amendment I have filed--I have two, 1597 and 1596, that would \nattach to the Defense authorization bill an energy policy for America. \nLet me be critical not of Democrats, not of Republicans, but of both, \ngoing all the way back to the early eighties because then, when \nPresident Reagan was President of the United States, we tried to get \nhim to have an energy policy. In fact, Don Hodel was Secretary of the \nInterior at that time, or in that timeframe.\n  Mr. President, we had this dog and pony show where we went all around \nthe United States--to the consumption States, not the production \nStates--demonstrating clearly that the outcome of every war, back to \nand including the First World War, has been determined by who has \ncontrol of the energy. That is still true today.\n\n  Nobody believed it then. Since then we have gone through the Persian \nGulf war. We realize we have enemies in the Middle East, and yet to a \ngreat extent we are reliant on the Middle East for our ability to fight \na war. It is insane we should continue that policy.\n  I know there are a lot of Members who are asking why it is an issue \nright now. It is an issue now because this is a readiness issue. I \nspent 5 years as\n\n[[Page S9572]]\n\nchairman of the Readiness Subcommittee. It is now chaired by my \ndistinguished colleague from Hawaii, Senator Akaka, and I am his \nranking member.\n  I can tell you right now that we are not ready in many areas to fight \nthe war we are looking at right now. One of those areas is our \ndependency on foreign oil.\n  Let me put up a chart. My amendment is not a partisan attack. I hope \nmy colleagues do not take it as such. I have been urging Democrats and \nRepublicans to deal with this for years, and they have refused to do \nit. Even George Sr., coming from an oil patch, said: Yes, we have to \nhave an energy policy, the cornerstone of which would be the maximum \npercentage of the energy we need to fight a war.\n  In the year 2000, 19.6 million barrels a day was used for the \nconsumers of America. I guess what I am trying to say is, our need for \npetroleum consumption has been going up for a long time. From the year \n2000 to 2001, it is up to 19.7 million barrels of oil a day. That is on \nthe rise.\n  The second chart shows our domestic oil production has sharply \ndecreased over the last 10 years. We have produced less domestic oil \nsince World War II. In January of 1991, we produced 17.6 million \nbarrels a day, and that has dropped down to 6 million barrels a day \nduring this timeframe.\n  On chart No. 3, we can see that our domestic oil production continues \nto decrease while our consumption continues to increase. This was not \ntrue in the days when we started calling this to the public's \nattention, but it is true today.\n  That means we are getting oil from foreign sources, and that is what \nthis chart shows. It shows our imports in that same year, January of \n1991, were 4.6 million barrels a day, and they went up to 8 million \nbarrels a day. It has almost doubled since that period of time.\n  Our dependence on foreign oil has dramatically increased since 1973 \nand is projected to increase in the future. Currently, 56.6 percent of \nU.S. oil needs are met by foreign sources. This presents a real energy \nand national security problem. The military is equally dependent on \nforeign oil, as is the general public. We must seek to drastically \nincrease a domestically produced, diverse energy supply, including \nnuclear, coal, oil, gas, and renewables.\n  All these sources of energy are addressed in the House bill, and I \nhave one amendment that would merely adopt the language in the House \nbill and also the language in the bill from the Senate Energy \nCommittee.\n  Looking at our dependence on foreign oil imports and how it has \nescalated, we are today at 56 percent. We were at 36 percent when I \ntalked about going around the country alerting people to the \nseriousness of the problem. In the same progression, we are going to be \nup to 66-percent dependent upon foreign sources in our ability to fight \na war.\n  What is most startling is that we depend on nations in the Middle \nEast, such as Iraq, to supply our oil needs. The Middle East supplies \nabout 25 percent of our oil needs. What shocks an awful lot of people \nis that of that amount, we are importing 862,000 barrels a day from \nIraq, a country we just defeated in a war 10 years ago, a country whose \nPresident made the statement that: If we had waited 10 years to march \ninto Kuwait, the Americans would not have come to their aid because we \nwould have the capability of lobbing a missile at them. That is the \ndilemma in which we find ourselves today. That is why I say this is a \nnational defense issue.\n\n  Iraq is the fastest growing source of United States oil imports. That \nis the same nation that we took military action against seven times \nlast month, the same nation we know has links to bin Laden, who is the \nprime suspect in the horrible attacks in New York and Washington, as \nwell as the U.S.S. Cole and both Embassy bombings in East Africa.\n  This is a major national security problem. Energy will be critical if \nand when America engages in military action.\n  Operating a modern war machine requires a lot more oil than it used \nto. A contemporary 17,500-soldier U.S. Army division uses twice as much \noil daily than did an entire 200,000-soldier field army during World \nWar II.\n  The 450,000 barrels of petroleum products consumed daily by the \n582,000 soldiers in the Persian Gulf was four times the daily amount \nused by the 2 million allied soldiers who liberated Europe from the \nNazis. Today it takes eight times as much oil to meet the needs of each \nsoldier as it did during World War II, and the Department of Defense \naccounts for nearly 80 percent of all U.S. Government energy use.\n  What I am saying is this is a very serious issue, and this is an \nissue that directly relates to our readiness, relates to our ability to \ndefend America, and relates to our ability to carry on the war which we \nare in right now. It is very important that we pass an energy package. \nI don't care if it is the House wording, I don't care if it is the \nwording that came out of the Senate Energy Committee, but it directly \nrelates to our ability to fight a war.\n  It will be perfectly acceptable to me if we make an arrangement \nwhereby we agree to passing a comprehensive energy policy by the end of \nthis year and not having it as a part of the Defense authorization bill \nbecause it would complicate things. It is very important we pass our \nDefense authorization bill and get it into conference and signed into \nlaw in a very short period of time.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Armed Services \nCommittee actions on the fiscal year 2002 Defense authorization bill. I \nalso commend the chairman, Mr. Levin, and ranking member, Mr. Warner, \nfor their part in leading the committee, as well as guiding the \ncommittee, in their efforts to bring about a bill that will give \nconfidence to the people of our country.\n  My friend and partner, Senator Inhofe, and I have worked closely to \nensure that the Readiness Subcommittee's actions support the full \ncommittee's five goals for this bill. As Chairman Levin has described, \nthese goals are: One, to continue improvements in the quality of life; \ntwo, to sustain readiness; three, to encourage transformation; four, to \nimprove the capability of the Department of Defense to meet \nnontraditional threats; and five, to increase the efficiency of \nDepartment of Defense operations.\n  Our subcommittee worked together to make contributions in all five \nareas, and these actions are reflected in the bill we present to you \ntoday.\n  In the area of improving quality of life, the bill takes strong steps \nto improve the facilities in which our military personnel work and the \nhousing in which they and their families live. This bill supports the \n$10.0 billion administration request for military construction and \nfamily housing for fiscal year 2002, which is a 10-percent increase \nover fiscal year 2001 levels. This funding will, according to \nDepartment of Defense calculations, reduce the current 192-year \nreplacement cycle for military facilities to 101 years. While this is a \nsignificant improvement, this figure is still nearly double the \nstandard of approximately 57 years accepted in the private sector.\n  The bill invests an additional $451 million from savings and \nefficiencies achieved elsewhere in the budget to make further \nimprovements in military facilities, including projects to enhance \nmission performance, build additional unaccompanied housing and family \nhousing, purchase key tracts of land at military installations to \nprevent future encroachment problems, and adequately fund legally \nbinding cleanup requirements at facilities closed by previous base \nclosure rounds.\n  The bill also includes an increase of $40.0 million for personal gear \nfor military members to improve their safety and comfort in the field.\n  The committee's second theme was one that I and the whole committee \ncare deeply about: sustaining the readiness of our Armed Forces.\n  This bill supports the funding increases contained in the \nadministration's budget request to more accurately reflect the \nincreased use of spare parts and the higher prices for spare parts \nassociated with older weapons systems. In addition to the requested \nincreases, the bill provides almost $100 million in additional funding \nfor maintenance work on surface ships and other Marine Corps and Navy \nequipment. These funds will increase the\n\n[[Page S9573]]\n\navailability of equipment to units and allow them to spend more time \ntraining.\n\n  The bill also supports the budget request for an increase of seven \npercent in real terms for facilities sustainment, restoration and \nmodernization over fiscal year 2001 levels. I believe that these \nadditional funds will provide critical improvements to service members' \nplaces of work, allowing for greater productivity and increased job \nsatisfaction.\n  I also believe that further advances in sustainment, restoration and \nequipment maintenance are possible, in particular by increasing \nattention to corrosion prevention technologies and products. As I know \nfrom the military facilities in Hawaii and elsewhere in the Pacific, \nmaintaining military equipment and facilities in wet, salty, and hot \nenvironments is a significant challenge. I believe progress can be made \non this critical issue that will both improve the service life of our \nproperty and the lives of our service members who have to maintain this \nproperty.\n  This bill includes a $7.4 million increase for anti-corrosion product \ntesting and treatments, and directs the Department of Defense to \ncoordinate anti-corrosion research and testing across the military \nservices. The bill also supports small increases in a limited number of \nammunition programs to reduce training and war reserve shortfalls and \nenhance troop safety.\n  The committee's third goal was encouraging transformation. This bill \nincludes small increases to support necessary training for the Army's \nnew Interim Brigade Combat Teams (IBCTs), a critical step in the Army's \ntransformation to a lighter, more rapidly-deployable force. Other \nactions taken by the Readiness Subcommittee to improve efficiency \nshould also result in savings in both the current and future budgets, \nsavings that can be redirected to the necessary process of transforming \nour armed forces.\n  The committee's fourth priority was to improve the Department of \nDefense's capability to meet non-traditional threats, the importance of \nwhich was made painfully and sorrowfully clear to us all last week. \nMany of my colleagues will speak forcefully on this issue, and I share \ntheir sentiments of outrage and extreme sadness as we cope with this \nhorrendous attack. The committee looks forward to bringing further \nrecommendations to our colleagues on this critical issue in the near \nfuture. Until this occurs, the bill before us will provide funding for \nthe requested improvements to bases and installations that will \nincrease the safety of our forces at home and abroad.\n  The fifth theme of our bill this year was to improve the efficiency \nof DOD programs and operations. This is a goal the committee shares \nwith Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and we look forward to \nworking with him closely to make further progress on this in the \nfuture. The bill presented here today takes important steps to help us \nalong the path.\n  In the area of acquisition reform, the bill includes a number of \nprovisions to improve the acquisition of equipment and services. One \nprovision would require the Department to set up a management \nstructure, management information system, and program review structure \nfor the Department's contracts for services. A related provision would \nestablish savings goals for services contracts and goals that would be \nachieved through the application of best commercial practices, \nincluding competition, performance-based contracting, and spending \nanalyses.\n  Another provision strengthens requirements for competition for \nmultiple-award contracts to purchase products and services, and would \nrequire approval for sole-source awards. The bill also includes \nprovisions enabling DOD to shorten the acquisition cycle for weapons \nsystems by codifying a technological maturity requirement for key \ntechnologies to be incorporated into new systems.\n  Other provisions of the bill address acquisition workforce issues and \naim to ensure that the defense components have sufficient staff to \nmanage requirements in a cost effective manner. I was impressed by the \nwork of the Acquisition 2005 Task Force's recent report, ``Shaping the \nCivilian Acquisition Work Force of the Future.'' I intend to confer \nwith the Task Force to further define the extent of the problem. As the \nchairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on \nInternational Security, Proliferation, and Federal Services as well as \nthe Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness, the issues raised \nby the Task Force are of great interest to me.\n  This bill also takes steps to improve financial management within \nDOD. Specifically, it includes a provision that would refocus \ncomptroller and auditor resources on addressing systemic problems in \nDOD financial systems rather than wasting resources on reviews of \nfinancial statements. Another provision codifies the Department's \nSenior Financial Management Oversight Council and financial feeder \nsystems compliance process to provide top-level guidance in addressing \nfinancial management problems.\n  Though the committee finished its work just days prior to last week's \nterrible attacks in New York and at the Pentagon, I believe that the \nbill we produced is just as relevant today as it was then. This bill \nlays a firm foundation to fortify our armed forces, takes many \nimportant actions to sustain and improve their readiness in both the \nshort- and the long-term, and represents a product which I commend to \nmy colleagues. I urge your support for this bill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I was going to make a statement on an \namendment I had filed. I did not know the Senator from Georgia was \nabout to speak now. I will be happy to yield to him.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am glad to work with the distinguished \nSenator from Texas, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly on an \namendment I offered to the armed services bill. It relates to survivor \nbenefits for people in the military who are killed in the line of duty. \nI had offered this amendment with Senator Inouye actually before \nSeptember 11, the day that changed all of our lives, because I thought \nthere was an injustice in the law as it deals with our military \npersonnel; that is, if someone died in a training accident or in the \nline of duty but had not yet retired, he or she would not be entitled \nto any retirement benefits, even the benefits already earned. So if \nsomeone died after 10 years of service and had not had the opportunity \nto serve the full 20 years, the survivors would have no benefits.\n  I do not think that is the way to treat our military families, so I \nhave been working on a piece of legislation that would allow those \npeople who die in the line of service while on active duty to have the \nretirement benefits for their survivors--just what they have already \naccumulated. It would not give them the full 20 years, but it would \ngive them the 5 years they served or the 10 years they served. This is \nsomething that now takes on an even bigger, more important role as we \nare dealing with the issues of September 11 because, as we know, over \n100 of our military personnel were in the Pentagon and were killed in \nthe line of service while on active duty.\n  So I am offering this amendment, once again, to the armed services \nbill. I hope it will be accepted. I hope both sides will agree that all \nthose who were in the Pentagon at the time should have the survivor \nbenefits to which they are entitled by their years of service.\n  The interesting thing about this is that the very parts of the \nPentagon where this particular issue was being worked is the part that \nwas hit.\n  I want to specifically mention a couple of the people who were in the \nPentagon and who are now missing who were really pushing for my \nlegislation to go forward--not for themselves because they were already \nretired. But they knew about the dangers of not taking care of our \npeople. They were in the Pentagon talking to the personnel\n\n[[Page S9574]]\n\nabout the necessity of this particular piece of legislation. COL Gary \nF. Smith, who was the Chief of Army Retirement Services, and Army MSG \nMax Beilke were working on this legislation. Those two men were in the \nPentagon and are now missing as of September 11, 2001. LTC Smith wrote \nto my staff about this legislation on June 15 saying:\n\n       Those of us who work on these issues daily know how \n     important this will be. We'll keep our fingers crossed and \n     hope it will get into law.\n\n  That was written to Jimmie Keenan, who is an Army nurse on my staff \ndetailed to me as an Army fellow. She is an expert in this area and has \nworked tirelessly on this issue. She has worked long hours. It was \nbecause of her experience in working with her fellow members of the \nmilitary medical corps that she realized there was something wrong. \nMany times in a training accident, for instance, we go through an \nelaborate procedure to medically retire someone who is already dead. \nThat is what we have been doing--where we could--if someone died in a \ntraining accident. Before we declare a military person dead, we go \nthrough a process that medically retires that person.\n  My staff says this isn't right; why would we go through this process \nwhen the family is already in trauma and the people around the person \nwho has died are in trauma? Why do we have to go through that? Why \ndon't we just say when someone dies in the line of duty, for heaven's \nsake, they should have the benefits to which they are entitled by the \nnumber of years they serve?\n  She went to work. It is a great idea. Another fellow knew what was \nneeded. And they worked on this for almost a year.\n  It just happens that the people who were working on it with her in \nthe Pentagon will not be able to see this bill pass. But what they will \nget is the comfort of knowing that their families are going to be taken \ncare of in a much better way than before.\n  I am asking the managers of the bill to put this provision in the \nmanagers' amendment. I think it is a very important part of taking care \nof all members of the military--not only the ones who have died before \nand not only the ones who died on September 11.\n  I think this is an important message to the members of our military \nwho are getting ready to be called up. Many are already called up. Many \nare waiting for those orders. That is what our military does. They wait \nuntil they are called up to serve their country. They are waiting to be \ncalled to service today as we speak and as we are seeing the \npreparations to enact the war against terrorism that our President so \neloquently laid out for the people of America.\n  As we know, the brunt of carrying out the President's orders is going \nto be on the men and women of our military. I want them to answer the \ncall knowing that if anything does happen to them, their survivors will \nbe entitled to the benefits of their retirement for whatever number of \nyears prorated they would be entitled to under the preretirement laws.\n  I thank Jimmie Keenan and Ray Ivie in my office, along with Michael \nRalsky and David Davis who have also helped on this issue.\n  In memory of LTC Gary Smith and MSG Max Beilke, I ask that this \namendment be accepted.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, it has been an incredible 10 days.\n  I was reading in the New York Times today a marvelous quote of John \nKennedy that I think is appropriate for where this country stands as we \nface our future.\n\n       Only in winter can you tell which trees are truly green. \n     Only when the winds of adversity blow can you tell whether an \n     individual or a country has steadfastness.\n\n  In so many ways over the last week and a half, it has been my honor \nand personal privilege to be a part of this great body, to see its \nsteadfastness in the face of adversity, and to see the wonderful staff \npeople come back to work even though they knew they were at least for a \nmoment in time a target of the terrorists.\n  It has been encouraging to see the steadfastness of my own people in \nmy own home State of Georgia as they rally for the cause.\n  It has been a marvelous thing to experience, watching television and \nseeing the experience of New Yorkers who rose to the occasion to honor \ntheir firefighters, and to honor their policemen, and who did what it \nwas difficult to do in dealing with that terrifying situation which \nstill goes on this day.\n  But one element of steadfastness we are showing is that this \nlegislative process continues. The Senate Armed Services Committee was \nbusy buttressing the defense of America before the attack. We are busy \ntoday buttressing the defense of America after the attack.\n  I would like to discuss today this pending legislation--the Defense \nauthorization bill for fiscal year 2002.\n  Just 2 short weeks ago, the Senate Armed Services Committee completed \nits markup of this authorization bill, which I heavily support. After \nthe tragic events of last week, in a very timely fashion, we bring this \nmeasure to the floor to begin the process of providing our military men \nand women with the resources they will need to respond in this crisis.\n  As all of us are aware, last week people and property of the United \nStates were attacked in a vicious, deliberate, cowardly, and inhumane \nfashion. The full cost of this attack is only now becoming clearer.\n  In the days that followed the attack, I was often asked what I \nthought was the historical meaning of this moment. I have often quoted \nAdmiral Yamamoto who planned and executed the attack against Pearl \nHarbor. Afterwards, he was quoted as saying he feared he had only \n``awakened a sleeping giant.'' In so many ways I think that is exactly \nwhat has happened to our country. We have become awakened. This \nsleeping giant called America is now awakened.\n  What is also clear to the perpetrators of this crime, while being \nunified against our country, is that we are now unified against them. \nThe President spoke eloquently and with great strength last night in \nthat regard. But I will say that the U.S. military will not be alone in \nthis fight. Indeed, I have spent some time this morning listening to \ntestimony before the Governmental Affairs Committee regarding how we \nought best to support the President's establishment of a National \nOffice for Homeland Security. In that hearing, it was the unanimous \nconsent of the witnesses that the current effort of the myriad agencies \ninvolved in the fight against terrorism, including the Department of \nDefense, must be better coordinated.\n  The Government Accounting Office report recently released--actually \nreleased yesterday--sums up the issue succinctly. ``Current Federal \nefforts,'' the GAO says, ``to combat terrorism are inherently difficult \nto lead and manage because the policies, strategies, programs, budgets, \nand activities are spread across more than 40 different Federal \nagencies.''\n  Since the problem appears to be one of coordination--and the GAO has \nfingered that--I believe the President's Office of Homeland Security is \nan excellent solution. It promises to adapt our Government to \naccomplish more effective counterterrorism coordination and assign \nresponsibility for measurable results.\n  It is simple enough to be rapidly implemented--and that is \nimportant--without disrupting the operations of the agencies which are \naffected.\n  I join the distinguished chairman of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, Senator Lieberman, in his desire to move quickly to support \nthe President's action with appropriate legislation.\n  Notwithstanding the fact that our response to terrorism will involve \nmany agencies, it will be our military that will be on the cutting \nedge--the tip of the spear, so to speak. It will be our military, our \nyoung men and women, that will wage one of the most visible and \ndangerous attacks that we have seen in many, many years. They are on \nthe cutting edge of this war on terrorism. For many around the world, \nthe performance of our military will characterize our success or \nfailure in the war on terrorism.\n  As the military carries out its critical part in the war, we must \nalso continue to provide for our military men and women in terms of \ntheir security as they protect our national security. This bill does \nthat.\n\n[[Page S9575]]\n\n  Prior to the recent terrorist attacks, the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee increased the original budget request for combating terrorism \nby well over $200 million. This increase includes over $100 million to \nsupport research and development aimed at detecting, defending against, \nand responding to the use of weapons of mass destruction. The other \nhalf of this increase--over $100 million--would increase the ability of \nU.S. forces to deter and U.S. installations to defend against a \nterrorist attack.\n  Within this latter total, the committee determined that the Army had \nan unfunded mandate for installation security, and we provided an \nadditional $778 million to address this need.\n  The committee also added funding of almost $14 million for U.S. \nspecial operations for the special operations command. Though we expect \nadditional requests and will identify future needs, the measure pending \nbefore the Senate continues this committee's bipartisan efforts to \nprovide a solid foundation for combating terrorism.\n  Just one anecdote: On the last day of consideration of this massive \nbill, authorizing over $300 billion to be spent for our defense, one of \nthe questions I asked my fellow committee members was: Defense against \nwhat? What is the threat? This was 2 weeks ago.\n  Senator Pat Roberts, the distinguished Senator from Kansas, for the \nlast couple years has been the chairman of the Subcommittee on Emerging \nThreats. Senator Mary Landrieu from Louisiana is now the chairman of \nthat subcommittee. I asked both of them in their research, in their \nhearings, in their study of the real threat against America: What is \nit? What are we defending against?\n  Both agreed the most likely threat to the country was a terrorist \nattack, a stealthy attack, with no known address, no return to sender \naddress, especially biological or chemical attack. That was the threat \nNo. 1. Threat No. 2 was cyber-warfare against our Internet, against our \ncomputers to, in effect, shut us down in terms of our communications \nand our data processing.\n  I thought about that last Tuesday when we had the terrifying attack \non this country. We were zeroing in on the fact that the real honest to \ngoodness threat against this Nation was going to be a terrorist attack.\n  Today I had the pleasure of visiting with two former Members, Senator \nWarren Rudman and Senator Gary Hart, part of the Hart-Rudman \ncommission, who months ago identified the chilling fact that it wasn't \na question of whether this country was going to get hit by a terrorist \nattack but when. Lord knows, we have learned that lesson.\n  As we proceed in the days and weeks and months ahead to consider \nadditional counterterrorist efforts, I cite an editorial that appeared \nin Monday's Atlanta Journal Constitution.\n  In that editorial, former U.S. Senator Sam Nunn, in whose seat I now \nsit, whose position I now have in the Senate and position I have on the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, coauthor of the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative \nThreat Reduction Act, who currently serves as cochairman of the Nuclear \nThreat Initiative, clearly summarized the threat we face and outlined \nsome key elements that should be included in our response.\n  Senator Nunn points out that the terrorists' murderous deeds are \nlimited only by the weapons they are able to employ--limited only by \nthe weapons they are able to employ. He notes that the disintegration \nof the former Soviet Union left many thousands of tons of nuclear, \nbiological, and chemical weapons, along with the scientists who worked \nwith those weapons, adrift in an eroding infrastructure of inadequate \ncontrols and depressed economies.\n  We must prevent terrorist groups from exploiting this situation to \nobtain weapons of mass destruction, weapons materials and know-how. As \nwe have only narrowly averted some attempts by terrorists to purchase \nthese materials in recent years, I call on my colleagues to act on the \nrecommendation of the bipartisan task force that called for a fourfold \nincrease in the funding of programs aimed at reducing the threat of \ninadequately safeguarding weapons, materials, and know-how in Russia.\n  As Senator Nunn correctly states:\n\n       We must develop a comprehensive defense against the full \n     range of threats based on relative risk and supported by \n     strong alliances around the world so that the pain of today \n     will not be known by the children of tomorrow.\n\n  In the trials to come, we must remember our military might springs \nfrom the willingness of our people to serve. I have always thought, \nsince I was a young serviceman in Vietnam, 35 years ago, the key to our \ndefense is our defenders. They are the military and civilian personnel \nwho make up the Department of Defense. They are our defenders.\n  As chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee of the Armed Services \nCommittee, I am pleased to inform the Senate that this authorization \nmeasure is a good bill and the provisions that address the needs of our \nmilitary men and women and their families enjoy the full and bipartisan \nsupport of all members of our committee.\n  Some of the personnel provisions in this legislation include: total \nfunding for personnel-related items at a level of $106 billion, about \n$7 million over the original budget request; and support for the \nrecommended active duty end strength requested by the administration. \nThis includes an increase of over 3,000 personnel in the Navy and \nalmost an increase of 2,000 in the Air Force. This bill provides an \nincrease in the full-time manning end strength by almost 2,000 \npersonnel. This is the first installment of an 11-year plan to increase \nfull-time manning, which is one of the top readiness priorities for the \nReserves.\n  As we now know, some 50,000 reservists have already been called up. \nAll of our State adjutant generals have said to us that they need help \nwith the shortage in full-time support that they receive from the \nactive duty force.\n  This bill also provides a significant pay raise--well above the rate \nof inflation--for all military personnel.\n  Mr. President, again, for our troops in the field, military \npersonnel, there is a significant pay raise in this bill, well above \nthe rate of inflation. We recommend a targeted pay raise that ranges \nfrom 5 percent to 10 percent, beginning in January of 2002. It is \nbetween 5 and 10 percent. Enlisted personnel and junior officers will \nreceive a pay raise of at least 6 percent or more.\n  We also extend the special pays and bonuses that are so important for \nrecruiting and retention. As someone who has served on the Personnel \nSubcommittee over the last 5, 5\\1/2\\ years, and now chairs that \nsubcommittee, as you know, we have been struggling with recruitment and \nretention. I am pleased to report the military services have seen a \nburst of recruitment around the country. That is another sign that the \nsteadfastness of this country is sound, particularly when we are \nthreatened.\n  Acceleration by 2 years of the existing plan to gradually increase \nthe basic allowance for quarters to eliminate average out-of-pocket \nexpenditures for off-post housing by 2005--accelerate that by 2 years--\nthe BAH will cover median housing costs by 2003. We have capped the \naverage out-of-pocket expenditures for 2002 at 7.5 years.\n  The bill authorizes a significant increase in funding for the defense \nhealth program, which includes full funding for TRICARE for Life. That \nis for the military retirees over 65. This is the retiree benefit that \nthis committee initiated. The bill includes an authorization of an \nexpanded benefit for disabled dependents of active duty personnel. This \nbenefit includes comprehensive health care, home health care, and case \nmanagement services for the disabled family member and respite care for \nthe primary caregiver to the disabled family member. We recognize that \nproviding for the special needs of disabled family members increases \nthe capability of service members to perform their military mission.\n  The bill also includes two new initiatives to help retain service \nmembers with critical skills. As a matter of fact, I was surprised to \nactually learn that part of the report recommended a focus on terrorist \nattacks and an emphasis on homeland defense. This report by Senator \nRudman and Senator Hart also included recommendations to dramatically \nupgrade the Montgomery GI bill. Some of those recommendations were \nalready in this authorization bill.\n  These initiatives include my own initiative, which I worked on for 3 \nyears with my staff, to allow service members to transfer up to 18 \nmonths of unused Montgomery GI bill benefits to\n\n[[Page S9576]]\n\nfamily members and Senator Hutchinson's education savings bond \ninitiative. Both of these help the educational package now available to \nservice men and women.\n  The bill also authorizes retired service members with a service-\nconnected disability to receive both military retired pay and veterans \ndisability compensation, contingent upon the President proposing and \nCongress authorizing an offset.\n  The bill also authorizes pilot programs with the VA for a joint \nprogram of graduate medical education, and for the VA to conduct \nseparation and retirement physicals.\n  Finally, the bill authorizes $35 million for impact aid and $5 \nmillion for impact aid for children with severe disabilities. Not only \nis this bill good for our service members, but this year's Defense \nauthorization bill provides critical resources to sustain and improve \nthe strength of America's Armed Forces, from funding initial production \nof the world's most advanced fighters, such as the F-22, to addressing \ninfrastructure concerns, to adding to our airlift capabilities, and \nproviding extra C-130s--shortfalls that DOD identified, and it \nguarantees that we as a nation are continuing the strong tradition of \nsupporting our military, as well as preparing for the threats of the \nfuture.\n  In conclusion, I thank Chairman Levin for his leadership and hard \nwork on this bill and the ranking Republican, Senator Warner--he and \nhis staff. They have made a strong contribution to this year's \nauthorization bill.\n  I think we should all commend these two gentlemen for their \ntremendous dedication to our Nation's military and their continued \nexample of true bipartisan cooperation and accomplishment.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude with a line that I came across when I \nwas going through Reserve Officer Training Corps school as a young \ncadet, written by one of Wellington's troops after the Battle of \nWaterloo, after the glory of the battle had long since faded. He wrote \nonce that:\n\n     In time of war and not before,\n     God and the soldier men adore,\n     But in time of peace, with all things righted,\n     God is forgotten and the soldier slighted.\n\n  Mr. President, over the last 10 days, this country has in many ways \nrediscovered our God and certainly has rediscovered our soldiers, our \nservice men and women. This bill is in their interest. I urge my \ncolleagues to adopt it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, a number of our colleagues have been \ncalling both leaders asking for some update on the schedule for the \nday. I wanted to notify Senators that the negotiations on the airline \nlegislation have just been concluded. So it is my expectation that we \nwill take the bill up within the next hour and a half.\n  All Senators should be on notice that we will attempt to get a \nunanimous consent agreement to move to the bill shortly after the \nlegislation has been drafted, and it would be my expectation to take \nthe bill up immediately. There would be most likely a rollcall vote \nbefore the end of the day. I guess, in the 3:30 to 4 o'clock range we \nwill take the bill up. I am not sure about the length of the debate. We \nwill have a rollcall vote on that legislation before the end of the \nday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks of \nthe chairman and the ranking member, as well as the eloquent statement \nthat my colleague, Senator Cleland, has just made.\n  This is a good bill. It is one that strengthens our military and \nenhances the quality of life for our Armed Forces and prepares our \nNation to confront terrorism.\n  One group of Americans will be on the front line of the new war on \nterrorism: our reservists and National Guard members. President Bush \nhas authorized a callup of 50,000 of these citizen soldiers. They may \nsoon leave their families and civilian jobs and, at a great personal \nsacrifice, report to active duty. They will be among those who will \nconfront our enemies, defending our freedoms in a shadowy and \npotentially brutal war.\n  Our Nation must do all we can to support these brave men and women \nand their families. There are many things we need to do to address the \nissues for reservists' quality of life. One of those is to ensure that \nthose who are called to duty and their families have access to \nuninterrupted health care coverage.\n  Currently, when reservists are called up, they are temporarily \nconsidered active duty components. While they are in harm's way, \nmembers of the Reserves and National Guard and their dependents are \nentitled to the same military health care coverage as other military \npersonnel, with what is called TRICARE. Reservists who have deployed \nfor more than 30 days during a major contingency may extend their \nmilitary health care coverage for 30 days after they return.\n  I have discussed this issue at length with several reservists and the \nleadership of the Missouri National Guard, and I can tell you 30 days \nsimply is not enough. Oftentimes, civilian employers are unable to \nrestore the reservists' health care benefits immediately. In other \ncases, Reserve members have quit their jobs before deploying and have \nno source of insurance when they return home.\n  On Monday I will offer an amendment on behalf of myself and Senators \nDeWine, Leahy, Landrieu, Johnson, Breaux, Bingaman, Dodd, and Thurmond. \nThe amendment is based on legislation I introduced with Senator DeWine \nearlier this year with seven co-sponsors. Our amendment will allow \nreservists returning from deployments without health care, to extend \ntheir TRICARE coverage for up to 180 days or until their civilian \nhealth insurers return their coverage to them.\n  This legislation would address the circumstances faced by reservists \nlike Capt. Terri McGranahan. She volunteered to be a part of our \npeacekeeping mission in Kosovo. During her service, she worked in a \nhealth clinic that had been newly painted with a toxic sealant. Working \nin this clinic had made her very ill, resulting in pneumonia. \nEventually, she developed a spot on her lung. She did not detect this \ncondition right away. When she finally sought medical treatment, the 30 \ndays of TRICARE coverage had already expired.\n  When she returned home, her private health insurance company refused \nto cover her. She asked the Army for help, but was turned down. Captain \nMcGranahan has fallen through the cracks of two health care \nbureaucracies.\n  We have to do better than this.\n  Mr. President, my amendment will provide comfort to thousands of \nreserve families whose loved ones risk their lives defending our \nNation. But more important it would be part of our national effort to \nunite behind our troops during this time of national crisis.\n  The bill on which the amendment is based has been endorsed by 28 \norganizations across the country, including the Reserve Officers \nAssociation, National Guard Association, Enlisted Association of the \nNational Guard, the Air Force Association, the Association of the U.S. \nArmy, and several other organizations promoting quality of life for our \nservice men and women.\n  Over 50,000 reservists may soon be called into service. As President \nBush himself has said, ``We're talking about somebody's mom, or \nsomebody's dad, somebody's employee, somebody's friend, or somebody's \nneighbor.''\n  Our initial cost estimate for our original bill was just 5 million \ndollars a year. This proposal is not extravagant in a $343 billion \ndefense budget. It is the right thing to do, and it is needed right \nnow. This is not a permanent solution. We need a full health care \nprogram for these service men and women. The Defense authorization bill \nrequires the Pentagon to study this issue, and I look forward to \nreviewing it. But in the meantime, I am pleased to offer this amendment \nin the name of our Missouri's National Guard and Reservists, as well as \nour country's other citizen soldiers.\n  General Eisenhower once said:\n\n       Leadership cannot be exercised by the weak. It demands \n     strength--the strength of this great nation when its people \n     are united in purpose, united in a common fundamental faith, \n     united in their readiness to work for human freedom and \n     peace.\n\n  Mr. President, let us assure our citizen soldiers that when they \nreturn home, they will not be denied health care because of their \nmilitary's service.\n\n[[Page S9577]]\n\nThey deserve no less. I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/21/senate-section/article/S9577-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9577-S9579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I move that the Senate stand in recess \nsubject to the call of the Chair.\n  The motion was agreed to, and at 2:45 p.m. the Senate recessed, \nsubject to the call of the Chair, and reassembled at 3:07 p.m., when \ncalled to order by the Presiding Officer (Mrs. Feinstein).\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \nspeak on the subject of our Defense authorization bill.\n  First, let me say how appreciative I am of the leadership of Senator \nLevin and Senator Warner. These are two Senators who trust one another \nand who work beautifully together. I have personally witnessed the work \nthey have done both publicly and during many hours of private \nnegotiations. I cannot thank them enough for their extraordinary \nleadership at this very important time in our Nation. I truly think \nthat God has blessed us at this time to have these two fine men helping \nlead the negotiations at this particular time on a very important bill \nfor our country.\n  President Kennedy reminded us during the height of the cold war that \nto ensure the peace we must prepare for war. September 11 seems to many \nof us literally years ago. It was just last week that our preparations \nfor 21st century warfare were cut dramatically short. We had just \nreached the point where the American public was beginning to comprehend \nthat future wars would, indeed, be very different; We would need a \ndifferent sort of military to combat them. However, national security \ninfrastructure is a large, lumbering ship. It takes time, focus, \npatience, and determination to turn its direction.\n  On September 11, early in the morning, the attention of our Pentagon \nturned on a dime to this new threat. As all of us are now beginning to \nunderstand, 21st century warfare is very different.\n  I have referred to the current attack on the United States as a \nsilent war. People have asked me what I mean by that. I mean that the \nresources we employ to fight this war may not be visible on CNN. We \nwill fight electronically, with our special forces, with our \nintelligence operatives, with psychological operations. It will be a \nwar in which our greatest victories may never be fully appreciated and \nin which our full vulnerabilities are perceived by only a few.\n  It is also a silent war because silence is the only real asset of our \nenemies. When we can identify our foes, they will be eliminated. For \nthat reason, we must be relentless and patient. We are in a chess match \nwith killers. A great deal rides upon its outcome.\n  My confidence in our victory comes from one simple fact: Our \nopponents rely on a few pathological minds to win this war. Our Nation \ncan call upon the minds of free-thinking, freedom-loving people around \nthe world to ensure our victory. And ultimately we will prevail.\n  We have a long journey in front of us. Today we take another step. I \ncommend our chairman, Senator Levin of Michigan, and Senator Warner of \nVirginia for their outstanding leadership at this time.\n  As the chairperson of the Emerging Threats Subcommittee, I am clear \nabout the work our committee must undertake over the next few months \nand perhaps years until the successful conclusion of this conflict. I \nalso sincerely thank the Senator from Kansas, Mr. Roberts, our ranking \nmember of this important committee, for his cooperation, his insight, \nhis vision, and his passion on this subject. His advice and counsel and \nour excellent working relationship have made a difficult task more \nbearable.\n  It should be noted that I have determined a new policy for our \nsubcommittee. From now on, all meetings of the Emerging Threats \nSubcommittee will be bipartisan in nature. We have neither the time, \nnor do the American people have the patience, for partisan squabbling \nand bickering because the stakes are so high.\n  In formulating the Department of Defense budget for the next fiscal \nyear, we considered five priorities. Sadly, recent events have brought \nthree of those priorities to the forefront. We have done very good work \nrecently in ensuring that our military is ready to meet nontraditional \nthreats and to ensure that our Armed Forces are ready to defend our \nNation on a moment's notice. Now is the time to enact all of our plans \nand defend America and its values against this unprecedented challenge \nto our Nation.\n  In addition, we have sought to improve the quality of life for our \nservice men and women and their families. It is the service family who \nwill keep the hearth warm while our fighting men and women are \ndeployed. We must provide them with the quality of life they deserve.\n  In almost every war of which we are aware and have studied--and many \nhave actually participated in--it was always hard on the family. I \nimagine and predict that in this war, in some ways it will be harder on \nfamilies because the intelligence, the secrecy of what we have to do, \nwhile it was always important in past wars, is going to be more so. \nThere will be families separated from loved ones for long periods of \ntime and children who will never be able to receive a letter from a \nfather or a mother or to hear their voice for long periods of time. I \nurge that our Nation give some extraordinary and new thinking to what \nwe might do to support the families who are going to be called to the \nfront lines and, in addition, to recognize while my committee only \nsupervises and oversees the military operations, as our President and \nas our leaders have so eloquently stated recently, it is not just men \nand women in uniform who are on the front line, but our firefighters, \nour local elected officials, our National Guard, business people, in \nmany instances, are on the front line, depending on what their business \nis. Their families need special consideration.\n\n  We have also done important work in improving the efficiencies of the \nDepartment of Defense. This will become more crucial in the coming days \nas our Nation commits its treasury to the present struggle. We must \nensure that we invest wisely in the best possible means toward ensuring \nabsolute victory.\n  There are a few aspects of this legislation of which I am \nparticularly proud. We have made a significant investment in upgrading \nand sustaining our fighters and our bombers. Any student of modern \nhistory cannot overlook how important these are to conducting modern \nwar and how vital they will be to achieving victory in this new type of \nwar.\n  In this bill, we have authorized a 5-percent pay raise for all of our \nservice personnel. Perhaps it can be more. Perhaps 5 percent is not \nenough. We can revisit that issue. It is another step along with an 8-\npercent pay raise that was done the year before and raises the year \nbefore to make the paycheck begin to match--which it can never quite \ndo, obviously--the sacrifices our men and women are called on to \nperform.\n  As we contemplate the tasks that our men and women in uniform face, \nwe are made aware of our duty to properly compensate them and their \nfamilies and to support them financially, psychologically, emotionally \nand, in many ways, spiritually.\n  We have provided a guarantee that our fighting men and women will be \nable to fully participate in democracy while being deployed abroad. We \nincluded language in this bill to ensure that their right to vote will \nbe uninhibited, barriers taken down, and that valid votes will be \ncounted.\n  This Nation set a precedent in 1864, when we conducted a Presidential \nelection in the midst of a paralyzing war. This bill ensures that we \nwill not allow the current crisis to disrupt our democratic process.\n  I now focus, briefly, and in conclusion, on the work done by the \nEmerging Threats Subcommittee in the last\n\n[[Page S9578]]\n\nfew months. Our committee is charged with the task of concentrating on \nthe efforts of the Department of Defense to counter new and emerging \nthreats to our national security interests. Our jurisdiction includes \nterrorism, the subject that is absorbing the attention of the entire \nworld at this time.\n  I stress that as the threat of terrorism has emerged in a most \nhorrific way, we must not overlook our other jurisdiction of \ncounterproliferation and chemical warfare. Those responsible for the \ntragic events of last Tuesday know they must find new ways to threaten \nour security, and we must be ready for them.\n  I will concentrate on the subcommittee's work on counterterrorism \ninitiatives just for a moment.\n  The threat of terrorism can no longer be described as emerging. It \nhas, unfortunately, emerged. The subcommittee has done substantial work \nin protecting our Nation from the terrorist threat, but it is obvious \nthat we must do more.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that in the coming days we will see the \nwork of this committee increase and our efforts redouble to stem the \ntide of terrorism here on our homeland. We have sought to meet the \nimmediate needs of the services and commanders for counterterrorism \ninitiatives and force protection. These initiatives include $14.3 \nmillion to fund enhanced counterterrorism training for the special \noperations command--a very special command now in this new war with \nthis emerged threat --which has a mission of defeating terrorist \nactions. This is a crucial investment. There will be more to be made in \nthe future, and I call on all Members of Congress and the President to \nunderstand the critical importance of significant investment in this \nparticular area.\n  In our bill, we have $10 million to increase and formalize the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff combating terrorism readiness \ninitiative fund, which allows commanders in the field to fund emergent, \nhigh-priority requirements. Again, this was the amount of money put in \nprior to 9/11. I am certain, as we have time to confer with each other \nand revisit the budget allocations again, there can be additional \nfunding authorization so that our commanders in the field have no \nbarrier to protect their forces and to protect Americans wherever they \nmay be in the world.\n  We also devoted $107 million to the Departments of Defense and Energy \nfor detecting, defending against, and responding to the use of weapons \nof mass destruction. This includes funds allocated for chemical and \nbiological detection and prevention.\n  The attack initiated against the United States last week was \ncommitted with a rather crude weapon of mass destruction. It is \nimportant that we keep our guard up against other more sophisticated \nweapons.\n  Additionally, we have devoted over $77 million to establish minimum \naccess and entry controls at military installations abroad. As security \nis increased on installations both domestically and abroad, these funds \nare needed now more than ever.\n  But while we focus on the threat that has emerged, it is important \nthat we also address the proliferation of nuclear weapons. As our enemy \nsearches for new and innovative and very destructive ways to attack us, \nit is important that we deny him access to the most destructive \nweapons. The markup package fully funds--and I am very proud that this \ndecision was made last week--the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program \nat the DOD budget request level of $403 million. Included in the $403 \nmillion is $50 million for destruction of Russian chemical munitions. \nBefore the program can spend the money to destroy the Russian chemical \nmunitions, however, DOD must meet certain prerequisites. These \nprerequisites include a Russian commitment to contribute $25 million to \nthe program per year. These prerequisites are based on those originated \nby Senator Roberts last year.\n  We also cannot overlook chemical and biological weapons that can \ninflict unthinkable, unbearable harm on our civilian population and our \nmen and women in the field. That is why our committee devoted over $1.2 \nbillion for demilitarization. Additionally, we have acquired vaccines \nto combat the threat of chemical and biological weapons and are in the \nprocess of making that entire system much more robust, and that work is \nwell underway.\n  Let me close by proclaiming my extreme confidence and admiration for \nthe men and women of our Armed Forces. They have trained day in and day \nout for their ultimate mission. And now we must all call on them to \nfulfill that mission. I am confident they are up to the task because, \nas I said in my opening, this war that we fight does not necessarily \nrely on the genius and strength of our President, although he showed \ngreat strength and genius last night. It doesn't just rely on the great \nstrength of the 100 of us in this Chamber, but it rests squarely and \nstably and securely on the shoulders of every American everywhere, our \nallies, and of free-thinking people who have been inspired by God over \nthe centuries to fight this war. That is why I know we will win and we \nwill all do our part.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, at this tragic time in our Nation's \nhistory, it is time for the Senate to lay aside politics and focus on \nthe needs of our country, especially those of the men and women of our \nmilitary services. The National Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal \nYear 2002 is the key legislation that this Senate will consider this \nyear to provide critical funding and legislative authority to the \nDepartment of Defense so it can carry out its national security role. \nThe bill also includes important provisions to improve the quality of \nlife for our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines. These men and women \nwill be the spears in the fight to rid this world of the terrorist that \nthreaten not only this great Nation, but all peace loving people \nthroughout the world.\n  The fact that we are considering this important legislation at this \ntime is a reflection of the bipartisan effort to support this nation. I \njoined my Republican colleagues on the Armed Services Committee in \nvoting against reporting out the Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal \nYear 2002. I would have joined my colleagues in voting against final \npassage of this bill if the onerous provision on the future course of \nthe deployment of ballistic missile defenses had not been not struck \nfrom the bill. By removing the provisions that would have hindered the \nPresident's ability to deploy an effective National Missile Defense \nSystem, Chairman Levin has come a long way toward assuring passage of \nthis important legislation and laid aside partisanship in favor of \nunity.\n  I will support this important legislation in its current form, \nalthough I have significant reservations regarding the section 821 \nwhich severely restricts Federal Prison Industries' ability to sell to \nthe Department of Defense. Since the Department is FPI's largest \ncustomer, my concern is that this provision would severely harm FPI and \nits essential mission in keeping inmates safely and productively \noccupied.\n  FPI is an essential program that maintains prison safety and \nsecurity. It keeps thousands of prisoners working and productively \noccupied, which helps prevent mischief and violence. Also, it is the \nmost successful government program for teaching inmates job skills that \nthey can use in the private sector when they are released. It does all \nof this without any cost to the taxpayers. Because of these concerns \nand the fact that this matter is under the jurisdiction of the \nJudiciary Committee, I will join any effort to strike this provision \nand am optimistic that it will not survive to see the light of day.\n  Under the leadership of our new Chairman Senator Levin and the \nRanking Member, Senator Warner, the Armed Services Committee included \nmany provisions and funding items that the administration supports and \nwill have a significant impact on readiness and quality of life. The \nbill provides $10.5 billion for military construction and family \nhousing construction. It adds more than $232.0 million to increase the \nBasic Allowance for Housing to further reduce the out-of-pocket \nexpenses housing costs for service members and their families. It adds \nmore than $1.0 billion to the budget request to improve the readiness \nof U.S. forces.\n  The bill also includes significant funding to improve the capability \nof our forces to meet the nontraditional threats that we will face in \nthe coming\n\n[[Page S9579]]\n\nyears. These threats, as so tragically evidenced on September 11, are \nnot only focused on our Armed Forces, but the heart and soul of our \nnation, its citizens.\n  I am especially pleased that this bill contains significant funding \nlevels to support the operations, especially environmental clean-up, at \nthe Savannah River Site in my home State. Additionally, the bill \nincludes the bill makes a strong statement, which was inserted at my \nrequest, regarding plutonium disposition. I believe that now more than \never we must eliminate the threat that this material pose. I strongly \nurge the Department of Energy to follow the Record of Decision on \nplutonium disposition and build the MOX fuel fabrication plant \notherwise the Savannah River Site may be forced to store plutonium \nindefinitely, which is an unacceptable situation.\n  Although this bill came to the floor under a shadow, I urge the \nSenate to unite and put aside the partisan interest for the sake of the \nNation and, more importantly, for the sake of the men and women who may \nsoon be thrust into harms way.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I would like to associate myself with \nremarks of the chairman and ranking member on the pending legislation.\n  Several months ago, I called for a new national commitment to our \narmed forces. I said that we need to reassess who the enemy is, \nredesign our military for a new century, and rededicate ourselves to \nour men and women in uniform and their families.\n  I am pleased to report that the Defense Authorization bill does all \nof those things. As our armed forces prepare for a long struggle \nagainst terrorism, they count on full support from this Congress.\n  This legislation authorizes $343.5 billion for national defense \nprograms, the full amount requested by the administration. And it goes \nbeyond what the administration requested in pay increases and quality \nof life improvements for the men and women of the armed forces.\n  The bill also provides additional investments to redesign our \nmilitary capabilities. It will enhance our airlift capabilities, which \nwill allow US forces to mobilize quickly and respond to crises and \nterrorist threats around the globe. A centerpiece of this effort is the \nC-17, produced in my home State of Missouri. I am proud to have worked \nclosely with Senators Levin, Warner, Kennedy, and Sessions, to \nauthorize an additional multi-year contract for this versatile \naircraft.\n  In addition, the committee worked to improve the country's defenses \nagainst emerging threats. It adds $600 million to the administration's \nbudget proposal to combat terrorism and weapons of mass destruction \nattacks.\n  The bill will help us shape a new force structure to respond quickly, \nforcefully, and effectively against terrorists. Senators Landrieu and \nRoberts, in particular, helped develop an important framework for \nresponses to threats against our homeland. We have recommended that the \nPentagon review its antiterrorism defenses. It should ascertain how \nvarious parts of the Defense Department can better coordinate \npreventative measures and responses to such attacks.\n  I have the honor of being my State's first Senate Armed Services \nCommittee member in nearly 25 years. I have enjoyed working with my \ncolleagues, Senators Levin and Warner, to help craft this bill. This \nlegislation is good for Missouri, but far more importantly, it is good \nfor America. It will strengthen our military, enhance quality of life \nfor our armed forces, and prepare our Nation to confront the terrorists \nhead-on.\n  In every generation, Americans have risen to threats against our \nfreedom. Now we must do so again. We must make a new national \ncommitment to our armed forces.\n  By passing this bill, let us send a message to the terrorists and \nthose who harbor them: America is ready. Your days are numbered.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chairman and the Ranking Member for their \nleadership, and I enthusiastically support this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/21/senate-section/article/S9579-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9579-S9580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MUKILTEO LAND TRANSFER\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to offer an amendment \nto the fiscal year 2002 Defense Authorizations bill improving upon a \nland transfer included in the fiscal year 2001 Defense Authorizations \nbill. Last year, I worked to include language transferring the 22 acre \nMukilteo Tank Farm from the United States Air Force to the Port of \nEverett, Washington. The Port, in cooperation with the City of Everett, \nthe City of Mukilteo, the Washington State Department of \nTransportation, Sound Transit, and the Washington State Ferry System, \nplans to redevelop the site to include a new ferry terminal, commuter \nrail, a marina and enhanced shoreline access. This redevelopment will \nrevitalize Mukilteo and Everett while improving transportation in this \narea. An important first step in implementing these development plans \nis for the Air Force to convey this property to the Port of Everett.\n  For almost 30 years, the 22 acre parcel of land has also been home to \nthe National Marine Fisheries Service's, NMFS', Mukilteo Field Research \nFacility. Its laboratories are currently housed in old, run-down \nmilitary barracks. Last year's land transfer legislation did not convey \nany of the property to NMFS. The agency was concerned that it had lost \nits chance to own a portion of the 22 acres, and thus to make \nsignificant improvements to the site. The facility conducts valuable \nmarine research, which will lead to improved long-term success in \nprotecting and restoring salmon, groundfish and other species in Puget \nSound.\n  I directed the parties involved to reach a mutually agreeable \nsolution. I am very pleased to announce that today's amendment reflects \nan agreement between the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, NOAA, NMFS and the Port of Everett. Upon transfer of \nthe 22 aces, the Air Force will convey 1.1 acres to NOAA. After 12 \nyears, any portion of the 1.1 acres not being used by NOAA shall \nautomatically revert to the Port of Everett. In addition, the Secretary \nof Commerce will have the authority to exchange portions of the 1.1 \nacres with the Port of Everett should such an exchange be deemed \nmutually agreeable.\n  This amendment reflects almost a year of negotiations and hard work \non the part of many people within each organization. I would like to \nthank John Mohr, Executive Director for the Port of Everett, and Donna \nDarm, Acting Regional Administrator for NMFS in the Northwest Region. I \nappreciate their outstanding leadership in crafting this agreement. I \nlook forward to continuing to work with the Port of Everett, NMFS and \nNOAA on this and any other issue that may arise in the future. \nCongratulations on working out an agreement which, I believe, is in the \nlong-term interest of the community, the state of Washington and the \nnation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed as in \nmorning business for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I wish to \nask the Senator if he will forbear for a moment.\n  In my capacity as ranking member of the committee, I thank our \ncommittee member from the great State of Louisiana for all of her hard \nwork and for her taking over the chairmanship of the Emerging Threats \nSubcommittee. I don't know of any other task facing the Senate today \nthat is greater than what faces her in trying to work for the \nadministration now that the President has made some very significant \nannouncements in restructuring efforts of the Federal Government toward \naddressing the emerging and, indeed, regrettably existing threats now \npoised at our country. So I commend the Senator from Louisiana and wish \nher well in the weeks and months to come in her new capacity as \nchairman.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator. Let me respond briefly. To assure \nthe Senator from Virginia that we are up to the task and that our \nmembers are ready to go, we look forward to working with him, and I \nappreciate his guidance, support, and direction.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from South Carolina to speak as in morning business?\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I will not object. That will mean we \nwill now go off the Defense bill, which we discussed. In consultation \nwith our chairman, I hope by Monday we will be ready to proceed with \nsome amendments as soon as the leadership establishes the parameters as \nto when the votes will be taken. We will be ready.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I appreciate very much the report from \nthe ranking member. The ranking member and the chairman have done a \ngood job getting us to this point.

Madam President, I understand that a settlement has \nbeen reached between the leadership of the House and Senate relative to \nthe airline assistance measure. This measure, an attempt to propound a \nbare bones solution, does not encompass all the main considerations \nthat came out at the hearing we had in the Commerce Committee \nyesterday.\n  It is more or less a gentlemen's agreement that safety is just as \nimportant, or this particular Senator was trying to get safety and \nsecurity ahead of money. Be that as it may, the money has prevailed and \nthe bill will pass, perhaps this weekend or perhaps this afternoon. I \nwant to save time by speaking now so that when the bill is under \nconsideration, I will not be holding up my colleagues who are trying to \ncatch transportation to get home for the weekend.\n  In that light, I have at the desk a bill by myself, Senator McCain, \nSenator Kerry, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Hutchison, Senator Breaux, \nSenator Cleland, Senator Nelson, Senator Edwards, Senator Burns, \nSenator Smith, and Senator Reid. I ask it be given its first reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1447) to improve aviation security, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair. Madam President, there \nis not any question when we are talking about financing that we can \ngive the airline industry billions upon billions of dollars in the next \n10 minutes, but the sustenance, success, and the full resumption of \nairline travel will never occur until the traveling public is confident \nof safety and security at the airports and on planes in America.\n  First and foremost, of course, is the matter of the cockpit. Pilots \ndo not want to get into the position of those pilots on 9-11. So they \nare not only asking for a secure door that can only be opened from the \ninside, going along with the rule that it not be opened in flight, but \nthat they also be equipped with stun guns. That is going to be taken \ncare of.\n  We have Federal marshals. We need to extend that program, there is no \nquestion about it. But the main kick in the arm of security at all \nairports of America is the reliance upon the industry itself to provide \nfor that security. It has been going to the lowest bidder, to temporary \nworkers paid minimum wage, their average stay not exceeding 5 months. \nSo there is no professionalism, there is no experience and, as a \nresult, there is no security. Everyone knows this. This was not just \nrevealed at the hearing.\n  The bill establishes a Deputy Administrator at the Federal Aviation \nAdministration for Aviation Security. We need a central command with \nfixed responsibility for this security.\n  The bill also establishes an Aviation Security Council comprised of \nrepresentatives from the FAA, the Department of Justice, the Department \nof Defense, and the CIA to coordinate national security, intelligence, \nand aviation security information and make recommendations.\n  There was a question about curbside check-in. Employees stationed \nthere look at their computers. They are well trained to look for \ncertain persons that Interpol, other countries, or the FBI in this \ncountry have given as known security risks.\n  With those that they may have some suspicion about, they check that \nbaggage. Obviously, if the distinguished Senator from California was \ngoing through, and she comes through every other week or so, going back \nand forth to the west coast, she is a discernible public figure, no \nsecurity risk whatsoever and there is no reason to open the bag. That \nfacilitates airline travel and that is understood.\n  Even at curbside when they use the computer and bring up the name \n``Hollings'' on the computer, they can see exactly what his travel \npractices are and other important information to the security of air \ntravel, and either give a double-check through his luggage or maybe a \npersonal check.\n  El Al Airlines requires that in Tel Aviv. The truth is, we invited El \nAl's safety executive, and due to the holidays he could not make it, \nbut he will be here the first of the week and is going to brief our \ncommittee.\n  We know there is required security in the country of Israel, and as a \nresult we want to try to emulate their success in that regard. First, \nput in a deputy administrator with a coordinated council and strengthen \nthe cockpit doors and locks.\n  We have heard from the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts of \nhis constituent who manufactures such a door. He will be momentarily \naddressing that.\n  There is no question in this Senator's mind that once the door is \nlocked securely with a substance such as Kevlar that it cannot be \npenetrated. Once that is secured and you get the security personnel at \nReagan National Airport, you can open up Reagan National. There is no \ndifference between opening up Dulles Airport or Baltimore-Washington \nAirport and not Reagan with respect to the proximity because, after \nall, it was the Dulles flight that hit the Pentagon.\n  Once a flight takes off, to turn around and come back into \nWashington, it is just as easy to turn from, say, Baltimore or Dulles \nbefore anything can really be done to stop its course and come right \ninto the Pentagon again.\n  I understand what the Secret Service and the National Security \nCouncil are saying, but this is no time for debate. As the President \nsaid, this is a time for action. So let us start with action, get\n\n[[Page S9581]]\n\nin the security personnel in a studied, incremental fashion. Start with \nthe shuttle flights to New York and Boston and immediately have enough \nsecurity personnel in those particular planes already equipped with the \nsecured cockpit.\n  This particular measure also increases the number of Federal air \nmarshals. In the interim, the FAA can use personnel from other Federal \nagencies to serve as those air marshals. It federalizes airport \nsecurity operations. I heard a while ago at a conference that the \nSecretary of Transportation said we did not have the money to do this. \nWe do have the money, and we have voted the money. That is why this \nSenator voted the $20 billion. Someone has said it is $3 billion, and \nthat $3 billion is enough. Put some 23,000, 24,000 security personnel \nin the airports around the country as Federal service employees, civil \nservice Government employees, skilled, with training, with adequate pay \nand retirement and health care benefits. That is when you are going to \nget the competent personnel.\n  I have had this struggle for the past several years about privatizing \nthe comptrollers. I do not see anybody in the Chamber this afternoon \ntalking about privatize, privatize, privatize. We can see what \nprivatization has done to security.\n  Europe affords government workers in its airports. If Europe can \nafford it, we can. In fact, after 9-11, we must afford it. We cannot \nplay games with the number of employees and everything else of that \nkind when it comes to security, and this is just as important or more \nso to this particular Senator than the money.\n\n  I am going to explain the money in a little while. You can give \nairlines all the money in the world, but if nobody comes to fly on \ntheir planes, if the airports and the planes themselves are not secure, \nthen they are going to suffer badly financially and there is not enough \nmoney in the Government Treasury to keep them alive unless we do this \nNo. 1 thing; namely, provide for airport security, which is on \neverybody's mind.\n  The bill also improves screening procedures for passengers. It checks \nthe passenger's name against a coordinated list comprised of criminal, \nnational security intelligence, and INS information.\n  I heard the previous administrator of the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, Doris Meissner, on TV the other evening. She \nwas talking about checking names off as they come in. The INS gets this \ninformation. The FBI gets this information. It ought to be absolutely \ncertain that it also goes to all of the airports and is disseminated, \nbecause there is some question that they had some information about the \n9-11 attack ahead of time but it was not properly dispensed among those \nresponsible.\n  The bill provides for hijack training for the flight crew. It calls \nfor background checks on students at flight schools for large planes \nand increases perimeter security at airports and air traffic \nfacilities. It assesses a dollar-per-passenger security charge and \nauthorizes funds to carry out the security initiatives.\n  This bill is totally bipartisan, but there was a concern amongst \nseveral of the Senators about assessing a charge. I think all members \nof our committee more or less will cosponsor the bill, once we can \ncheck this afternoon, in a bipartisan fashion.\n  Now, that charge will bring in $250 million. Assuming the security \nresponsibility at airports is federalized, it relieves the private \nairline industry of $1 billion. So $250 million for passengers to start \ncontributing toward taking care of some of these expenses is definitely \nin order, in this Senator's mind.\n  I want to cover one particular thing with respect to the bill itself. \nThe bill might have to be repaired if there is not a cap on claims. We \nare establishing a Federal claims procedure so the injured are not \nfurther damaged and do not have to chase around several jurisdictions \nand file all kinds of legal motions. So the Federal claims provision \nwill be included in the bill this afternoon.\n  My understanding, because I was trying to get it on as a cap, if you \ndo not have a cap on these particular claims, there will not be enough \nmoney in the Federal til. That will have to be repaired.\n  I could give the example of this high paid group on the top of the \nWorld Trade Towers, and they are very deserving people, but if they \nmake $8 million or $10 million a year, if I were a lawyer I know I \ncould get a $200 million to $300 million verdict of some kind, and \nwhile I am getting the $200 million to $300 million verdict, the poor \nfireman's lawyer comes in and says, ``Wait a minute. You are paying \nthat high paid individual a couple of hundred million dollars, but this \nis a poor fireman who rushed in and saved his life, I want $200 \nmillion,'' and up and away it goes. Or the insurance company takes a \ntraveling passenger who was on one of those planes and the lawyer goes \nto the insurance company and says, ``Go ahead, give us the $50 million, \ngive us whatever million you want because you are subrogated, you can \ngo against the Government claims, no limit on the government claims, \nand you can be reimbursed.'' They say I am out here shilling for the \ntrial lawyers, but right is right. I am confident most of my trial \nlawyer friends would understand, in an act of war of this kind, there \nhave to be some limits. If there are not limits, we will not sustain.\n\n  I hold the bill up with an amendment. I was prepared, but I have been \ntalked out of it by the leadership, to have the airline security \nmeasure that could be passed this afternoon in the House and Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I ask unanimous consent for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, since others are prepared now, let me \nread the most significant testimony of Harry Pinson of Credit Suisse \nFirst Boston, in Texas, and the head of the southwest regional \ninvestment banking group based in Houston that handles all of these \nindustrial accounts. I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Testimony of Harry Pinson, Hearings on Airline Industry Finances, \n            Senate Committee on Commerce, September 20, 2001\n\n       Good afternoon Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you for \n     holding these hearings today and allowing me to appear before \n     the Committee.\n       My name is Harry Pinson and I am a Managing Director of \n     Credit Suisse First Boston (``CSFB''), and Head of the \n     Southwest Regional Investment Banking Group, based in \n     Houston. I joined CSFB in 1984, and moved to Houston in the \n     summer of 1995 from New York. I am responsible for \n     coordinating the coverage of industrial accounts in the \n     Southwest, including the airline industry. While in New York, \n     I was Head of the Transportation Group in the Investment \n     Banking Department from 1990 through 1995.\n       I began my business career as an Associate in the public \n     finance department of Merrill Lynch, where I specialized in \n     the transportation industry, prior to joining CSFB. I have \n     managed a variety of financing and strategic advisory \n     assignments for major U.S. industrial companies including the \n     acquisition of McDonnell Douglas by The Boeing Company, the \n     strategic alliance between Continental Airlines and Northwest \n     Airlines, the sale of United Airlines to its employees, \n     advising the creditors of Continental Airlines in the \n     reorganization of the Company, the privatization of Quantas \n     Airways and the acquisition of TWA by AMR.\n       The U.S. air transportation system, for all its faults, is \n     the envy of the world. Its cheapness and ease of use means \n     that more Americans fly more often than the citizens of any \n     other major country. Whole industries are built around this \n     unquestioned principal of mobility: hotels, resorts, car \n     rental agencies. It binds us together as a nation, and \n     connects us to the world.\n       The events of last Tuesday and their ramifications are \n     threatening that principal of mobility in a number of ways.\n       First, the cash losses suffered while the industry was \n     grounded and as it rebuilds this week are weakening an \n     industry already made vulnerable by a weakening economy.\n       Second, the reduction in demand caused by the loss of \n     passenger confidence and the impact on travel times caused by \n     the security guidelines necessary to restore that confidence, \n     coupled with the increased operating costs and lower fleet \n     utilization that those same safety guidelines are likely to \n     require, means that the profit model for the industry will \n     change, perhaps permanently. For the first time ever, an \n     industry conditioned to growth will have to find a way to \n     shrink to profitability. It will take a lot of Yankee \n     ingenuity to find that path, and many will not succeed.\n       Third, the catastrophe last week and our government's \n     response to it have served to raise the perceived potential \n     liabilities of operating an airline while simultaneously \n     reducing the availability of insurance for that\n\n[[Page S9582]]\n\n     risk. This means that airline shareholders, creditors, and \n     potentially even the officers and directors of these carriers \n     are being asked to bear the risk of potentially catastrophic \n     losses: an unprecedented and highly disruptive situation.\n       Finance, the industry I participate in, has always had a \n     big role to play in this industry because its persistent \n     growth, capital intensity, fierce competition and low profit \n     margins mean lots of external capital needs to be raised: \n     about $10 billion so far this year. Because the airplanes can \n     be deployed anywhere in the world, have long useful lives and \n     a long history of holding their value, the vast proportion of \n     the capital raised is in the form of long-term debt secured \n     by these aircraft. This form of financing keeps annual \n     ownership costs low and has generally been available in large \n     amounts in virtually all operating environments, allowing \n     airlines to fulfill purchase commitments even when business \n     is bad. It also means that the airlines have accumulated \n     enormous debt service and lease payment burdens which will \n     not diminish soon.\n       We, in our industry, are eager to get back to the business \n     of financing this industry, as we are eager to get back to \n     business generally. It is our livelihood. The rebuilding of \n     this industry will generate terrific investment opportunities \n     which will attract the capital necessary to fund the future \n     of this industry and eventually supplant the aid you are \n     considering.\n       The fact that these investments will be risky does not \n     necessarily diminish their appeal. The assessment of risk and \n     speculation about an uncertain future are at the core of the \n     investing process. There are, however, some types of risks \n     that financial markets find hard to deal with which the \n     current situation contains, and act as barriers to restarting \n     the investing process.\n       For example, the more stringent security procedures which \n     are essential to attracting passengers back to the airlines \n     will be costly and disruptive, but we don't know how much \n     because we don't understand them yet nor do we know who will \n     bear the costs. Clarity on the ``rules of the game'' will be \n     essential for the investment community to begin to assess \n     rationally the future of the industry and its various \n     participants. Until the rules are clear, investors will put \n     their brains to work elsewhere. Since this issue also affects \n     the likely size of the fleet for the foreseeable future, it \n     makes the value of aircraft the bedrock collateral for much \n     of the industry's financing, also hard to determine.\n       Second, investors are conditioned to assessing management \n     turnaround plans and placing their bets, but liquidity \n     concerns will make analysis again difficult. ``Shrinking to \n     profitability'' is a new concept in the airline industry. \n     Given the rigidity of airline cost structures in both capital \n     and labor, it will take a long time, years for a turnaround \n     to take place. No airline has anything like the resources \n     necessary to fund this turnaround and investors in the \n     current poor general investment climate are not likely to bet \n     on a company's ability to raise money in the future to fund \n     its plan. Therefore another, necessary condition to getting \n     private capital moving back into this industry is to give the \n     airlines access to sufficient liquidity to fund a turnaround, \n     so that investors can focus on the business risks they \n     understand.\n       It is in the nature of these support arrangements that, if \n     the process goes as intended, much of this support will not \n     be used because it will act as a catalyst for private capital \n     to flow to the industry and take back from the government the \n     role of financing the industry.\n       Third, new kinds of liability issues have arisen because of \n     the catastrophe itself and the state of war resulting from \n     it. The industry's insurance arrangements are not adequate to \n     deal with this situation, and the war risk is effectively \n     uninsurable at present. This has the potential to paralyze \n     the industry as investors and creditors are faced with the \n     potential of catastrophic loss. This is an impossible \n     situation for investors to grapple with.\n       Clarity, liquidity, liability. Address these issues and \n     we're in business.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I will start on page 3:\n\n       First, the cash losses suffered while the industry was \n     grounded and as it rebuilds this week are weakening an \n     industry already made vulnerable by a weakened economy.\n\n  This measure is not going to save a couple of airlines, in this \nSenator's opinion.\n  Continuing:\n\n       Second, the reduction in demand caused by the loss of \n     passenger confidence impact on travel times caused by the \n     security guidelines necessary to restore that confidence, \n     coupled with the increased operating costs and lower fleet \n     utilization that those same safety guidelines are likely to \n     require, means that the profit model for the industry will \n     change, perhaps permanently. For the first time ever an \n     industry conditioned to growth will have to find a way to \n     shrink to profitability. It will take a lot of Yankee \n     ingenuity to find that path, and many will not succeed.\n       Third, the catastrophe last week and our government's \n     response to it have served to raise the perceived potential \n     liabilities of operating an airline while simultaneously \n     reducing the availability of insurance for that risk. This \n     means that airline shareholders, creditors, and potentially \n     even the officers and directors of these carriers are being \n     asked to bear the risk of potentially catastrophic losses; an \n     unprecedented and highly disruptive situation.\n       Finance, the industry I participate in, has always had a \n     big role to play in this industry because its persistent \n     growth, capital intensity, fierce competition and low profit \n     margins mean lots of external capital needs to be raised: \n     About $10 billion so far this year. Because the airplanes can \n     be deployed anywhere in the world, have long useful lives and \n     a long history of holding their value, the vast proportion of \n     the capital raised is in the form of long-term debt secured \n     by these aircraft.\n\n  Madam President, jumping forward:\n\n       Second, investors are conditioned to assessing management \n     turnaround plans and placing their bets, but liquidity \n     concerns will make analysis again difficult. ``Shrinking to \n     profitability'' is a new concept in the airline industry. \n     Given the rigidity of airline cost structures in both capital \n     and labor, it will take a long time, years, for a turnaround \n     to take place. No airline has anything like the resources \n     necessary to fund this turnaround.\n\n  Madam President, we are going to do our best at the Washington level \nto re-instill confidence in airlines, their operation, and, more \nparticularly, the airline traveling public. We have been watching it \nday by day, and incrementally we have to address the insurance problem, \nwe have to address the warrant problem with respect to payments to \ndividend.\n  I am not worried about the pay of the airline executives right now; I \nam worried about more substantial things for the moment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Could I ask for 10 seconds? I ask unanimous consent, \nfollowing the Senator from Illinois, I be allowed to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are you propounding a unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Yes, that after the Senator from Illinois, I be \nallowed to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nSenate Commerce Committee for his leadership on this issue over a \nnumber of years. It has been almost 10 years that the Senate in \ncommittee has been advocating at many levels the notion of the \nfederalizing of airport security. I guess it is part of the nature of \nall Members not to mention just the nature of our politics, that \nsometimes things of good common sense don't happen for inertia, for \nindifference, for other interests that weigh in, until there is a \ntragedy such as we experienced a week ago.\n  The Senator from South Carolina has talked for a moment about the \nissue of the finances of our airlines. I emphasize that we obviously \nneed to do something and do it fast. But that something has to be \nsmart. That something has to recognize the distinction between the \nairline industry that existed on September 10 and the airline industry \nthat was impacted on September 11 and what happens as a consequence \nthere of. It is clear that prior to September 11, the airline industry \nwas already experiencing a significant downturn in passengers and \nridership because of the state of the economy. That has now been \nexacerbated a hundredfold.\n  I say to my fellow Americans today as forcefully as I can, there is \nno reason not to fly in an airplane in the continental United States or \nto fly out of the United States in today's system. There really isn't. \nThat system is safer than the air system has been in years. The \nscrutiny level already in our airports today is significantly higher \nthan it has ever been. The level of safety today as a result of the \nredundancy of checks and the level of concern by air marshals and State \npolice, local police, and others is raised to the highest level it has \never been in our country. It is safe to fly in aircraft in the United \nStates today. It may be that some people in this country would deem \nmost of those in Washington expendable anyway, but if it is any \nconsolation, Senators, Congressmen, and others are flying those planes \nnow, and the American public should not hesitate to do so.\n  Here is also a truth, a reality. We can do things that create almost \na fail-safe capacity, that raise the scrutiny level\n\n[[Page S9583]]\n\noften further in order to establish an even greater level of confidence \nnotwithstanding that what we are doing today is the greatest level of \nscrutiny we have ever had. That is what brings the Senator from South \nCarolina, Mr. Hollings, Mr. McCain, myself, and others to the floor \ntoday to introduce an airport security bill that will, in fact, raise \nthe level to the point where there is no excuse for anybody having any \nfear or any sense of dread about flying.\n  How do we do that? Let me remind people that what happened last \nTuesday was not high technology, nor was it even force at the end of a \ngun barrel or a bomb that had somehow gone through and evaded security. \nIn fact, everything that was used as a weapon was used within the \npermissiveness of the system as it existed then. It wasn't as if \nsomebody walked through security and had a weapon that wasn't detected. \nWhat these terrorists evidently did was use terror in a low-tech way as \neffectively and as deviously, as hideously, as any of us could ever \nhave imagined; using a box cutter, using a minimalist kind of weapon, \nthey managed to terrorize flight attendants and terrorize passengers \nwho, up until that point in time, had an understanding of hijacking \nthat you sort of behave. You try not to unsettle the hijackers. In \nfact, the tapes that were used by the flight attendants were 1970 \ntapes, a 1-hour tape that taught them to try to calm the hijackers and \nperhaps persuade them to seek political asylum, or at least not to harm \nthe passengers while they took them to Cuba or took them to some other \ncountry.\n\n  What we learned on September 11 was that now there is a completely \ndifferent strategy that we now know people are willing to employ. \nSomeone is willing to commit suicide and try to take over an airplane \nand use it as a weapon.\n  The task now is to make certain that no one can again use an airplane \nas a weapon. I again point out that, in an act of absolutely \nextraordinary heroism, three American citizens who were informed of the \nchange in tactic, who were told by loved ones on the ground that the \nplanes prior to them had been used as weapons, understood the new \nequation. They understood that they were faced with the potential of \nimminent death and, if that was true, they were going to take matters \ninto their own hands.\n  I think that forever changes the equation with respect to the \npotential of an aircraft again being used as a directable weapon by \nsomeone moving into the cockpit, taking over and actually flying the \naircraft, using it as an instrument with specific targeting.\n  It may well be that through some extraordinary lapse, even after all \nthe security measures, although it is hard to imagine how that might be \nif we do our jobs properly, someone might be able to terrorize \npassengers. But they could walk into any restaurant anytime, anywhere \nand do that. They could walk into any mosque, any church, any \nsynagogue--they could walk into any place where crowds gather and, if \nthey were willing to die, tragically they would have the ability to \nwreak havoc and chaos and mayhem in the area of their choice.\n  But we have the ability to do something to make it safe to fly, \nbeyond any doubts whatsoever, beyond what I think is the extraordinary \nlevel of safety that exists today. One of the things that would give \ngreater confidence to our fellow citizens is the awareness that all \nacross this country there is a standardized, uniform system by which \npeople are being screened as they come to an airport, not some \nindividual company in Boston and a different company in New York and a \ndifferent company in another city with different supervisors and no \naccountability across the board except to those particular airports and \nto some Federal standard which is not applied in a Federal way.\n  It seems to me we could guarantee that safety. A lot of people in \nAmerica are not aware of it, but the turnover rate of the current \nemployment of those security operators is simply unacceptable: in some \nplaces 100-percent turnover, 200-percent, 300-percent turnover within \nthe span of a year. And that is even among supervisors.\n  If we federalize the process we not only have the opportunity to hire \npeople at a decent wage, to guarantee the continuity, to guarantee the \nlevel of supervision, but we also will have an ability to do one of the \nmost critical things now. We recognize that airport security is also a \nmatter of national security. If it is a matter of national security, \nthen those airport personnel have to work within a system that has the \nability to share information that comes from law \nenforcement, information that comes from national security--the CIA, \nNSA, FBI, Defense Department.\n\n  If someone is on a watch list or if someone is a frequent flier with \npatterns that raise suspicion because of those prior trips and \ntravels--which, incidentally, do show up in your passport check when \nyou come through INS, and you can begin to make those determinations \nbut there is no such similar kind of cross-tabulation or verification \nin the processing of passengers' manifests and flights--in a virtual \nworld where we have computers at our fingertips with instantaneous \ncommunication of the Internet, shame on us for not having a system that \nhas that kind of cross-pollination between our law enforcement agencies \nand security agencies across the Nation.\n  This is now a matter of law enforcement and national security. The \nonly way to raise the airport security issue to that level is to \nfederalize the process.\n  We are here to talk about how we are going to bail out or help the \nairlines. The airlines pay $1 billion a year for their security costs. \nSo if the Federal Government indeed takes over those security costs, we \nare automatically reducing the burden of $1 billion a year or more, \nunder increased status, from the airlines. Given that the airlines are \nworking, hopefully, for profit and this affects the profit line, and \ntherefore affects the kind of bids and expenses they are willing to put \nout in it, we should guarantee to Americans that security at our \nairports is not going to be subject to the bottom line of an industry \nthat is already in difficulties. It is going to be subject only to the \njudgment of our public officials about what offers the greatest level \nof security.\n  In the legislation that Chairman Hollings and Ranking Member McCain \nand I and others on the committee are offering today, we are suggesting \nthe establishment of a Deputy Administrator at the FAA for airport \nsecurity. We establish an Aviation Security Council with the FAA, the \nDepartment of Justice, the Department of Defense, and the CIA, to \ncoordinate national security intelligence and aviation security \ninformation and make recommendations.\n  We require the strengthening of cockpit doors and locks with limited \naccess to the cockpit so every passenger who boards an aircraft will \nknow that unless it is at the choice of the pilots, no person will \nenter that cockpit from the time they leave the gate until the time \nthey arrive at their destination.\n  We increase the number of Federal air marshals so people will know \nthat while riding an aircraft, particularly those with the greatest \npotential of diversion, they would be protected by the use of Federal \nair marshals riding in the air with them.\n  We federalize the overall airport security operations, providing \nimproved training and testing for screening personnel.\n  We improve the screening procedures for passengers, checking \npassengers' names against a coordinated list comprised of criminal, \nnational security, intelligence, and INS information. I might add, the \nINS component is a critical component in the context of security.\n  We will provide new and modern hijack training for flight crews based \non what we now understand to be the threat. We perform background \nchecks on students at flight schools. We increase perimeter security at \nairports and air traffic facilities, and we authorize the funds to \ncarry out these initiatives.\n  Let me echo what has been said here previously. We can pass a bill \nthat provides funding for the airlines through these next weeks. But we \nneed the passengers of this country to come back to those airlines. I \nreiterate, I am convinced--I know the Senator from Florida is; he has \nflown commercially in the last days, as have others--this airline \nsystem is safe to fly today. But to whatever degree our fellow citizens \ndoubt that, we need to guarantee they\n\n[[Page S9584]]\n\nwill come back to those airports to ride the aircraft that we empower \nto fly.\n  Nothing is more important to revitalize the car rental industry, the \nrestaurants, the hotels, the entertainment industry, the travel \nindustry--all those ancillary spinoff industries that depend on people \nflying the aircraft of our various entities in this country.\n  I believe this legislation, while we will not vote on it today, is \nimperative to move on as rapidly as the legislation that we are moving \non today with the hopes that we will be able to guarantee to every one \nof our citizens the full assurance of every level of safety that they \nexpect. I hope we will do that as rapidly as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Akaka). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Illinois is to be recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: I would like to \nask if the Senator from Illinois would allow me to speak for 5 minutes \non the aviation security bill on which I am a cosponsor with Senators \nHollings, Kerry, and McCain, if the Senator from Minnesota will agree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to follow the \nSenator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota.\n  I rise to speak on behalf of the aviation security bill that has been \nintroduced by the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, Mr. \nHollings; Senator McCain, the distinguished ranking Member of the \nCommerce Committee, the Senator from Massachusetts, and myself. This is \nvery much a part of the overall program that we are putting forward.\n  The bill we will probably vote on today is the finance part of the \npackage. I think most Americans agree we cannot allow our aviation \nindustry to fall. So we are going to pass, I hope very shortly, a \nmeasure that will help our airlines get over the hump until the people \nhave the security to come back and fly.\n  The aviation security bill that we are introducing today, that I hope \nwe will be able to pass early next week or the following week, is very \nmuch a part of airlines getting back to normal. I think the flying \npublic wants to come back. Aviation is an important part of our economy \nand our way of life and our commerce.\n  The way we are going to draw them back is to have the security in \nplace so they know they will be safe when they get to the airport and \nboard an airplane. But in the interim, until we are able to put all of \nthese things in place, we need the financial aid package that is before \nus today.\n  I am very pleased that under the chairmanship of Senator Hollings we \nhad a hearing yesterday to talk about the security need. We talked to \nthe Secretary of Transportation. We talked to the FAA Administrator. We \ntalked to pilots and people who know what needs to be done to close the \nvulnerabilities that we saw on September 11. In fact, the bill that \nis being introduced today, of which I am a cosponsor, has many of the \nitems I have proposed in the past and certainly think we must pass \ntoday. We must have sky marshals in the air. In fact, I applaud the \nAttorney General for putting sky marshals on many of our flights around \nthe country. They are in plain clothes. Most people would not know they \nare on a flight. But we do indeed have armed sky marshals on many of \nthe flights that are in the air as we speak. But we want to make them \npermanent. We want to make sure we have sky marshals on virtually every \nflight, and possibly every flight later down the road.\n\n  We need to assure the passengers that there is a certified peace \nofficer onboard who is trained to do what is necessary to deal with the \ncrime that is committed in the air.\n  The second major provision in this bill that I think we must do is \nupgrade the screening. We will upgrade the equipment, and we will \nupgrade personnel education and training. We all know the screeners \nhave been hired by contractors. They have high turnover rates. They do \nnot have the experience that we would expect in screening. We have seen \npictures of things that have gone through the screens and gotten onto \nan airplane that are just not appropriate. We want to stop that from \nhappening.\n  That is why upgrading the screeners is important. I think they should \nbe a part of a Federal system of security.\n  We are going to put some kind of barrier between the pilots and the \nrest of the airplane so that someone would not be able to penetrate a \ncockpit, as so sadly happened on September 11. We will have a Deputy \nFAA Administrator in charge of aviation security so that we will have \none person in charge of all of aviation security.\n  It is my hope that we would start with entry-level screeners, and \nthat it would be a career path for the aviation security department \nwhich would include graduating to become a sky marshal, staying in the \nsystem with a career in the system so we could have more trained and \nexperienced people.\n  Those are some of the important points that are in this bill. I know \nsome people disagree with certain parts of this bill. But it is a great \nstart. It is an important start for rehabilitating our airline \nindustry.\n  If we have the security, people will fly. People love to fly. We had \n600 million people fly last year. We can build back to that number if \nwe have the security for passengers. The convenience will be there. It \nis going to take a little longer going through the airport, but I think \npeople are willing to wait a little longer and go earlier in order to \nfeel safe. The flying public will come back.\n  I support this bill. I will continue to work on it with the chairman. \nBut mainly I want the people of America to know we are addressing \nsecurity in the air and we will do something very shortly, as we are \nalso trying to shore up our airlines. We will not let our \ntransportation system fail. If we do, the terrorists will have won. The \nterrorists are not going to beat the United States of America.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/21/senate-section/article/S9584-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1450\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, I believe this Transportation Safety \nAct, which I know Senator Hollings and others are going to introduce \nvery soon, will certainly pass with strong support.\n  First of all, I ask unanimous consent to be added as an original \ncosponsor of this piece of legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the Senator from South Carolina is \nabsolutely right. Not only does safety have to be there with the money, \nbut the fact is, without the safety, people aren't going to fly. If \nthey don't fly, we are never going to have this industry financially \nviable. It is that simple. You can see it traveling around the country \nright now. There are very few people at the airports. People are quite \nfrightened. We have to absolutely pass this bill. I think it should be \nin this\n\n[[Page S9585]]\n\npackage right here. But we will be coming back to this very soon, and I \nthink the sooner the better.\n  There were some provisions that I desperately wanted to see in this \nbill. I know the Senator from South Carolina and others tried with all \ntheir might. I know Senator Daschle did. There were negotiations late \ninto the evening.\n  From my point of view, this language is essential to air service. I \nwant to make sure that gets lived up to.\n  A good part of our State is rural. We don't want our smaller airports \nleft out.\n  On the question of general aviation and VFR, there are a lot of \npeople hurting right now. I traveled in a small plane this last \nweekend. They are having to lay off people. We don't have any \nprotections for them. We will get back to that next week.\n  But the final point I want to make is that we had, I think, about a \n$3.7 billion package that dealt with all the people who are being laid \noff. Northwest Airlines just announced that 10,000 people will be laid \noff. Half of them are in the State of Minnesota. Frankly, look at the \neconomy.\n  There are an awful lot of people in a world of economic pain. I \nbelieve what should have been in this package--I know there were \nRepresentatives on the House side who resisted this, talking about the \ncompanies, yes--is the extending of unemployment benefits and making \nsure people have access to job training, that there is a dislocated \nworker focus.\n  The most frightening thing of all, next to losing your job, is that \nyou then lose your health care coverage. COBRA is too expensive. I wish \nwe had something better. For so many of these employees, this is going \nto be critically important.\n  These are going to be some really hard times for people. As one \nSenator from the State of Minnesota, I am really disappointed we did \nnot get this included. I know the Senate majority leader, Mr. Daschle, \nsaid this would be a first priority. I know Senator Hollings has said \nthat. We have to come back next week and we have to focus on these \nemployees. We have to make sure we provide the help to them and to \ntheir families. That has to be part of a relief package. We have to \nmove fast now. We couldn't get it in today. It will be in next week or \nit will be in as soon as possible. It must be.\n  Last point: We have all these huge issues staring us in the face. \nWhen I flew out here, I was talking to some of the employees of \nNorthwest. I said: How are you doing? They said: We are holding on. \nThey meant about the world they live in. Everybody is very worried. \nEverybody is very resolute. Everybody is very worried. But they also \nmeant: We are afraid we are going to lose our jobs. I am sure a number \nof those people now have lost their jobs. We have to provide help for \nthem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I \nbe recognized for 5 minutes. It is my understanding, under a previous \norder, that the Senator from Illinois has time. If he is not ready, \nthen I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized for 5 minutes prior \nto him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, as we consider a major \ncomponent of America's economic engine and what to do about it, clearly \nthere are two things that stand out and that came out of our Commerce \nCommittee hearing yesterday chaired by Senator Hollings.\n  For the airlines to be able to fly again financially solvent, the \nsecurity measures must be put into place so that the American public \nhas confidence to fly again.\n  I personally think it is safe to fly. I flew Monday night to Orlando, \nand there were only 10 people on the plane. Happily, when I flew back \nfrom Florida, from Tampa to Washington on Tuesday night, there were 40 \npeople on the plane. My recommendation on the basis of going to two \nmajor airports in Florida, checking all of their security arrangements, \nis that the security apparatus is beginning to work. It didn't work on \nSeptember 11.\n  The first part of restoring this industry to health is security, so \nthat we can get people back in the airplanes and the American public \nflying again. That, of course, has been amply demonstrated by our \ndiscussion today. I am a cosponsor of this bill.\n  The second component that came out of our hearing was that the \nairlines, in order to be able to operate, have to have insurance that \nis available and affordable. That is what is creating the crisis right \nnow, that several of the insurance carriers are about to yank the \ncoverage from the airlines. Of course, the airlines will be grounded if \nthat is going to occur.\n  That is what is so important in this package that is coming out that \nthe majority leader and the Republican leader are about to describe, a \ncomponent of victims' compensation which would eliminate a lot of the \nuncertainty about all that collateral damage that had been done as a \nresult of the World Trade Center being rammed by those two jet liners \nand where would be the source of that funding.\n  Preliminarily, for the leaders to discuss what has been agreed upon \nas a first step--and I do believe this is a first step in a long \njourney, as we return to normality in our airline traffic system, a \nvery big, essential first step--the American public, the American \ntraveling public, has to be a major component. They have to have the \nconfidence that they are going to be safe when they get back into air \ntravel.\n  A major component of economic restoration in this country is hanging \nin the balance. I am going to discuss why I think this is of critical \nimportance to the country.\n  Once we get through and decide on this first package--hopefully we \nwill enact it this afternoon--then there are going to be many steps in \nthis journey. There are collateral industries that have been decimated. \nClearly, all of these other collateral industries, such as hotels, \nrestaurants, tourist attractions, car rental agencies--and I have three \nof the Nation's largest that are headquartered in the State of Florida:\n  Alamo, National, and Budget Rent A Car companies are headquartered in \nthe State of Florida. You can imagine, with 50 percent of their \nbusiness now not coming in the door, what is happening to their \nfinancial obligations, and to the obligations they have to banks on \nloan payments, and their obligations to the salaries of their \nemployees.\n  So as we get on down the road, I think what we are going to discover \nis, first and foremost, we have to get the airline industry back in the \nair operating with fairly full loads, so the economic engine is working \nand so it is supplying all of the air traffic that feeds so many of \nthese other collateral industries, such as car rentals, such as hotels, \nsuch as convention centers, such as restaurants. Once that package has \nbeen firmly established--and I hope this gathering right here in this \nSenate is bringing reasonable men together so they might agree--then I \nthink in the very near future--and I am talking about next week--we can \naddress some of these other collateral industries that desperately need \nhelp.\n  Today we are going to proceed with the debate on the aviation \nsecurity bill. I don't think there is going to be a lot of disagreement \non that. I think it clearly will reestablish in the public's mind that \nit is safe to travel. Indeed, I am going to demonstrate that with my \nown feet tonight when I walk on to another commercial airliner. I \nreally do believe it is safe. By the way, if you need to fly, now is \nthe time to fly because there are no lines. But in addition, it is my \nhope that we are going to have agreement here so we can proceed with \nthis financial package to give the aviation industry the security it \nneeds and, thus, the insurance industry will not start canceling their \ninsurance starting Monday and Tuesday. It is absolutely essential, and \nit is essential for one more reason: because we don't want the \nterrorists to win. If they disrupt our economy, if they cause financial \ndistress to a major component of America's economic engine, then they \nwill have scored a victory. But we are not going to let them. That is \nwhy this great democracy is functioning as it is to provide the needed \nhelp.\n  I thank the Chair for the opportunity for me to share. I thank the \nchairman of the committee, Senator Hollings. I thank the ranking \nmember, Senator McCain. It was an excellent all-day hearing yesterday \nin the Commerce Committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S9586]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have a few observations to make and \nthen the Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, is here as well. He would like \nto follow after me.\n  I want to say a few words in support of the Air Transportation System \nStabilization Act, which we will pass, hopefully, in the Senate \nshortly. My only concern with this bill is that the Federal Government \nis not doing all it should for the victims of this tragedy with respect \nto their legal remedies. Specifically, there is no limit in this \nlegislation on the amount of lawyer fees that personal injury lawyers \ncan receive for filing lawsuits, either in absolute terms or as a \npercentage of the victim's recovery. In other words, there is no \nguarantee that the victims or their families will receive an amount of \nthe damages awarded to ensure that the personal injury lawyers do not \nend up taking the lion's share of the award.\n  I think this is, in short, completely wrong, particularly when this \nlegislation caps the compensation of airline executives relative to the \naid package. Bear in mind, what we have in the underlying bill is a cap \non airline executives' compensation but no cap on personal injury \nlawyer fees. It is right that we are going to make sure airline \nexecutives do not take advantage of this terrible tragedy, but we \nshould also make sure personal injury lawyers do not unduly profit from \nother people's miseries. I am relieved, however, that there is already \nin Federal law a bereavement rule in effect that will protect victims \nand families from being chased down and harangued by insensitive and \nopportunistic lawyers. Specifically, 49 U.S.C., section 1136 (g)(2) \nprotects victims of a commercial airline disaster and their families \nfrom unsolicited contact from lawyers for 45 days after a disaster. In \nother words, already under Federal law--I remind all of those who are \nconcerned about the victims that there is a 45-day period from the day \nof the disaster during which, under this bereavement rule, lawyers are \nnot to contact the families of victims of planes that have been lost.\n  It provides in relevant part that in the event of an accident \ninvolving an air carrier providing interstate or foreign air \ntransportation:\n\n       No unsolicited communication concerning a potential action \n     for personal injury or wrongful death may be made by an \n     attorney (including an associate, agent, employee, or other \n     representative of an attorney) or any potential party to the \n     litigation to the individual injured in the accident, or to a \n     relative of an individual involved in the accident, before \n     the 45th day following the date of the accident.\n\n  Let me repeat: For 45 days after this tragedy, Federal law protects \nthe victims and their families from unsolicited contact and harassment \nby lawyers or their agents. And this protection applies to all victims, \nwhether they are from New York, New Jersey, Virginia, or any other \nState.\n  I am glad we acted in 1996 to protect the emotionally vulnerable from \nthose in the legal community who do not have their best interests at \nheart. I am glad we acted again in 2000 to extend the bereavement time \nfrom 30 to 45 days. This gives the relatives of victims time to find \ntheir loved ones, arrange for burial, and come to grips with their \nloss. And I want to make sure that the victims and their families know \nthat, as we speak, Federal law protects them in this fashion. This is a \nFederal Government guarantee to innocent victims that all aggrieved \nfamilies will be protected until Friday, October 26, from any contact \nwhatsoever on the part of lawyers seeking to represent those who have \nbeen victims of this disaster.\n  I wish the legislation had included at least a 25-percent cap on \nfees, such as is already the case in the Federal Tort Claims Act today. \nAlready today, in the Federal Tort Claims Act, there is a 25-percent \ncap on legal fees. I wish that had been applied to this bill. At least \nwe do have the bereavement rule in existing law to protect the victims \nof this disaster from being contacted by lawyers for 45 days, and that \nwill go up until October 26.\n  I commend the Senator from South Carolina for his legislation \nregarding airport safety. There is no question that we need to make \nthoughtful and sweeping changes to help ensure that the tragedy of \nSeptember 11 never occurs again.\n  I would also like to commend the Senator from Arizona and the Senator \nfrom Texas for their leadership on this issue. Yesterday, I introduced \nlegislation that had a similar purpose to expand airport and airplane \nsecurity.\n  The legislation I introduced yesterday, however, took a different \napproach by placing the primary responsibility for an expanded Federal \nAir Marshal program with the Attorney General, as our nation's top law \nenforcement official. I firmly believe that we need a comprehensive \nFederal Air Marshal program to secure airports from curbside to \ncockpit.\n  So, the fundamental difference between my approach and the Committee \napproach is that my legislation would relieve the obligations of \nairport security from the FAA and the airlines, whose primary purpose \nis to facilitate and manage air travel, and entrust that obligation to \nthe Department of Justice, whose primary mission is to enforce federal \nlaw, and most importantly, to safeguard and protect us from terrorism.\n  Obviously this new Federal Air Marshals program will require \nadditional manpower and financial resources. And that is where we \nintend to harness the volunteer spirit espoused by so many of our law \nenforcement personnel throughout the country. The new Federal Air \nMarshals program not only will recruit new full-time active \nprofessional marshals but will augment that program with Deputy Federal \nAir Marshals drawn from retired military personnel, as well as active \nor retired Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers--anyone \nfrom a DEA agent to a local law enforcement officer who wants to serve \nhis country by securing our airports and aircraft. It is also crucial \nthat we retain a sufficient measure of cost-sharing with private and \nstate and local entities. Private airlines and airport authorities \nshould share a responsibility, as they do now, to help fund a portion \nof airport security.\n  We actually already have models in place for the type of curbside to \ncockpit security envisioned in this bill. Our federal courthouses \ncurrently are secured by our United States Marshals, who also employ \nCourt Security Officers (CSOs) to provide security around the perimeter \nof the building, at each point of entry, and in the courtrooms \nthemselves. These CSO are themselves retired Federal, State, and local \nlaw enforcement personnel. Part of the reason our courthouses are so \nsecure today is that this unified system provides for layers of \nsecurity far before one enters the actual courtroom. This is perhaps \nwhy Americans have so little to fear today when they walk inside a \nfederal courtroom. What is good for our federal judges is good for all \nAmericans. Our nation's Capitol also is secured by a uniform system of \nfederal officers who patrol from the interior of this chamber to the \nsurrounding neighborhood sidewalks. Our democracy now demands, in the \ninterest of our national security, that we make sure our cockpits are \nevery bit as secure as our courthouses and this chamber.\n  I believe we should entrust this national security item with the \nresources, expertise, and experience of our Nation's top law \nenforcement agency, and that we do so immediately.\n  I look forward to ongoing discussions with my colleagues who serve on \nthe Commerce Committee and the Judiciary Committee. I think we can work \ntogether to produce a thoughtful and effective airline security law.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to speak on this bill and to add my \nvoice to those who have pointed out how critical it is that the U.S. \nGovernment support our airline industry.\n  I share some concerns, such as those expressed by the Senator from \nKentucky. There are other concerns that others have expressed that also \nhave merit. I will note in a moment why I am very concerned about a \nprovision of the bill. I would not have written it the way it is \nwritten, but I think fundamentally the U.S. Government must support our \nairlines at this critical time.\n  Everyone knows what happened on September 11. Everybody knows that as \na result the U.S. Government shut down the airlines--no more air travel \nuntil we deemed it was safe.\n\n[[Page S9587]]\n\n  That shutdown resulted in huge losses to our airlines, not just for \nthe days those airlines were down, but we have seen a continuation of a \nreluctance of people to fly, a diminution in the revenues of these \nairlines, fewer flights, people laid off and, frankly, the possibility \nof a spiraling down of this industry to the point that it could affect \nmany other facets of our economy and drive our GNP down to an \nunacceptable level.\n  In my State, which depends a lot on tourism--either everyone has come \nto Arizona for a vacation or would like to, I suspect, just as they \nwould for the State of the Presiding Officer, States such as Hawaii, \nNevada, Arizona--we have had a tremendous loss in our tourism industry, \neverything from the hotels and the motels, the golf courses, the \nlimousine and taxi services, and everything else connected with it. \nThose losses are going to be extraordinary and a huge drag on our \neconomy if people do not begin to have confidence that they can fly in \nsafety at reasonable fares.\n  That brings up the concern I have about the legislation. We need to \nsupport this industry. I think we are going to pass this legislation \noverwhelmingly. I hope so. I look forward to supporting it. I want to \nissue a warning about the way this will be implemented because the \nadministration will have a fork in the road and they will have to \nchoose which path to follow. I am going to argue strongly for the first \npath rather than the second, and I want to explain why.\n  This bill actually provides, among other things, some financial \nrelief for the airlines of two different kinds. The first is $5 billion \nof grants. This is to make up for the immediate loss to the airlines \nwhen the Federal Government shut them down. That is fair. Everybody \nagrees with that. There is a formula for that based on passenger miles \nand some other factors that have been agreed to by the airline \nindustry.\n  That same formula was supposed to apply to the subsequent loan \nguarantees. The bill has $10 billion of loan guarantees. The industry \nwanted more, but there is $10 billion of loan guarantees in the bill. \nThat is also very important for the industry because besides getting \nover the immediate hump of those revenue losses, they need to make \nthemselves whole again by going out to the financial market and \nfinancing their future needs until the fares begin to make up for that \nlost revenue. To do that, they need the backing of the U.S. Government \nbecause most of them cannot convince lenders at this point that they \nare a good credit risk, for all of the obvious reasons of which we are \naware.\n  The administration did not want the formula to apply to the loan \nguarantees and has fought very hard to take that formula out. This is \nregrettable because it suggests the possibility that this \nadministration will actually involve itself in picking winners and \nlosers in a free market. That is not right. One can say it is not a \nfree market if the Government guarantees loans, but the Government is \nsupposed to be guaranteeing these loans on an equal basis to everybody. \nIt should not be deciding which companies to favor and which ones not \nto favor.\n  That is my concern about the possibility that because there is no \nformula for the loan guarantees, some Federal official is going to \nliterally be picking winners and losers. They certainly would not do \nthat on the basis of some prejudice. I am not suggesting that. Instead, \nthey would argue they need to protect the taxpayers' money. There is \nnot anybody who has been stronger in this body on that than I have \nbeen. We all agree we need to protect the taxpayers and to grant these \nloans on the basis that they are going to be repaid, obviously so the \ntaxpayers are not left holding the bag. Therein lies the rub because \nsome airlines are different from other airlines in terms of what they \ncan show the bank. Let me give an example.\n\n  The older, larger, well-established airlines have what is called \ncollateral. They have assets they can pledge as collateral for the \nloans. They go to the bank and say: We need to borrow $200 million, and \nwe promise, if we do not pay it back, you can have these three \nairplanes worth $200 million. That is probably way off, but you get my \npoint.\n  The newer airlines have not established the collateral, the asset \nbase which enables them to pledge to the bank that if their loan \ndefaults, they have all these assets with which they can repay the \nloan. Instead, the newer airlines have financed themselves based upon \nthe projection of future revenues, and future revenues have, obviously, \npanned out in most cases. So they have been able to obtain financing, \ntoo.\n  I will give an example. An airline headquartered in my State, America \nWest Airlines, which is 9th or 10th in the country, but a relatively \nnew airline, had just obtained a commitment for a $200 million line of \ncredit based upon future expected revenues. That was set to go through \non September 11, when the bottom fell out. Obviously, no lender under \nthe current circumstances wants to lend to anybody. That is why we are \ntalking about guaranteed loans.\n  There are those who say these loans should be based on some \ncollateral, something very specific and definite, or else the Federal \nGovernment should not be in the business of guaranteeing the loan. That \nwould cut out certain companies, the very companies that offer the \nprimary competition to these older, larger airlines to keep the fares \nlow.\n  The reason these newer airlines have succeeded is that they have been \nable to offer low-fare service, and the net result has been a lot of \npeople have gone to these newer, smaller airlines. But it has also \nserved to keep the older, larger airlines' fares within a reasonable \nlevel.\n  I happen to fly a couple of these older, larger airlines a lot, and I \nlove them. They have provided very good service, and I want to help \nthem, but I think they would agree that it would not be fair simply \nbecause of a difference in size or age, therefore representing \ndifferent circumstances, that one airline should be preferred over \nanother airline in terms of the ability to get these loans.\n  The legislation has embodied within it total discretion on the part \nof the President and his agents in any event because it says that the \nloans that are made under this guaranteed loan provision are only to be \noffered under rules and regulations the President deems necessary--no \nother further restrictions.\n  The reality is, if the President of the United States wants to say: I \nwant to make sure the taxpayers get their money back, so I am going to \nrequire a condition of X, he can do that. The ability, however, to do \nthat should not be confused with the ability of an airline to say: Even \nthough the President has total discretion to grant terms and conditions \nthat we may not be able to satisfy, if there is a formula involved, we \nat least have the right to go to the banks or other lenders and say: \nUnder the legislation, we are, in effect, guaranteed the right to apply \nfor 3 percent or 5 percent, or whatever that percentage is, of the \navailable loans, and therefore would you, please, based upon that \ncommitment of the Federal Government, lend us that money? There is at \nleast a right to apply for a certain amount of money to borrow. There \nis no guarantee the Government is going to approve the terms of the \nloan, but there is at least the right to do that. That is what \nreturning the formula to the legislation would do.\n  Senator McCain and I have considered offering an amendment to that \neffect. We know the leadership would like to consider the bill without \namendments, and we are willing to proceed on that basis if everyone \nelse is as well.\n  What I am saying to our leadership, to you, Mr. President, and to \nanybody in the administration who will listen, is we are willing to \ncooperate on this, and, on behalf of the people we represent, we are \nwilling to be cooperative, but we plead with them that for good public \npolicy, they need to appreciate the differences among the airlines, the \nfact that some can do one thing, others can do another, and that this \nGovernment should not be in the business of literally picking winners \nand losers, the result of which could be to drive companies into \nbankruptcy. I do not think anybody wants that on their hands.\n  In the granting of these loans, I hope it will be done in such a way \nthat they do not disadvantage certain companies with the result that \nthey cannot stay\n\n[[Page S9588]]\n\nin business. All of the industry will suffer as a result, and the \nAmerican travelers will suffer as a result.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise before you today to support \nthe Aviation Security Bill introduced by Senator Hollings and me. As \nthe nation strives to recover from the tragic events of September 11, \n2001, one of the vital steps we must take to protect our economy and \nregain our sense of national security is to restore full function and \nconfidence to our nation's air transport system. We are on the verge of \npassing a large financial package to aid in relieving the financial \npressures placed on our airlines as the result of these heinous \nattacks. This is a crucial first step in restoring consumer confidence \nin our airlines, both to the passengers who rely on their services and \nto the economy.\n  While the financial package is of critical importance, I believe the \nsingle most crucial element in the airlines' recovery is restoring \nconfidence in air travel by making it as safe and secure as is \npractical. While the financial package will help the airlines recover \nfrom the short-term losses associated with the September 11th disasters \nand subsequent shutdown, only the public's return to air travel can \nguarantee their long-term success. Travelers must be confident that the \nUnited States has the most advanced, secure aviation system in the \nworld. The Aviation Security Bill before us today is an important first \nstep in restoring such confidence to those in the sky and those on the \nground. I am proud to stand with Senator Hollings to introduce this \nmomentous legislation.\n  The Aviation Security Bill contains important security measures which \nwill drastically reduce the potential for future disruptions in our \nnation's air traffic. The bill demands the strengthening of cockpit \ndoors and limits access to the cockpit itself, thus assuring that a \ncommercial plane can never again be used as a guided weapon of \ndestruction. Only pilots will be able to allow others into the cockpit. \nUnder the provisions of this bill, even flight attendants won't have \nkeys. It federalizes airport security operations, improving the \ntraining and testing programs for screening personnel, giving these \ninvaluable men and women the tools necessary to perform their jobs \nproperly. It increases perimeter security at airports, in their parking \nlots, and in air traffic facilities so that we can be sure at all times \nthat only authorized personnel and vehicles have immediate access to \nour airports and aircraft. Additionally, it increases the number of \nfederal Air Marshals and provides hijack training for flight crews to \nmake certain those in the skies are equipped to deal with any situation \nthat may arise after takeoff. It establishes a Deputy Administrator at \nthe Federal Aviation Administration for Aviation Security and \nestablishes an interagency Aviation Security Council to make it easier \nfor the government to assess and respond to the needs of the aviation \ncommunity. It requires the performance of background checks on those \nseeking training in the operation of large planes. This will allow us \nto ensure that those who know how to fly our planes have the noble \ngoals of service and self-betterment in mind. All of these steps \nguarantee that air transportation will be safer and more secure than it \nhas ever been.\n  However, it is important to remember that this is only the first \nstep. It is crucial that we take immediate, but not final action. In \nthe eleven days since these tragic events, many common-sense security \nsolutions have emerged all over the country and on Capitol Hill. These \nare the solutions included in this bill. Yet a longer look remains \nnecessary. We must continue to examine aviation security, working in \nphases to implement newer and better security measures as we go. We \ncannot forget about smaller commercial airports and general aviation \nairports. My home state of West Virginia is full of these airports and \nwe must ensure that they receive the same scrutiny and attention as \nlarger airports. We must ensure that customers in smaller markets can \nalso travel with confidence. Furthermore, additional security measures \nfor our major airlines, such as limits on carry-on baggage, must also \nbe considered. I am certain that as we continue to examine the safety \nissues before us, we cannot only restore confidence in our nation's air \ntransport system but, in fact, instill in the flying public a level of \nconfidence even greater than before. I ask you to join me in supporting \nThe Aviation Security Bill and to join me in finding future solutions \nto improve our national aviation system.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are now at a point where I can \npropound this unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to \nS. 1450, the aviation assistance and security bill; that no amendments \nor motions be in order to the bill; that there be 1 hour for debate \nequally divided between the two leaders, or their designees, with an \nadditional 15 minutes under the control of Senator Byrd and 10 minutes \nfor Senator Kennedy and 5 minutes for Senator Specter; that at the \nconclusion or yielding back of the time, the bill be read a third time, \nand the Senate vote, without intervening action or debate, on final \npassage of the bill.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that when the Senate receives from \nthe House its companion bill, it be immediately considered, read a \nthird time, and passed, provided it is identical to the Senate-passed \nbill.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that once the bill has been enacted \ninto law, provided it is identical to the Senate measure, then action \non the Senate bill be vitiated and the measure then be indefinitely \npostponed.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I do \nnot intend to object, for clarification, is the specific time within \nthe bill, within the 1-hour total?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, those would be in addition to the 1-hour \ntotal as is propounded.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object, I ask I be given 5 minutes out of the minority leader's \ntime.\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Reserving the right to object, parliamentary inquiry: \nAre the times that were mentioned outside of the 1 hour?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I want to clarify that because I think we need to be at \nleast on equal footing as far as additional time is concerned. I \nunderstand there is a time request by the Senator from Illinois and \nothers on this side, so we ought to try to be equitable in the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, we have a \ncommitment to Senators who wish to be heard, such as Senator Kyl and \nSenator Fitzgerald, that they will be yielded time out of the one half \nhour on our side. Of course, Senator Hutchison will be my designee to \nhandle the time on our side, and she will speak also, but I urge the \nSenators to speak within the allowed time and hopefully keep the total \ntime under an hour.\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is agreeable to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, our \nNation's airlines are clearly suffering as a result of last week's \nterrorist attacks, and I express my appreciation to the distinguished \nmajority leader for his efforts to craft a comprehensive package of \nfinancial assistance for the airlines. I am confident the leader's \nefforts will ensure that the attackers who took down our buildings will \nnot succeed in taking down the airline industry, too. I look forward to \nsupporting this measure.\n  I also believe we must act to bolster the airline industry. We must \ndemonstrate our commitment to supporting the men and women who \nrepresent the industry's heart and soul.\n\n[[Page S9589]]\n\n The tens of thousands of workers who before September 11 were flying \nour planes, building our planes, keeping our airports open, and serving \nthe flying public are now facing unemployment. They will need financial \nassistance to be sure they can continue to pay their mortgages. They \nmay need retraining so they can find jobs in a new industry. And we \nought to be sure they and their families are not put in the scary \nposition of being without health care coverage. As we have done for the \nairlines, the Federal Government must take the lead in supporting these \nworkers.\n  I inquire of the leader as to his thoughts on the prospect for \nenacting a benefit package for displaced workers in the near future.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Missouri for raising the issue and commend her for her active \ninvolvement on this matter now for some time. She spoke eloquently \nabout it in the caucus, and she has addressed this issue on a number of \noccasions. I share her conviction and her strong belief that we must \naddress the impact on employees as well.\n  Over 100,000 employees are now out of work as a result of this \nextraordinary economic problem we are facing, and we have to address \nit. I indicated my caucus this morning that it is my strong view that \nthis is the first installment of a series of efforts that must be made \nto put our economy back on track and to address the myriad other \neconomic challenges we face, especially those involving workers and \ntheir families. So we are going to continue to work and find ways in \nwhich to do that.\n  I emphasize I see this only as the first installment. We will have to \ngo back and address other issues, especially those involving families. \nI thank the Senator for raising the issue.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. As always, I thank the leader for his guidance. I look \nforward to working with him next week, and I do not object.\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, but I \nask that Senator Nickles get 20 minutes so we will have a balance of \nthe time.

Mr. President, I yield to the manager of the bill, the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, are we now on the bill and into my 30 \nminutes of time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for yielding \nme time. Let me try to be quicker than 5 minutes.\n  No. 1, while this package may not be what anyone likes, I am sure in \nthis body and the other body there are probably 535 different ideas as \nto what we need to do. I hope we can come together, the House and \nSenate, and decide that we must move. I am more than willing to take \nwhat has been put together as an emergency measure and urge my \ncolleagues to support it, and to support it without amendment.\n  We are looking at a situation where the airline industry, which is a \ncritical element in our economy, is right on the verge--from the \nsmallest airlines that need an immediate infusion of cash to make up \nfor the losses that were sustained when the Federal Government \nrightfully shut down air transportation this past week, to the current \ntime where consumer concerns over safety have limited the flying \npublic. We have put our entire airline industry at great risk. This \nbill is necessary if we are to solve those problems and if we are to \nget the planes back in the air.\n  I can understand what my colleagues in this body and the other body \nhave raised as concerns about insurance and compensation for those who \nare out of work. Let me be clear; it is not just the airline industry \nwhich has suffered losses. Boeing laid off 30,000 workers. I have just \ntalked to people in the travel and tourism industry and consumer \nproducts industries. They have suffered a great downturn, and there may \nbe people out of work. The good news is we have in place statutes and \nprograms designed to assist those people.\n  Let me be clear; if we delay passing this bill, as we attempt to \ncraft a change or adjustment on assistance for laid-off employees, we \nrisk causing a tremendous economic calamity.\n  I understand that in the House objections over the failure to include \nrelief for unemployment led to objections that put the passage of this \npackage in doubt.\n  Right now, we are looking at layoffs in the airline industry in the \nneighborhood of 20 to 25 percent. If we do not pass this bill, we are \nlooking at 100-percent layoffs. We are looking not only at disaster for \nthose people who work in the airline industry, those of us who depend \nupon airline traffic to get back to our constituents, those who depend \nupon airline travel for business, for recreation, and for tourism, but \na risk to the entire economy. So this bill needs to be passed.\n  Let me also point out that last week I was in this Chamber and I said \nthat one of the key things we must include in the airline rescue \npackage is a carefully crafted, structured means of providing \ncompensation to the victims. There is a two-part means of providing \ncompensation for the families of those who are deceased as a result of \nthe accident and those who are injured. There are various provisions \nbuilt in which would seem to make an option of two structures \navailable, and there is a clear-cut indication that airlines will be \nliable only up to the limits of their existing insurance coverage.\n  I thank the White House and the leadership for including those \nprotections. Without them, at least two of our major airlines would not \nbe able to continue in business next week. This is critically \nimportant, as is the provision in the measure for direct loans to those \nwho can demonstrate their need to the Secretary of Transportation as \nwell as loans which are to be structured by a board composed of the \nSecretary of Transportation, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, the \nSecretary of the Treasury, and the Comptroller General. We put a great \ndeal of discretion and responsibility in the hands of those very able \nofficials. While none of us may have crafted the bill exactly as it was \ncrafted, this is our only hope to ensure we do not have a disaster \nresulting from the total shutdown of the airline industry.\n  I urge my colleagues, I beg my colleagues, to pass it.\n  I return to the manager on this side any time remaining on my time. I \nthank the Chair and the Senator from Texas for their accommodation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I will take up to 3 minutes of time now to explain \nwhat is in the bill, but I want to be told when 3 minutes is up because \nI will lose the remaining 30 minutes to other people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will notify the Senator.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, the Air Transportation System \nStabilization Act is the effort of the U.S. Congress, working with the \nPresident, to shore up the aviation industry in our country. Already we \nhave seen announced almost 100,000 layoffs in the aviation industry in \nour country. That will have a rippling effect throughout the economy. \nWhat we are doing today is trying to stabilize this industry to keep it \non its feet in very tough times so we can minimize the layoffs. \nHopefully, they will not be as bad as the airlines announced they will \nbe and we\n\n[[Page S9590]]\n\ncan get this country back on track so our economy will stay strong.\n  What this bill does is have $5 billion in immediate assistance to the \ncarriers based on their actual losses for the grounded airplane time \nthey have had. As we know, there is still one airport that does not \nhave service. We still have airlines losing business because of the \nSeptember 11 tragedy that was not any fault of theirs.\n  We have in addition $10 billion of loan guarantees subject to terms \nand conditions set by the President. There will be a board created to \nreview and decide on the applications for these Federal credit \ninstruments. The board will be the Secretary of the Treasury, the \nFederal Reserve Chairman, the Secretary of Transportation, and the \nComptroller General. These loans will be based on sound, solid, \nhopefully, financial integrity. We are also going to put limits on \nexecutive compensation of any carrier that gets a part of this airline \ncash assistance package.\n  We also have provisions for the Secretary of Transportation to \nprovide help for airlines that are the only airline serving a \ncommunity, and if the airline wants to pull out, we are going to try to \nencourage that airline to stay in the community. We are dealing with \nthe liability issues, trying to take from the airlines any liability \nbeyond what their insurers will carry.\n\n  We also have liability provisions for the war risk insurance for all \nother industries that might be affected in the future with an act of \nterrorism that is beyond their control so that they will not be liable \nbeyond their means and be put out of business.\n  These are the basic parts of this legislation that we are hoping to \npass tonight and send to the President.\n  I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam President, I rise to say what I think are some \nimprovements that have been made to the bill as it has been negotiated \nby various parties in the House and the Senate, and I guess with \ninvolvement from the White House and the Office of Management and \nBudget.\n  I am very concerned about the airline industry and especially the \nmany employees of the industry. Tens of thousands of airline employees \nhave already been laid off. My home State of Illinois is home to O'Hare \nInternational Airport which is a hub for United and American Airlines, \nthe Nation's two largest carriers. Perhaps no State in the country is \nas immediately affected by the problems affecting the aviation industry \nas is Illinois. I am very concerned about the employees. I met with \nseveral skycaps the other day who told me it was their last day on the \njob, and to see the forlorn look in their eyes was heart wrenching.\n  However, I alert my colleagues, the way this bill is designed, there \nis no protection for the employees of these airlines. There are no \nstrings, really, attached to the airline access of up to $15 billion in \ntaxpayer money. It is money that some airlines will take, and still we \nwill see lots of layoffs and poor treatment of some of the airline \nemployees.\n  I think Congress is remiss; we are moving too fast. We should have \nsome strings attached if they are getting all this government money. We \nshould have some protections for the airline employees. That is an \nomission in this bill.\n  I am also concerned that anytime you have a Federal bailout of an \nindustry, you have to ask, by what principle or what reasoning are you \nbailing out this industry? In this case, we have chosen to bail out the \nairline industry. The airline industry has said they are entitled to \nFederal money because the Federal Government issued a ground stop order \non September 11 that kept their planes out of the air for at least 2\\1/\n2\\ days, and but for that ground stop order, that edict of the \nGovernment, they would not have incurred the losses they did during \nthose days.\n\n  This bill might make sense if we were only compensating them for the \nlosses incurred by virtue of that ground stop order. The fact is we are \ncompensating them for many times the losses they suffered as a result \nof the ground stop order.\n  Analysts testified before the Senate Commerce Committee yesterday. I \nsat in the whole hearing for 4 hours. We heard from many people. It was \ntestified that the direct loss to the aviation industry in America as a \nresult of that ground stop order on September 11 was $2 to $3 billion. \nThat comports with the estimates that have come out from research \ndepartments, investment banks around the country, and comports with \neverything I have seen. Yet this bill has $5 billion in direct cash \nassistance and another $10 billion in loan guarantees or $15 billion in \nFederal taxpayer bailouts.\n  Leo Mullin, the CEO of Delta Air Lines, testified that the direct \nloss of Delta Air Lines for each day they were shut down as a result of \nthat ground stop order was $70 million. So over 3 days, Delta Air Lines \nincurred a loss as a result of the ground stop order of $210 million. \nHow much in Federal assistance will Delta get as a result of this bill? \nAt least four times the losses they sustained as a result of the ground \nstop order. Delta will get about 60 percent of the $5 billion in cash \nassistance. In other words, they will get a grant of about $800 \nmillion, four times their losses, plus they will be eligible for these \nnew loan guarantees.\n  The bottom line is, I think this assistance is too generous. It gives \ntoo much money. It goes far beyond compensating the airlines for those \n3 days that Government edict was in effect.\n  Clearly we are compensating them for far more. In fact, this bill \nsuggests we are compensating them for all their losses through the end \nof the year. Then my question is, By what principle do we not agree to \nhelp other industries?\n  I had the general counsel of a major car rental company call me and \nsay they needed the bailout. I had restaurants tell me they are \nshutting down. There are hotels shutting down. The fact is, those other \nindustries did not quite have the effective lobbying team the airline \nindustries had. They were very prompt in coming to Capitol Hill and \nrequesting relief. And, moreover, they got this relief in a way that I \nthink is virtually unprecedented.\n  When the Chrysler Corporation got its loans guaranteed back in the \n1970s, in return for making those Government guarantees the Federal \nGovernment was paid in warrants of Chrysler Corporation stock. The \nGovernment took 14 million warrants of Chrysler Corporation. When those \nwarrants rose in value as the company did better and got back on its \nfeet, the Government sold those warrants at, I believe, a $300 million \nprofit.\n  Fortunately, Senator Corzine and I worked together. We did get put \ninto this bill, at our request, language to allow the Treasury \nDepartment, in return for any of the loan guarantees that are given out \nunder this bill--the Treasury will have the authority to negotiate \nappropriate warrants so the taxpayers can participate in the upside \nhere.\n\n  I would prefer that the Treasury Department have clear authority to \nask for warrants in return for the $5 billion in cash assistance. I \nthink that would be the appropriate protection for the taxpayers. In \nfact, without that protection, then, what we are doing, by the way we \nare structuring this bailout--this is not a bailout of the industry so \nmuch as it is a transfer of the loss that industry has incurred from \nthe airline industry shareholders to Joe Taxpayer.\n  It may be intuitive to some that the general decline of the industry, \nthat loss, should be borne by the taxpayers. To this Senator it is not \nintuitive that the shareholders of airlines should be protected and \nindemnified from any loss here. I find it very troubling. I think there \nshould be a price the shareholders have to pay.\n  I hope the Treasury Department and the Office of Management and \nBudget will try to find if they have any residual authority --they tell \nme they believe they do--to ask for warrants from each airline in \nreturn for the grants they are given.\n  In the Continental Bank bailout, which happened in Chicago, IL, many \nyears ago, in the 1980s, the FDIC did not come in and make the \nshareholders of Continental Bank rich. In fact, they wiped out the \nshareholders of Continental Bank in return for the Government \nassistance, and FDIC ended up owning 80 percent of the bank. Then, when \nthe bank got back on its feet, the Government did an initial public \noffering of its shares and sold them back to the public and recouped \nfor the taxpayers what they had given.\n  I think we could have done better. It is an improvement from where it \nwas\n\n[[Page S9591]]\n\nearlier in the process. I certainly hope the issuance of warrants--and \nthe Treasury has the authority now to accept warrants in return for the \nissuance of the loan guarantees--I hope that authority on the part of \nthe Treasury will deter companies, airlines that do not need a Federal \nguarantee, from coming to the taxpayers and asking them for that \nguarantee. So I am hopeful the Treasury will use that authority to the \nfullest extent, and I am hopeful, furthermore, that in return for the \ncash grants available under this bill, the Treasury will insist upon \ngetting some equity instruments in the corporation or some payment for \nthe taxpayers, lest this just be a complete and total indemnification \nof the sophisticated shareholders of the airline industry.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Will the Senator yield for a question before he yields \nthe floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has no time at this time. His time \nhas expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The Senator from West Virginia is happy to yield 5 \nminutes to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I wonder if I might ask a question of the Senator from \nIllinois with regard to his premise that would not be subtracted from \nmy time?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. If the Senator wishes to do it, it is on his time.\n  Mr. CORZINE. The Senator from Illinois spoke about the need to ensure \nsome accountability by giving the Government a stake in airlines that \nare provided grants beyond the funding necessary to compensate them for \nthe shutdown period. I agree with him on that.\n\n  Has the Senator had conversations with anyone on this question? Has \nhe been led to believe that equity participation--warrants, options, \ncalls--also will be extended to grants that go beyond compensation for \nlosses associated with the shutdown?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Yes, I have, in a conversation, I think, with Sean \nO'Keefe from the Office of Management and Budget. He works for Mitch \nDaniels. He was under the impression that the executive branch had the \nauthority, in return for granting $5 billion worth of cash assistance, \nto demand warrants or other appropriate instruments from the airlines \nthat were getting them, and that that would deter the airlines from \nasking for more than they should.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Is it the Senator's belief that the equity stake \nassociated with those grants would operate in the same way that is \nexplicitly outlined in the bill with respect to loan guarantees, with \nrespect to which the Treasury clearly has the authority to access \nwarrants, options, or calls?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Yes. Just as in return for the loan guarantees the \nTreasury could ask for warrants, I believe that in return for the cash \ngrants, the Treasury can ask for warrants from the corporation.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I thank the Senator from Illinois for helping clarify \nthis, and making clear what the administration has said about this \naspect of the bill.\n  Having said that, Madam President, let me emphasize that I rise very \nmuch in support of the efforts to reinforce our aviation industry. This \nindustry is in dire straits. And it is an industry that plays a \ncritical role in our economy.\n  It also plays an important role for our military. Senator Torricelli \nand I visited McGuire Air Force Base with senior officers on Monday, \nand they told us that about 40 percent of the transportation that our \nmilitary folks will need in a full war might be provided by our private \naviation industry. The strength of that industry clearly is important \nfor our national security.\n  Madam President, I live in a State where about 12,000 Continental \nemployees work at Newark Airport. It is the largest employer in Newark. \nI very much understand the needs and desires of having a healthy and \nongoing industry which is under stress. But, in my view, unless we have \nsome discipline in this process--which very clearly has been outlined \nin the bill as it relates to loan guarantees--we would be writing a \nblank check for some companies that are very strong. This would be \nunnecessary and could dissipate resources that could be better spent on \nother important priorities, including workers who are losing their jobs \nand other struggling companies that are not in the airline industry.\n  In my view, it would be a mistake to provide direct support without \ndiscipline. So I hope the Administration will do what it said it will \ndo, and ensure that, as with the loan guarantees, the grants that we \nare offering companies--beyond those needed to compensate them for \nlosses directly associated with the stop order--are accompanied by \nwarrants, or options held by the Federal government. This will help \nensure discipline and accountability, just as would be required in the \nprivate sector.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I would like to commend the \nMajority Leader for his hard work in putting together an airline \nstabilization bill that will save our nation's airlines and our air \ntransport infrastructure. I will strongly support this bill without \namendment.\n  The terrorists who launched those despicable attacks on September 11 \ntook thousands of American lives, and did billions of dollars of \ndamage. It has also become clear in the past 10 days that they dealt a \nbody blow to the U.S. airline industry, on which virtually all of our \ncitizens depend on to one degree or another.\n  Demand for air travel has virtually collapsed in the past week. Last \nweekend I flew back to West Virginia, and on the return flight Sunday \nnight--usually a crowded flight from Charleston to Dulles--I was the \nonly passenger on the plane. Many of my colleagues have mentioned that \nthey've had similar experiences in the past ten days. Flights are \ndeparting West Virginia airports with a load factor of 25 per cent--\nonly one in four seats filled. Unfortunately, this is not, like last \nweek's closure of the New York Stock Exchange, a temporary phenomenon. \nBased on past air disasters or international conflicts--none of which \nwas of the same massive scale as last Tuesday's attacks--airlines are \npredicting that passenger traffic will be down by almost half for the \nremainder of this year, and will take until next summer to return to \nnormal levels. And those are optimistic estimates.\n  This kind of crisis could do irreparable harm to the ability of \nAmerica's airlines to continue in business. Airlines lost $300 million \neach day that they were shut down last week. They are set to lose \nbillions more in the coming months. Their insurance rates have shot up, \nwith some airlines telling us of a 600 percent increase in their \ninsurance rates. Coming on top of what was already a difficult outlook \nbecause of our slowing economy, the nation's airlines--main line \ncarriers and regional carriers alike--could be in bankruptcy within a \nfew weeks and possibly out of business within a few months. Already we \nare seeing the first signs: a round of massive, painful layoffs for \nnearly 100,000 of our nation's hardworking airline employees. And huge \ncutbacks of around 20 percent to most airlines' schedules.\n  Some people have said, well, this is the market, and it is not the \nAmerican way to interfere with the market. But I have been pleased, as \nchairman of the Senate's aviation subcommittee, to see a broad \nconsensus among my colleagues that the air transport industry is not \njust a huge business and employer, but it is also a critical element of \nour nation's infrastructure. Nowhere is that more the case than in the \nsmaller states and communities like West Virginia. When people think of \nthe airline industry, they usually think of big hub airports like \nHartsfield and O'Hare. But airline traffic is just as important--maybe \nmore important to smaller communities like Beckley and Bridgeport. \nSafe, convenient and affordable air service represents an important \nelement of our efforts to attract development to our state. It's an \nimportant connection that allows our citizens and our businesses to \novercome the historic isolation created by our state's mountainous \nterrain.\n  And when I see planes flying with one passenger, and learn that \ncarriers are cutting back on their schedules, and hear that several \ncarriers could be in bankruptcy within two weeks, I know that the first \ncommunities to be hit will be small communities like those in\n\n[[Page S9592]]\n\nWest Virginia that are at the end of the food chain, so to speak. That \nwould be tragic. It would reverse the efforts our communities have made \nto attract and retain air service, and turn their residents into \naviation ``have nots.'' It would also set in motion the slow implosion \nof the U.S. airline industry, which would spread to larger hubs and \nairports as well. And finally, it would give the terrorists who \nperpetrated last week's heinous attacks the ultimate victory, as their \nactions would lead to a severe curtailment of America's freedom of \nmovement and mobility.\n  It is the shared consensus of this body that cannot be permitted to \nhappen, and that has driven our remarkable efforts this past week to \nput together a stabilization package for our nation's airlines.\n  It will contain up to $5 billion in immediate credits to reimburse \nairlines for the revenues they lost when the government shut down U.S. \nair space last week. It will also contain $10 billion in loan \nguarantees so that our airlines can continue to obtain financing in the \ncoming months.\n  It will limit airlines' liability for collateral damage incurred up \nto the amount of their existing insurance coverage as a result of last \nweek's terrorist attacks--a key provision because our airlines might \notherwise not be able to obtain or afford insurance.\n  It will set up a victim's compensation fund for the families of the \ninnocent victims of last week's despicable attacks\n  It will provide $120 million in additional authority to fund to the \nEssential Air Service program, a key element in preserving air service \nto smaller communities.\n  This package is an important first step in stabilizing the U.S. \nairline industry and ensuring that air service to communities across \nthe nation survives this crisis. But it does not address all the needs \nthat this crisis has created.\n  One important issue we will need to take up in short order is the \nplight of the nearly 100,000 airline workers who will lose their jobs \nas a result of this week's cutbacks. We have already begun to see \nairline layoffs in West Virginia. Excellent workers who expected a \npromising career in a growing industry, until terrorists hijacked four \nplanes and frightened Americans out of the skies. We must take measures \nto address their needs. We provide special assistance to American \nworkers who have been displaced by foreign trade; we must provide the \nsame level of assistance to American workers who have been displaced by \nforeign terrorism.\n  We must also be prepared to look at the needs of related industries, \nas well as the future needs of the airline industry. Many related \nindustries--aircraft manufacturers, travel agents, and various travel-\nrelated businesses--have already begun to feel the effects of this \nattack. We will have to look carefully at the real needs of those \nindustries, and be prepared to take bold measures where they are needed \nand appropriate.\n  One thing is certain: the survival of America's airlines is a key \nelement of any solution. Their needs are real and urgent, and I \ncongratulate the Majority Leader on his success in putting together a \nstabilization package that will address them.\n  Madam President, Senator Schumer and I believe Senator Clinton wants \nto speak, along with the Senator from Texas and a few others. But I \nnote that the Senator from Texas has an obligation, as well as all of \nus, and we would like to see this drawn to a close and have our vote. \nThose who want to speak on other subjects could perhaps do that after \nthe vote. It would be just as relevant.\n  From my point of view, we are at a very clear and obvious, \narithmetically, inevitable point in time where we have to say to the \naviation industry of the United States and, even more importantly, to \nthe American people that there are going to be planes flying on Monday. \nWe have to have a safety bill. That is an enormous subject, and safety \nhas to come. Safety will come. Safety is going to be addressed \nimmediately. There are planes to make safe. People need to feel \nconfident about safety and then get aboard the plane. None of it makes \nany difference if their insurance expires. When insurance expires--\nairplane companies have all received their notices--then of course \nthere can be no flights. That will happen very early next week. The \nNation will shut down with respect to that.\n  The whole question of providing support on a temporary basis and \nbased only on what happened as a result of the tragedy on September 11 \nis important. Nothing that the Senate will be voting on will be based \nupon anything that had to do with the airlines' financial condition \nprior to September 11--only as a result of the tragedy on September 11 \nand the Government-mandated shutdown.\n  There are a lot of considerations about the broad economy of America \nas well as the ability of the American people to gain some level of \nconfidence in getting back to travel. In fact, there are airplanes at \nthe airport they can board. I remind all Americans as well as my \ncolleagues that airlines remain far and away the safest form of travel, \nand they have been that way for a long time in comparison with any \nother form.\n  Safety will happen. Safety is somewhat more complex, and it will \nhappen. It will be done by legislation. It will be done by the \nadministration. There will be a lot of money for it. But the ability of \nthe aviation industry to put planes in the sky next week is where we \nhave to start. If we do not pass this legislation, and do not do so \npromptly, it will not happen.\n  I urge my colleagues--who understandably are saying: Wait a second, \nwhat about my rental car company or what about my steel industry--there \nare all kinds of things that can come into an emergency designation. \nBut here, we are focused on aviation. That is the order of this day \nwithin our national security situation. If the planes don't fly, much \nof the economy shuts down. I think this is arithmetically \nuncontestable. I think it is an absolute priority of this Senate to \npass it and hopefully do so in a very short amount of time.\n  I call upon my colleagues to at the proper time support this aviation \nlegislation--not to say that it is perfect, not to say that some of the \nlegislation which has arisen out of this crisis is perfect. We will \nhave a chance to revisit it. This is only the first of a wave of \naccountability and dealings with the airline industry, its financial \nhealth, safety, and all other manner of conditions that are coming \nbefore us. Without this, nothing else follows.\n\n  I plead with my colleagues to support this legislation in spite of \nworker protection and other things which will be absolutely a part of \nwhat follows this vote and this legislation.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield 5 minutes to the senior \nSenator from the State of New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent, following \nthe Senator from New York, to yield time to the Senator from Alabama, \nwho has been waiting for 5 hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Madam President.\n  First, I thank the chairman of our Aviation Subcommittee, the Senator \nfrom West Virginia, and the Senator from Texas, the ranking member, and \neverybody who worked so hard on this issue.\n  I particularly thank our leader, Tom Daschle, for his outstanding \nefforts on this bill and for all the help he provided to New York and \nthe Nation in this recovery from the crash and tragic events of \nSeptember 11. I also want to thank his talented staff who worked long \nand hard on into the night in working out provisions that were vexing \nto me--they are: Andrea LaRue, Laura Petrou, Randy DeValk, Mark \nChildress, and Mark Patterson--for all of their help during the past 2 \nweeks.\n  In addition, there are two technical points I want to clarify. It may \nbe a little unclear to some whether all lawsuits or just lawsuits \nagainst the airlines will be situated in the Southern District of New \nYork. The intent here is to put all civil suits arising from the tragic \nevents of September 11 in the Southern District.\n  Second, the prospective liability package covers the airlines, their \nagents, and other relevant parties. Agents includes, as I understand \nit, airplane lessors and financiers.\n  This bill is a mixed bag. It has some things that I am grateful for \nand support. It does not take any of this\n\n[[Page S9593]]\n\nmoney from the $20 billion we were able to vote for for New York. There \nwas a real attempt to do that. It does not. I appreciate that.\n  There was a huge fight on the liability issue. I understand the need \nfor prospective liability exemption. But at some point the families of \nthose who died in the World Trade Center and not on the airplanes are \ngoing to be treated differently than victims had been and those who \ndied who were on the ground or in buildings in the past. That has been \nrectified. There is a very generous package for those families who lost \nmembers in the World Trade Center bombing--who were in the World Trade \nCenter, not just on the airplanes.\n  Finally, my crusade has been to bring good service to the middle-\nsized cities of upstate New York. While I am not fully satisfied with \nthe provisions, there are provisions in the bill, and let us hope that \nis the beginning of a new chapter. The airlines are no longer totally \nindependent. Therefore, I am relying on them in my meetings with them. \nWhat the majority leader and others have told us is that as we come \nback in future bills, we will strengthen those provisions further so \nthat these airlines cannot abandon middle-sized cities such as \nRochester, Syracuse, Albany, and Buffalo--rather large cities that \ndepend on airline service. But there is a provision in the bill that \nrecognizes some of that. It is better than the present law, and I \nappreciate it.\n  For all those reasons, this bill is a bill I will vote for. I have \nsome misgivings. Amtrak should have been included in this bill. To have \na comprehensive transportation system, we need a good rail system. The \ncongestion that so many of us see in New York airports and other \nairports around the country could well be relieved by a functioning \nAmtrak. Again, I am relying on the understanding of our leadership on \nboth sides of the aisle that when we come back and do other airline \nbills, we will include Amtrak.\n  It also does nothing for the workers. I am very worried, and I urge \nthe airlines not to invoke a war clause when they deal with their union \nworkers. Yes, indeed, when business contracts, we don't expect airlines \nnot to accept those economic consequences, but I would regard invoking \nthat clause as a breach of faith. I hope they will not do it. I hope \nthey know they will have to come back to us and deal with it. We have \nto include employees and what they need in this package as well.\n  It is a mixed bag: good on liability, good on where the money comes \nfrom, and OK making progress on taking account for middle size cities; \nnot enough, nothing for Amtrak, nothing for labor, but we will come \nback and deal with those issues.\n  If it is a mixed bag, why am I supporting this bill? Because we are \nin a new era where every one of us has to give a little bit. We heard \nthe President speak. We were unified yesterday. We must keep that \nunity. It is important that each one of us no longer say: It is my way \nor no way.\n  I didn't get everything I wanted in this bill. I did get some things. \nI am a little worried about the numbers as well.\n  If we don't vote for this bill and we bicker, airlines will not fly \non Monday. It will set a tone in this body that we don't need right \nnow.\n  Relying on the good work of our majority leader and our minority \nleader and knowing we will get back to the other issues we care about, \nI will vote for the bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I am pleased that the Senate has been \nable to act so quickly on this issue.\n  As you know, all four planes hijacked last week were headed for my \nState of California. Consequently, many Californians who were simply \ntrying to make their way home lost their lives in these attacks. My \nheart goes out not only to the Californians who fell victim to \nterrorism, but to all the victims of last week's attacks and their \nloved ones.\n  Our Nation's aviation system was transformed into a terrorist weapon. \nAs a result of the terrorist attack, the airlines are confronting an \nalarming financial situation. Last week's tragedy will be compounded if \nthe aviation industry is destroyed as well.\n  As an industry, airlines are losing $300 million per day. Lines of \ncredit may not be available. Insurance premiums for some airlines may \nrise $100 million per year or may be unavailable period. Without \ninsurance, the airlines cannot fly.\n  Therefore, I support this bill to provide financial assistance to the \nairlines. I also support a victim's compensation fund to help ensure \nthat victims' families receive compensation in a timely fashion.\n  I am particularly pleased with the language in this bill that commits \n$3 billion of the $40 billion in the emergency funding that we passed \nlast week for airline security. I hope this funding is used to improve \nscreening in our airports. It is extremely important that security be \nthe responsibility of the Federal Government, including creation of a \nprofessional security force for passenger screening. I also believe the \nfunding should be used to increase the number of air marshals by \nplacing an air marshal on every commercial domestic flight.\n  This is only the first step in aviation security. In the next week or \ntwo, I will be working to see that Congress passes comprehensive \nsecurity legislation, including federalizing screening and guaranteeing \nthat air marshals are on every flight.\n  Finally, I am disappointed that this bill, while bailing out the \nairlines, does not provide assistance to laid-off workers. This week \nalmost 100,000 jobs were lost industry-wide. That is 100,000 families \nwho are losing their incomes.\n  These numbers do not even include the manufacturing sector of the \nairline industry. Boeing also announced that it could lay off as many \nas 30,000 employees in the next few months.\n  We must not forget the workers who are affected. They may need help \nwith job training and acquiring new skills. They may need help with \nkeeping their health insurance. Again, I will be working to see that \nhelp comes to these families soon.\n  This bill is important, but it is only the beginning of what we need \nto do after last week's tragic events.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, as we discuss this much \nneeded legislation to provide financial assistance to our airline \nindustry, I would like to voice my concern that air service to our \nsmall communities not be lost in this effort. I have consistently \nsupported adequate funding for the Essential Air Service Program, and \nensuring the viability of our small airports is a priority for me. \nBecause I realize the economic impact a loss of air service would have \non our small, rural communities, I applaud the efforts made in this \nlegislation to include the needs of carriers who serve these markets.\n  It is important that in considering financial assistance for the \nairline industry, that thought is given to the impact this tragedy has \nhad on the regional airlines, which service our small communities. \nEssential air funding is critical to providing air service to most of \nthe communities in Nebraska, as I know is the case in many States. As \nwe continually focus on how to regain confidence in our economy, I \nbelieve this is one area where Government assistance can truly be \nbeneficial. Because it is imperative to the economic wellbeing of these \nsmall communities that air service be continued, increasing the level \nof essential air service funding is critical to ensuring the air \ncarriers serving small communities can continue to do so.\n  I understand that the bill contains language authorizing the \nSecretary of Transportation to require air carriers currently receiving \ndirect financial assistance to maintain scheduled air service to any \npoint served by that carrier prior to September 11. In addition, the \nSecretary may require these carriers to enter into agreements, which \nwill, to the maximum extent practicable, ensure that all communities \nthat had scheduled air service before September 11 continue to receive \nadequate air service.\n  I do have concern that in light of recent events some of these \ncarriers will cut service to communities that rely on Government-\nsubsidized air service. Therefore, I urge the Secretary of \nTransportation, in carrying out his authority under this bill with \nrespect to these carriers, to consider the devastating impact cutting \nair service to small communities, especially rural communities, will \nhave. It is my hope that the provisions of this bill provide sufficient \nprotection of air service to small communities.\n\n[[Page S9594]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, the bill that we are voting on today not \nonly provides financial assistance to airlines, it addresses the issue \nof legal liability for the tragic events of last week by creating a \nfederally-funded victims' compensation fund and by limiting airlines' \npotential legal liability to ensure their continued operation.\n  The effect on the airlines of the September 11 terrorist attack put \nCongress in the unenviable position of having to take immediate action \nto prevent the collapse of the aviation industry as a result of the \nfederally ordered grounding of all aircraft and the anticipated \nreduction of air travel.\n  One of the most difficult issues we had to grapple with was the \nenormous potential liability that airlines faced if courts determine \nthat they were negligent and in some way responsible for the damage \nwrought by the terrorist attacks last week.\n  Aviation financiers informed Congress that this potential liability \nwas a barrier to the airlines' obtaining credit in the private market, \nwhich we anticipate they will soon have to seek despite the direct \nfinancial assistance we are providing to them today.\n  The vast uncertainty of our litigation system posed significant \nchallenges to crafting reasonable limitations on airline liability \nwhile providing compensation for the victims of the terrorist attacks \nand their families.\n  Disturbingly, while courts could order the liquidation of our biggest \nairlines if they are deemed liable for the catastrophic damage of \nSeptember 11, victims could also receive no compensation from the \ncourts if they determine that corporate entities, including airlines, \nwere not responsible for the devastating damage arising from the \nterrorist attacks.\n  We faced two unsatisfactory outcomes: 1. that the airlines, whose \nliability insurance coverage is insufficient to cover all damage, would \nbe dissolved as their assets were sold to pay off their liability and/\nor; 2. some or all of the victims who were injured or killed in this \ntragedy would receive no compensation.\n  The liability provisions in this bill are by no means perfect, but \nthey are intended to prevent these two unacceptable results.\n  To ensure that the victims and families of victims who were \nphysically injured or killed on September 11th are compensated even if \ncourts determine that the airlines and any other potential corporate \ndefendants are not liable for the harm; if insurance monies are \nexhausted; or are consumed by massive punitive damage awards or \nattorneys' fees, the bill also creates a victims' compensation fund. \nThese victims and their families may, but are not required to, seek \ncompensation from the Federal fund instead of through the litigation \nsystem.\n  At the same time, to provide for the continued operation of our \nairlines, the bill limits airlines' civil liability to the amount for \nwhich they were insured at the time of these unforeseen events.\n  No amount of money can begin to compensate the victims for their \nsuffering. Nothing will make them and their families ``whole.'' It is \nnot the intent of the federal fund to do this. Nor is it the intent of \nthe fund to duplicate the arbitrary, wildly divergent awards that \nsometimes come from our deeply flawed tort system--awards from which up \nto one third or more of the victims' award is often taken by attorneys.\n  The intent of the fund is to ensure that the victims of this \nunprecedented, unforeseeable, and horrific event, and their families do \nnot suffer financial hardship in addition to the terrible hardships \nthey already have been forced to endure.\n  In addition to removing the specter of devastating potential \nliability from the airlines, and guaranteeing that victims and their \nfamilies will receive compensation regardless of the outcomes of the \ntangle of lawsuits that will ensue, the bill attempts to provide some \nsense to the litigation by consolidating all civil litigation arising \nfrom the terrorist attacks of September 11 in one court.\n  It is regrettable, but perhaps inevitable, that the unity that this \nterrorist attack has wrought will devolve in the courts to massive \nlegal wrangling and assignment of blame among our corporate citizens. \nIt is my hope that the liability provisions we are adopting today will \nserve, to some extent, to reduce this, and produce as fair a result as \npossible in light of the gross injustice of these events.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I am pleased that the Senate is moving \nwith great speed to insure the short-term stability of our nation's \nairlines. The tragic events of September 11 have unfortunately made \nthis legislation an absolute and immediate necessity. This Senate us \nwisely moving with great dispatch.\n  This act is difficult for all of us. It has not been easy to \nnegotiate by any means. But the Senate has come together for the good \nof this great nation to do the right thing. That is, to keep the \nairlines in the air.\n  The airline industry is a marginal industry, just like farming. And \njust like farming, it depends upon a constant and consistent flow of \ncash. That critical cash flow dried up on September 11. This \nlegislation provides needed cash assistance and loan guarantees to make \nup for the current terrorist induced shortfall.\n  The bill also addresses critical liability issues. As a member of the \nJudiciary Committee, I will monitor these provisions continually and \nclosely as to their propriety and proper functioning. I will not \nhesitate to step in as I see necessary should the situation call for \nfurther action.\n  I welcome the language concerning Essential Air Service, EAS. This is \na proven program with an administrative bureaucracy already in place. \nState and communities understand the EAS program and its important role \nin maintaining air service to small, underserved communities. This \nprogram has the potential to help several communities in Iowa which now \nface the loss of air service. It will help to prevent these small \ncommunities from bearing the brunt of air service reductions. I \nstrongly urge appropriations to provide the funding necessary to insure \nthe success of the program.\n  I wish this measure was not necessary. But it is. The cowardly acts \ncommitted by terrorists on September 11 have made it so.\n  The terrorists will not win. The American airlines will continue to \nfly, and Americans will continue to fly on them. Our economy and \nculture will grow and thrive. Of this, I am confident.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise to speak about S. 1450, the Air \nTransportation Safety and System Stabilization Act.\n  Let me first say that I support the intention of this bill. I want to \nensure that the victims of this heinous crime receive just compensation \nwhile at the same time we provide much needed stabilization to the \nairline industry. That balance is a very difficult thing to achieve. I \nhave very strong reservations about whether we accomplished that task \nin a fair or feasible manner here today. It is with mixed emotions that \nI support this bill. I hope that there is an opportunity to address \nthese concerns down the road and to improve on what we have done here.\n  This bill does do some good. We provide a generous administrative \nremedy for all victims who were physically injured or killed as a \nresult of this attack. This will help ensure that injured people \nreceive money and receive it faster than they otherwise would if left \nto pursue claims through litigation. It also provides that the Federal \nGovernment can recoup, to the extent possible, any money from the \nresponsible parties, including the terrorists whose assets we may be \nable to recover in the future.\n  We also provide the airlines with some much needed cash to cover the \nlosses they incurred as a result of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration's ordered shutdown of air traffic for nearly a week. \nHowever, we have not included a provision that I wanted to guarantee \nthat once the airlines receive this cash infusion and government loan \nguarantees, they would not discharge their federally guaranteed debt in \nbankruptcy.\n  The limitation on liability included in this bill has some productive \naspects. We limit the liability of the airlines to the extent of their \ninsurance coverage in order to allow them to keep operating. In my home \nstate of Utah, Delta Airlines employs over 4,700 people. I don't want \nto see a company that employs so many people in my State go out of \nbusiness. Air service is\n\n[[Page S9595]]\n\nessential. However, we also must protect the liability of other \ndefendants in potential litigation. If we do not, then we very likely \nwill place other defendants in a worse position than if we do nothing \nat all. For instance, under the legal principle of joint and several \nliability, even if a nonairline defendant is only 10 percent liable and \nthe airline is determined to be 90 percent liable, the nonairline \ndefendant may be required to pay more than its share of liability \nbecause the airline's policy limits have been exceeded in the judgment. \nThis could be an unfair outcome and is a serious concern. Do we really \naccomplish our goal of keeping air transportation operating if we \nsacrifice the other entities that contribute to a well-functioning \nairline industry? I am talking about the airline contractors and \nsubcontractors as well as the companies that built the planes, the port \nauthorities, and even those that built the World Trade Center itself.\n  For those who seek to pursue the litigation route, I am pleased that \nwe consolidated the causes of action in one Federal court so that there \nwill be some consistency in the judgments awarded. However, because the \npool of funds available to potential plaintiffs will be limited, we \nneed to eliminate, or at least limit, the punitive damages that can be \nawarded. I do not want to deny any legitimate plaintiff just \ncompensation. He or she should receive both economic and reasonable \nnoneconomic damages which would include everything from lost earnings \nto emotional distress. However, If we do not limit outrageous jury \nawards of punitive damages, we run the risk of denying some plaintiffs \ntheir rightful share in an award. If one plaintiff's punitive damage \naward is excessive, it could very well deplete the amount of funds \navailable to pay awards, leaving other plaintiffs out in the cold. \nDon't we want to ensure that all legitimate plaintiffs receive \ncompensation?\n  This was indeed a horrible attack on our country and I have \nconfidence that the President will make sure that the terrorists are \nbrought to justice. With this bill the Government attempts to provide \nsome relief to the victims of this attack. Unfortunately, the \nGovernment cannot do everything. What pleases me most in the aftermath \nof this tragedy is the extent to which the communities across the \ncountry have reached out to help their neighbors. We have all heard of \nthose heroic firemen and police officers who gave their lives trying to \nsave the lives of others. Also, those noble passengers who sacrificed \nthemselves rather than let the terrorist inflict even greater damage on \nthe ground. There are many wonderful charitable organizations such as \nthe Red Cross and the Salvation Army who responded immediately to \nassist victims of the terrorist attack. Donations have been pouring in \nfrom across the country to assist the victims. It warms my heart and \nreminds me of the Thousand Points of Light that President Bush's father \noften referenced regarding the generous nature of our communities. \nBecause of all of this, I am confident our country will come out of \nthis tragedy stronger.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Madam President, I rise today to direct my colleagues' \nattention to the needs the workers who play a vital role in our \nnation's aviation system--tens of thousands of men and women who are \noften overlooked by those who travel by air. From the ticket agents to \nthe sky caps to the mechanics, these workers support the American \nairline industry and promote its viability.\n  These same workers were uniquely impacted by the terrorist attack on \nSeptember 11, 2001. Their place of work--a place that should be safe--\nwas violated when terrorists turned the four commercial planes into \nmissiles. On that fateful day, the air travel system in this country \nground to a halt. The order to ground our aircraft was an unprecedented \nand correct action by the Department of Transportation. For the next \nfour days there was virtually no air travel in this country, and the \nairlines suffered huge financial losses.\n  In the wake of this tragedy and as the airline industry is returning \nto the skies, the Administration and Congress are working to stabilize \nthis industry. Unfortunately, the aid Congress is providing will not be \nenough to retain the entire current workforce of the major airlines. I \nhave heard that lay-offs in the airline industry could top 100,000 by \nnext week! That is one hundred thousand people who will be faced with \nlosing their health insurance and their source of income. One hundred \nthousand people who will be faced with reviewing their retirement \nplans. One hundred thousand people who will be faced with making \ndifficult decisions. These people cannot be forgotten.\n  While I will be supporting the economic aid package for the airlines \nwithout a provision for employee assistance, I will be redoubling my \nefforts to ensure these dedicated employees, who are casualties of the \nfirst war of the 21st century, will not be overlooked. I am \ncosponsoring a bill introduced by Senator Carnahan to provide benefits \nto the dislocated employees of our aviation industry. This package of \nrelief would provide funding for unemployment insurance and health \ninsurance, and it will contain provisions to aid in the retraining of \nthese workers. These are basic measures we can and must take to help \nstabilize these employees.\n  No one expected September 11 to develop as it did, and we are reeling \nfrom this tragedy. Congress is appropriately acting today to support \nthe airlines--an industry critical to our national security and \neconomy. And I fully support and will work to enact a package of \nassistance to those workers who are suffering as a result of this \nattack.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I will support this relief package, \nhowever, I have a number of concerns. There is certainly a legitimate \nneed to assist our nation's airlines in this time of crisis. I am \nconcerned, however, that we are forgetting about airline employees and \ntheir families, including many Wisconsinites. These massive layoffs are \na double blow to an already shocked country. We should act quickly to \nensure that those who work for our nation's airlines and their families \nreceive adequate relief, including continued access to health care and \nunemployment and job training assistance. We must be careful that this \nairline relief package is targeted at those airlines that are facing \neconomic losses due to the recent terrorist attacks and not instead \nused to prop up firms that were already in financial trouble before \nthis tragedy.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I am very disappointed language was not \nincluded in the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act \naddressing employee compensation for the thousands of airline employees \nwho have lost their jobs in the past week. It is imperative that we \naddress this in the immediate future. However, there is a crucial need \nto act swiftly to stabilize the airline industry. Therefore, I will \nsupport this legislation which includes a number of critical provisions \nto stabilize the airline industry and restore confidence in this \nindustry. I hope that we will address employee compensation and \nadditional airline security issues in the very near future.\n  The airline industry is losing about $300 million to $350 million a \nday. Losses incurred by the industry for the 2 days that the airlines \nwere grounded total $1.25 billion. In the past week alone there have \nbeen 100,000 layoffs by the airlines including 10,000 at Northwest \nAirlines. Northwest Airlines has as a major hub in Detroit and serves \nas an economic engine for Michigan with over 18,000 employees in the \nState. Northwest Airlines now has a net negative booking rate which \nmeans that more people are calling to cancel their tickets than there \nare people calling to purchase tickets. The airlines are now only \ncarrying about 30 to 40 percent of their normal capacity.\n  We cannot let this important industry go under. There is simply too \nmuch at stake. This legislation provides an immediate $5 billion cash \ninfusion to stop the immediate hemorrhaging of the airline industry and \nto cover their losses for the month of September. It also provides $10 \nbillion in Government-backed loan guarantees which will help the \nindustry gain access to credit and maintain its long-term viability. \nThe airline industry currently has no access to capital because its \ntraditional collateral, airplanes, are now considered worthless by Wall \nStreet. The $10 billion will be made in the form of loans, not grants, \nand that they will be paid back.\n  Under this bill, the Secretary of Transportation has discretion in \nmaking the loan guarantees. For instance, when an airline applies for a \nloan it\n\n[[Page S9596]]\n\nwill have to provide access to its books to prove that the loan is not \ngoing to repair past management actions that might have occurred before \nSeptember 11.\n  This bill also allows the Secretary of Transportation to use his \nauthority to require airlines benefitting from Federal funding to \ncontinue to serve midsized and small airports and communities. This is \nimportant for all those people in Michigan and around the country \nliving in rural communities who may depend on a single airline for \nservice. If that airline were to pull out, they would be left stranded. \nIn addition, the bill authorizes $120 million for the Essential Air \nService, an important program which subsidizes airline service in those \ncommunities where it is not profitable to serve. This program allows \nthe Government to share some of the costs of providing service and in \nexchange, the Government can require that a carrier continue to serve a \ncommunity. This guarantees that these communities will have airline \nservice. It is a program that is currently underfunded and in need of a \nhigher authorization which this bill provides. A number of Michigan \ncommunities participate in this program and, unfortunately, others may \nsoon need to gain access to the program in order to keep the air \nservice they currently have.\n  Senate action today to provide the airlines with funding to keep them \nsolvent is very important. It will help return confidence to the \nmarketplace and keep some airlines from going under. But it is equally \nimportant that we turn immediately to the other critical issues such as \nproviding assistance for displaced workers and airport security \nmeasures.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise today in support of the \nfinancial package before the Senate to help protect a vital industry to \nour Nation's economy. I believe that this legislation is one essential \ncomponent in a series of steps that Congress has taken, and will \ncontinue to take, to address the tragic and horrific attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001.\n  So far, Congress has taken considerable action in the wake of the \nunprecedented events last Tuesday. Congress condemned the violence in a \njoint resolution, Congress authorized the President to use ``all \nnecessary and appropriate force'' to retaliate for the acts of war \nagainst our Nation, and Congress approved $40 billion to rebuild from \nthe rubble and prevent further acts of terrorism during this time of \ngreat peril.\n  These are the steps Congress has taken so far, but they are not the \nlast of what we will do, or what we need to do to mitigate the damage \nand destruction.\n  The next step we must take is to pass this financial relief package. \nOnce this is passed, Congress will need to consider legislative \nsolutions on other matters stemming from the September 11 attacks. For \nexample: What long-term changes do we need to make to our aviation \nsecurity system? How can we establish stricter guidelines on issuing \nvisas? How do we build up our homeland defense against more deadly \nterrorist attacks in the future? What can we do to stimulate more \nconsumer spending, more job creation, and more investment in this time \nof uncertainty?\n  The events of September 11 demand that Congress and the President \nwork together to remedy the devastation the attacks have inflicted upon \nour safety, our economy, and our livelihood. The legislation before us \ntoday is part of the comprehensive action Congress must take to help \nour Nation reclaim unprecedented growth of which we know our economy is \ncapable.\n  The terrorist attacks of September 11 have dealt a crippling blow to \nthe airline industry. This package of assistance is essential to keep \nthe airlines up and running because they are an important component to \nour Nation's economy. Airlines are the very backbone of our \ntransportation infrastructure enabling people and goods to flow freely \nand quickly across our Nation.\n  Airline travel and air cargo shipments interconnect our global \neconomy and contribute a significant amount of jobs to the U.S. \nEconomy. Consider the following: Approximately 1.2 million people work \nfor the airlines in this country. Last year about 670 million \npassengers traveled on commercial airlines and the industry provided \nover 25 billion ton miles of freight delivery. The U.S. commercial \naviation industry contributes over 10 percent of the Nation's GDP.\n  Yesterday, David Walker, Comptroller General of the United States, \ntestified before the Commerce Committee. According to Mr. Walker, ``The \ncontinuation of a strong, vibrant, and competitive commercial air \ntransportation system is in the national interest. A financially strong \nair transportation system is critical not only for the basic movement \nof people and goods, but also because of the broader effects this \nsector exerts throughout the economy.''\n  The contributions airlines make to our economy are clear, yet the \nindustry estimates that the overall impact of the terrorist attacks \nwill cost $24 billion and companies may be forced to lay off over \n140,000 employees. Airline stocks plummeted when the market reopened \nMonday and they have continued to fall this week.\n  Secretary Mineta has indicated that the industry has been losing $300 \nmillion a day in lost revenue since Tuesday, September 11. Some \nfinancial analysts predict the airline industry will lose $6.5 billion \nthis year, triple the $2.2 billion loss that was expected.\n  The ripple effect of the terrorist attacks is clear. Once people stop \nflying, airlines cut back on flights. Lighter flight schedules mean \nairplanes lie idle and companies' employees lose their jobs. Fewer \nflights mean airlines do not need as many new planes or airplane parts. \nSo it comes as no surprise that this week, Boeing announced 30,000 \nemployees would lose their jobs.\n  I have received many letters asking me to support this plan before \nthe Senate, and I believe it is important to point out that the vast \nmajority of these letters are not from airline employees, but rather, \nfrom workers whose jobs are indirectly dependent on airlines.\n  One such letter is from G. Hardy Acree, the director of Sacramento \nCounty's airports. Mr. Acree wrote, ``Quality air service is critical \nto our community. Without it, Sacramento County's economic development \nand tourism industry will suffer, and the growth we've worked so hard \nto sustain will be lost. This is an issue whose impact goes well beyond \nthe airline sector.''\n  The same could be said for all of California's 58 counties and, in \nfact, for every one of the 3,142 counties across the Nation.\n  The economic impact is spreading beyond U.S. borders. London-based \nVirgin Atlantic Airways said it must trim its operations by 20 percent \nand lay off 1,200 employees, the first ever layoffs for the company in \nits 18 years of existence.\n  Just as the problems are not confined to one region, they are not \nconfined to one industry. The president of the American Society of \nTravel Agents, Richard Copland, wrote to tell me of the tremendous \nlosses suffered by the travel agencies across the U.S. According to Mr. \nCopland, ``There are many other groups of firms that are normally \nthought of as separate `industries' but that in fundamental reality are \nan integral part of what airlines do. Travel agencies are among \nthose.''\n  Travel agencies, hotels, cruises, and many other industries directly \ndepend on the airline industry. And there is almost no business that \ndoes not indirectly depend on the airlines. How else do employees meet \nwith clients? How else do goods ship overnight?\n  As Jonathan Tisch, chairman of the Travel Business Roundtable, wrote, \n``The link that airlines provide to the travel and tourism industry \ncannot be underscored enough. Airlines are the conduit for so many \nindustry activities, bringing travelers to hotels, resorts, restaurants \nand shopping in cities and towns around the country.''\n  I want to acknowledge Mr. Tisch's point, the collective ripple effect \nairlines have on the entire economy is immense. I would like to ask my \ncolleagues and constituents to think of this legislation, not as a \nbailout plan, but as a relief package. It is just compensation for the \ndirect damage inflicted on the airline industry and the U.S. economy as \na whole.\n  One more point I would like to make is that since my husband is on \nthe board of an airline company, the easiest thing for me to do would \nbe not to vote on this legislation. The Senate\n\n[[Page S9597]]\n\nEthics Committee, however, has assured me that voting on this bill is \nnot a conflict of interest for me because there will be a wide range of \nbeneficiaries from this legislation.\n  Furthermore, at this time, the economic ramifications are as such \nthat I am compelled to vote on this bill because I strongly believe it \nis in the national interest to do so.\n  We have allocated billions to rebuild in New York and Virginia. Let \nus also allocate billions to rebuild our Nation's economy.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, this is an important piece of \nlegislation. We need to enact it today. Without immediate financial \nassistance, many airlines face imminent bankruptcy as a direct result \nof the horrific terrorist attacks that took place on September 11.\n  This bill provides $5 billion in emergency direct assistance to \nreimburse the airlines for the direct costs of the terrorist attacks \nand preventing another attack. It also provides $10 billion in loans \nand loan guarantees to help the airlines while they recover from these \nattacks. These loans will also restore the confidence of the private \ncapital markets, which are unwilling to lend the airlines.\n  Because of this legislation, the airlines are going to be around to \npay back these loans. Therefore, from a budget point of view, the \nimpact of the loans on the Federal budget will only be about $3 \nbillion. But the airlines get the $10 billion essential to keep them in \nbusiness.\n  Also, this afternoon President Bush made the first apportionment of \nmonies we appropriated one week ago today for the Emergency \nSupplemental Appropriations Act for Recovery to the Terrorists Attacks.\n  Out of the $40 billion in that Emergency appropriation bill provided \nto the President, he has this afternoon transferred nearly $5.1 billion \nto Departments and Agencies to address funding needs related to the \nattacks of September 11.\n  This is just the first in what will be many more transfers out of the \ntotal funds provided. The Department of Defense will immediately \nreceive $2.5 billion and the Federal Emergency Management Agency will \nreceive $2.0 billion today.\n  But also within today's transfers is $141 million for the Department \nof Transportation, the bulk of which is to the FAA to support immediate \nincreased airport security measures. I am sure, once again this is just \nthe first of what will be much more funding coming out of the $40 \nbillion to increase security measures at our airports and expand the \nFederal Sky Marshal program.\n  This expansion requires first-rate training for our new law \nenforcement officers. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, \nFLETC, in Artesia, NM, is uniquely positioned to serve as the primary \ntraining center for the new sky marshals and other aviation law \nenforcement officers. Moreover, it is located only 40 miles from the \nRoswell Industrial Air Center, which can handle planes as large as \n747's. These facilities can play a vital role in enhancing our Nation's \naviation security.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, the Senator from West Virginia \nrecognizes the junior Senator from New York for a period of 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from New York \nis recognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I thank the Senator from West \nVirginia. I rise to join the comments of my colleague, Senator Schumer.\n  Many of us recognize the need for immediate action to aid our \nstruggling airline industry and are prepared to do so. We also \nappreciate greatly the continuing bipartisan cooperation that is \nhelping this body address the needs of our country in the wake of the \nterrible attacks of September 11.\n  I am very grateful that the long negotiations in the House and the \nSenate over the last several days, along with the White House, have \nresulted in a process to provide relief to families who have either \nlost a loved one or sustained significant personal injury.\n  We are also grateful that the legislation provides more support for \nessential air services, particularly in many of our more rural areas, \nsuch as Watertown, NY, that are totally reliant on air service which \nstill comes in to serve those communities.\n  The passage of this legislation can only be a beginning. We also must \nmake our airports as secure as possible. I am honored to join in \nlegislation Senator Hollings and Senator Rockefeller and others are \nputting forward to address the security issues so that Americans have \nthe confidence I know they should have in flying once again, resuming \nour normal life.\n  We also will have to work together to develop a process so the many \nbusinesses that have sustained losses will be able to seek relief in \nsome expedited process and not get buried and even bankrupted by an \nextensive round of litigation. I just learned that the litigation that \nwas filed following the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center is still \nongoing. Businesses have no certainty, no resolution of what their \nliability, if any, might be. We need to avoid that in the wake of this \ntragedy and do everything we can to come up with a process that deals \nwith the needs of other businesses as well as the airline industry.\n  I also hope that the assurances we have received with respect to the \nairline workers who have been laid off or displaced will be addressed \nas soon as possible. I am well aware that a package being considered to \nhelp the workers was stripped out of this bill. We have to revisit it. \nIt is something that is growing in importance day by day. There are now \nat least 74,000 people affected. We expect in the next few days that \nnumber to grow to 100,000. I suggest we look at some kind of an aid \npackage modeled after trade adjustment assistance to extend \nunemployment insurance, job training, support services to airline \nworkers and other workers who have been directly affected by the \nattacks on our country.\n  We also will have to look at the way our entire transportation system \noperates. I am very proud of the way Amtrak stepped in to fill the need \nfor the movement of passengers and goods. Their ridership is up \nnationwide. They have honored airline tickets of stranded airline \npassengers and shipped relief and medical supplies. Amtrak has also \nmade security upgrades on trains and in stations. But we need to do \nmuch more to address the critical needs in the Northeast corridor as \nwell as the rest of the country.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues. I see my good friend \nSenator Hutchison from Texas who led the fight on the high speed rail \nbonding act. That is just one of the many issues we need to consider as \nwe look at transportation, again, as part of national defense.\n  I well recall how President Eisenhower obtained the funding for the \nInterstate Highway System because it was part of national defense. Our \nhighways, our airways, and our railways are all part of our national \ndefense infrastructure.\n  Finally, I say once again how grateful we in New York are for the \ntremendous and continuing outpouring of support from the American \npeople. I particularly thank the President for his strong support. I \nwas overcome by his absolute resolute commitment to rebuilding New York \nin his speech last night as well as the other very strong words of \nreassurance and resoluteness he delivered with respect to the \nchallenges we face. I appreciate greatly his leadership and his support \nthroughout this crisis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes from my time to \nthe Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, I thank Senator Hutchison, who has been \nan outstanding leader on the issue of aviation safety and better \nairline quality for many years.\n  This is not something that Senator Hutchison first started worrying \nabout after this terrible disaster of September 11. She has been \nworking on this issue way ahead of time. If more people had listened to \nSenator Hutchison years ago, some of the concerns we are now finally \naddressing would have been addressed.\n  I join with many of my colleagues in thanking Senator Hutchison and \nall\n\n[[Page S9598]]\n\nthose who worked together on this package to provide some stabilization \nfor air transportation.\n  Yesterday we had hours and hours of hearings with Secretary Mineta, \nwho all of us recognize did a great job in coordination with the FAA, \nin grounding all flights. They saved lives. They saved lives here in \nAmerica with that quick decision.\n  However, without that decision in response to the terrorist attack, \nour airlines would be in much better financial shape today. We are now \nin a different paradigm, a different world.\n  I have heard comments from my colleagues: Why is the Federal \nGovernment involved in this versus other businesses? The main reason \nis, the Federal Government controls the air, and the FAA grounded all \nthe airplanes. It actually said: You must stop business. That decision \nhas caused losses for the industry. Today we will vote to provide \ncompensation for those lost revenues resulting from this necessary \ndecision regarding the safety of our citizens.\n  We also recognize the absolute essential nature of air travel for our \nway of life, for our economy, for commerce, and for our national \nsecurity. It has been stated by many others how important it is for our \neconomy and how many jobs are affected.\n  In our Commonwealth of Virginia, Reagan National Airport is shut down \ntoday. It remains the only airport in the Nation that is prohibited \nfrom operating. There are 10,200 employees currently out of work, and \nthen about five to seven times as many employees indirectly affected \nwho are also out of work.\n  General aviation fortunately is back, at least at a greater level \nthan it was previously. But we know that the layoffs are in the tens of \nthousands across this country. We recognize the need for safe planes. \nNext week we will address airline safety with efforts to make sure the \ncockpits are safer and the security is better. Today we will address \nthe financial losses resulting from the events of September 11.\n  However, I had hoped that this bill would include assistance for \nworkers who had lost their jobs as a result of the airlines being \ngrounded.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, my time is taken. I apologize, but \nmy time is taken.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ALLEN. Senator Rockefeller, may I have 1 minute of your time?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Our time has been divided.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I yield 30 seconds.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I thank the Senator from West Virginia. I share the desire \nto make sure employees who are out of work are also taken care of with \nboth health and unemployment benefits. I am working with Senator \nCarnahan of Missouri to make sure that this is made part of the overall \npackage. I will cosponsor her bill to provide unemployment assistance, \nextend healthcare benefits and to provide for worker retraining. We \nneed to act today on aid for the airlines so that future job losses are \navoided, and in the future let's make sure we take care of those hard-\nworking employees who are have already lost their jobs through no fault \nof their own. I thank my friend from West Virginia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, the airline industry's damages from the \nSeptember 11 terrorist attacks are immense and unprecedented. Clearly, \nwe must provide relief for the airlines, but we must not forget the \nairline workers and other workers harmed by this tragedy.\n  Failing to include relief to workers in this bill is a serious \nomission. It is essential for Congress to act as soon as possible to \nprovide support for airline workers.\n  The toll across the economy from this tragedy will be staggering, and \nthe economic hardships to millions of American working families will be \nsevere. Large numbers of workers have already been laid off, and the \nworking poor will soon become the unemployed poor.\n  We have already seen tens of thousands of layoffs. Who are these \nworkers? They are the flight attendants who are single parents raising \ntheir kids on their own; they are the reservation agents trying to make \na living; they are the security clerks, cashiers, and baggage handlers.\n  I also understand that the airlines are trying to get out from under \nthe contracts they have with employees. I think this is wrong.\n  We are assisting the airlines, and they should not leave their \nworkers high and dry. We need to provide critical long-term \nunemployment insurance benefits, training assistance, and health care \ncoverage for workers affected by these terrorist attacks. Layoffs in \nthe airline industry alone are expected to total more than 100,000 \nworkers.\n  Even beyond the issue of fairness, helping workers during a slowing \neconomy is good economic policy. The unemployment insurance system will \nbe critical to our Nation's recovery and economic health. Unemployment \nbenefits help workers bridge the gap between jobs. It also puts the \nmoney in the hands of the unemployed. Unemployed workers spend benefits \nrather than saving them, thereby stimulating the economy.\n\n  Workers deserve action on this issue from this Congress. This is not \njust a matter of labor rights; it is a matter of human rights, \nfairness, and decency. Every day we delay, more workers suffer. \nAmerican workers are waiting for relief, and we owe it to them to act.\n  A strong airline industry is critical to the national economy. We \nneed to keep the airlines flying. But we also need to provide critical \nassistance for the airline workers and other workers who have lost \ntheir jobs as a result of this disaster. I call on my colleagues and \nthe President to address this matter as soon as possible. No one has \nbeen more affected by this than our State of Washington, and Senator \nMurray has spoken frequently about this, as well as Senator Cantwell.\n  I yield a minute to the Senator from Washington and the remaining \ntime to the floor manager.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I thank my colleague from \nMassachusetts. I thank all of our colleagues who have worked together \nin a very bipartisan manner over the last week to address the critical \nissues coming at us. I know we need to help the airline industry, and \nthat is why this bill is important.\n  I remind my colleagues that thousands of workers were left out of \nthis bill. I have 30,000 employees in my home State of Washington at \nBoeing who have been left out of this bill. They are just as patriotic \nand they have worked just as hard. They deserve our attention just as \nmuch. We should not forget them when we are taking care of the owners \nof these airline companies.\n  It is the workers who go to work every day who make this country \ngreat and strong. We need to make sure we have a commitment to them in \nthe coming week to put together an aviation package that includes \nemployee assistance for those who have made this country what it is.\n  I thank my colleague from Massachusetts and Senator Cantwell from my \nState, and other Members, such as Senator Carnahan. I pledge my support \nto make sure this Senate doesn't forget the workers as we put together \nthe aviation package that has been promised. I thank my colleague from \nMassachusetts, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague from Texas. I am encouraged to see \nthe Senate and the House moving so promptly on this legislation to keep \nthe airlines functioning. The terrorist attack is really an attack \nagainst the United States as a whole, and when we have losses directly \nattributable to that attack, it seems fair to me that the entire Nation \nshould sustain those damages. What we are doing today with the cash \ngrant and especially the loan guarantee will keep the airlines \noperating, which is very important for the lifeblood of our country and \nvery important for an economic recovery.\n  US Airways, illustratively, needs the loan guarantees in order to get \nfinancing to keep operating. US Airways is\n\n[[Page S9599]]\n\nonly one of many carriers across the country, but it illustrates the \nproblem and it illustrates the issue especially pertinent to my State \nof Pennsylvania, which has some 17,000 US Airways employees dependent \nupon their jobs. This is a very, very important matter for \nPennsylvania, and a very important matter for America.\n  This legislation also establishes a very appropriate procedure for \ncompensating the victims on a program administered by the Attorney \nGeneral's office without going through the long litigation process. \nHowever, it is only a first step.\n  There is more to be done on airport security, on security within the \nairplanes, on compensation for the workers with some 100,000 already \nhaving lost their jobs, and with the ripple effect on hotels, on the \nairport complexes, on restaurants, on tourism, and on the airports \nwhich sustain themselves by having the shops now unfrequented by \ncustomers because only ticketed passengers can get within the area.\n  How much time remains on my 3 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 45 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield back the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The heart of every American aches for those who died or have been \ninjured because of the tragic terrorist attacks in New York, Virginia, \nand Pennsylvania on September 11th. Our first priority should be \nensuring that their needs are met and that they receive adequate \ncompensation.\n  At the same time, the airline industry of this country is in grave \ndanger of collapse. The industry has announced more than 100,000 \nlayoffs. Insurance companies have reportedly contacted the airlines \nabout lowering the terrorist-related protections in their policies. And \nthey have warned that they are running out of cash. If Congress does \nnot pass this legislation today, it is likely that all of our Nation's \nair carriers would cease service next Wednesday.\n  The bipartisan, bicameral legislation we are considering today \nprovides $5 billion in direct grants to cover the cost to the airlines \nfrom the closing of all the nation's airports after last week's \nterrorist attacks. The bill also provides $10 billion in loan \nguarantees to help the airlines through their cash crunch, funds to be \ndistributed within 14 days by a four-member Air Transportation \nStabilization Board. Further, it extends the existing War Act, which \nprotects airlines from liability during wartime for overseas flights, \nto cover domestic flights and include terrorist acts. Finally, it \nprovides that the liability of the airlines involved in the terrorist-\nrelated airline crashes on September 11, 2001, will be limited to the \namount of the insurance coverage they have for such instances, and all \nlegal cases stemming from these incidents will be consolidated in the \nUnited States District court for the Southern District of New York.\n  Most importantly, working with Majority Leader Daschle, Republican \nLeader Lott, Speaker Hastert, Congressman Gephardt, and Senators Hatch, \nKohl, DeWine, Schumer, and Clinton, we have established a Victims \nCompensations Program to provide expedited payments to victims and \ntheir families. To be eligible for compensation, applicants will need \nto provide information about the harm they suffered or death linked to \nthe terrorist attack, but they will not be required to prove negligence \nor liability. It is our responsibility to provide fair compensation to \nthose most affected by this disaster. We have devised a plan that means \nprompt filing, quick review, and prompt payments to victims and \nfamilies.\n  The Department of Justice will supervise the Victims' Compensation \nFund that will be administered by a Special Master. The Special Master \nwill make a final determination of an applicants eligibility and level \nof compensation within 120 days of receiving a claim. All payments must \nbe paid within 20 days after the determination. This is a simple and \nfair approach to put the victims and their families first. These \npayments will be tax free. Filing a claim under the program will \npreclude other civil remedies.\n  This program is targeted to help the neediest victims and their \nfamilies. When making a determination, the Special Master will take \ninto account any life insurance, death benefit, or other government \npayment received by the victims and their families.\n  The victims in this tragedy and the airline industry are in need of \nrelief. The terrorists will win if victims continue to suffer and the \nairlines go under. Establishing the Victim Compensation Fund and giving \nthe airlines the capital they need to continue operating are crucial \nfirst steps in our national healing process. I thank the leadership of \nboth parties in both Houses of Congress for their cooperation in moving \nthis essential legislation forward.\n  Madam President, again, the heart of every American aches for those \nwho have died or have been injured because of the terrorist attacks in \nNew York, Virginia, and Pennsylvania on September 11--and due to the \nripple effect out to New Jersey and Connecticut and Maryland and the \nDistrict of Columbia. It has been terrible. I think we have to ensure \nthat the needs of those who suffered most directly are met, that they \nreceive adequate compensation.\n  We also know that the airline industry in the country is in danger of \ncollapse. They have announced, I believe, around 100,000 layoffs. \nInsurance companies reportedly have contacted airlines saying they will \nlower terrorist-related protections in their policies. They have said \nthey are not going to be able to pay their bills. If we don't do \nsomething, we can literally see the terrorists shutting down the \nairlines next week. We have worked with Senators Daschle and Lott, \nSpeaker Hastert and Congressman Gephardt, Senators Hatch, Kohl, DeWine, \nSchumer, and Clinton, and we put together a victims' compensation \nprogram to provide for victims and their families. It is going to be \nsimple. It is a speeded-up process. In fact, the payments will be tax \nfree, with prompt filing, quick review, and prompt payments to victims \nof families. We literally had children who kissed their parents good-\nbye in the morning and came home at night and found that they were \norphans, and the mortgage is due in 2 weeks. We have to do something to \nhelp them. We can.\n  The victims in this tragedy are in need of relief. The airline \nindustry is in need of relief.\n  The terrorists will have even a greater victory if we do not help. We \ncan help.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I yield 10 minutes to the senior \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from West Virginia has 15 \nminutes of his own time under the agreement.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I revise my statement simply to say \nthe senior Senator from West Virginia has 15 minutes under the \nunanimous consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, the distinguished majority whip wishes me \nto yield time to him. How much time does he need?\n  Mr. REID. Three minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 3 minutes of my time to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I received a letter, as did all Senators, \ntoday addressed to the Honorable Tom Daschle, majority leader, and the \nHonorable Trent Lott, minority leader, of the U.S. Senate. The letter \nreads as follows:\n\n       Dear Senators: The Association of Trial Lawyers of America \n     (ATLA) commends the United States Congress and President Bush \n     for their leadership and decision to put families victimized \n     by our national tragedy first and to ease their pain by \n     expediting appropriate relief to them through the ``September \n     11th Compensation Act of 2001.''\n       ATLA agrees with you that extraordinary situations demand \n     extraordinary response.\n       At least seven thousand families are hurting more than any \n     of us can imagine. And, because the first priority of every \n     American should be prompt and full justice for the thousands \n     of families who know first-hand the unspeakable horror \n     visited upon the world on September 11, 2001, members of\n\n[[Page S9600]]\n\n     ATLA will provide fine legal services to any family wishing \n     to pursue justice through the fund established by this \n     unprecedented, humanitarian legislation.\n       ATLA believes that 100% of the compensation from the fund \n     should go directly to these families.\n       The officers and Executive Committee of ATLA have \n     volunteered to be the first attorneys to provide legal \n     services free of charge under this program.\n       God Bless America.\n           Sincerely,\n       Leo V. Boyle, President, on behalf of the 60,000 men and \n     woman of ATLA.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, the bill currently before the Senate \nprovides $5 billion in immediate direct cash assistance to the airline \nindustry. It also provides up to an additional $10 billion in loan \nguarantees for the airlines. This bill is not simply an authorization \nbill. It is also an appropriations bill which provides funding over and \nabove the $40 billion Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill that \nthe Senate passed one week ago today.\n  The airline industry is essential to this Nation's commerce. It \nproduces about $125 billion annually and creates work for thousands of \nmanufacturers and other companies. The Federal Government cannot allow \nthis industry to fold without seriously disrupting the United States \neconomy. That fact is not lost on this Senator.\n  However, we have now reached an important turning point in the \nrelationship between the Federal Government and the airlines, and this \nshould not go unnoticed. As of this day, the airlines are now required \nto live off the generosity of the general treasury. We are about to \ngrant them several billion dollars of assistance, not from the Aviation \nTrust Fund, not from any ticket taxes from airline passengers, but from \nthe general treasury. We are talking about money from people's income \ntaxes, including the income taxes of millions of Americans who did not \nboard a plane last year, who will not board a plane this year, and who \nwill not board a plane next year perhaps.\n  Twenty-three years ago, the Senate passed the conference report on \nthe airline deregulation bill on October 14, 1978 by a vote of 82-4, I \nbelieve. I was Majority Leader at the time. I was among the 82 Senators \nwho voted for that bill. And as I have mentioned on the Senate floor \nmany times, I have regretted that vote ever since.\n\n  My colleague at that time was Jennings Randolph. Jennings Randolph \nvoted against deregulation. I voted for deregulation. He voted the \nright way at that time, and I voted the wrong way. I regret that vote \nbecause ever since deregulation, numerous airlines have pulled out of \nWest Virginia and other rural states altogether. Many of them pulled \nout immediately following the vote. My constituents and millions of \nother Americans who live in smaller communities have been left with \ninfrequent air service at astronomical prices. Indeed, today, it is \noften cheaper to fly from Washington D.C. to London, England, than it \nis to fly from Washington D.C. to Charleston, WV. The quality and cost \nof service to many of our smaller airports in West Virginia and across \nthe Nation are even worse.\n  Yesterday, as part of a Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee \nhearing with Secretary Mineta, I expressed my view that we should not \nbe providing the airlines with billions of dollars from the income \ntaxes of hard working Americans without requiring the air carriers to \nprovide a reasonable level of service to those Americans. Now that this \nindustry must live off the generosity of the U.S. taxpayer, at least \nfor a while, I think we have a responsibility to ensure that the \ntaxpayers are well served. But today, we find that the airlines are \ncutting back service and eliminating cities from their national network \nat the same time they have their hands out on Capitol Hill.\n  I recognize that the airlines find themselves in such precarious \nfinancial condition because of a recent tragedy of massive proportion. \nHowever, the airlines were not doing so well before that time. I am \ndetermined to make sure that the airlines do not use this incident as a \nrationale for abandoning or dramatically reducing service to \ncommunities that depend on that service to connect with the national \neconomy.\n  Toward that end, I want to call the attention of the Senate to a \ncritically important section of the bill. Under this bill, the \nSecretary of Transportation is granted broad new statutory authority to \nrequire an airline that receives direct financial assistance under this \nact to continue to provide service to any city that it was serving \nprior to the tragedy of September 11.\n\n  The bill also grants the Secretary the authority to require any \nairline taking assistance under this act to enter into agreements to \nensure that all communities that had scheduled air service before \nSeptember 11 continue to receive adequate air service.\n  These provisions, if applied appropriately, will ensure that the \nsmall cities and the rural airports of America are not cut off from our \nnational aviation system as the industry endures a downturn. The \nCommittee on Appropriations, which I chair, will monitor carefully how \nSecretary Mineta implements these critically important provisions. He \nhas been granted important new powers in this time of crisis, and I \nexpect him to use these powers. The committee will also monitor \ncarefully the actions of the airlines when it comes to discontinuing \nroutes and reducing service. We must see to it that the small \ncommunities of our country are not relegated to the status of an \neconomic backwater as the jets keep flying from New York to Los Angeles \nto London and to other far away ports.\n  I understand there are discussions that additional Federal assistance \nmay be needed for the airlines in later bills. The airlines should be \non notice and the Department of Transportation should be on notice that \nif the provisions in this bill are not applied appropriately, and we \nsee a pattern wherein the small communities of our Nation are not being \ntreated fairly, we will be back with stronger legislative measures to \naddress this problem. This issue will not go away with the passage of \nthis bill.\n  As we stand poised to hand the airlines billions of dollars in \ngeneral revenue tax dollars, we must ensure that taxpayers in all \ncommunities, small and large, have access to reasonable and affordable \nair service. During this time of national crises--during a time of \nwar--we should require that there will be air service to all parts of \nAmerica to ensure that there is mobility for all Americans.\n  I want to thank my colleague, Senator Rockefeller, for the leadership \nhe has demonstrated in this area of legislation. He has done a great \npiece of work. He is highly dedicated to the service of his \nconstituents, who are my constituents, but in thinking of our \nconstituents we are also thinking of Americans across this country who \nlive in rural areas and who have been deprived of fairness in service \nand in connection with costs in flying.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Alabama, Mr. Sessions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I appreciate the work of our \nleadership in this Senate working together to produce legislation that \neach day, since this tragedy occurred, we have been virtually unanimous \non. I want to keep that unanimity going. I express my appreciation to \nSenators Daschle, Lott, Nickles, Reid, and the others who have worked \non this legislation. I know there is a belief that there is a critical \ntime period, and apparently there is, an insurance problem of \nmonumental proportions that needs to be dealt with promptly.\n  However, I do believe, as Senator Fitzgerald from Illinois has said, \nwe are rushing this matter, that this bill is not a perfect bill. It is \nfar from a perfect bill. Maybe it is approximately correct, but we do \nnot know all of that yet. I am not happy with how fast this is moving \nand how much money we are dealing with. I want to support our \nleadership. I know they have hammered it out. I know they have made \nsome progress. I know they have made some agreements. I know Senator \nNickles has worked hard to bring as much accountability as he could in \nthe time he had to make this a reality. So I salute them for it, but I \nam not convinced we are doing it the right way.\n  I was pleased to see trial lawyers say they would do work for free, \nbut I am\n\n[[Page S9601]]\n\nnot sure that, in the way we have crafted the bill, a client still does \nnot need a lawyer that is loyal to them and that is paid by them. I \nwould like to see us create a way to compensate people simply by who \nthey are. If they are the widow of a person who has lost his life, they \ncan make a claim and certify that and get their payment without any \nfees needing to be paid. Maybe we could do that in this kind of mass \ntort. We have not had time to think that through.\n  I know this bill is probably moving on to passage tonight. I am \ntroubled by it. We are going to need to do some work on it in the \nfuture, and I expect we will be coming back and revisiting this. I \nthink that should be made clear.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I am going to finish our 30 minutes of time by saying \nthis is not a perfect bill. There are areas we have not addressed but \nthat we will address in the future. Since September 11, 2001, a lot of \nthings have been thrown at us, and we are going to handle every one of \nthem as they come. We will keep the airlines flying. We will try to \nminimize the damage to the economy of layoffs from the airline industry \nand all the other people who are laid off from their jobs. We will take \nit one step at a time.\n  Senator Rockefeller and I have worked hand-in-hand on this issue and \non the security issue that we will have on the floor next week or the \nweek after, because security is what will make the flying public feel \nsafe in our skies. So we are going to address this issue and keep the \nairlines financially secure in the interim period while we are getting \nthat security bill passed so America will not be in any way hampered in \nour freedom and our ability to have commerce and business as usual in \nour country. That is what we are all trying to accomplish.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Lincoln). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I commend the majority leader for his hard work in \nputting together an airline stabilization bill that will save our \nnation's airlines and our air transport infrastructure. I will strongly \nsupport this bill without amendment.\n  The terrorists who launched those despicable attacks on September 11 \ntook thousands of American lives, and did billions of dollars of \ndamage. It has also become clear in the past 10 days that they dealt a \nbody blow to the U.S. airline industry, on which virtually all of our \ncitizens depend to one degree or another.\n  Demand for air travel has virtually collapsed in the past week. Last \nweekend I flew back to West Virginia, and on the return flight Sunday \nnight--usually a crowded flight from Charleston to Dulles--I was the \nonly passenger on the plane. Many of my colleagues have mentioned that \nthey've had similar experiences in the past ten days. Flights are \ndeparting West Virginia airports with a load factor of 25 per cent--\nonly one in four seats filled. Unfortunately, this is not, like last \nweek's closure of the New York Stock Exchange, a temporary phenomenon. \nBased on past air disasters or international conflicts--none of which \nwas of the same massive scale as last Tuesday's attacks--airlines are \npredicting that passenger traffic will be down by almost half for the \nremainder of this year, and will take until next summer to return to \nnormal levels. And those are optimistic estimates.\n  This kind of crisis could do irreparable harm to the ability of \nAmerica's airlines to continue in business. Airlines lost $300 million \neach day that they were shut down last week. They are set to lose \nbillions more in the coming months. Their insurance rates have shot up, \nwith some airlines telling us of a 600 percent increase in their \ninsurance rates. Coming on top of what was already a difficult outlook \nbecause of our slowing economy, the nation's airlines--main line \ncarriers and regional carriers alike--could be in bankruptcy within a \nfew weeks and possibly out of business within a few months. Already we \nare seeing the first signs: a round of massive, painful layoffs for \nnearly 100,000 of our nation's hardworking airline employees. And huge \ncutbacks of around 20 percent to most airlines' schedules.\n  Some people have said, well, this is the market, and it's not the \nAmerican way to interfere with the market. But I've been pleased, as \nchairman of the Senate's Aviation Subcommittee, to see a broad \nconsensus among my colleagues that the air transport industry is not \njust a huge business and employer, but it's also a critical element of \nour nation's infrastructure. Nowhere is that more the case than in the \nsmaller states and communities like West Virginia. When people think of \nthe airline industry, they usually think of big hub airports like \nHartsfield and O'Hare. But airline traffic is just as important--maybe \nmore important--to smaller communities like Beckley and Bridgeport. \nSafe, convenient and affordable air service represents an important \nelement of our efforts to attract development to our state. It's an \nimportant connection that allows our citizens and our businesses to \novercome our state's historic isolation created by our mountainous \nterrain.\n  And when I see planes flying with one passenger, and learn that \ncarriers are cutting back on their schedules, and hear that several \ncarriers could be in bankruptcy within two weeks, I know that the first \ncommunities to be hit will be small communities like those in West \nVirginia that are at the end of the food chain, so to speak. That would \nbe tragic. It would reverse the efforts our communities have made to \nattract and retain air service, and turn their residents into aviation \n``have nots.'' It would also set in motion the slow implosion of the \nU.S. airline industry, which would spread to larger hubs and airports \nas well. And finally, it would give the terrorists who perpetrated last \nweek's heinous attacks the ultimate victory, as their actions would \nlead to a severe curtailment of America's freedom of movement and \nmobility.\n\n  It is the shared consensus of this body that cannot be permitted to \nhappen, and that has driven our remarkable efforts this past week to \nput together a stabilization package for our nation's airlines.\n  It will contain up to $5 billion in immediate credits to reimburse \nairlines for the revenues they lost when the government shut down U.S. \nair space last week. It will also contain $10 billion in loan \nguarantees so that our airlines can continue to obtain financing in the \ncoming months.\n  It will limit airlines' liability for collateral damage incurred as a \nresult of last week's terrorist attacks up to the amount allowable \nunder their insurance policies--a key provision because our airlines \nmight otherwise not be able to obtain or afford insurance.\n  It will set up a victim's compensation fund for the families of the \ninnocent victims of last week's despicable attacks.\n  It will provide $120 million in additional authorization authority \nfor the Essential Air Service program, a key element in preserving air \nservice to smaller communities.\n  This package is an important first step in stabilizing the U.S. \nairline industry and ensuring that air service to communities across \nthe nation survives this crisis. But it does not address all the needs \nthat this crisis has created.\n  One important issue we will need to take up in short order is the \nplight of the nearly 100,000 airline workers who will lose their jobs \nas a result of this week's cutbacks. We have already begun to see \nairline layoffs in West Virginia. Excellent workers who expected a \npromising career in a growing industry, until terrorists hijacked four \nplanes and frightened Americans out of the skies. We must take measures \nto address their needs. We provide special assistance to American \nworkers who have been displaced by foreign trade; we must provide the \nsame level of assistance to American workers who have been displaced by \nforeign terrorism.\n  We must also be prepared to look at the needs of related industries, \nas well as the future needs of the airline industry. Many related \nindustries--aircraft manufacturers, travel agents, and various travel-\nrelated businesses--have already begun to feel the effects of this \nattack. We will have to look carefully at the real needs of those \nindustries, and be prepared to take bold measures where they are needed \nand appropriate.\n\n[[Page S9602]]\n\n  One thing is certain: the survival of America's airlines is a key \nelement of any solution. Their needs are real and urgent, and I \ncongratulate the majority leader on his success in putting together a \nstabilization package that will address them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Nickles pertaining to the submission of S. Con. \nRes. 73 are located in today's Record under ``Submission of Concurrent \nand Senate Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I have worked with some of our \ncolleagues on the underlying bill that deals with assisting the airline \nindustry to try to make a significant and positive impact, and I \ncompliment both Democrats and Republicans, because we have worked \ntogether, and I think we are passing a bill tonight that will provide \nneeded assistance to the airline industry.\n  This bill has several provisions some of our colleagues are somewhat \nfamiliar with, some maybe not, but it has a provision that provides for \n$5 billion in cash assistance. Some people said that is too much. \nActually, last Friday we were looking at a bill that was two and a \nhalf. The airline industry generates revenues of about $2 billion per \nweek, and this bill provides $5 billion. Well, they were shut down for \n2\\1/2\\ days, but certainly when they started again they had significant \nlosses, and this $5 billion is an attempt to offset the losses that \nwill be incurred not only for the shutdown but for the resumption of \nservice, and that is for the time period from September 11 through \nDecember 31.\n  Also, there are losses that have to be incurred. I would love to see \nridership come up to a very full volume in a very short period of time \nand maybe that $5 billion would not be necessary. In all likelihood it \nwill be. The legislation also provides for $10 billion of loan \nassistance. Some people have asked for details, but we left the \nregulations up to OMB, and some people have disputed whether it be cost \nshare, whether it will be a guaranteed loan amount.\n  When we did the steel loan guarantees, that this Senator did not \nsupport but we put a percentage must be required, the Federal \nGovernment did not guarantee 100 percent. The Federal Government \nguaranteed up to a percentage, and I hope that would be the case in \nthis bill. So it would not be a 100-percent Federal loan guarantee but \nup to 80, with those regulations to be determined by the Office of \nManagement and Budget. They have 15 days to do so from date of \nenactment.\n  The legislation also has about a page and a half, or two pages, \ndealing with essential air service. It is my thought that should not be \nin the legislation, and it is because Senator Byrd and Senator \nRockefeller and others wanted to have it and said the Secretary should \nmake efforts to endeavor that communities that now have assistance in \nFederal air service would continue to receive it. In my opinion, it \nshould not have been put in, but it is in and I am not that upset. It \ndoes give some discretion, but in some of these communities we have \nairplanes flying with two or three people on them and they cost a lot \nof money. They cost the airlines and taxpayers a lot of money, and I \nquestion whether we should mandate that it continue.\n  The language we have in the bill is less than a mandate. It does have \nsome discretion, so hopefully common sense will prevail. That is not a \nparticularly big provision.\n  Most importantly, the bill does provide some limitation on \nliabilities for the air carriers. If we did not have that, they \nprobably would not be able to buy insurance. They probably would not be \nflying in a month. We did not want that to happen so we did put some \nliability protection, some limitations there. Carriers would be liable \non September 11. The limitations for liability will be for the amount \nof insurance they have. So that was pretty well agreed upon.\n  The prospective liability, where the Government would assume \nadditional liability if there were another act of war or terrorism, was \npretty well agreed upon.\n  We also passed legislation, and it begins on page 19 and goes through \npage 30 in this legislation, called victims' compensation. It basically \nsays that victims and/or their family survivors, people who were killed \nby the terrorist act of September 11, may receive financial assistance \nor at least have legal recourse. They can do it either by suing in a \nFederal district court or they can do it through a new system we are \nnow creating in this legislation called the special master.\n  It was my hope this would not be included in this legislation, that \nwe would defer it until we had a little more time to study it. This is \nvery complex law. It deals with the State of New York law, it deals \nwith Federal law, it deals with liability, and the liability of not \nonly the airlines but also the building, the port authority, and other \nindividuals and governments. It is very complicated and very complex.\n  Although I think the committees and the other people who worked on it \ndid a pretty good job, the special master has enormous responsibility \nunder this legislation, to be making determinations on what family \nsurvivors will receive, what injured members and individual will \nreceive.\n  I am not against having a victims' compensation section, but when we \nput this together in a short period of time, I am not sure we did it \nthe best way. I am not trying to be critical, and I have assurance from \nproponents of this, as late as last night: If we find it is in error \nand it needs adjustments, we will revisit it. I compliment my \ncolleagues because we have operated in a bipartisan spirit, and we \nshould continue to do so. That is vitally important. We did it last \nweek; we did it this week.\n  Some people said we want to rewrite unemployment compensation laws \nand make everybody whole on unemployment compensation because of the \nairline employees, because of restaurant employees, et cetera. We have \nto be cautious. The unemployment compensation system can be enormously \nexpensive. We have an unemployment compensation system providing \nbenefits in most cases for 26 weeks. I don't know that has such urgency \nwe need to address it in the next week. Some said we need to do this \nnext week. Almost everyone in every State of the Nation has \nunemployment compensation that will last at least for 6 months.\n  We have made good progress in providing stability for the airlines. \nThey will be able to buy insurance; they will be able to continue \nflying. We provided cash assistance and provided loan guarantees to get \nthem through, bridging this very difficult time as a result of the \nterrorist act and tragedy that happened on September 11.\n  I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation.\n  For the information of our colleagues, a lot of people are wanting to \nget out of town. It is my intention to yield back the remainder of time \nand commence the rollcall in a very short period of time.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, the Senator from the State of \nOregon has up to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. In a few hours the U.S. Congress is going to respond to \nthe horrible tragedy in New York in an unprecedented way. The U.S. \nCongress is going to vote to send billions of dollars to the airline \nindustry, while not making any funds available to the scores and scores \nof other businesses across this country affected by this tragedy that \nalso teeter on bankruptcy.\n  The process that the U.S. Congress is using is also unprecedented. \nThe number being used to send these billions of dollars of taxpayer \nmoney to the airline industry comes from the airline industry itself. \nThere has not been an independent, third party review of the numbers \nand the projections on which this legislation tonight is based. It is a \nleap of faith. The Congress tonight is responding to the airline \nindustry's assertion that because this tragedy is so dire and the \ncircumstances so enormous, we should waive the traditional process of \nsaying that someone independent should evaluate a piece of legislation \nsuch as this involving billions and billions of dollars.\n  But it is also unprecedented, the horror and the tragedy that the \nCongress must address. Tonight, in what has been one of the hardest \ndecisions I have had to face, I am going to vote for this legislation \nbecause of one addition that has been made, and I am pleased to \nannounce it tonight. Senator Daschle, the majority leader, has worked \nso hard on this legislation; Senator Hollings, chairman of the Commerce\n\n[[Page S9603]]\n\nCommittee, has done yeoman work on this bill; Congressman Doggett; and \na variety of Members have indicated they expect the General Accounting \nOffice to give a briefing to the U.S. Congress by September 28 on this \nlegislation.\n\n  I make it clear tonight, if it appears on September 28 or in the days \nthat succeed that briefing that this legislation was in excess of what \nthe airlines needed, I am going to come back on this floor and do \neverything in my power to send this money to the scores of other \nbusinesses across this country that teeter on bankruptcy tonight. This \nis unprecedented, first, because of the tragedy; second, because one \nclass of those affected in the airline industry is receiving help while \nothers are not; and third, because there has not been an independent \nanalysis of what the claims actually constitute and what funds are \ntruly needed.\n  Because the circumstances are so dire, the Congress is going to vote \nfor this legislation over the next few hours. I want the Congress to \nknow, that briefing on September 28 will be critical because it will be \nour first chance to get an objective analysis of whether the industry \nneeds this sum of money and needs it for the claims that are being \nmade.\n  I wrap up by saying in my view Senator Rockefeller and Senator \nHutchison have done a first-rate job on this legislation. This is, as \nwe all know, just the beginning of the debate about how to deal with \nthe financial consequences of the horror in New York, but it is a \nparticularly difficult choice the Congress is making tonight. I assure \nmy constituents and others who are following this debate that the way \nthis money is going to be spent is something that is going to be \nscrutinized with as much care as any subject that has ever come before \nthe U.S. Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is my understanding that all time is \ngoing to be yielded back on this matter.\n  Mr. ENZI. I rise to make a few remarks concerning the Air \nTransportation System Stabilization Act.\n  First, I would like to associate myself with the comments by the \nSenator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions and the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. \nNickles.\n  I know we need to take immediate action to keep the airline industry \nin the air. The last few days have taught us that air travel is the \nheart of our economy. Many businesses have been hurt by the events last \nweek. I am disappointed that help has not been offered particularly to \nthe small businesses. But I realize that those businesses will be out \nof business if air travel ceases or is greatly reduced. Airlines are a \nlifeline for many occupations.\n  This morning I had many concerns about this bill. I am pleased that \nmany of my suggestions were taken and now appear in the bill. Other \nparts of this bill can and must be reworked in the days to come.\n  I am pleased at the recognition that will assure essential air \nservice, help to airlines that serve small, rural communities \nthroughout the nation.\n  I am pleased that we remembered the regional air carriers and \nproportionally helped them.\n  I understand the reluctance of the insurance companies to continue to \ninsure air carriers, because of the uncertainty of the exposure, so I \nam pleased that an insurance provision was provided.\n  I am pleased that provisions were put into the bill that would remove \nconcern and provide assurance that the grant money will not be golden \nparachutes for highly paid executives.\n  I know the bill now has provisions for audits to be sure the money is \nspent within the criteria set out. I would feel more comfortable if the \naudits were mandatory instead of optional. Taxpayer money always comes \nwith strings.\n  I understand the need for expediting compensation to victims, but I'm \nnot sure that we have done that. Perhaps we have just opened up a trial \nlawyer's dream. I have been assured that section will be reworked to \ngive assurance that the money will go to the victims and not just to \nattorneys, and that the taxpayer won't be the one providing all the \ncompensation. I had hoped that the Federal obligation would be \navailable only for those who took the expedited avenue of resolving \ntheir loss using the Special Master.\n  I applaud my colleagues and the Administration in expediting aid to \nthe nation's airlines under this bill for damages arising out of the \nSeptember 11, 2001 terrorist attack. This initial funding will provide \nthe resources necessary to assure continuity and stabilization of the \nairline industry. By including direct cash assistance, loan guarantees, \nincreased air transportation safety, and prospective and prior \nliability provisions, the bill will ensure the safety of the American \npublic and restore confidence in our economic foundations. The \nprovisions of this bill are designed to restore the confidence of \nairline customers and industry investors and provide a bridge of \nassistance to the new environment in which the industry will need to \noperate.\n  I am pleased that the bill states that the U.S. Department of \nTransportation Secretary should take appropriate action to ensure that \nall communities, both rural and urban communities, that had scheduled \nair service before September 11, 2001, continue to receive adequate air \ntransportation service and that essential air service to small \ncommunities continues without interruption. In addition, the bill \nauthorized an appropriation of $120 million for the Essential Air \nService program. This additional funding in the EAS program will \ngreatly benefit the rural communities in Wyoming.\n  Resumption of normal air travel is essential for our commerce and the \nmobility for our way of life. We have to act to keep our airlines \nflying without throwing the free market out of the window. These \nbusinesses need to show that their requests for assistance are tied to \nthe recent terrorist attacks and not debts incurred prior to September \n11, 2001. They also need to show that the financial assistance they \nreceive will be used wisely, keeping their planes flying and their \nemployees working.\n  I believe that the airlines should submit a business plan to the U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation to justify why they need the grant funding \nand loan guarantees and what the funds will be used for. Within the \nbusiness plan, the airlines should state specific provisions that \nexecutive management of the airlines should not receive pay increases \ngreater than the cost-of-living adjustment and they should not receive \nany bonuses due to the funding allocated to them by this bill. I \nbelieve this emergency funding for the airlines should help all airline \nemployees, not just the executive management.\n  I have been assured there will be specific criteria when directing \nfederal funding to the airlines in the form of a loan guarantee. For \nexample, the bill gives the President the authority to issue the $10 \nbillion in loan guarantees to the airline industry subject to terms and \nconditions as he seems necessary. We must assure there is no abuse and \nthat the bill protects the federal government who is the U.S. taxpayer \nfrom incurring costs from the possible defaulting on the loans.\n  Traditionally, loan guarantee programs ensure that the General \nAccounting Office, GAO, can exercise its authority by auditing the \nbusiness that receives a loan guarantee. The administration should \ninclude a provision that mandates the GAO act as the auditor of this \nloan guarantee program. At present, an audit may be conducted by the \nGAO and U.S. Department of Transportation if the Comptroller General \nand Transportation Secretary deem necessary. We have to ensure that the \nfunds are spent accordingly in relation to the intended purpose of this \nbill.\n  Furthermore, the bill should more directly address the higher costs \nincurred by commuter and short-haul carriers and issues arising from \nrecent changes in air transportation availability to small- and medium-\nsized communities. These regional airlines provide the only air service \nbetween the major airports and the more than a hundred small- and \nmedium-sized communities in the West.\n  I am committed to supporting an economically strong airline industry \nfor the West and the nation. Due to last week's tragic events, we have \nrealized that interdependence is key to keeping our economy strong, if \nplanes are flying, then the motels are being occupied and the \nrestaurants are being utilized. I look forward to supporting my \ncolleagues in restoring public confidence in the fact that the United\n\n[[Page S9604]]\n\nStates has the strongest and safest airline system in the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/21/senate-section/article/S9604-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nUNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--NOMINATION OF KIRK VAN TINE, OF VIRGINIA, \n       TO BE GENERAL COUNSEL FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION\n\n  Mr. REID.

We yield back the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I do appreciate the time before the \nvote. I thank the leadership of Senator Daschle, Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Carnahan, and Senator Murray for working on what is part of \nthis package that we will discuss next week and that is worker \ncompensation.\n  Last week's terrorist attacks murdered thousands of innocent \nAmericans, and left thousands more grieving for friends and loved ones. \nThose people are the first and most visible victims of the unprovoked \nterrorist attacks--but they are not the only ones.\n  Already tens of thousands of workers at major U.S. airlines have lost \ntheir jobs due to the economic fallout of the terrorist attacks on \nSeptember 11. Current projections are for a total of 100,000 airline \njobs to be cut this year--nearly 10 percent of the industry workforce. \nBoeing, America's leading aircraft manufacturer, has announced it will \nlay off up to 30,000 employees by the end of 2002.\n  These workers and their families are secondary victims of the \nterrorists who attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and \nCongress should not leave them to bear a disproportionate share of the \neconomic burden of terrorism.\n  I am supportive of the overall intent of this bill and the need to \nshore up the airline industry, but I still have some concerns.\n  The current airline relief package is good as far as it goes--but it \ndoes not go far enough.\n  The airline relief package does nothing to ensure that airlines will \nuphold their contractual obligations and other commitments to \nemployees. Those should be fundamental qualifications for any airline \nseeking government assistance.\n  The airline relief package does nothing to directly benefit the \nthousands of airline and aircraft manufacturing workers who are being \nlaid off as a result of the recent terrorist attacks.\n  In this speech to the nation last night, President Bush told the \nAmerican people ``justice will be done.'' If Congress passes an airline \nrelief package without addressing worker assistance, we will have done \na grave injustice to thousands of American workers and their families \nwho are suffering from the aftermath.\n  In the meantime, I think that the industry needs to step up to the \nplate. I am very concerned about reports that some airlines are \nconsidering invoking the war clause to avoid contractual obligations to \ntheir workers. That would be a tragic failure of their obligation to \nthe American people to act in good faith. Let's be clear; American \ntaxpayers are shouldering the burden of this relief package, and I \nthink they will be angry if workers are not treated fairly while the \nairlines get relief.\n  I have worked with several of my colleagues over the past several \ndays to develop a reasonable package of worker assistance provisions, \nand I believe that we have a proposal that makes a great deal of sense \nand would take at least a small step toward helping those workers get \nback on their feet. That package would extend income supports, pay for \nthe extension of healthcare coverage and provide training assistance to \nthe affected workers. I am deeply disappointed that those provisions \nwere not ultimately included in the bill, but pleased that the majority \nleader has committed to continue his work on this critical component in \nthy days to come.\n  For the past 10 days, ever since the terrorist attacks my \ncongressional colleagues have spoken eloquently and with great emotion \nabout the courage, compassion and commitment of the relief and rescue \nteams who have reached out a helping had to victims of terrorist, \nToday, we have our own chance to help thousands of other Americans who \nhave been harmed by terrorism. We must not turn away.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate very much the comments of the Senator from \nWyoming and the Senator from Washington. The majority leader has asked \nme to note for everyone the first vote Monday will be at 2 p.m. on the \nKirk Van Tine nomination.\n  Senator Warner and Senator Levin, the managers of the Defense \nauthorization bill, have indicated there will also be votes throughout \nthe day. They are moving that legislation as quickly as possible.\n  We yield all time on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, for the interest of all Senators, I \nwant to make sure people understand what the schedule is for Monday.\n  We will convene at 12 noon. From 12 o'clock to 2 o'clock, we will \ntake up the Jordan free trade agreement. That has already been \nestablished by unanimous consent. There will be a 2-hour debate and, by \nagreement, a voice vote.\n  At 2 p.m., there will be a rollcall vote on the Kirk Van Tine \nnomination, Mr. Van Tine to be general counsel of the Department of \nTransportation.\n  Following that vote, we will resume consideration of the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n\n\n                           Passage of S. 1450\n\n  I appreciate very much the tremendous cooperation of all Senators. I \nknow this bill was extremely difficult and very complex, very \ncontroversial in many respects. I appreciate the work on both sides of \nthe aisle to get us to the point we are now.\n  I know there are a lot of Senators who would have appreciated the \nopportunity to offer amendments. It is not our intent to deny Senators \nthe right to offer amendments. Under these circumstances, I am grateful \nfor the acknowledgment that we are in a very difficult time and that \ncooperation, as was demonstrated again this afternoon, is essential if \nwe are able to respond as we now have to the crisis we are facing, not \nonly in the aviation industry but in the economy in a number of other \nways having to do with the tragedy.\n  In my view, there were two essential pieces of legislation missing \nfrom this bill. Others have already addressed it. Senators Carnahan, \nMurray, Cantwell, and Kennedy, and others have been working on a \nproposal to deal with the disaster adjustment assistance and extended \nCOBRA coverage. It is essential that we provide dislocated workers some \nincome security, some training, access to health benefits. We did a \nlittle bit of that in this bill. It was a first step, but we really \nhave a long way to go if we are going to address in a comprehensive and \nmeaningful way the tremendous problems that families all over this \ncountry are now facing as a result of layoffs, as a result of \nbankruptcies, as a result of the economic slowdown. For all of the \nreasons we have heard, we simply cannot allow the circumstances to go \nunattended. It is critical that we do it sooner rather than later.\n  I have talked to Senators Kennedy and Carnahan and others. I have \ntalked with some Senators on this side of the aisle, especially Senator \nLott. It is my hope and my determination to address this issue in the \nnot-too-distant future. We must. We simply cannot go without the \nacknowledgment of the seriousness of the problem as well as a \nrecognition that this problem must be addressed.\n  Secondly, I am very pleased that the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. \nHollings, Senator McCain, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Hutchison, so \nmany others, and Senator Kerry, have worked as closely together as they \nhave on airport security and on airplane security as well. If there is \none piece I really wish we could have addressed in this bill more \ncomprehensively, it is that.\n  I talked to the President about it this morning. It is his intention \nto address the issue in a much more comprehensive way as well. I have \nno doubt we can work with him on security. The Presiding Officer very \neloquently and passionately addressed the issue of security this \nmorning in the caucus.\n  I am pleased that at least the $3 billion that has been committed to \nairport security will allow us to take some of the initial steps. We \nmust rebuild confidence on the part of air travelers. We must ensure \nthat airports and airplanes can be made more secure. We must work \ntogether to make that happen soon. We can continue to provide these \nbills with billions and billions of dollars, but if people are not \ngoing to climb on those airplanes, if they are not going to feel \ncomfortable walking through the airports, if they don't know whether \nthe ramps are secure or not, those billions of dollars will not solve \nthe problem.\n  I am equally as determined to address this issue of security in the \ndays ahead. Senator Hollings has indicated he will continue to work \nwith our colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I intend to work with \nthe administration. I will bring this matter up with the speaker at the \nnext opportunity. We will continue to find ways with which to address \nsecurity, perhaps as early as next week.\n\n  The bill the Commerce Committee has now introduced is a bill I \nbelieve very confidently will address many of these issues, so \nconfidently that I have cosponsored it along with many other Senators. \nI am hopeful that in the not-too-distant future it can be a subject for \ndebate and consideration in the Senate Chamber and that we can work to \nget a bill passed that will truly provide the kind of infrastructure \nand security that will be required to raise the confidence level that \nis necessary.\n  Security, additional compensation, and a safety net for all of those \nworkers who have been left out so far are issues that I am committed to \naddress and that I know the Senate is committed to address. I will \ncontinue to work with my colleague Senator Lott, who is every bit as \nconcerned about many of these issues as I am.\n  We will continue to find ways to work together to do what we know we \nmust to put this country back and to recognize the needs of families, \nworkers, and businesses across the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/21/senate-section/article/S9608-2", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9608-S9609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

Madam President, the events of last week by terrorists \nillustrate the worst of human nature, however, the actions of people in \nthe wake of the disaster has shown the best.\n  While the attacks were in the United States, they were directed at \nthe entire civilized world. And the entire world has responded. Today, \nI would like to draw your attention to the response of a key ally in \nCentral Asia.\n  In light of the direct threat to world freedom that we faced on \nSeptember 11, 2001, Kazakhstan has emerged as one of the only ``silver-\nlinings'' in Central Asia. I am very grateful for the outpouring of \nsupport from the President of Kazakhstan, Mr. Nursultan Nazarbayev. \nWithin a day of the attack President Nazarbayev said, ``Kazakhstan is \nready to support measures undertaken by the United States to fight \nagainst terrorism, with all the means necessary.'' I would also ask \nunanimous consent to submit the President's entire statement into the \nCongressional Record.\n  Kazakhstan is predominantly a muslim nation about four times the size \nof Texas in Central Asia. Surrounded by Russia, China, Turkey, Iran, \nand Afghanistan. Kazakhstan's continued economic and political \nstability is critical to the long-term success of the Central Asian \nnations.\n  In the first few years after its independence from the former Soviet \nUnion in 1991, Kazakhstan successfully dismantled the fourth largest \nnuclear arsenal in the world with U.S. support via the Cooperative \nThreat Reduction Program, CTR. Kazakhstan continues to set a model for \nthe global community in its leadership on unilateral disarmament and \nnonproliferation.\n  In addition, I believe our Nation needs to continue to support the \nGovernment of Kazakhstan which has begun to transform its economy from \nthe old Soviet based communist model to a market-based economy with \nsignificant U.S. foreign direct investment, FDI.\n  It is for these reasons that I have co-sponsored S. 168 that \nauthorizes the extension of nondiscriminatory treatment to the products \nof Kazakhstan. In summary, the United States must do its part to \nenhance cooperation and encourage prosperity and stability for the \nentire Central Asian region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/21/senate-section/article/S9609-2", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THE CALIFORNIANS WHO PERISHED ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, as the American people struggle to come \nto terms with the horrific events of Tuesday, September 11, we are \nreminded again and again of the countless individual tragedies still \nplaying out in every corner of our country: another firefighter is laid \nto rest, a classroom copes with the loss of a teacher, a baby is born \nwho will never know her father, a family accepts that a loved one will \nnever be found.\n  We are all haunted by such stories, each one profound in its deep \nsadness and, considered together, staggering in their scope.\n  None of us is untouched by last Tuesday's terror, and it is now \npainfully clear that many residents of California were part of each \ntragic moment of that tragic day. Some were trapped in the World Trade \nCenter towers. Some were at work in the Pentagon. And the fates of some \nwere sealed as they boarded planes bound for San Francisco or Los \nAngeles.\n  I offer today this tribute to the dozens of Californians who perished \non that awful morning.

Mr. President, I thank the managers of this bill for \ntheir hard work in putting forth this legislation which provides \nFederal funding for numerous vital programs in the Treasury Department \nand the General Government. However, once again, I find myself in the \nunpleasant position of speaking before my colleagues about parochial \nprojects in another appropriations bill.\n  This bill spends at a level 5.9 percent higher than the level enacted \nin fiscal year 2001, which is greater than the 4 percent increase in \ndiscretionary spending than the President wanted to adhere to.\n  In real dollars, this is $328 million in additional spending above \nthe amount requested by the President, and a $1.8 billion increase in \nspending from last year. So far this year, with just seven \nappropriations bills already passed including this bill, spending \nlevels have already exceeded the President's budget request by more \nthan $7.6 billion. I must remind my colleagues that the Administration \nhas urged us to maintain our fiscal discipline to ensure that we will \ncontinue to have adequate funds to prosecute our war against terrorism, \nto aid those in need, and to cover other related costs.\n  In this bill, I have identified just over $200 million in earmarks, \nwhich is less than the cost of the earmarks, totaling $356 million, in \nthe bill passed last year. Therefore, I applaud the efforts of the \nappropriators in keeping parochial spending to a minimum in this bill \nbut more must be done.\n  While the amounts associated with each individual earmark may not \nseem extravagant, taken together, they represent a serious diversion of \ntaxpayers' hard-earned dollars at the expense of numerous programs that \nhave undergone the appropriate merit-based selection process. It is my \nview that the people who run these programs should be the ones who \ndecide how best to spend the appropriated funds. After all, they know \nwhat their most pressing needs are.\n  For example, under funding for the Department of Treasury, some \nexamples of earmarks include: $1,000,000 for work on joint technology \nprojects with New Mexico State University's Physical Sciences \nLaboratory; and $750,000 for the Center for Agriculture Policy and \nTrade Studies located at North Dakota State University.\n  Under funding for the General Government, some of the earmarks \ninclude: $2,500,000 for the Native American Digital Telehealth Project \nand the Upper Great Plains Native American Telehealth Program at the \nUniversity of North Dakota; and $5,000,000 to help\n\n[[Page S9610]]\n\npurchase land and facilitate the moving of the Odd Fellows Hall to \nprovide for construction of a new courthouse in Salt Lake City, UT.\n  There are more projects on the list that I have compiled, which will \nbe available on my Senate Web site.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to curb our habit of directing hard-\nearned taxpayer dollars to locality-specific special interests.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/21/senate-section/article/S9610-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               POSTAL SERVICE SORTING PRACTICES IN HAWAII\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I understand that as a result of the closure of our \nnation's airports and the limitations placed on the carriage of cargo \non commercial passenger planes, postal service throughout our country \nwas affected. However, the State of Hawaii was impacted most severely. \nMy colleague from Hawaii, Senator Inouye, has joined me to discuss the \nsituation in Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank Senator Dorgan for the opportunity to share with \nour colleagues the impact of the air service restrictions on the \ndelivery of mail in the State of Hawaii. The recent closure of our \nNation's air transportation system brought to light a Postal Service \npractice that I believe should be reevaluated. Hawaii is an island \nState that is not only geographically isolated from the mainland United \nStates, but that is also geographically divided into seven distinct \nislands separated by the Pacific Ocean. Hawaii has a population \ndependent on the air transportation system for the movement of goods \nand people throughout the State. However, I believe the current Postal \nService mail sorting procedure has the potential to exacerbate the harm \nto my State's economy from the airport closures, the reduced inter-\nisland travel, and the decline in travel to and from my State.\n  The Postal Service in Hawaii has only one centralized sorting office. \nWhile I understand that mail service throughout the United States \nexperienced slow-downs and difficulties as a result of the closure of \nour air transportation system, mail service in Hawaii came to a virtual \nstandstill. The shut down of our airports resulted in the delivery of \nmail only on the island of Oahu, where the sorting station is located. \nMy constituents on Maui could not mail letters to one another because a \nletter originating on Maui and addressed to another location on Maui \nmust first be flown to Honolulu for sorting. This hardship was faced by \nall the residents of Oahu's neighbor islands.\n  With the threat of war upon us and the possibility of further airport \nclosures, I believe we must study alternatives to the current mail \nsorting system. The problems faced by the neighbor islands as a result \nof the airport shutdown are expected to continue as tourism to and \nwithin Hawaii declines. Aloha Airlines, one of two island air carriers, \nhas announced a 26-percent reduction in flights that will begin next \nweek. Hawaiian Airlines, the other inter-island air carrier has also \ndramatically reduced its flight schedule. Additional flights will \nlikely be eliminated with the expected continued decline in leisure and \nbusiness travel.\n  In light of these flight restrictions, I believe the Postal Service \nshould develop a procedure by which mail that originates on the same \nisland to which it is addressed can be kept and sorted on that island. \nI realize that this would be only a small step toward addressing the \nmany issues resulting from my State's unique geography, but it would be \na start.\n  Mr. Dorgan. I thank Senator Inouye for sharing with us the \ndifficulties faced by your State. I agree that the Postal Service \nshould examine the feasibility of implementing procedures that take \ninto account Hawaii's unique geography. Please be assured that I will \nwork with the Senator to help in this endeavor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/21/senate-section/article/S9610-2", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RETIREMENT OF SHERRY ADKINS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I am grateful for this opportunity to \nrecognize and pay tribute to Sherry Adkins, who has worked in my Salt \nLake City office for 25 years as a Constituent Services Representative. \nSherry is retiring after many years of hard work to fulfill her dream \nof moving to Alaska with her husband Bruce to spend time with her \ngrandchildren.\n  Sherry's life has epitomized true public service. She literally \ntouched thousands of Utahans' lives by assisting me in helping \nconstituents with problems ranging from Social Security issues to \nVeterans Administration benefits. Over the years, I have received \nhundreds of letters from constituents who have praised Sherry's work \nand expressed their gratitude to me for her assistance.\n  Sherry has been described as ``a valuable resource,'' ``efficient,'' \n``courteous,'' ``concerned for others' welfare,'' and ``trustworthy.'' \nMany people have been able finally to receive their Medicare benefits, \nresolve their tax problems, or find their missing Social Security \nchecks, because of her commitment and concern.\n  Sherry's life has been an example of service. She has always \nchampioned the underdog and looked for ways to help others in need. She \nspent many years volunteering at the Salt Lake City Odyssey House, an \norganization designed to help men and women overcome the tragic disease \nof alcoholism. In fact, she even directed the Odyssey House Choir, \ngiving members new hope and experiences, as well as entertaining \nthousands of people through their music.\n  I have always known that I could count on Sherry to get her job done, \nand to do it well. In fact, Sherry's work with me didn't start when I \nwas a elected to the U.S. Senate. Sherry and I go back even further. I \nwas privileged to have Sherry as my personal secretary for a few years \nwhile I practiced law in Utah. So, Sherry has been my longest serving \nstaffer, and I will miss her greatly.\n  It has always been a pleasure to work with Sherry Adkins. I am so \ngrateful to Sherry for her efforts and the service that she has \nrendered to me, my office, and to all Utahans. I feel blessed to be \nable to call her a friend. I want to wish Sherry and her husband Bruce \nthe very best that life has to offer in the beautiful land of Alaska. \nMay they find peace and happiness in their retirement years doing the \nthings that they love the most.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/21/senate-section/article/S9610-3", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ARMENIAN INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I rise today to recognize the 10th \nanniversary of Armenia's independence.\n  On September 21, 1991, the people of Armenia began their journey of \nfreedom and democracy. The road they have travelled over the past 10 \nyears has been full of challenges including natural disasters, conflict \nin Nagorno Karabagh, and the struggles associated with economic and \npolitical transformation. Any of these could have led Armenians off the \npath of liberty. However, it is through the perseverance of Armenians, \nand those around the world who support them, that Armenia begins this \nnew century a strong republic and an example for young democracies \nworldwide.\n  The events of September 11, 2001, pose a new challenge to Armenians, \nAmericans, and those who reject terrorism and fight the war against \nfear. In his September 11 letter to President George Bush, Armenian \nPresident Robert Kocharyan called on Armenians to confront the ``evil \nof terrorism'' with ``determination and resolve.'' At this most \ncritical time, Americans are thankful for Armenia's support, and \ntogether, along with a global coalition of freedom-loving nations, we \nwill find the strength and patience to continue our journey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/21/senate-section/article/S9610-4", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9610-S9613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL POW/MIA RECOGNITION DAY\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, today is National POW/MIA Recognition \nDay.\n  In light of the tragic events of September 11, this day of \nremembrance and recognition has new meaning. We have spoken about a new \nkind of ``war'' but we are not sure what shape it will take. Whatever \nform, however, it will likely include casualties and perhaps prisoners, \nthese are among the harsh lessons history has taught us. This day gains \nnew meaning, too, when we consider the rescue workers who continue to \ncomb through the war zones at the Pentagon and in lower Manhattan for \nthe bodies of the fallen, the missing, in action.\n  In time of war, an entire nation unites with a singularity of \npurpose.\n\n[[Page S9611]]\n\n But, we all know how swiftly the Nation's attention can wane and be \ndistracted. Those of us in this body and across the relevant Executive \nagencies, however, cannot be distracted from one thing; that is, a \ncommitment to ensure the return of POWs and MIAs at the end of \nhostilities. The vigorous pursuit of this commitment must continue \nthrough painstaking on-site investigations, diplomatic negotiations and \ncomplete examinations of records following a conflict.\n  As we look forward with resolve, we must recognize the work that the \nmany POW/MIA organizations have done, led by the Department of Defense \nPrisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office, DPMO. The painstaking work of \nrecovery operations have, in the past year, seen the return of 36 \nAmericans from the war in Southeast Asia; however, 1,957 remain \nunaccounted for at this time from SEA, 1,474 from Vietnam alone. Last \nyear, those numbers stood at 2,005 and 1,511 respectively.\n  Seven of the dedicated men engaged in Vietnam recovery operations \ngave their own lives this year, even as they searched for fallen \ncomrades. The Americans died along with nine Vietnamese in April when \ntheir helicopter crashed into a fog-shrouded mountain about 250 miles \nsouth of Hanoi. The team was scouting excavations for six MIA crash \nsites.\n  In Korea, where the fighting ended in 1953, progress continues. Ten \nJoint Recovery Operations have been conducted in North Korea this year, \nresulting in the identification and return of three Americans to their \nfamilies and final resting places. Twenty-six servicemen have been \nidentified from World War II recoveries. Teams from the U.S. Army \nCentral Identification Laboratory in Hawaii continue to implement \ncutting-edge DNA technology, and as renowned experts in the field, have \ncontributed their know-how and direct assistance to the operations in \nNew York and at the Pentagon.\n  Just last month, another team headed off to Russia to bring home the \nremains of seven Navy flyers whose World War II PV-1 Ventura bomber \nwere lost on the Kamchatka peninsula. The plane went missing from a \nMarch 25, 1944 bombing mission from Alaska to the Kurile Islands. The \nNavy has located family members and prepared comparison DNA samples in \nhopes that all will be returned at long last. Having spent time in that \npart of the world, I know what dedication to duty it takes to dig in \nthat extreme weather. I understand that weather permits them only about \na 30-day window.\n  As we know well, this is a team effort requiring the commitment and \ndedication of the Congress, the Administration, the Departments of \nDefense and State, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the NSA. I am hopeful \nthat all of us, through continued humanitarian support and dedicated \ndiplomatic endeavors will gain further information about the servicemen \nstill missing to honor their sacrifice and provide peace and solace to \ntheir loved ones. You are not forgotten.\n  At this point in the record, I ask unanimous consent that the names \nof Indiana's missing and unaccounted from the Korea and Vietnam Wars be \nprinted in the record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. UNACCOUNTED FOR IN SOUTHEAST ASIA--POST 1973\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     Country of\n        Military service              casualty          Refno               Name             Last rank      Status      Date incident    Home of record\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUSAF...........................

Madam President, during the course of the past week, \nwe have witnessed extraordinary acts of bravery. Americans from all \nwalks of life have reached deep into their souls and sought to bring \nforth comfort to those who have suffered the unimaginable. Their \nefforts range from simple acts of kindness to the emotionally numbing \ntasks of searching through the aftermath for survivors. Today I rise to \napplaud the efforts of a special team of Americans, Missouri Task Force \nOne.\n  Created in the early '80s by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, \nthe philosophy behind urban search and rescue was to compile a team of \nhighly trained and motivated rescue and medical specialists that could \nfind and return people in collapsed buildings. This past week the 62 \nvolunteers that make up Missouri Task Force One have used the full \nrange of their skills in the New York City rescue mission.\n  Searchers work in 12-hour shifts. They search around the clock. The \neffort is slow and methodical and emotions run high. ``It's sensory \noverload in every aspect,'' said team member Doug Wasar, a firefighter \nfrom St. Louis. Yet, despite the fatigue and anguish they face, they \nmust be forced to stop and eat. When the shift is over, they are \nreluctant to stop. They are driven by an inner force they find hard to \nexplain.\n  Their job is as difficult and challenging as perhaps any task that \nhas been undertaken since the attack, but their focus remains true. As \nthe days and weeks progress and the chances of finding survivors wane, \nthey press on, their hope and determination strong.\n  On behalf of all Missourians I express my sincere and heartfelt \nappreciation\n\n[[Page S9614]]\n\nto the heroes and heroines who make up Missouri Task Force One. They \nare shining examples of the best Missouri has to offer and an \ninspiration to the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/21/senate-section/article/S9614-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I rise today to speak about \nhate crimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of \nthis year. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred November 30, \n1993 in Tyler, TX. Nicholas West, a 23-year-old gay man, was abducted \nfrom a park known as a meeting place for gays, robbed and shot to \ndeath. Donald Aldrich, 29, David Ray McMillan, 17, and Henry Dunn Jr., \n19, were charged with murder.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/21/senate-section/article/S9614-2", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n IN MEMORY OF TWO BRAVE CALIFORNIA PILOTS, LARRY GROFF AND LARS STRATTE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I rise today to commemorate the tragic \ndeaths of Larry Groff and Lars Stratte, pilots who were killed on \nAugust, 27, 2001 in a mid-air tanker collision while fighting the Bus \nFire in Northern California. Both pilots were flying Gruman S-2 \naircraft and were making fire retardant drops on the fire when they \ncollided.\n  Larry Groff and Lars Stratte were established and dedicated pilots \nwho have recorded numerous hours of flying time. Both pilots were \nemployees of San Joaquin Helicopters, Incorporated. Larry Groff was a \n20 year Navy Veteran pilot and Lars Stratte was Past President of the \nRedding Area Pilots Association.\n  We will never forget the service of these pilots to their community. \nIn a difficult and dangerous occupation, they demonstrated outstanding \ncourage and extraordinary ability to fight fires from the air in their \nservice with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.\n  Larry Groff, from Windsor, CA, leaves behind his wife Christine, his \nsix children and two grandchildren. Lars Stratte, from Redding, CA, \nleaves behind his wife Terri and two children.\n  Larry Groff and Lars Stratte served their community and the people of \nCalifornia with great distinction. I am honored to pay tribute to these \nbrave men today and I encourage my fellow colleagues to join me in \ncelebrating their lives and service, mourning their passing and \nextending our condolences to their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/21/senate-section/article/S9614-3", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN RECOGNITION OF DAVID BOHLEY\n\n  Mr. BOND.

Dave Bohley has been a member of my \nSmall Business Committee staff since 1998. Since that time he has set a \nhigh standard of excellence and knowledge in handling banking and \nrelated matters for the Committee. He was also deeply involved in the \nSmall Business Innovation Research program reauthorization we passed \nlast year, and in the Small Business Technology Transfer program \nlegislation currently working its way through the Congress.\n  Dave's expertise recently attracted him into a new career at Fannie \nMae, the financial services company. Although I am happy for him to \nhave this new opportunity, I am sorry to see him leave my staff. Fannie \nMae's gain is truly our loss. I wish him every success and thank him so \nvery much for his exemplary service to me and to the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/21/senate-section/article/S9614-4", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATURALIZATION EXTENSION ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. KOHL.

The Hmong, and particularly the Lao Veterans of America, \ndeserve our respect and honor for all their help during the conflict in \nVietnam.\n  The Hmong Veterans Naturalization Act of 2000 waives the English \nlanguage requirement and provides for a translator during \nadministration of the Civics test for all Hmong Veterans of the Special \nForces in Laos and their spouses and widows applying for U.S. \ncitizenship.

Since enactment, fewer than half of \nall Hmong veterans and their family members have been able to seek \ncitizenship under these standards.

Madam President, I rise to join with my colleagues in \nsupport of H. Con. Res 227 condemning bigotry and violence against \nArab, Muslim, and South Asian Americans.\n  I am sincerely grateful for and proud of the tremendous response of \nthe American people who have shown true courage and loyalty in the face \nof the horrific attacks on our country on September 11, 2001. No one \nshould doubt the resolve of this Nation to meet the challenge before us \nin fighting terrorism. But as we continue to wrestle with deep and \nconflicting emotions of sadness, pain, anger, and fear, we must ensure \nthat the spirit of America, that ability to transcend differences in \nrace, religion, and ethnicity to achieve greatness, is not only \npreserved, but strengthened as a result of this tragedy.\n  As history has shown, America has always triumphed when we are \nunited. That is why it is so important in this chapter in our history, \nas we prepare to defend and preserve our Nation, that we stay united as \none Nation. This should not be an occasion for irrational impulses of \nfear, hate or violence towards Arab-Americans, Muslim Americans, South \nAsian Americans, or any other person in this country. Such actions are \nwrong. The idea of ``America'' knows no racial, ethnic, or religious \nboundaries, and no American should have to live in fear as a result of \nthis situation. I stand together with my colleagues, and with Americans \nof all backgrounds, in condemning such actions. We must renew our \ncommitment to protect our fellow Americans and our Nation against those \nwho want to divide us with hate.\n  Unfortunately, there has been a rash of acts of hate during the last \nweek, compounding the anxiety of Americans in communities throughout \nthis Nation. I have been saddened to hear of incidents in my own State. \nAshraf ``Mike'' Khaled, a Wisconsin resident of Jordanian descent and \ngas station owner, has been the victim of several incidents of hateful \nstatements and threats of his safety by customers and passerby. He \nreminded us of why our country is so great and why these actions of \nhatred can be so damaging. He said, ``I love this country because I \nfound my freedom here.''\n  This is a critical moment for America. One in which we must all live \nby and honor our Pledge to live as ``One Nation, under God, \nindivisible, with liberty and justice for all.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/21/senate-section/article/S9614-6", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9614-S9615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BISHOP TIMLIN\n\n Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I seek recognition today to \nacknowledge the service of my friend, Bishop James C. Timlin, D.D., of \nthe Diocese of\n\n[[Page S9615]]\n\nScranton, who is today celebrating 25 years since his elevation to the \nrank of bishop. Recently, on July 16, 2001, Bishop Timlin also observed \nthe 50th anniversary of his priestly ordination.\n  Bishop Timlin was born in Scranton on August 5, 1927. He attended \nHoly Rosary High School and St. Charles College in Catonsville, MD. He \nthen attended St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore and the North American \nCollege in Rome, Italy, where he completed his studies for the \npriesthood. Bishop Timlin was ordained on July 16, 1951, in Rome by the \nMost Reverend Martin J. O'Connor, D.D. Bishop Timlin continued his \nstudies in theology there before returning to the Diocese of Scranton, \nwhere he was appointed Assistant Pastor at St. John Evangelist Parish, \nPittston, in 1952.\n  On June 12, 1953, he became Assistant Pastor of St. Peter's Cathedral \nin Scranton, where he served until September 12, 1966, when he was \nnamed Assistant Chancellor of the Diocese of Scranton. He was named \nChaplain to His Holiness Pope Paul VI on August 3, 1967, Chancellor of \nthe Diocese of Scranton on December 15, 1971, and Prelate of Honor to \nHis Holiness on April 23, 1972. He was named the Auxiliary Bishop of \nScranton on August 3, 1976, and Pastor of the Nativity of Our Lord, \nScranton, in September 1979. Cardinal John J. O'Connor, the seventh \nBishop of Scranton, appointed him Chairman of the Board of Advisors for \nSt. Pius X Seminary and Chairman of the Preparatory Commission for the \nScranton Diocesan Synod in 1983.\n  Pope John Paul II appointed him the eighth Bishop of Scranton on \nApril 24, 1984, and his installation followed on June 7, 1984. Bishop \nTimlin has served two terms as a member of the Administrative Board and \nthe National Advisory Council of the National Conference of Catholic \nBishops. He also served as a member of the Board of the North American \nCollege, as well as a consultant on the Liturgy Committee. He is \npresently a consultant to the NCCB's Ecumenical and Migration \ncommittees.\n  For his leadership and spiritual shepherding of 340,000 Catholics in \nthe 11 counties of the Diocese of Scranton, I would like to extend the \ngratitude and recognition of the United States Senate to Bishop James \nTimlin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/21/senate-section/article/S9615-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN MEMORY OF ROSE ANN VUICH\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nrecent passing of Rose Ann Vuich, an extraordinary public servant and \nCalifornian who died on August 30th at the age of 74, after a long \nbattle with Alzheimer's.\n  Rose Ann Vuich was California's first woman State senator, serving in \nthe California State Senate for 16 years until her retirement in 1992. \nWith the election of Senator Vuich in 1976, she became an icon in \nCalifornia's political history and helped to write a new era in the \nhistory of the California State Senate.\n  Rose Ann Vuich set a high level of integrity and decency. To this \nday, there is a Rose Ann Vuich award recognizing other great public \nservants who meet her high standards. She was a woman of great \ndetermination and dedication, who worked tirelessly for her \nconstituents and was loved and respected by so many.\n  Rose Ann Vuich was the daughter of Yugoslav immigrants and was from \nthe small farming community of Dinuba in Tulare County, California. \nSenator Vuich was dedicated to agriculture, family, community and \npromoting the San Joaquin Valley. She will be greatly missed by all.\n  On behalf of the Senate, I extend our thoughts and prayers to the \nVuich Family on the loss of an extraordinary woman. I ask that the \nFresno Bee Editorial from August 31, 2001 be printed in the Record.\n\n                  [From the Fresno Bee, Aug. 31, 2001]\n\n  Rose Ann Vuich--Valley Lawmaker Left an Enduring Legacy of Ethical, \n                            Honest Behavior\n\n  At a time when there's so much cynicism about government, Rose Ann \nVuich reminded us that public service is noble. Sen. Vuich, who died \nThursday, was California's first woman state senator, but her mark in \nSacramento was made with her integrity and a commitment to her Valley \nconstituents.\n  A Democrat from Dinuba, Sen. Vuich represented the region for 16 \nyears until retiring in 1992. She served at a time when the Legislature \nwas controlled by special interests and laws limiting gifts from \nlobbyists were not as strict as they are today. Many legislators had \ntheir hands out, and the special interests were only too happy to \ngrease them. But they could not get to Sen. Vuich, although they tried.\n  Sen. Vuich had earned a reputation for voting her conscience and, \ndidn't look kindly on so-called ``juice bills,'' which were bills that \nhad no value other than attracting campaign contributions for \nlawmakers. In Sacramento, FBI agents played a tape that had a witness \nsaying a bill shouldn't go to the Banking and Commerce Committee, which \nSen. Vuich chaired, because she didn't ``play ball.''\n  In 1998, an award for ethical leadership was established in Sen. \nVuich's name. The aim was to raise the ethical bar in the region, which \nwas sorely needed after the many indictments in the local Operation \nRezone case.\n  Sen. Vuich also was a role model for women in government. It was \ndifficult being California's first woman state senator, but she broke \ninto that men's club with humor and dignity. She kept a bell on her \ndesk in the Senate chamber, and when her male colleagues referred to \nthe ``gentlemen of the Senate'' or ``fellow senators,'' she rang the \nbell loudly. The Senate soon became more sensitive to gender-biased \nlanguage.\n  Sen. Vuich was instrumental in getting the local freeway system built \nand the centerpiece of her 1976 campaign was completing Freeway 41, \nwhich she called ``the freeway to nowhere.''\n  Sen. Vuich remains a role model for all of us. The lessons she taught \nus must endure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/21/senate-section/article/S9615-2", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9615-S9616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IN MEMORY OF SARAH MAE SHOEMAKER CALHOON\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \npassing of a wonderful woman, mother, and American. Sarah Mae Shoemaker \nCalhoon died on July 7, 2001 outside of Columbus, OH, (Hilliard), after \na courageous battle with cancer. Mrs. Calhoon was 75 years old.\n  Mrs. Calhoon was born on August 31, 1925 in Philadelphia, PA to the \nlate Samuel and Sarah Mae Shoemaker. She spent her childhood in \nPhiladelphia, where she would graduate from Cheltenham High School. On \nAugust 29, 1947, just two days before her 22nd birthday, Sarah Mae \nShoemaker was married to J. Thomas Calhoon, a Marine from Grandview \nHeights, a suburb of Columbus, OH.\n  The new Mr. and Mrs. Calhoon had their first child, Thomas F. or \n``little'' Tom as they often called him early in their marriage. In \nSeptember of 1948, Tom, Sarah, and ``little'' Tom moved to Columbus, \nOH, where, over the next four years they would become the proud parents \nof three more sons, Sam, Don, and Bob. Their only daughter, Susie, \nwould be born in April of 1961.\n  Although I did not know Sarah Mae Calhoon personally, I have known \nher son Tom for more than half of my life. We met as undergraduates at \nthe Ohio State University in the 1960s and have been fraternity \nbrothers for more than three decades. Despite living so far from each \nother, Tom and I have managed to keep in touch over the years. It is \noften said that all children are a reflection of their parents. If Tom \nis even a faint reflection of his mother, it is a great tribute to the \nvalues she carried throughout her life and instilled in her children.\n  Since her recent passing, I have heard and read many wonderful things \nabout Sarah Mae Calhoon. I have learned about her strong commitment to \nthe community of Columbus, whether it be through her active membership \nin a variety of organizations like the PTA, 4-H, the Lions Auxiliary or \nin her unofficial role as the ``zoning watchdog'' of the Calhoon's \nneighborhood on Old Cemetery Road. I have read about her great success \nas a multi-million dollar producer in the real estate industry. I have \nheard, from both former customers and competitors alike, about the \ndedication, loyalty, and integrity that she brought to her job every \nday.\n  Most importantly, however, I have learned about her unfailing \ncommitment to being a mother and wife. Nothing was more precious to \nSarah Calhoon than her family and she did all she could to ensure that \nall of her children grew up in a loving and nurturing\n\n[[Page S9616]]\n\nenvironment that would enable them to go on to lead valuable and \nfulfilling lives. She consistently put the needs, concerns and feelings \nof her family and others, before her own wishes, never asking for much \nbut always giving a great deal. Her life served as an example, \nproviding inspiration to women everywhere struggling to maintain the \ncareful balance between career and family, a task that she carried out \nwith admirable grace and skill.\n  Everything that I have learned about Sarah Mae Calhoon since her \ndeath has only confirmed what I had always pictured my good friend \nTom's mother would be like: the epitome of an exemplary wife, mother, \nbusiness woman, and citizen.\n  In closing, I would like to extend my greatest condolences to her \nhusband, their five children, seven grandchildren, and countless others \nwhose lives were touched by this wonderful woman. As we celebrate her \nremarkable life, let it be known that Sarah Mae Calhoon will be dearly \nmissed, yet never forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/21/senate-section/article/S9616-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN HONOR OF SHOSHONA GREENBAUM\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, a suicide bombing occurred in \nJerusalem during the Congressional recess that claimed the life of a \nyoung American woman, Shoshona Greenbaum. Ms. Greenbaum, four months \npregnant with her first child, is yet another tragic victim in the \nnumbing string of suicide bomb attacks perpetrated by Palestinian \nextremists against innocent Israeli citizens.\n  Shoshona Greenbaum was one of 15 people killed on August 9th in a \ndowntown Jerusalem pizzeria, after a Palestinian terrorist detonated a \nbomb studded with nails, screws and bolts that he had strapped to his \nbody. She died instantly, and with her died the hopes and dreams of a \nyoung, idealistic woman, a wife, a devoted school teacher and mother-\nto-be.\n  Ms. Greenbaum spent most of her life in Southern California, and her \nparents, Alan and Shifra Hayman, still live in Los Angeles. My heart \ngoes out to her family, her many friends, and to her grieving husband \nSteven for their cruel and unexpected loss.\n  I have had the opportunity to talk with Shoshona's father, and I know \nwhat a deep loss this is for the entire family. I condemn this cowardly \nattack that robbed a husband of his beloved wife and child, devastated \na family and took a remarkable young woman from a community that adored \nher.\n  It is time for the terrorism to stop. It is time for the suicide bomb \nattacks to stop. It is time for the Palestinian leadership to renounce \nthe use of violence and to rein in those individuals and elements who \nseek only to destroy Israel and forever destabilize the region.\n  In the name of Shoshona Greenbaum and the other innocent victims of \nthese attacks, we must seek to understand the roots of terrorism in the \nMiddle East and bring to an end the ever-escalating cycle of violence. \nI can think of no more appropriate memorial to Shoshona than to ensure \none day that the people of Israel can live in freedom and safety, \nsecure in their knowledge of a peaceful and productive future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/21/senate-section/article/S9616-2", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/21/senate-section/article/S9616-3", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/21/senate-section/article/S9616-4", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9616-S9617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:04 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which is requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n       H.R. 1900.

A bill to establish a Federal air marshals program under the \nAttorney General; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, two unmistakable American voices have \nemerged from the aftermath of September 11.\n  One voice expressed a newfound hesitancy to fly. Passengers have \ncanceled scheduled flights en masse and I, for one, can hardly blame \nthem. Just this week we heard chilling reports that more acts of terror \nmay be planned in our skies, and, even after the tragic events of \nSeptember 11, we continue to hear anecdotes of lax security at our \nNation's airports. Almost overnight, air travel, a way of life for \nmillions of Americans every day, is now limping along. Families who \ngather to celebrate holidays, businesspeople who depend upon air \ntransport, and Americans who simply prefer the speed of airplanes, now \nall must deal with the awful reality of terrorism. The hard economic \ntruth of September 11 is that it scared so many passengers from \nairlines that it threatens to destroy our multi-billion dollar aviation \nindustry.\n  But a second, more inspiring, voice emerged from Americans after the \nacts of September 11, a visceral, instinctive urge to serve their \ncountry in some way after the attack on American soil. Minutes after \nTuesday's tragedy, we saw real-life armies of compassion come to the \naid of those whose lives were destroyed. We saw police and fire rescue \nunits risk their lives to save their fellow citizens. We saw American \nfamilies generously pour nearly $200 million of relief money to \ncharitable organizations such as the Red Cross, the United Way, and the \nSalvation Army. And in memorial services and vigils all over the \ncountry, we saw Americans rallying together to pause, to pray, and to \npledge that the American spirit will not be broken. Still today, in a \nremarkable show of patriotism, there is a chorus, especially those in \nlaw enforcement, asking ``what can I do?'' to protect and defend our \nfellow countrymen from future terrorist tragedies.\n  What we need to do is harness this spirit in order to make our \nairlines safe again for American families. So, today, I am introducing \nlegislation that authorizes the Attorney General, as our Nation's top \nlaw enforcement official, to establish a comprehensive Federal Air \nMarshal program to secure airports from curbside to cockpit. And to \ncapitalize on the desire of so many Americans to serve our country in \nthe fight against terrorism, the legislation specifically authorizes \nthe Attorney General to use active and retired Federal, State, and \nlocal law enforcement officials to serve in the Air Marshal program.\n  America needs a uniform Federal Air Marshal program to combat \npotential terrorism from the minute passengers arrive at an airport \nuntil the time they arrive safely at their intended destinations. This \nrequires a professional law enforcement team to police airport points \nof entry, operate x-ray machines, and serve as undercover air security \nmarshals on board commercial aircraft. While we have an existing FAA \nFederal Air Marshal program on board aircraft, we need to expand \nFederal aviation security to put Federal marshals on more flights and \nto stop terrorism on the ground before it can board an aircraft. For a \ncomprehensive Air Marshal program to be most effective, we need to \nrelieve the obligations of airport security from the FAA and the \nairlines, whose primary purpose is to facilitate and manage air travel, \nand entrust that obligation to the Department of Justice, whose primary \nmission is to enforce Federal law, and most important, to safeguard and \nprotect us from terrorism.\n  Obviously this new Federal Air Marshals program will require \nadditional manpower and financial resources. And that is where we \nintend to harness the spirit espoused by so many of our law enforcement \npersonnel throughout the country. The new Federal Air Marshals program \nnot only will recruit new full-time active professional marshals but \nwill augment that program with Deputy Federal Air Marshals drawn from \nretired military personnel, as well as from active or retired Federal, \nState, and local law enforcement officers, anyone from a DEA agent to a \nlocal law enforcement officer who wants to serve his country by \nsecuring our airports and aircraft. It is also crucial that we retain a \nsufficient measure of cost-sharing with private and State and local \nentities. Private airlines and airport authorities should share a \nresponsibility, as they do now, to help fund a portion of airport \nsecurity.\n\n  The Attorney General will, of course, determine how to deploy the \nDeputy Air Marshals most effectively, and will ensure that they are \nproperly trained to perform the task required of them, be it thwarting \nhijackers on board an aircraft or searching suspicious packages in the \nterminal. What is certain, however, is that tapping this reservoir of \nknowledgeable and experienced law enforcement officers to serve this \nvital national security function will allow us to put more Marshals \nboth in the air and on the ground. Our goal should be to secure as many \nairports and as many aircraft as possible using the most experienced \nand professional staff available.\n  We already have models in place for the type of curbside to cockpit \nsecurity envisioned in this bill. Our Federal courthouses currently are \nsecured by our United States Marshals, who also employ Court Security \nOfficers, CSOs, to provide security around the perimeter of the \nbuilding, at each point of entry, and in the courtrooms themselves. \nThese CSOs are themselves retired Federal, State, and local law \nenforcement personnel. Part of the reason our courthouses enjoy such \nsecurity today is that this unified system provides for layers of \nsecurity far before one enters the actual courtroom. Our democracy now \ndemands, in the interest of our national security, that we make sure \nour cockpits are every bit as secure as our courthouses.\n  In times and events such as these, the Federal Government is not only \nthe best answer, but the only answer. The challenge we face in securing \nour airports and airlines is not a matter of free market economics, it \nis a matter of national security, as the tragic events of September 11 \nmade so\n\n[[Page S9624]]\n\nhorrifyingly clear. That is why it is imperative that we entrust this \nnational security item with the resources, expertise, and experience of \nour Nation's top law enforcement agency, and that we do so immediately.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1444\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to \nintroduce the Internet Equity and Education Act of 2001 in the Senate. \nThis important legislation, which is based on the findings of the \nbipartisan Web-Based Education Commission on which I served, will \naccomplish the critical goal of giving more students in both rural and \nurban areas access to distance education by expanding Internet-based \neducational opportunities at the post-secondary level.\n  Specifically, this legislation, which is cosponsored by Senators \nDorgan, Frist and Hutchinson, will remove three regulatory barriers \nthat are slowing the growth of distance education in our nation. First, \nit will modify the Department of Education's ``50 percent rule'' that \nrequires institutions that are eligible for Title IV student aid \nprograms under the Higher Education Act to offer at least 50 percent of \ntheir instruction in a classroom-based environment. This legislation \nwill instead allow institutions to offer more than 50 percent of their \nclasses by telecommunications methods if the institution already \nparticipates in the student loan programs and their student loan \ndefault rate is less than 10 percent for the three preceding years. \nThis ensures that distance education options are available to schools \nwith a proven track record of successfully administering federal \nfinancial aid programs.\n  Second, it will eliminate the ``12 hour rule.'' This rule defines a \nweek of instructional time to mean 12 hours of ``regularly scheduled \ninstruction, examinations, or preparation for examination'' for \nprograms that are offered in non-standard terms. This legislation will \ninstead require that programs offered on a non-standard term, such as \nthose offered by the University of Wyoming and the Western Governors \nUniversity, be held to the same accountability standards as those \noffered on a traditional semester or quarter basis.\n  Third, this legislation will clarify the incentive compensation \nrestrictions that were passed by Congress in 1992 with the intent of \nprohibiting colleges and universities that participate in federal \nstudent financial aid programs from paying any commission, bonus, or \nother incentive payments to third parties based on their success in \nenrolling new students. These restrictions, while well intentioned, \nhave had the unintended consequence of preventing some\n\n[[Page S9625]]\n\nhigher education institutions from using third-party Web portals. This \npractice, which is fairly common and often necessary for many distance \neducation and Internet based education programs, provides prospective \nstudents with access to information about the programs they offer and \nadmissions requirements. This legislation clarifies the incentive \ncompensation prohibitions in the Higher Education Act by allowing the \nuse of third-party Web portals and allowing schools to appropriately \nreward employees for their job performance. The bill preserves the \nintent of the 1992 law by stating that non-salary payments to those \ndirectly involved in recruiting students or awarding financial aid are \nnot allowed. It will also allow the Secretary of Education to impose \nappropriate sanctions against an institution if a violation occurs. \nThis change to the regulation will continue to ensure that Federal \nstudent aid programs are free from fraud and abuse, while allowing \nprospective students to gain information about all of the post-\nsecondary educational opportunities that are available.\n  As some of you may know, I have a very personal interest in the issue \nof distance education. I saw how effective it can be because my wife, \nDiana, received her masters degree in adult education by taking classes \nthrough the University of Wyoming while living here in Washington. \nAfter witnessing the high quality of the course work, the \nresponsiveness to students' needs, and the ``technology flexibility'' \nthat enabled Diana's experience, I have become a strong advocate for \ndistance learning.\n  I am especially pleased to be able to sponsor this legislation at a \ntime when the University of Wyoming is experiencing record breaking \nenrollment in Online UW, the web-based educational arm of the \nUniversity of Wyoming Outreach School. I was impressed to learn that as \nof August 28, 2001 class enrollments totaled 1,164, which is a dramatic \nincrease over the 140 students who enrolled in the spring of 1999 when \nthe University launched this program. In addition to the enrollment \ngrowth, the number of courses that are being offered is also expanding. \nDuring the fall 2001 semester 43 online courses are available at the \nUniversity of Wyoming, supporting seven degree programs or \ncertificates. It is my hope that with the passage of this legislation, \nprograms like those at the University of Wyoming will be able to expand \neven further to serve more interested students.\n  In closing, I would like to take this opportunity to extend my thanks \nto Congressman Johnny Isakson and his staff. As the Vice Chair of the \nWeb-Based Education Commission, Congressman Isakson introduced this \nlegislation in the House earlier this year and has successfully steered \nit through the House Education and the Workforce Committee, where it \npassed overwhelmingly on August 1, 2001. I look forward to the same \nsuccess here in the Senate so that we might open up the possibilities \nof distance education to a new generation of students.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Nelson \n        of Florida, and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 1448.

It has been 10 \ndays since we vowed to track down and bring to justice those who \nassisted, financed, and harbored these terrorists and to treat them as \nterrorists.\n  Today, as the investigation proceeds, I believe it is time we begin \nto look beyond the crisis of September 11. It is time we begin to \ndevelop a long-term response to the continued threat of terrorism.\n  Terrorism ultimately is not a crisis. It is a cancerous condition, a \ncondition that all Americans must come to grips with as we strive to \nreturn to normalcy.\n  Today, with several of my colleagues, I am introducing a pair of \nbills that offer a prescription for the condition of terrorism.\n  The first bill will make changes to a number of laws, including the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, to enhance our ability \nto infiltrate terrorist cells, to collect information necessary to \nguarantee America's security, and to coordinate more effectively our \ndomestic efforts against terrorism.\n  There are four primary goals of this legislation. The first relates \nto data collection to assure that our foreign intelligence should be \nbrought into line with the laws that control domestic law enforcement \nactions. In a number of areas, we have different standards if we are \ncollecting information for domestic law enforcement than when we are \ncollecting analogous information for purposes of foreign intelligence.\n  Second, many regulations have not kept pace with the rapid changes we \nhave seen, particularly in communication technology, and need to be \nupdated.\n  Third, as we saw on September 11, most terrorist acts have both a \ncriminal and an intelligence component. Our foreign intelligence and \ndomestic law enforcement agencies need to be able to share information \nin order to protect our citizens.\n  Fourth, there are some strategic changes we need to make in the laws, \nsuch as better training of our local law enforcement so that they can \nplay their appropriate role in responding to terrorism before the act \nto prevent terrorist actions, as opposed to just, as we are doing now \nat the Pentagon and in New York City, picking up the pieces of the \nconsequences of a terrorist act that has been executed.\n  I emphasize that the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has been \nworking on these proposals for several months. We have worked closely \nwith the appropriate Federal agencies, as well as within the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, the Governmental Affairs Committee, and the Armed \nServices Committee.\n  It is my hope that we will develop a consensus around the proposals \nother Members of Congress may have that the Attorney General has \nrecently submitted. We do not purport that our list is exclusive. We \nthink it represents a well-researched, solid beginning against a very \nserious challenge to our Nation, and we look forward to fully reviewing \nthose recommendations that have been made within the last 72 hours by \nthe Attorney General.\n  I also want to make it clear that I am mindful of the concerns we are \nbeginning to hear from various organizations that we might overreact \nand impinge upon the civil liberties of our people. We would hand the \nultimate victory to terrorists if we were to allow them to coerce our \ngreat Nation into compromising our highest values, personal freedom, \nand civil rights.\n  Madam President, in many ways we are here today much as the country \nwas in the 1920s. It was at that time that America launched a national \ncrusade against organized crime. The Nation committed itself to rooting \nout the corrupt captains of crime who had infiltrated labor unions, run \ngambling operations, trafficked in illegal drugs and, in the course of \ntheir activities, accumulated great wealth and, in many communities, \ngreat political influence.\n\n  We can take pride that over several decades an earlier generation of \nAmerican leaders managed to put many of these domestic enemies behind \nbars and diminish their influence and their corrosive effect on our \nsociety.\n  I take this experience of the 20th century, our ability to begin to \nroll back the influence of organized crime in the United States, as a \nhopeful sign, a sign that we can pass on to our children and our \ngrandchildren a world that has greatly diminished the threat we now \nface from terrorists. It is our hope that these two legislative \nproposals will be a step in that direction.\n  Under our proposal, the President will appoint the Director of the \nNational Office for Combating Terrorism\n\n[[Page S9626]]\n\nsubject to Senate confirmation. This individual will be accountable to \nthe President, to the Congress, and to the Nation.\n  One of the key responsibilities of this new office would be budget \ncoordination to assure that all of the agencies--and there are now as \nmany as 40 agencies that have some piece of antiterrorism activity--are \noperating from a coordinated plan and that resources to carry out their \nportions of the plan are properly coordinated. To do that will require \nthe statutory authority from Congress.\n  Madam President, the second bill has as its objective to assure that \nthe dozens of Federal agencies that have counterterrorism as one of \ntheir missions are working together in a coordinated way to detect and \ndisarm terrorists.\n  There have been over the past several years several independent \ncommissions which have reviewed the issue of terrorism. Two of our \nformer colleagues, Senators Rudman and Hart, have headed one of those \ncommissions. All of those commissions have endorsed the principle of a \nstronger central coordination of the Federal Government's efforts \nagainst terrorism.\n  Just this past week, the General Accounting Office issued yet another \nstudy of this issue. I quote a portion of that General Accounting \nOffice study:\n\n       Key interagency functions are resident in several different \n     organizations, resulting in fragmented leadership and \n     coordination. These circumstances hinder unity of effort and \n     limit accountability. However, the current attention being \n     focused on this issue provides an opportunity to improve the \n     overall leadership and coordination of programs to combat \n     terrorism.\n\n  In other words, we need to assign responsibility to someone who will \nbe the leader of our national effort to make certain that all of the \nagencies are on the field, from the Central Intelligence Agency to the \nFBI, and are following a common set of objectives. I am pleased that \nPresident Bush endorsed this approach in his address to the Nation.\n  The President called, by Executive order, for the creation of a \nposition of homeland defense within the White House. He has assigned \nthat responsibility to the current Governor of Pennsylvania, Tom Ridge.\n  I believe we should build on what the President has recommended by \ngoing a step further and making this position a statutory position.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, in the wake of the tragic events of \nSeptember 11, 2001, it is not with pride exactly, but with a firm \nresolve that I join with my good friend and colleague Senator Bob \nGraham, the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, in \ncosponsoring two important pieces of legislation: Bills to establish \nthe National Office for Combating Terrorism and the Intelligence to \nPrevent Terrorism Act of 2001.\n  While we strive to go on and do the work that the people sent us here \nto do, we cannot help but feel heartsick as a Congress, and I am quite \nsure as individuals, when we consider the unimaginable loss of human \nlife and the magnitude of the destruction wrought by these malicious \nand misguided men. But grieve though we must, it is our solemn \nresponsibility as representatives of the American people to look into \nthis abyss and find the lessons that may be there for us.\n  When a relatively large group of foreign terrorists who had lived and \neven trained in this country carried out a despicable and unfortunately \nwell-choreographed wave of terror attacks months or years in the \nplanning, it cast a harsh light on a range of deficiencies in our \nNation's efforts to combat terrorism. We are made to feel vulnerable by \nthe sheer enormity of the evil and by the realization that any of us \ncould become targets of the next fanatical assault. Our dread might \neven turn to despondency if we consider the agonizing possibility that \nour law enforcement and intelligence establishments might have been \nable to prevent the horror of last Tuesday if they had had adequate \nmechanisms with which to collaborate on strategy, share information, \nand assist in investigation and apprehension of men capable of these \nheinous crimes.\n  Rather than feeling despondent, however, it is our duty as a Congress \nto act. This Nation and this Congress can no longer tolerate a \nsituation in which competing missions of agencies--or competing \npersonalities of public officials--put our citizens and our property at \nrisk. We must create an environment of coordination between the \nintelligence community, our Federal, State, and local law enforcement \nagencies, the military, public health authorities, and all the other \nparties who can play a role in combating terrorism. I believe these two \npieces of legislation, which establish a centralized authority to \ncoordinate the activities and responsibilities of a multifaceted group \nof agencies, and provide both the intelligence community and law \nenforcement with valuable tools to combat terrorism-related crimes, do \njust this.\n  Briefly, the bills introduced today in the Senate would do the \nfollowing:\n  Establish a ``National Office for Combating Terrorism'' to provide a \ngreater level of coordination among the Nation's law enforcement \nestablishment, the intelligence community, the military, public health \nauthorities, and State and local governments to create a coherent, \nfunctional strategy for combating terrorism out of a current system a \nblue-ribbon Presidential Commission has called fragmented, \nuncoordinated, and politically unaccountable.\n  Ensure that terrorism-related intelligence gathered under the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act--FISA--is used to further the overall \nantiterrorism strategy. The legislation clarifies that the Director of \nCentral Intelligence--DCI--is the primary government official \nresponsible for coordination and dissemination of intelligence gathered \nunder, while retaining the FBI as the agency with operational authority \nfor intelligence gathering from foreign nationals.\n  Require law enforcement agencies to share with the DCI any terrorism-\nrelated intelligence information gathered in criminal investigations.\n  Mandate cooperation between the DCI and the Treasury Department to \nroot out and cut off the international money trail terrorists use to \nfinance their activities.\n  Develop training programs for State and local law enforcement \nagencies and public officials to help them detect terrorist activity, \nand to improve their understanding and use of intelligence shared with \nthem.\n  Establish a National Virtual Translation Center to enable \nintelligence information collected anywhere in the world to be \ntransmitted over secure electronic lines, translated and analyzed by \nexperts elsewhere, and shared with relevant law enforcement and \ngovernment personnel throughout this country, as well as by \npolicymakers in Washington and intelligence agents overseas.\n  Make explicit that U.S. Government officers, acting in their official \ncapacity, may recruit any person who has information about terrorist, \nterrorist groups, or those who assist or harbor them--including foreign \ngovernments.\n  The reactions to last week's attacks have ranged from shock, to \nhorror, to sadness, to rage, and now, as I said at the beginning of my \nremarks, to resolve. Just over a week after the worst act of terrorism, \nindeed, the worst crime, in the history of the country, we are united \nas a people behind our President, our armed forces, and our law \nenforcement agencies, resolved to root out and defeat terrorism \nwherever this particular breed of hatred is fostered. Part of that \nresolve may be seen in the package of legislation introduced here \ntoday, although it would be incorrect to characterize this legislation \nas a reaction to the nightmare of September 11. These bills are the \nproduct of a longstanding concern about a lack of coordination between \nour law enforcement and intelligence resources and are the result of \nseveral months of hard work on the part of Chairman Graham, several \nother members of our committee, and Intelligence Committee staff. I \nbelieve these bills represent good first steps.\n  I have not had the privilege of being a member of the Intelligence \nCommittee for very long, but from the very first day I have been \nenormously impressed with the careful balance the committee strikes \nbetween the intelligence gathering needs of this nation, and the civil \nliberties enjoyed by its citizens. However, in this time of heightened \ntension and increased security, I must admit that I share some of the \nconcerns of many Americans, from across the political spectrum, who \nfear that well-meaning reforms may unduly infringe on the liberties we \ncherish.\n\n[[Page S9627]]\n\n  While I am confident that in crafting this legislation Senator Graham \nhas taken those concerns very much to heart and has protected the \nrights of law-abiding Americans, I will closely monitor the progress of \nthis legislation. I cannot overestimate the importance of ensuring that \nin our zeal to prevent another terrorist assault on this Nation we do \nnot contribute to an atmosphere of fear and mistrust of our fellow \ncitizens.\n  I will also be looking for an understanding of these concerns from \nour colleagues on the various committees of referral, and in the Senate \nas a whole. We must commit ourselves and our Nation that, despite the \ngrave seriousness of combating terrorism, we will always safeguard \ncivil liberties as we consider this or any other piece of legislation \nintroduced to combat terrorism. What is needed--and what this package \nof legislation provides--is greater coordination, efficiency, and \neffectiveness among our existing antiterrorism resources, without a \nsurrender of the rights and liberties that make this the greatest \nnation in the history of the world.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself and Mr. Lott):\n  S. 1450.

A bill to provide for the conveyance of certain public land \nin Clark County, Nevada, for use as a shooting range; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I rise today for myself and for Senator \nEnsign to introduce the Clark County Public Shooting Range Conveyance \nAct.\n  Clark County and the Las Vegas Valley have experienced tremendous \npopulation growth over the past decade from about 770,000 in 1990 to \nover 1.4 million people today. This growth has had a tremendous impact \non uses of the outlying public lands, including traditional \nrecreational activities such as hunting, fishing and target shooting. \nThere are literally dozens, if not hundreds, of makeshift shooting \nranges across Las Vegas Valley which pose extreme danger to nearby \nhomes and increasingly busy roads.\n  My bill provides the foundation for the establishment of a world-\nclass shooting range, sports park and firearms training facility by \nconveying 2,880 acres of public land to Clark County. This facility \nwill be used by residents of, and visitors to the Las Vegas Valley for \nrecreation, education, competitive and marksmanship events, and \ntraining related to firearms. Firearms training facilities owned and \noperated by the Metropolitan Police Department and the North Las Vegas \nPolice Department are also being encroached upon by residential and \ncommercial development. Special facilities will be provided at the \nClark County facility to accommodate law enforcement training for \nfirearms qualification and certification.\n  This facility will provide a great public benefit by creating a safe \ncentralized location for this important purpose.

Madam President, it is a privilege to join my colleagues \nSenators Brownback, Leahy, Grassley, and Cantwell in introducing \nimmigration legislation that will enhance our intelligence capabilities \nand improve our border security.\n  These critical functions are an important part of the massive \nchallenges now facing the country in the wake of last week's terrorist \nattacks. These functions are the shared responsibility of the FBI, the \nINS, and the State Department. This legislation will provide U.S. \nconsular officers and the INS, including inspectors at our ports of \nentry, with electronic access to information located within certain FBI \ndatabases, such as the National Crime Information Center's Interstate \nIdentification Index, the Wanted Persons File, and other files \nmaintained by the National Crime Information Center. Electronic access \nto this information will enable the State Department and the INS to act \nimmediately to identify high-risk criminals seeking admission to the \nUnited States or seeking other immigration benefits.\n  Clearly, we must improve the security and intelligence capabilities \nof the Nation. But we must do so without violating the basic rights and \nliberties of the American people. Our legislation includes provisions \nto protect individual privacy. It authorizes the Secretary of State to \ndraft regulations which will appropriately limit the use of the FBI's \ninformation. These regulations will require the information to be \nsafeguarded from unnecessary dissemination, so that it is used only for \nthe purpose of making decisions on the issuance or denial of visas or \nimmigration benefits, and so that its confidentiality will be \nmaintained to protect the privacy rights of those who are the subject \nof the information.\n  These steps are needed now. We must also examine other ideas to \nimprove safety at the Nation's borders and strengthen our overall \nability as much as possible to prevent future terrorist attacks.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 1455. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to regulate \nthe training of aliens to operate jet-propelled aircraft, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I am sure I am not alone in finding that \none of the more disturbing revelations of the investigation into the \nSeptember 11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center and Pentagon is \nthat over half of the hijackers received flight instruction at American \nfacilities. Investigators have named ten separate flying schools across \nthe United States, from California to Oklahoma to Florida, where the \nhijacking suspects may have engaged in flight training in one form or \nanother. In addition, it is believed that one of these suspects was \nable to gain legal entry into the United States through the assistance \nof a flight school that provided immigration documentation.\n  I know that this ironic turn of events, the schools dedicated to the \nsafety of the airline industry were unwittingly utilized to facilitate \nthe worst airline disaster in history, has school administrators and \ninstructors asking themselves, ``What if . . .'' as they look in the \nmirror every morning.\n  We need to take action now to remove the doubts of the instructors as \nwell as restore confidence in student pilots engaged in valid training. \nThat is why I am introducing legislation to require thorough background \nchecks on foreign nationals seeking advanced flight or jet aircraft \ntraining in American flight schools.\n  At present the Federal Aviation Administration FAA, regulates course \ncontent at these schools and does it well, the U.S. has the best \ntraining program in the world and pilot certification from the FAA is \nconsidered the industry ``gold standard.'' That is why a large number \nof foreign students are attracted to American schools. And we want to \ncontinue to encourage foreign participation at our schools, it assures \naviation safety world wide.\n  However, the FAA does not regulate who can participate in pilot \ntraining, be it glider plane basics or 757 advanced training. More \nspecifically, the requirement for foreign students is limited to \ndemonstrated English proficiency and proper immigration documentation.\n  Given the events of September 11, it is imperative that the screening \nprocess for pilot trainees be improved. As such, the legislation I am \nintroducing today mandates the completion of security checks before \nforeign nationals may commence advanced jet training. Specifically, by \nrequiring that the Attorney General carry out background investigations \non individuals seeking such training, the legislation ensures a \ncomprehensive review against records held by such agencies as the FBI, \nINS, and DEA will be carried out prior to starting training on any \nsimulator or jet powered aircraft. Also, given the recent tragedies in \nNew York, Washington DC, and Pennsylvania, all foreign nationals \ncurrently in training would be required to stop until a satisfactory \nbackground check is completed.\n  I want to urge my colleagues to join me in taking this small but \ncritical step to prevent a repeat of unintentionally training those who \nwould terrorize our cities and skies and ask for their support in \nincreasing security requirements for flight training.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/21/senate-section/article/S9631-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 162--PROVIDING FOR MEMBERS ON THE PART OF THE SENATE \nOF THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON PRINTING AND THE JOINT COMMITTEE OF CONGRESS \n                             ON THE LIBRARY\n\n  Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. McConnell) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Madam President, I rise today to introduce a resolution \nto help increase the awareness of tuberous sclerosis or TS. Even though \n1,000,000 people worldwide are affected with this disease, few are even \naware of it.\n  TS is a genetic condition characterized by lesions of the skin and \ncentral nervous system, tumor growth and seizures, and TS is \ntransmitted either through genetic inheritance or as a spontaneous \ngenetic mutation. It is the leading known cause of epilepsy, and may \nalso cause brain, eye or kidney tumors, hydrocephalus, and disfiguring \ngrowths on the skin. At least two children born every day will be \naffected by TS, which affects 1 million people worldwide of all races \nand ethnic groups. Infants and children too often spend their lives \nbeing misdiagnosed, possibly leading to irreparable brain damage, \nKidney failure, and even premature death.\n  Because there is no cure for this disease, early intervention is \nimportant in helping to overcome developmental delays. Passage of this \nimportant resolution will help to raise the importance of early \ndetection and proper treatment of TS; encourage increased funding for \nresearch and treatments; and call upon the National Institutes of \nHealth, NIH, to develop a research plan for TS.\n  For all of the families that are affected by this terrible disease, I \nask that my colleagues support this important legislation. By helping \nAmerica to learn about and understand tuberous sclerosis, we will help \nto improve the quality of life for many Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/21/senate-section/article/S9632-2", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9632-S9633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 70--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE CONGRESS \n          IN SUPPORT OF THE ``NATIONAL WASH AMERICA CAMPAIGN''\n\n  Mr. WARNER (for himself and Mr. Allen) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 70\n\n       Whereas on September 11, 2001, the United States was victim \n     to the worst terrorist attack on American soil, as hi-jacked \n     aircraft were deliberately crashed into the World Trade \n     Center in New York, New York, and the Pentagon outside \n     Washington, D.C.;\n       Whereas the tragic events of September 11, 2001, have \n     inflicted enormous emotional pain on Americans of all ages;\n       Whereas young Americans, who are generally unable to donate \n     blood, help with rescue efforts, or make financial \n     contributions, are nevertheless sharing in the Nation's pain \n     and are especially in need of a way to make a difference and \n     help their country;\n       Whereas four young sister, Ashley, Aubrey, Alyssa and Alana \n     Welsh, from Annandale, Virginia, whose father serves in the \n     military and narrowly avoided the Pentagon disaster, resolved \n     that they could make a difference by holding local car washes \n     to raise funds for the American Red Cross and to ``help wash \n     away the hurt'';\n       Whereas within forty-eight hours the young girls had \n     involved hundreds of others and raised more than $10,000, all \n     in one Northern Virginia community;\n       Whereas there are more than 100,000 schools across the \n     United States, whose teachers, students, and parents are \n     searching for ways to unite and help rebuild the Nation as \n     the Welch sisters have done in their home town;\n       Whereas a National Wash America Campaign has been created \n     with its own Internet site, www.WashAmerica.org, to help \n     other communities launch similar efforts on the weekends of \n     September 22 and 23, September 29, and 30, and October 6 and \n     7, 2001; and\n       Whereas the American Red Cross is designating an account to \n     receive all Wash America funds, giving the children of this \n     campaign the opportunity to participate in one of its largest \n     fund-raising drives ever: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That is is the sense of the Congress that----\n       (1) salutes the young Americans who take part in Wash \n     America events in their communities to help raise funds for \n     the American Red Cross efforts in the wake of the terrorist \n     attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001, and \n     thanks them for doing their part to ``Help Wash Away the \n     Hurt'' across the Nation.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, September 11, 2001 was indeed one of the \nmost tragic days in America's history. While our lives will never be \nthe same, I know that we will be better and stronger as a Nation.\n  Regrettably, these loathsome, cowardly acts of terrorism have deeply \nwounded our country, but they have not, and will never dull, the spirit \nand resolve of the American people. My thoughts and prayers are with \nthose who lost loved ones on that horrific day. My thanks and deep \nappreciation go out to the many thousands who stepped up in the face of \ndanger to assist in the devastating aftermath, and who continued to \nwork tirelessly at the Pentagon, the World Trade Center, and the \nPennsylvania crash site.\n  During this time of crisis it is important that we come together as a \nnation. Thus far, the American people have responded in many different \nways: by donating blood, sending money, even participating in the \nrescue efforts underway in Virginia and New York.\n  But, for one group of people, young Americans, it has been especially \ndifficult for them to find a meaningful outlet for their tremendous \nneed to be involved.\n  That is why I am so proud today to rise in support of four Virginia \nyoungsters, and to introduce a resolution on their behalf that will \nhelp share their remarkable and uplifting story with a country in need \nof such stories.\n  The Welch sisters, Ashley, Aubrey, Alyssa and Alana, might not have \ntheir father, Lt. Col. Tracy Welch, here today had a meeting he was due \nto attend at the Pentagon in the morning of September 11, 2001, not \nbeen postponed.\n  After the cowardly attacks on our country, the Welch sisters, like so \nmany other Americans, went to donate blood. However, because they were \nunderage, they were turned away.\n  Some might have stopped there, but these girls, aged 10-16, were \ndetermined to make a difference. So, in two days, they organized four \nlocal car washes and mobilized approximately one hundred of their \nfriends to help them wash cars by urging their friends to ``Help Wash \nthe Hurt Away.'' At the end of these two days, the Welch Sisters and \ntheir friends raised $10,000 for the American Red Cross. They called \ntheir effort ``Wash America.''\n\n[[Page S9633]]\n\n  The Welch sisters are now taking their effort a step further, \nbelieving that what can be accomplished in two days in Annandale and \nAlexandria, Virginia, can happen in cities and towns and rural areas \nacross this country. Accordingly, they decided to organize three \nconsecutive ``National Wash America Weekends'' to reach out to millions \nof youth in more than 100,000 schools around America and to raise funds \nfor the American Red Cross.\n  Today, they have a Web site, www.washamerica.org. a logo, and \ncompanies pledging support. I am honored that they asked me for support \nin the United States Senate.\n  The resolution I introduce today will support these young Americans' \ndetermination to create three, consecutive ``National Wash America \nweekends.'' This resolution will serve as a vehicle for my colleagues, \nby adding their names as cosponsors, to similarly support Wash America \nevents within their states. And, most important, it salutes every young \nperson in America who is doing his or her part to ``Wash Away the \nHurt.''\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/21/senate-section/article/S9633-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 71--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF OCTOBER 7 \n THROUGH OCTOBER 13, 2001, AS ``NATIONAL MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS WEEK''\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                            S.

Murrah \n     Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, on April 19, \n     1995;\n       Whereas there are numerous Federal programs that help \n     prepare first responders from across the Nation, including \n     the Domestic Preparedness Program and other training and \n     exercise programs administered by the Department of Justice;\n       Whereas there are also domestic preparedness programs \n     administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, \n     which together with the programs of the Department of Justice \n     support State and local first responders with funding, \n     training, equipment acquisition, technical assistance, \n     exercise planning, and execution;\n\n[[Page S9634]]\n\n       Whereas many of the first responders who participate in \n     such programs do so on their own time;\n       Whereas an effective response of local first responders to \n     a terrorist attack saves lives; and\n       Whereas in response to a terrorist attack, first responders \n     are exposed to a high risk of bodily harm and death as the \n     first line of defense of the United States in managing the \n     aftermath of the attack: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) expresses its profound sorrow for the deaths and \n     injuries suffered by first responders as they endeavored to \n     save innocent people in the aftermath of the terrorist \n     attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on \n     September 11, 2001;\n       (2) expresses its deepest sympathies to the families and \n     loved ones of the fallen first responders;\n       (3) honors and commends the first responders who \n     participated in evacuating and rescuing the innocent people \n     in the World Trade Center and the Pentagon after the \n     terrorist attacks;\n       (4) encourages the President to issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to pay respect \n     to the first responder community for their service in the \n     aftermath of the terrorist attacks and their continuing \n     efforts to save lives; and\n       (5) encourages all levels of government to continue to work \n     together to effectively coordinate emergency preparedness by \n     providing the infrastructure, funding, and interagency \n     communication and cooperation necessary to ensure that if an \n     attack occurs, first responders will be as prepared as \n     possible to respond effectively.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, it is with great honor that I introduce \nthis concurrent resolution on behalf of Senator Inhofe, Senator \nSchumer, Senator Clinton, and myself, as well as many other original \nco-sponsors.\n  The resolution expresses Congress' profound sorrow for the loss of \nlife and injuries suffered by ``first responders'' as a result of their \nefforts to save innocent Americans in the aftermath of the World Trade \nCenter, Pentagon and Pennsylvania disasters on September 11, 2001. It \nalso expresses our deepest condolences to the families and loved ones \nof the first responders who will never again return home.\n  Last Tuesday, in New York City and at the Pentagon, law enforcement, \nfirefighters, and emergency medical personnel (first responders) were \nthe first public-service personnel on the scene. If it were not for \ntheir heroic efforts immediately after these attacks, the death toll \nwould be much higher.\n  We also believe that it is important for America to better understand \nthe daily activities and responsibilities of first responders. Our \neveryday well-being, security and safety depend upon first responders' \nofficial duties. In preparation for these tragedies, first responders \naround the country plan, train and exercise for mass-casualty events. \nOur resolution recognizes the hard work and dedication of ``first \nresponder'' personnel and thanks them for the long hours of training \nthat many participate in on their own time.\n  In addition, this resolution recognizes the hard work and dedication \nof first responders after the 1993 World Trade Center and the 1995 \nOklahoma City bombings.\n  First Responders exemplify great courage and patriotism in the \ndarkest of hours and for this we are most grateful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/21/senate-section/article/S9634-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1587.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) increasing dependence on foreign sources of oil causes \n     systemic harm to all sectors of the United States economy, \n     threatens national security, undermines the ability of \n     Federal, State, and local units of government to provide \n     essential services, and jeopardizes the peace, security, and \n     welfare of the American people;\n       (2) dependence on imports of foreign oil was 46 percent in \n     1992, rose to more than 55 percent by the beginning of 2000, \n     and is estimated by the Department of Energy to rise to 65 \n     percent by 2020 unless current policies are altered;\n       (3) even with increased energy efficiency, energy use in \n     the United States is expected to increase 27 percent by 2020;\n       (4) the United States lacks a comprehensive national energy \n     policy and has taken actions that limit the availability and \n     capability of the domestic energy sources of oil and gas, \n     coal, nuclear and hydroelectric;\n       (5) a comprehensive energy strategy must be developed to \n     combat this trend, decrease the United States dependence on \n     imported oil supplies and strengthen our national energy \n     security;\n       (6) this comprehensive strategy must decrease the United \n     States dependence on foreign oil supplies to not more than 50 \n     percent by the year 2011;\n       (7) this comprehensive energy strategy must be multi-\n     faceted and enhance the use of renewable energy resources \n     (including hydroelectric, solar, wind, geothermal and \n     biomass), conserve energy resources (including improving \n     energy efficiencies), and increase domestic supplies of \n     conventional energy resources (including oil, natural gas, \n     coal, and nuclear);\n       (8) conservation efforts and alternative fuels alone will \n     not enable America to meet this goal as conventional energy \n     sources supply 96 percent of America's power at this time; \n     and\n       (9) immediate actions must also be taken to mitigate the \n     economic effects of recent increases in the price of crude \n     oil, natural gas, and electricity and the related impacts on \n     American consumers, including the poor and the elderly.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this division are to protect \n     the energy security of the United States by decreasing \n     America's dependence on foreign oil sources to not more than \n     50 percent by 2010, by enhancing the use of renewable energy \n     resources, conserving energy resources (including improving \n     energy efficiencies), and increasing domestic energy \n     supplies, improving environmental quality by reducing \n     emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases, and \n     mitigating the immediate effect of increases in energy prices \n     on the American consumer, including the poor and the elderly.\n\n   TITLE I--GENERAL PROVISIONS TO PROTECT ENERGY SUPPLY AND SECURITY\n\n     SEC. 4101. CONSULTATION AND REPORT ON FEDERAL AGENCY ACTIONS \n                   AFFECTING DOMESTIC ENERGY SUPPLY.\n\n       Prior to taking or initiating any action that could have a \n     significant adverse effect on the availability or supply of \n     domestic energy resources or on the domestic capability to \n     distribute or transport such resources, the head of a Federal \n     agency proposing or participating in such action shall notify \n     the Secretary of Energy in writing of the nature and scope of \n     the action, the need for such action, the potential effect of \n     such action on energy resource supplies, price, distribution, \n     and transportation, and any alternatives to such action or \n     options to mitigate the effects and shall provide the \n     Secretary of Energy with adequate time to review the proposed \n     action and make recommendations to avoid or minimize the \n     adverse effect of the proposed action. The proposing agency \n     shall consider any such recommendations made by the Secretary \n     of Energy. The Secretary of Energy shall provide an annual \n     report to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of \n     the United States Senate and to the appropriate committees of \n     the House of Representatives on all actions brought to his \n     attention, what mitigation or alternatives, if any, were \n     implemented, and what the short-term, mid-term, and long-term \n     effect of the final action will likely be on domestic energy \n     resource supplies and their development, distribution, or \n     transmission.\n\n     SEC. 4102. ANNUAL REPORT ON UNITED STATES ENERGY \n                   INDEPENDENCE.\n\n       (a) Report.--Beginning on October 1, 2001, and annually \n     thereafter, the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the \n     Secretary of Defense and the heads of other relevant Federal \n     agencies, shall submit a report to the President and Congress \n     which evaluates the progress the United States has made \n     toward obtaining the goal of not more than 50 percent \n     dependence on foreign oil sources by 2010.\n       (b) Alternatives.--The report shall specify legislative or \n     administrative actions that must be implemented to meet this \n     goal and set forth a range of options and alternatives with a \n     benefit/cost analysis for each option or alternative together \n     with an estimate of the contribution each option or \n     alternative could make to reduce foreign oil imports. \n     The Secretary shall solicit information from the public \n     and request information from the Energy Information Agency \n     and other agencies to develop the report. The report shall \n     indicate, in detail, options and alternatives to (1) \n     increase the use of renewable domestic energy sources, \n     including conventional and non-conventional sources such \n     as, but not limited to, increased hydroelectric generation \n     at existing Federal facilities, (2) conserve energy \n     resources, including improving efficiencies and decreasing \n     consumption, and (3) increase domestic production and use \n     of oil, natural gas, nuclear, and coal, including\n\n[[Page S9637]]\n\n     any actions necessary to provide access to, and \n     transportation of, these energy resources.\n       (c) Refinery Capacity.--As part of the reports submitted in \n     2001, 2005, and 2008, the Secretary shall examine and report \n     on the condition of the domestic refinery industry and the \n     extent of domestic storage capacity for various categories of \n     petroleum products and make such recommendations as he \n     believes will enhance domestic capabilities to respond to \n     short-term shortages of various fuels due to climate or \n     supply interruptions and ensure long-term supplies on a \n     reliable and affordable basis.\n       (d) Notification to Congress.--Whenever the Secretary \n     determines that stocks of petroleum products have declined or \n     are anticipated to decline to levels that would jeopardize \n     national security or threaten supply shortages or price \n     increases on a national or regional basis, he shall \n     immediately notify Congress of the situation and shall make \n     such recommendations for administrative or legislative action \n     as he believes are necessary to alleviate the situation.\n\n     SEC. 4103. STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE STUDY AND REPORT.\n\n       The President shall immediately establish an Interagency \n     Panel on the Strategic Petroleum Study (referred to in this \n     section as the ``Panel'') to study oil markets and estimate \n     the extent and frequency of fluctuations in the supply and \n     price of, and demand for crude oil in the future and \n     determine appropriate capacity of and uses for the Strategic \n     Petroleum Reserve. The Panel may recommend changes in \n     existing authorities to strengthen the ability of the \n     Strategic Petroleum Reserve to respond to energy \n     requirements. The Panel shall complete its study and submit a \n     report containing its findings and any recommendations to the \n     President and Congress within 6 months from the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 4104. STUDY OF EXISTING RIGHTS-OF-WAY TO DETERMINE \n                   CAPABILITY TO SUPPORT NEW PIPELINES OR OTHER \n                   TRANSMISSION FACILITIES.\n\n       Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the head of each Federal agency that has authorized a \n     right-of-way across Federal lands for transportation of \n     energy supplies or transmission of electricity shall review \n     each such right-of-way and submit a report to the Secretary \n     of Energy and the Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission whether the right-of-way can be used to support \n     new or additional capacity and what modifications or other \n     changes, if any, would be necessary to accommodate such \n     additional capacity. In performing the review, the head of \n     each agency shall consult with agencies of State or local \n     units of government as appropriate and consider whether \n     safety or other concerns related to current uses might \n     preclude the availability of a right-of-way for additional or \n     new transportation or transmission facilities and shall set \n     forth those considerations in the report.\n\n     SEC. 4105. USE OF FEDERAL FACILITIES.\n\n       (a) The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of the \n     Army shall each inventory all dams, impoundments, and other \n     facilities under their jurisdiction.\n       (b) Based on this inventory and other information, the \n     Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of the Army shall \n     each submit a report to Congress not later than 180 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act. Each report shall--\n       (1) describe, in detail, each facility that is capable, \n     with or without modification, of producing additional \n     hydroelectric power. For each such facility, the report shall \n     state the full potential for the facility to generate \n     hydroelectric power, whether the facility is currently \n     generating hydroelectric power, and the costs to install, \n     upgrade, modify, or take other actions to increase the \n     hydroelectric generating capability of the facility. For each \n     facility that currently has hydroelectric generating \n     equipment, the report shall indicate the condition of such \n     equipment, maintenance requirements, and schedule for any \n     improvements as well as the purposes for which power is \n     generated; and\n       (2) describe what actions are planned or underway to \n     increase hydroelectric production from facilities under his \n     jurisdiction and shall include any recommendations the \n     Secretary deems advisable to increase such production, reduce \n     costs, and improve efficiency at Federal facilities, \n     including, but not limited to, use of lease of power \n     privilege and contracting with non-Federal entities for \n     operation and maintenance.\n\n     SEC. 4106. NUCLEAR GENERATION STUDY.\n\n       The Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission shall \n     submit a report to Congress not later than 180 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act on the state of nuclear power \n     generation and production in the United States and the \n     potential for increasing nuclear generating capacity and \n     production as part of this Nation's energy mix.

LEASING PROGRAM FOR LANDS WITHIN THE ANWR 1002 \n                   AREA.\n\n       (a) Authorization.--Congress hereby authorizes and directs \n     the Secretary, acting through the Bureau of Land Management \n     in consultation with the Fish and Wildlife Service and other \n     appropriate Federal offices and agencies, to take such \n     actions as are necessary to establish and implement a \n     competitive oil and gas leasing program that will result in \n     an environmentally sound program for the exploration, \n     development, and production of the oil and gas resources of \n     the 1002 Area and to administer the provisions of this title \n     through regulations, lease terms, conditions, restrictions, \n     prohibitions, stipulations and other provisions that ensure \n     the oil and gas exploration, development, and production \n     activities on the 1002 Area will result in no significant \n     adverse effect on fish and wildlife, their habitat, \n     subsistence resources, and the environment, and shall require \n     the application of the best commercially available technology \n     for oil and gas exploration, development, and production, on \n     all new exploration, development, and production operations, \n     and whenever practicable, on existing operations, and in a \n     manner to ensure the receipt of fair market value by the \n     public for the mineral resources to be leased.\n       (b) Repeal.--The prohibitions and limitations contained in \n     section 1003 of the Alaska National Interest Lands \n     Conservation Act of 1980 (16 U.S.C. 3143) are hereby \n     repealed.\n       (c) Compatibility.--Congress hereby determines that the oil \n     and gas leasing program and activities authorized by this \n     section in the 1002 Area are compatible with the purposes for \n     which the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was established, \n     and that no further findings or decisions are required to \n     implement this determination.\n       (d) Sole Authority.--This title shall be the sole authority \n     for leasing on the 1002\n\n[[Page S9644]]\n\n     Area: Provided, That nothing in this title shall be deemed to \n     expand or limit State and local regulatory authority.\n       (e) Federal Land.--The 1002 Area shall be considered \n     ``Federal land'' for the purposes of the Federal Oil and Gas \n     Royalty Management Act of 1982.\n       (f) Special Areas.--The Secretary, after consultation with \n     the State of Alaska, City of Kaktovik, and the North Slope \n     Borough, is authorized to designate up to a total of 45,000 \n     acres of the 1002 Area as Special Areas and close such areas \n     to leasing if the Secretary determines that these Special \n     Areas are of such unique character and interest so as to \n     require special management and regulatory protection. The \n     Secretary may, however, permit leasing of all or portions of \n     any Special Areas within the 1002 Area by setting lease terms \n     that limit or condition surface use and occupancy by lessees \n     of such lands but permit the use of horizontal drilling \n     technology from sites on leases located outside the \n     designated Special Areas.\n       (g) Limitation on Closed Areas.--The Secretary's sole \n     authority to close lands within the 1002 Area to oil and gas \n     leasing and to exploration, development, and production is \n     that set forth in this title.\n       (h) Conveyance.--In order to maximize Federal revenues by \n     removing clouds on title of lands and clarifying land \n     ownership patterns within the 1002 Area, the Secretary, \n     notwithstanding the provisions of section 1302(h)(2) of the \n     Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. \n     3192(h)(2)), is authorized and directed to convey (1) to the \n     Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation the surface estate of the lands \n     described in paragraph 2 of Public Land Order 6959, to the \n     extent necessary to fulfill the Corporation's entitlement \n     under section 12 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act \n     (43 U.S.C. 1611), and (2) to the Arctic Slope Regional \n     Corporation the subsurface estate beneath such surface estate \n     pursuant to the August 9, 1983, agreement between the Arctic \n     Slope Regional Corporation and the United States of America.\n\n     SEC. 4504.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Hydroelectric Licensing \n     Process Improvement Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 4722. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) hydroelectric power is an irreplaceable source of \n     clean, economic, renewable energy with the unique capability \n     of supporting reliable electric service while maintaining \n     environmental quality;\n       (2) hydroelectric power is the leading renewable energy \n     resource of the United States;\n       (3) hydroelectric power projects provide multiple benefits \n     to the United States, including recreation, irrigation, flood \n     control, water supply, and fish and wildlife benefits;\n       (4) in the next 15 years, the bulk of all non-Federal \n     hydroelectric power capacity in the United States is due to \n     be relicensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission;\n       (5) the process of licensing hydroelectric projects by the \n     Commission--\n       (A) does not produce optimal decisions, because the \n     agencies that participate in the process are not required to \n     consider the full effects of their mandatory and recommended \n     conditions on a license;\n       (B) is inefficient, in part because agencies do not always \n     submit their mandatory and recommended conditions by a time \n     certain;\n       (C) is burdened by uncoordinated environmental reviews and \n     duplicative permitting authority; and\n       (D) is burdensome for all participants and too often \n     results in litigation; and\n       (6) while the alternative licensing procedures available to \n     applicants for hydroelectric project licenses provide \n     important opportunities for the collaborative resolution of \n     many of the issues in hydroelectric project licensing, those \n     procedures are not appropriate in every case and cannot \n     substitute for statutory reforms of the hydroelectric \n     licensing process.\n\n     SEC. 4723. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this subtitle is to achieve the objective of \n     relicensing hydroelectric power projects to maintain high \n     environmental standards while preserving low cost power by--\n       (1) requiring agencies to consider the full effects of \n     their mandatory and recommended conditions on a hydroelectric \n     power license and to document the consideration of a broad \n     range of factors;\n       (2) requiring the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to \n     impose deadlines by which Federal agencies must submit \n     proposed mandatory and recommended conditions to a license; \n     and\n       (3) making other improvements in the licensing process.\n\n     SEC. 4724.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 was \n     intended to facilitate the work of Federal and State \n     regulators by placing certain constraints on the activities \n     of holding company systems;\n       (2) developments since 1935, including changes in other \n     regulation and in the electric and gas industries, have \n     called into question the continued relevance of the model of \n     regulation established by that Act;\n       (3) there is a continuing need for State regulation in \n     order to ensure the rate protection of utility customers; and\n       (4) limited Federal regulation is necessary to supplement \n     the work of State commissions for the continued rate \n     protection of electric and gas utility customers.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to eliminate unnecessary regulation, yet continue to \n     provide for consumer protection by facilitating existing rate \n     regulatory authority through improved Federal and State \n     commission access to books and records of all companies in \n     a holding company system, to the extent that such \n     information is relevant to rates paid by utility \n     customers, while affording companies the flexibility \n     required to compete in the energy markets; and\n       (2) to address protection of electric and gas utility \n     customers by providing for Federal and State access to books \n     and records of all companies in a holding company system that \n     are relevant to utility rates.\n\n     SEC. 4812.

Mr. President, we have for the most part today been \ndealing with the Defense authorization bill. As a member of the Armed \nServices Committee, it is something we wrestled with for some time. We \nrealize how tight our budget is, and I thought it would be important \nfor those Americans who care about those things, that remnant out \nthere, that we give them some perspective as to where we are, what this \nauthorization bill would mean, and how it would affect our Armed \nForces.\n  In the early 1990s, our defense budget was as high as $326 billion, \nas I recall, well over $300 billion. After the collapse of the Soviet \nUnion, President Bush commenced a decline in that budget. He had \nprojected it out over a certain number of years and then it began to \nflatten out at a fairly substantial rate over $300 billion.\n  What happened was, in our glee over the collapse of the Soviet Union, \nwe allowed that budget to continue downward. We reached as low as $286 \nbillion, I believe, in the mid-1990s, $20 billion more or less than \nformer President Bush had proposed, and as a result we reduced our \npersonnel very rapidly.\n  We had problems in a number of areas funding our budget, and as a \nresult, the military began to suffer. In particular, what suffered was \nour plans to recapitalize defense in America. I am talking about ships \nand planes and equipment that is pretty expensive. We paid the electric \nbills. We trained our men and women in uniform. We paid their salaries. \nWe did the things we needed to do, but as one naval officer said, we \ncreated a bow wave out in front of the ship of increased capitalization \nneeds. So we have been doing that for some years.\n  Gradually, we made a few increases since I have been in the Senate in \nthe last 3 years, an increase in our defense budget, but it has not \nbeen much.\n  President Bush ran on the promise that he would do more for defense. \nHe said, ``Help is on the way.'' We remember that phrase.\n  We do indeed, this year, have a Defense appropriations bill that \nshows the largest increase in probably well over a decade. I know the \nPresident pro tempore is so familiar with these numbers, there is no \nneed for me to recall them for him. We made some progress, and as I \nread this budget, this authorization bill, we will take defense \nspending from $296 billion last year to $328. If you count the \nsupplemental of $6 billion, we have a $35 billion increase in defense, \nwhich amounts to a little over around 10 percent of the budget.\n  I thought we would have more impact, but I have not seen it. It \nstrikes me that presumably the money has gone to do the things we need \nto do. We promised and committed to higher pay and better medical care, \nas we promised our men and women in uniform. They received that, and \nthey are pleased with it. Retention and recruitment and morale is up, \nfor which we can certainly celebrate, but it has left us not nearly as \nmuch as we had hoped we would have to begin to do better about \ncapitalization.\n  For example, it was not too many years ago we were looking for a 600-\nship Navy. We are now down to around 315 ships. We have ships going out \nof service every year because of age and lack of serviceability, and \nthe number of ships coming on are less. So at the present rate, we can \nexpect our fleet to fall well below 300. Maybe that is wise. I doubt \nit. I think we are getting a bit thin. I say that simply to say the \nmoney is not there in this budget to build ships at the rate it needs \nto.\n\n  I served as the ranking member on the Sea Power Subcommittee and \ndealt with those numbers, along with Senator Kennedy, and we did the \nbest we\n\n[[Page S9675]]\n\ncould with the moneys we had to allocate, but we are not where we need \nto be in shipbuilding.\n  So now we find ourselves in a war against terrorism. I think it is \ncausing us to reevaluate what we have done with defense. As a \npercentage of our total gross domestic product, our spending on defense \nis at a low level, certainly since the midpart of the last century. We \nare at a low level in spending as a percentage of the gross domestic \nproduct.\n  I think we can do better. Right now, in short order, we will receive \nthe QDR, the Quadrennial Defense Review, report. That should help us \nplan for the future. I hope it will be a bold and aggressive call for \nreform and change and innovation. I think it will have some of that in \nit, but I am not sure it will go as far as we would like it to go. We \nwill be looking at that.\n  Then the Secretary of Defense is also completing his review, and he \nwill analyze the situation and will make a recommendation to us for a \nreformation of our military, a transformation of our military, so it is \nmore capable of dealing with conflicts of the kind we are discussing \nthis very night, the television commentators are discussing: Are we \nready to fight that kind of war?\n  I believe we need to be sure we are. I do not think it will cost us \nan amount of money that we cannot afford. I am not sure we are where we \nneed to be with regard to transformation to go from a military that was \ncapable and required to defend on the plains of Europe against massive \nattacks by tanks and infantry and troops from the Soviet Union to a \nworld that is much more complex, much more diverse, requiring more \nspeed, more maneuver, more mobility to transport troops around the \ncountry.\n  I salute Senator Levin and Senator John Warner, the ranking \nRepublican on the committee, for working together to reach an accord at \nthis critical time in our country that I can support at this time, and \nthat was not easy. We had some differences of opinion, and when the \nbill came out of committee on a partisan vote, 13-12, we were \ndistressed about that. In the days that have gone by since and after \nthis terrorist attack, I think we all realized it was necessary we \nshould reach an agreement on how to proceed.\n  I believe that was done. I can support this bill as I understand it \ntoday, and we will probably vote next Tuesday. We will have made a step \nin the right direction. Our challenge, of course, with $20 billion more \nin defense, is to confront terrorism around the world.\n  Our distinguished President pro tempore is a student of Roman \nhistory, the best in this Senate, probably one of the best in the \nUnited States. I thought I would share tonight a little bit of Roman \nhistory, Appian's Roman history; as someone referred to me, what the \nRomans did about terrorists.\n  This is the situation they faced: Pirates were developing throughout \nthe Mediterranean. It became unsafe for Roman ships to sail. According \nto Appian, in a very short time these pirates increased in number to \ntens of thousands. They dominated now not only the eastern waters but \nthe whole Mediterranean to the Pillars of Hercules. They now even \nvanquished some of the Roman generals in naval engagements, and among \nothers the praetor of Sicily on the Sicilian coast itself.\n  No sea could be navigated in safety, and land remained untilled for \nwant of commercial intercourse. The city of Rome felt this evil most \nkeenly, her subjects being distressed and herself suffering grievously \nfrom hunger by reason of her own populousness. But it appeared to her \nto be a great and difficult task to destroy so large a force of \nseafaring men scattered everywither on land and sea, with no fixed \npossession to encumber their flight, sallying out from no particular \ncountry or any known places, having no property or anything to call \ntheir own, but only what they might chance to light upon. Thus, the \nunexampled nature of this war, which was subject to no laws and had \nnothing tangible or visible about it, caused perplexity and fear.\n\n       When the Romans could no longer endure the damage or the \n     disgrace they made Gnaeus Pompey, who was then their man of \n     greatest reputation, commander by law for 3 years, with \n     absolute power over the whole sea within the Pillars of \n     Hercules, and of the land of a distance of 400 stades from \n     the coast to coast. They sent letters to all kings, rulers, \n     peoples and cities, they should aid Pompey in all ways. They \n     gave him the power to raise troops and to collect money from \n     the provinces, and they furnished a large Army from their own \n     muster-roll, and all the ships they had, and money to the \n     amount of 6,000 Attic talents--\n\n  Perhaps the President would know how much that was; apparently it was \na lot--\n\n       So great and difficult did they consider the task of \n     overcoming such great forces, dispersed over so wide a sea, \n     hiding easily in so many nooks, retreating quickly and \n     darting out again unexpectedly. Never did any man before \n     Pompey set forth with so great authority conferred upon him \n     by the Romans. He had an Army of 120,000 foot and 4,000 \n     horse, and 270 ships.\n       Pompey, like a king of kings, should move to and fro and \n     stationed his people where he thought best.\n\n  He developed a brilliant scheme to deploy his forces. And he \nastonished all by the rapidity of his movement, the magnitude of his \npreparations, and his formidable reputation, so that the pirates, who \nhad expected to attack him first, or at least to show that the task he \nhad undertaken against him was no easy one, became straightway alarmed, \nabandoned their assaults upon the towns they were besieging, and fled \nto their accustomed peaks and inlets. Thus the sea was cleared by \nPompey forthwith without a fight, and the pirates were everywhere \nsubdued at their several locations.\n  According to Appian's history, whereas it was expected to take 3 \nyears to win this war because they were so united, so determined, and \nso committed, within a matter of days the war was won, 10,000 of the \npirates were killed and the rest surrendered.\n  I don't know and don't expect we can accomplish this much in dealing \nwith our modern-day terrorist pirates, but I like the way they set \nabout to do it. They recognized their nation was threatened and \njeopardized, and when the disgrace could be stood no more, they took \naction to defend their just interest, and did so with a commitment that \nwas total and complete, and they set about it and were successful far \nmore quickly than people thought possible.\n  I don't know if this will occur more quickly than we think possible, \nbut I know one thing: If we commit ourselves to it, just as the Romans, \nwe can succeed. And even though these people move about and seem to \nhave no place they call their own, and are difficult to locate, they \ncan be located, they can be pressured, they can be attacked, and can be \ndefeated. I hope and pray we will succeed in that.\n  I am honored to be a Member of this Senate--not the Roman Senate but \nthis Senate. It is a great Senate, as the Presiding Officer is wont to \nremind us--the greatest since the Roman Senate. I believe, united as we \nare today, we can succeed in eliminating these modern-day terrorists \nwho threaten our world, our prosperity, and our liberty.\n  I am honored to have the opportunity to speak tonight, and I yield \nthe floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/21/senate-section/article/S9675-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9675]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 2001\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.
