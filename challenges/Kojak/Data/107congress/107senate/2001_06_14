On the second vote?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, the issue we are dealing with today is a very \nimportant issue. I had no idea how significant teachers and principals \nand superintendents consider this issue. We have already in the course \nof this legislation approved a historic increase in funding for IDEA. \nThat is going to help schools do a better job of providing specialized \ntraining for students with disabilities to a degree we have never seen \nbefore.\n  In fact, 10 or 15 years ago, when the IDEA matter was settled and \nmade a part of Federal law, Congress agreed to pay 40 percent of the \ncost that would fall on the school system. That agreement was never \nhonored. Congress never appropriated that 40 percent. In fact, we are \ncloser to 10 percent, or even under 10 percent. Now I think we are \naround 15 or 20 percent of that commitment under the legislation that \npassed here. I hope we will be able to fund it. We voted to fully fund \nIDEA. It would be a large increase in funding for school systems.\n  But as I traveled my State, they expressed concern to me. I visited \n20 schools in Alabama recently, and I talked to principals and teachers \nat each one of those schools. They tell me that funding is important. \nThey would like more funding. Many of them know that Congress has not \nfulfilled that agreement. They told me. Their frustration just pours \nout over the Federal regulations that deal with children with \ndisabilities.\n  This is the book that has the regulations in it with which they are \nrequired to comply. Lawyers, experts, testimony, and hearings occur on \na regular basis. It is very difficult for teachers to be able to \nmaintain discipline in their classrooms.\n  Anyone who has talked to teachers in recent years--and perhaps \nforever, but now I think it is more of a problem--knows they are not \nable to maintain the level of discipline in a classroom they would \nlike. As a result, it makes it more difficult for them to reach the \nchildren in the classroom. It makes learning more difficult. We know \nthat in certain nations in the world they have classroom sizes three \ntimes or four times what we have in the United States. Yet they are \nable to maintain discipline. We need to do a better job of maintaining \ndiscipline in the classroom. If you talk to teachers and principals, \nthey will tell you that.\n  One of the greatest irritants to them is the regulation that comes \nout of this book. Teachers have left the profession based on it. They \nare incredibly frustrated. When you talk to them, their frustration \npours out. They cite example after example of circumstances that you \nwould think would not and could not happen but do happen in America. In \nfact, it does happen on a daily basis.\n  We have been thinking about how to improve this. How can we improve \nthe ability of school systems to confront a difficult situation with \ncompassion, with consistency in the classroom so that it is clear that \nno one child can rule the roost, that no one child can just take charge \nand know they can't be disciplined and actually utilize that power to \ndisrupt the classroom?\n\n  We have talked with superintendents. We have talked to national \nleaders. We have talked to lawyers who handle these cases. We have \nproposed an amendment that is modest, that is less strong in some ways \nthan others that have been adopted, but it will go a long way, if not \nall the way, in fixing this problem.\n  This is what happens: A disabled child who is misbehaving is treated \nin an entirely different way than a child who is not a disabled child. \nThey have extraordinary protections that, in effect, make it difficult \nfor discipline to even occur. Lawyers are involved in it to an \nextraordinary degree.\n  Let me read one letter from a special education coordinator who wrote \nabout this problem. We tried to fix some of this in 1997 to improve it, \nbut from what I am hearing in the field from the teachers, we made the \nsituation worse, not better. This special education coordinator writes:\n\n       The restrictions inherent in [the 1997] legislation have \n     the potential to ``cripple'' a school system beyond repair. \n     Although my job is to advocate for students with \n     disabilities, I also feel a responsibility to protect the \n     rights of all children to an appropriate education.\n\n  An elementary school principal writes:\n\n       Today general educators at all grade levels must deal with \n     a large number of these students who are a challenge to \n     manage and instruct. Having to deal with these behaviors and/\n     or to constantly change behavior interventions not only takes \n     away important instructional time from other students, but \n     inadvertently reinforces the disabled children's behavior. \n     All class rules should apply to all students and therefore \n     all students should share the same disciplinary action.\n\n  I have maybe 50 or 60 letters to that effect. Let me read a letter \nfrom one teacher who shared her thoughts on this subject:\n\n       As a special educator for six years I consider myself ``on \n     the front lines'' of the on-going battles that take place on \n     a daily basis in our nation's schools. I strongly believe \n     that part of the ``ammunition'' that fuels these struggles \n     are the ``rights'' guaranteed to certain individuals by IDEA \n     '97.\n\n  Remember this is a special educator.\n\n       The law, though well intentioned, has become one of the \n     single greatest obstacles that educators face in our fight to \n     provide all of our children with a quality education \n     delivered in a safe environment. There are many examples that \n     I can offer first hand. However, let me reiterate that I am a \n     special educator. I have dedicated my life to helping \n     children with special needs. It is my job to study and know \n     the abilities and limitations of such children. I have a \n     bachelor's degree in psychology, a masters degree in special \n     education and a Ph.D. in good ole common sense. No where in \n     my educational process have I been taught a certain few \n     ``disabled'' students should have a ``right'' to endanger the \n     right to an education of all other disabled and nondisabled \n     children. It is nonsense. It is wrong. It is dangerous. It \n     must be stopped. There is no telling how many instructional \n     hours are lost by teachers in dealing with behavior problems. \n     In times of an increasingly competitive global society, it is \n     no wonder American students fall short. Certain children are \n     allowed to remain in the classroom robbing other children of \n     hours that can never be replaced. There is no need to extend \n     the schoolday, no need to extend the school year. If \n     politicians would just make it possible for educators to take \n     back the time that is lost on a daily basis, to contain \n     certain students, there is no doubt we would have better \n     educated students. It is even more frustrating when it is \n     a special education child who knows and boasts ``they \n     can't do anything to me'' and he is placed back in the \n     classroom to disrupt it day after day, week after week.\n\n  And she goes on.\n  There are many other letters. I thought I would share one from a \nstudent. I think it is particularly insightful into the problem with \nwhich we are dealing. We want to give every possible assistance to \nchildren with disabilities, but there are other children in the \nclassroom also. We ought to think about them. Sometimes their very \nlives are at stake. Sometimes their safety is at stake. Sometimes their \ndignity is at stake.\n  This is what this 14-year-old writes. It was sent to me earlier this \nyear:\n\n       I am a 14 year old eighth grader. I have a problem. There \n     is this girl that goes to school with me, she is an ADD \n     student [disabled student]. She has been harassing me for no \n     reason. She has pretty much done everything from breaking my \n     glasses to telling me she is going to kill me. This really \n     bothers me because she is an ADD student and the only \n     punishment she ever gets is a slap on the hand. My principal \n     says there is not much that he can do because of her status \n     as a special ed kid. I asked what would happen if I \n     threatened her back and he told me that I would be suspended \n     from school and forced to stay away. The most she has ever \n     gotten is three days ``in school'' suspension. I think this \n     is wrong. She scares me and I am tired\n\n[[Page S6241]]\n\n     of this. It has been going on for 5 months and it's really \n     getting scary.\n\n  Unfortunately, that is not a rare event. Too often, that is what we \nare seeing today.\n  Our legislation is a realistic attempt to deal with it.\n  What it says is--and this is the core of it--if a child's misbehavior \nin the classroom is unconnected to the disability which they have, then \nthey should be able to be disciplined like any other child in the \nclassroom. We are not creating a permanent set of separate and unequal \ndisciplinary actions in a classroom.\n  If a child has a disability and that disability is connected to their \ndisruptive activity, then we, as a society, have decided we will not \nremove them from the classroom; that it is something they cannot \ncontrol, perhaps, and that we will provide them some form of education, \nwhether it is in that classroom or in an alternative setting.\n  But it is morally wrong and legally indefensible, in my view, to say \nthat a child who has a mobility disability, who sells drugs in a class \nto other students, or who brings a gun to school--and that mobility \ndisability has no connection whatsoever to the misconduct that they act \nout and do--they should not be protected and treated preferentially \nover the other students in the classroom.\n  Let me tell you what I have heard from teachers in my State. I have \ntwo different examples I will share. There are many. Two children in a \ncar bring a gun to a school campus. They did not bring it in the \nclassroom, but it was a clear violation of the rules. It required a \nsuspension from the school. The nondisabled student is suspended from \nschool. The disabled student is not suspended, or is suspended just for \na few days, because they are treated separately.\n  Another example was told to me by teachers where one child sold \nmarijuana to two other children on the school grounds. The seller was a \ndisabled child. The purchasers or receivers were nondisabled children. \nUnder the school rules, they were clearly in violation. The two who \nreceived the drugs were kicked out of school for a period of time. The \none who sold the drugs was not. The teacher asked: How can we look \nthose children in the eye? What kind of moral authority can we expect \nto have if we maintain discipline such as that? Isn't that wrong? It is \nmandated by Federal law, the IDEA regulations that are all over the \ncountry.\n  We want to help children with disabilities, but we do not want to \ncreate a circumstance that frustrates teachers, that undermines \nlearning, and really does not help the child involved.\n  Over and over again, the letters I receive from teachers tell me they \nbelieve it is a bad learning process for a child to believe that they, \nin the classroom, can do things other children cannot. Then when they \nget out into the work world, they are treated like everybody else and \nend up having trouble on the job or with criminal activity.\n  It is a problem we can confront. This legislation says you are \nentitled to a hearing, but if the hearing finds that your bad activity \nwas not directly connected to your disability, then you could be \ntreated for disciplinary purposes like any other child in the \nclassroom. That is only common sense. It surprises me that anyone would \nobject to that.\n  Secondly, we found in the course of working on this matter that a \nnumber of parents are sacrificing to have their children take advantage \nof special schools. There is a great school, Talladega School for the \nBlind, in Alabama where a lot of children go. These are not inexpensive \nschools. Parents sacrifice to send their children there.\n  Under Federal law, the school system must give each disabled child as \nmuch assistance as they can based on their disability.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Torricelli). The Senator's time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this provision would say that if the \nschool system believes an alternative school could help and if the \nparent agrees, if they both agree, they could take their daily \nallowance for funding for that student and allow the parent to apply to \nanother school. I note that the House voted on a tougher bill than this \njust the other day by an overwhelming vote. The time has come to fix \nthis problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Sessions \namendment. I hope our colleagues will consider the alternative Senator \nHarkin has offered. Let me mention that briefly and then put this into \nsome context.\n  The amendment Senator Harkin and I are proposing ensures that \nstudents with disabilities will continue to receive services even if \nthey are suspended or expelled. It retains the noncessation of services \nprovision in current law.\n  It ensures that behavioral supports are available to children so they \nmay continue to learn. We are agreeing with Senator Sessions that a \nuniform policy of discipline for students with or without disabilities \nis appropriate. Where we differ is in the ultimate outcome.\n  Our amendment continues the services while his amendment denies them. \nOur communities will be safer. Our children will become better \ncitizens, if they have the full opportunity to learn. Conversely, \nexpulsion from school with no alternatives will lead some children down \na path where no one wants them to go. That is the alternative.\n  I remind our colleagues of the history of the IDEA and where we have \ncome from in terms of discrimination against those with disabilities. \nWe have made remarkable progress on the road to free our Nation from \nthe stains of discrimination. Discrimination was written into the \nConstitution. We fought a Civil War. Then again in the late 1950s, \nprimarily with the leadership of Dr. King, and then in the early 1960s, \nwe were able to pass landmark legislation that helped, to the extent \nthat laws could, free us from discrimination on the basis of race, \nreligion, national origin, gender discrimination, and discrimination on \nthe basis of disabilities. Hopefully, we are going to free ourselves \nfrom discrimination on sexual orientation as well. It has been a very \ndifficult march. No place has it been more difficult than trying to \nfree the 5 million children who 25 years ago were more often locked in \nclosets, not participating in the educational process. We have moved \nbeyond that; we have proudly gone beyond that.\n\n  We have seen slow but continuing progress. We saw it in 1974-1975, \nwith the leadership at that time of President Ford. We made important \nprogress. It was in response to Supreme Court decisions that recognized \nthat when every State constitution guaranteed education to children, it \ndidn't mean leaving out the disabled, leaving out the handicapped. The \nSupreme Court said we have a responsibility to provide for children who \nhave certain mental and physical challenges. We have embraced that.\n  As we have seen through this debate, we have recognized that many \ncommunities are attempting to deal with this problem. Given the \ncomplexity and the challenges of those disabilities, it is costly for \nmany small communities. I know this is true in every State. Members \nhave talked about small communities that have children with severe \ndisabilities and what the impact has been in terms of taxes in the \ncommunities.\n  What we stated a number of years ago--10 years ago--is that we were \ngoing to at least give the assurance that the Federal Government was \ngoing to provide 40 percent of the help for education. It still is a \nState requirement. Make no mistake about it. If we were not providing \nthe funds, there is still the requirement under the State constitution, \naccording to the Supreme Court. But we said we want to participate.\n  That is what this legislation is about in terms of its focus on needy \nchildren. We are saying that that is a particular challenge for our \ncountry, that the poorest children, locked in rural and urban areas, \nare a special cause of America. We are also saying those children who \nhave disabilities are a special cause.\n  That is one of the most important parts of the bill, and I am going \nto do everything I possibly can to ensure that it comes back from \nconference\n\n[[Page S6242]]\n\nwith the kinds of funding we have guaranteed in this legislation.\n  There has been slow progress in giving assurance to children that \nthey are going to have an opportunity to get a decent education in our \npublic schools.\n  This issue the Senator from Alabama has raised has been before the \nSenate on a number of occasions. The place to deal with it is when we \ndo the reauthorization of the IDEA, which is going to occur next year. \nThat is the appropriate place to deal with it. We haven't had the \nhearings. We haven't conducted the studies. We haven't had review. We \nhave anecdotal evidence the Senator from Alabama has provided to us.\n  Let's take the General Accounting Office. I listened to the Senator \nfrom Alabama talk about various letters. You can get letters on school \nbehavior from any school in the country. Public schools are still the \nsafest place in America for children, and we know the number of \nincidents taking place in public schools generally in any event. You \ncould get 1,000 letters from many cities on kids and their concerns \nabout safety.\n  We have to do something about it. We are trying to do something about \nit. We have included that in the legislation. I will not spend the time \nin reviewing that at this moment, but we have taken many steps to \nensure safer and better education in the community.\n  Let's look at student discipline. In January 2000, just 2 years ago, \nwe adopted new disciplinary procedures for the public schools. Here is \nthe GAO report:\n\n       Nevertheless, responding principals generally regarded \n     their overall special education discipline policy as having a \n     positive or neutral effect on the level of safety and \n     orderliness in their schools.\n\n  That is the GAO. That is not anecdotal. That is not coming here to \nthe Chamber and reading four or five letters from students. That is \nwhat the General Accounting Office said. They are not advocating my \nposition or the position of the Senator from Alabama. They are trying \nto give us the facts, and these are the facts. The facts are not the \nanecdotal message of the Senator from Alabama.\n  That is what is happening out there. Now, you can go through the \nstudy and you will find out that 27 percent of the principals report \nthat a separate discipline policy for special education--20 percent \nreported that the disciplinary procedures for IDEA are burdensome and \ntime consuming. I would like to do something about that, but we are not \ndoing that here on the last 1-hour time distribution on the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act. We ought to be able to do something on it.\n  I would like to get the best people here, the GAO people who wrote \nthat report. I would like to hear their testimony and get their \nrecommendations. I would like to help those schools.\n  But that isn't what this amendment is all about. That is not what \nthis is all about. It is taking children who have, in these instances, \na disciplinary problem--and note the words of art related to their \nparticular disability. In fact, if you knock those children out, we \nknow what happens. It is five or six times as likely that they will \nnever come back to education once they lose that continuing education. \nThose are the statistics. We know what is going to happen. Those \nchildren are gone, out.\n  Now, this is a difficult challenge, but it is a challenge that I \nthink most of us think is worth it. What we have seen, as the Senator \nfrom Iowa pointed out very eloquently last night, is the extraordinary \nroad to progress when local communities and school districts attempt to \ndeal with these issues, with extraordinary kinds of results, incredible \nkinds of reactions. I could spend the time, which I don't have here, \nreading letters that have been written by parents who say their \nchildren have learned how to love because they have a child in the \nclass who has learning disabilities, and we know the problems they \nhave. We have spent time working with those children and other children \nwho come together. Do you want to throw those kids out? Do you want to \nthrow them out because they have had a cigarette outside in the lobby \nwhich was not related to their disability? Throw them out? My goodness. \nIf we are going to have to have a full debate, let's do it, but do it \non the reauthorization. Let's not take the final hours here to throw \nthem out of school. That is what this amendment does, make no mistake \nabout it.\n  This is a basic major retreat, Mr. President, on the march of \nprogress for disabled children. It is unworthy of this body, with the \nprogress that we have made, to go backward. That is where this \namendment takes us. We have a very solid alternative which is \nresponsive to any of the continuing challenges. It has been offered by \nSenator Harkin. Every Member can vote for it with pride and hold their \nhead high. I give assurance to the Senator from Alabama, if he wants to \ndo that next year, he can be our first witness on the reauthorization \nof IDEA. If he wants other people on the panel that sustain his \nposition, we will welcome them, too.\n  Let's not effectively undermine the solid progress that we have made \nfor children in this country over the period of the last 25 years. That \nis what the Sessions amendment does. We should reject it.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. How much time \nremains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has his own time, 15 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to associate myself fully with the \nstatement just made by the chairman of our committee regarding the \namendment I spoke on last night. I intend to speak a few more minutes \nthis morning. First of all, sometimes good things happen, and we ought \nto take notice of them.\n  Apropos of this debate we are having about kids with disabilities in \nschools, there is an article that recently appeared in the Washington \nPost on June 10th. It is a great story of the success of the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act. It is headlined, \n``Autistic Teen in DC School Goes to Head of Class.'' It talks about \n``Lee Alderman, a shy 19-year-old with autism, who will become the \nfirst special education student in the district, and perhaps in the \nmetropolitan area, to graduate as valedictorian of his public high \nschool class.'' This kid with a disability had a lot of problems going \nthrough school. He had the support of IDEA.\n  Mr. President, I talk about that because in these debates we hear \nabout discipline problems and all the things that are happening. We \nforget the hundreds of thousands of success stories that happen because \nof the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, such as the one I \njust mentioned here with Lee Alderman. Yet we pick out a problem in \nthis school or one in that school and we blame the kids with \ndisabilities. I don't know why we continue to do that.\n  I have pointed out many times how I have looked at schools where they \nhave discipline problems, and they get a new principal and institute \nprocedures according to the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct, and their problems go away.\n  The easy thing is always to get a kid with a disability out of the \nclassroom, segregate them. My principal objection to the Sessions \namendment is that it results in segregation--we are going to once again \nturn the clock back to the days when we segregated kids with \ndisabilities, when we took kids from their homes and their communities \nand sent them sometimes halfway across the State to live in an \ninstitution to go to a special school.\n  As I said last night, that is my personal story. My brother, who was \ndeaf, was taken from his home, his community, his family, his friends, \nand sent halfway across the State to a boarding school for the deaf and \nthe dumb, as they called it in those days. He was segregated from his \nfamily, his community, only because he was deaf. Mr. President, I don't \nwant to go back to those days--back to the days when these kids were \nshuffled off to institutions.\n  That is why we passed the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct--to mainstream kids. That is why we passed the Americans with \nDisabilities Act--to say that it is wrong to discriminate against \nanybody, not just on the basis of race, sex, color, creed, national \norigin, but also disability. As a result of this, kids with \ndisabilities have gone to school with their friends and their \nneighbors, kids they know\n\n[[Page S6243]]\n\nand with whom they associate. It has provided opportunities for these \nkids with disabilities. But more than that, it has provided the \nopportunities for kids without disabilities to be intimately associated \nin the classroom with kids who do have disabilities. I believe both \nhave gained from this experience. I don't want to turn the clock back.\n  The Sessions amendment basically would allow that segregation--take \nthe kid out and put him in some segregated setting, without the \nprotections of current law.\n  Under IDEA, the law as it is presently constituted, can a child with \na disability be segregated? The answer is yes. If that child is a \nsafety risk to himself or herself, or to others. And, even if it is a \nmanifestation of their disability, that child can be segregated, but \nonly after a process in which the school has to show that they have \nprovided adequate services for this kid.\n\n  Last night, I gave an example of a child in a classroom. They had a \nTV monitor. He was watching it. The kid was deaf and some of the \neducational materials were put on the television monitor. But there was \nno captioning on it. So this went on, I don't know how long--a couple \nof days. Then the kid started throwing things. Then he started punching \nthe kid next to him and things like that. Well, they kicked him out of \nthe class. But, because of IDEA, there was a process to find out why \nthat child acted out. When they brought in an interpreter, they found \nout the kid was frustrated because he could not understand what was \ngoing on. He was not getting the proper services. Under the Sessions \namendment, that would not happen. That kid could be taken out, if he \ndone something like that, without the protections of current law and \ncould be segregated from that classroom.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for a question on that?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Just one minute. Yes, I will yield, but I may ask for \nmore time if I yield. I would not mind getting into a discussion.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would not want the due process hearing to be \neliminated. I don't intend to do that in the legislation. If there is \nany language there that does that, I will be glad to discuss it with \nthe Senator. I do not believe it does.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, if you look at my amendment, section 2, \nlimitation, in general----\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator's amendment or mine?\n  Mr. HARKIN. My amendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator said mine eliminated a due process hearing. \nI would like for him to say where it does that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Right in ``(2) Limitation.--(A) In General.--'' where you \nsay ``shall receive a free appropriate public education which may be \nprovided in an alternative educational setting.'' My amendment adds the \nwords ``pursuant to Sec 615K'' which does provide that. The Senator's \namendment does not provide that. I ask him to look at that. That is not \nprovided.\n  To me, that was the biggest problem. I have other problems with his \namendment. That is the single biggest problem right there. I point that \nout.\n  Look at my amendment; I put in the words ``pursuant to Sec 615K.''\n  That is one big problem with this amendment. The second problem is \nthe cessation of services, and this is equally as important, perhaps, \nas the segregation.\n  I agree with the Senator from Alabama; if a student with a disability \nviolates a school rule and if that behavior is not related to his \ndisability, that child should be disciplined in the same manner as any \nother child, and IDEA allows for that.\n  Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, let's say a \nchild with a disability is caught smoking in the parking lot and that \nis a violation of school rules but it is not a manifestation of that \nchild's disability. That child can be disciplined just as any other \nchild who was caught smoking in that parking lot. No ifs, ands, or buts \nabout it.\n  Here is the point: They can be disciplined, but the educational \nservices cannot be stopped. We continue the services to this child.\n  Here is the difference between the approach of the Senator from \nAlabama and mine. I do not believe educational services ought to be \nstopped for any child. Two years ago, we had the juvenile justice bill \nbefore the Senate. I offered an amendment at that time, which was \nadopted, which said that if a student with or without a disability was \ndisciplined and was segregated or moved out of the school setting, \neducational services had to be continued.\n  Why is it that if we are going to expel a student, we are just going \nto throw them out on the street? We shift the problem to the streets \nwhen it may be a family problem or it could be a host of reasons why \nthis young person is acting up.\n  The juvenile justice bill continued services for every child, not \njust kids with disabilities, but every child who was disciplined and \nremoved from a school setting continued to receive educational \nservices.\n  My approach was to expand the concept of IDEA to all students. The \napproach of my friend from Alabama is let's take away everything, all \nof the services, even from kids with disabilities. That is the \ndifference in approach. If one believes that a kid with a disability \nwho is caught smoking in the parking lot and is kicked out of school \nbecause that is the school policy ought to be thrown on the street and \nreceive no educational support, no educational services, then that is \nwhat the Sessions amendment does. But if one thinks that child should \ncontinue to receive educational services, that is not contained in his \namendment; he wipes that out. Under IDEA, as the law is constituted \ntoday, that child will continue to get services.\n  Two years ago when I offered this amendment on the juvenile justice \nbill, I had major police and law enforcement agencies of America \nsupporting my amendment because they wanted to continue educational \nservices to these kids.\n  Law enforcement and parents all agree that ceasing services is the \nwrong answer, and yet I point out to my friend from Alabama, under \nparagraph (C) of his amendment, all of these services are ceased. My \namendment leaves the same language as the Senator from Alabama, except \nI say ``except as provided in 612(a)(1)'' which means they continue the \nservices. They can still be kicked out of school, make no mistake about \nit. They can be kicked out, but educational and other services that a \ndisabled child needs will continue.\n\n  I have lived with this now for most of my life. I have lived with \nIDEA for 26 years. It just seems as if every year we get some amendment \nthat comes up to do something about kids with disabilities and \ndiscipline in school. Look, I do not mind, I say to my friend from \nAlabama, if he wants to do something about discipline in schools. I am \nsure there is something we can do about discipline in schools without \nencroaching on local control. But why focus on kids with disabilities? \nWhy pick on the most vulnerable of our society? When we look at all of \nthe school shootings from Columbine to Oregon to Pennsylvania, and I \nthink there was one in Arkansas, not a one of those involved a child \nwith a disability--not one. Yet every time we have something like that \nflare up, there is always an amendment that comes out that goes after \nkids with disabilities. It is not right. It is not fair.\n  We have been through this before. We have been through it time and \ntime again. I repeat for emphasis' sake what the Senator from \nMassachusetts said. We had a GAO study done of this. I wanted to get a \nstudy done to find out whether or not kids in special education were \ngetting special treatment in the schools. Here is what the GAO report \nsaid in January, and I quote:\n\n       Special education students who are involved in serious \n     misconduct are being disciplined in generally a similar \n     manner to regular education students based on information \n     that principals reported to us and our review of the limited \n     extent research.\n\n  That means IDEA is not limiting the ability to discipline children \nwith disabilities. Really, what the Sessions amendment does is, under \nthe guise of discipline, it will allow schools to turn the clock back \nand segregate these kids again. It will allow us to turn the clock back \nand stop services to these kids.\n  As the Senator from Massachusetts said, we know a lot of times \nfamilies with kids with disabilities are struggling. They do not have a \nlot of wherewithal. Kids get kicked out, they get\n\n[[Page S6244]]\n\ndisciplined, families throw up their hands, the kids get thrown on the \nstreets, and they never come back. They do not come back. We all know \nwhat happens then, and we know what happens to them after that. They \nwind up in our jails, in our prisons.\n  We have taken major steps in this country to integrate kids with \ndisabilities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Objection. Five minutes is a bit much at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent for 3 more minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. OK. Three on each side?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I think we should have 3 \nminutes for the opposition to this amendment also.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Sure, that is all right.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Three minutes a side is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as I was saying, we have come a long way, \nand we should not turn the clock back. On this very bill we are \ndiscussing, Senator Hagel and I offered an amendment that fully funds \nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act that we passed 26 years \nago. That is in this bill. It is not an authorization; it is actually \nan appropriation in this bill, and it was adopted unanimously by the \nSenate by voice vote. That means school districts now will have more \nFederal funds coming in to help them provide the services these kids \nneed.\n  Let's not resegregate these kids until we see the outcomes of full \nfunding. We are now going to give the schools the support and the \nfinances they need to make sure they get the appropriate services for \nthese kids with disabilities.\n\n  The amendment I have pending in many ways is similar to the amendment \nof the Senator from Alabama, but it does not segregate and it does not \nstop services. It does allow schools to discipline kids with \ndisabilities, it allows them to even kick them out, but it does not \nallow them to segregate or stop services to the kids with disabilities. \nI think that is a vital, important difference between these two \namendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will take managers' time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama was yielded 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will take that time.\n  Let me respond first to the distinguished Senator from Iowa. I know \nhow deeply he cares about this issue. I understand his concerns. We are \nnot trying to undertake anything that would be detrimental to children \nwith disabilities.\n  I want him to understand clearly that under the example cited about a \nchild who was frustrated because they could not hear the television--\nand some of those things happen--under this amendment I have presented, \nthat child could not be removed without a manifest determination \nhearing, and if in any hearing that would occur it is clearly shown \nthere was a connection between his disability and his behavior, he \ncould not be denied school services.\n  That is the difference between our amendment and the one that passed \nthe House a few weeks ago in May that does not provide for the hearing. \nUnder the House bill that passed by 250 or 40-some-odd votes, they \nwould be treated as any other child for disciplinary purposes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield such time as I may have under this amendment to \nthe Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. For example, it says for disciplinary purposes the \nchildren shall be treated equally.\n\n       ``(2) Limitation.--\n       ``(A) In general.--A child with a disability who is removed \n     from the child's regular educational placement under \n     paragraph (1) shall receive a free appropriate public \n     education which may be provided in an alternative educational \n     setting if the behavior that led to the child's removal is a \n     manifestation of the child's disability, as determined under \n     subparagraphs (B) and (C) of subsection (k)(4).\n       ``(B) Manifestation determination.--The manifestation \n     determination shall be made immediately; if possible, but in \n     no case later than 10 school days after school personnel \n     decide to remove the child with a disability from the child's \n     regular educational placement.\n\n  I wanted to get that straight. I know the Senator cares deeply about \nthat.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I point out to the Senator, in all fairness, the \nparagraph just quoted leaves our ``pursuant to section 615(k)'' of the \nunderlying bill which provides for that due process hearing. That is \nnot in your amendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Our amendment further says:\n\n       (A) Review of manifestation determination.--If the parents \n     or the local educational agency disagree with a manifestation \n     determination under subsection (n)(2), the parents or the \n     agency may request a review of that determination through the \n     procedures described in subsections (f) through (i).\n\n      That is current law, and we provide for the hearing.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Later, after they are kicked out.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The school gets to protect the students until it is \ncomplete, no later than 10 days. I think the school system ought to be \ngiven some deference. The principals and the teachers love children. \nThey care about their school. They want to do the right thing. We have \npounced on them.\n  Why does the disability act come up in the U.S. Congress? Because it \nis a Federal law that is controlling our teachers and principals. When \nthey express concern to us, we should listen.\n  I am pleased to yield 7 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia, Mr. Allen. He was a former Governor and was deeply involved \nin education.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 4 minutes \n23 seconds; the Senator from Iowa has 1\\1/2\\ minutes; and the Senator \nfrom Alabama has 13 minutes 49 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am interested because I thought we had an hour evenly \ndivided at 9 o'clock. I know we went to this a few minutes after 9.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was an additional 6 minutes added by \nunanimous consent.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Sessions amendment \nwhich would properly return the ability to the local schools and \nprincipals to establish and implement uniform discipline policies \napplicable to all children in our States and school districts.\n  I have been listening to a lot of comments back and forth. One of the \nreasons this issue comes back year after year after year is that it is \nan issue in local schools year after year after year and it becomes an \nissue in campaigns.\n  The issue is not whether or not we support IDEA or support education \nand helping those with disabilities. We clearly all agree with that. \nThe issue is whether or not we are going to have a uniform standard of \nconduct applicable to all students within a public school system. That \nis the issue.\n  I was involved in this issue from the first month I came in as \nGovernor of Virginia in 1994 where we had these problems with this \nFederal law. We took the Department of Education to court in \nCommonwealth of Virginia v. Riley. We went to the appellate court and \nprevailed. Then in 1997 our victory for maintaining order and \ndiscipline in our schools was taken away by the action of the House and \nthe Senate.\n  I can promise the Senator from Iowa, the Senator from Massachusetts, \nand the Senator from Alabama that discipline or expulsion is not taken \nlightly in Alabama or Virginia--or I can't imagine in any school. To \naccuse our educators, our States, our school boards of wanting to \nunfairly discriminate against students with disabilities and shirking \ntheir responsibility by unfairly expelling them is unfounded and wrong.\n  It is not a question of a kid smoking a cigarette in the parking lot. \nThe issues are students who set up cocaine rings, sell explosives that \nblow off a child's hand, or bloody another student with brass knuckles. \nIf a child has an epileptic fit and breaks a teacher's\n\n[[Page S6245]]\n\nnose, that is usually a mitigating factor so a child will not be \nexpelled.\n  Here are actual cases in Fairfax County, not too far from here, in \npublic schools. A group of students brought in a loaded 357 magnum \nhandgun. It was recovered in the school building. The non-special-\neducation students were expelled. One student, however, was identified \nas learning disabled due to the student's weakness in written language \nskills. The team reviewed the evaluations and found there was no causal \nrelationship between the student's writing disability and the student's \ninvolvement in the weapons violation. The student was not expelled. \nThat student later bragged to teachers and students at the school that \nhe could not be expelled.\n  In another recent case in Fairfax High School, a student was part of \na gang that was involved in a mob assault on another student. One \nstudent involved in the melee used a meat hook as a weapon. Three of \nthe gang members were expelled; the other two who were special ed \nstudents were not expelled and are still in the school.\n  These are the real situations where there is not an equal or fair \nadministration of standards of conduct in the schools. I think we all \ncare about good school conduct. We want small class sizes, good \nacademics, good assessments, empowerment of parents, and all the rest. \nWhat also is important is a conducive learning environment.\n  We need to trust in and take care to allow the responsibilities for \nmaintaining order and discipline in schools to be where they properly \nbelong and not have a Federal law that really justifies a double \nstandard on discipline for disabled and nondisabled students, despite \nour shared efforts to ensure equal treatment and inclusion into a \nmainstream system.\n  The Sessions amendment would return authority for all students back \nto the States and local schools where it belongs. It is for the \nparents, teachers, and community, not Washington, to know what is best \nfor students. We want to provide students with a safe learning \nenvironment, but we do not need any illogical interference from the \nFederal Government.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the Sessions amendment. I thank \nSenator Sessions for his brave leadership on this issue. I ask Senators \nto stand by your local schoolteachers, stand by your principals, by \nproviding fair and equal standards of conduct for all students, and \nplease support the Sessions amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am absolutely amazed and shocked at the \ncomments of the Senator from Virginia, talking about drugs, guns, and \nbombs. Why didn't they call 911? They can be held and expelled. Now we \nare finding out what this is all about: Guns, drugs, and bombs in \nschools--that disabled children are doing it? Demonstrate it.\n  I give you the General Accounting Office report that says there is no \nsuch thing that is happening. This is not something we are proposing. \nThis is a study on discipline and school behavior. If you can find the \nwords ``guns, bombs, and drugs'' in here, go ahead and find them. It \nreaches entirely different conclusions.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. No, I don't yield. You talk about it, that it comes up \nin campaigns. You bet it does. And we have just heard it, we have just \nseen it. We just heard and understand the reasons.\n  If there is a problem, as the Senator from Alabama says, we don't \nfind it in the General Accounting Office report. Anyone can get \nanecdotal information that there is a problem here and there in some \nschools. But that just doesn't happen. That is not the case. That is \nnot what the General Accounting Office in its report of January of this \nyear stated.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If you have a different conclusion from that, present \nit. But just to say look, there are guns, bombs, and drugs, all these \ndisabled children all over, disrupting, disrupting--we are used to \nthat. We have heard that kind of presentation. That is not what this is \nabout. These children have faced these challenges along the line. This \nis what the General Accounting Office report says.\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have limited time, Senator. I was here last evening \nready to debate it, and I was here earlier ready to debate it.\n  Mr. ALLEN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask for order, Mr. President. Who has the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  This is what it says:\n\n       Special education students who are involved in serious \n     misconduct are being disciplined in generally a similar \n     manner to regular education students, based on the \n     information principals reported to us and our review.\n       [P]rincipals generally rated their school's special \n     education discipline policies . . . as having a positive or \n     neutral effect on the level on [school] safety and \n     orderliness.\n\n  That is what this report, the General Accounting Office report, says:\n\n       Based on our analysis of disciplinary actions and past \n     research, regular education and special education . . . were \n     treated in a similar manner.\n\n  There is the General Accounting Office report. We have, with 1 hour \non the reauthorization of this act, a proposal that is going to take \naway the kind of education support systems the Federal Government pays \nfor--not Virginia pays for but the Federal Government pays for. That is \nthe effect of it.\n  You wanted to wipe that out.\n  The amendment Senator Harkin has introduced is very clear in what it \npermits, what it allows. The amendment says that students with \ndisabilities will continue to have services, even if they are suspended \nor expelled. It retains the noncessation of service provisions in \ncurrent law and ensures that behavioral supports are available to \nchildren so they may continue to learn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his minute and a half.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will take the last minute.\n  We are agreeing with Senator Sessions; a uniform policy for students \nwith or without disabilities is appropriate. Where we differ is in the \nultimate outcome. If you want to change the IDEA law, let's do it when \nwe do reauthorization.\n  I have invited the Senator from Alabama to come to our hearing. I \nwill invite the Senator from Virginia to come and make the \npresentation. But to change this march we have had--not since 1994, but \nmany of us have been here since 1974, at a time when 5 million children \nwere being put in closets and not educated--not 1994, and we know who \nhas been discriminated against--we are not going to march backward.\n  This is a major retreat in providing mainstreaming for the children \nof this country which is not only the right educational policy and the \nright, decent thing to do, but is also commanded to be done by the \nSupreme Court.\n  I hope the amendment of the Senator from Alabama is defeated and the \namendment of the Senator from Iowa is accepted.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I recognize that the issue of educating \nchildren with disabilities is complex. There are many factors to take \ninto consideration as we try to determine the best possible policy to \nmake sure that all children receive a quality education. I have no \ndoubt that this amendment is intended to improve the educational \nopportunities for disabled students, but I have concerns that the \namendment fails to provide protections to make sure that parents of \nchildren with disabilities are not pressured into removing their \nchildren from public schools. If a system of protections were included, \nI would likely support this amendment.\n  Further, this bill is not the appropriate place to resolve this \ncomplicated issue. In view of the fact that this Congress will \nreauthorize the bill that guarantees an education to children with \ndisabilities, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA, I \nbelieve Congress should wait for that opportunity to make significant \nchanges in policy concerning educating disabled children. That will \nallow us to fully debate these important issues, examine the \nalternatives, and come to a clearer understanding of how to best \neducate disabled children in this country. I am voting against this \namendment today,\n\n[[Page S6246]]\n\nbut I look forward to revisiting this issue during the reauthorization \nof the IDEA.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to both \nSenator Sessions' and Senator Harkin's amendments, which attempt to \nreach the goal of helping school districts establish and implement \ndiscipline policies that are consistent for every child in the school \ndistrict.\n  I strongly believe that we do need to come to a resolution in Federal \nlaw that will help school districts appropriately discipline students \nwhen they act out violently or in a way that disrupts the learning of \nother students, but that we should be certain that our actions do not \npunish children for their disabilities.\n  The problem we have, at hand, is that the 1997 IDEA reauthorization, \nas passed and implemented, has developed a separate discipline policy \nfor children in special education, which many school superintendents \nhave found unequal and unfair in their efforts to maintain discipline \nin their schools. In fact, a recent GAO report, published in January of \nthis year, found that while many principals believe that the differing \nschool policies had a neutral effect on their schools, 27 percent of \nprincipals did believe that a separate discipline policy for special \neducation students is unfair to the regular student population.\n  Now, I want to be very clear that my intention is not to go back to \nthe pre-1975 days when students with disabilities were segregated from \nthe regular student population or, even worse, were denied education \nall together. In fact, in the early 1970s, I walked door to door trying \nto figure out why so many children were staying home from school. The \ncensus, at the time, showed that there were 2 million children out of \nschool so the Children's Defense Fund worked to answer the question of \nwhy these children were not in school. While working for the Children's \nDefense Fund, I was one of the researchers who found that approximately \n750,000 of these children were being kept out of school because they \nwere handicapped. This research led to the first-ever report by the \nChildren's Defense Fund, ``Children out of School in America,'' which \nhelped provide solid research to pass the Education for All Handicapped \nChildren Act of 1975.\n  As the Progressive Policy Institute so eloquently concluded in a \nrecent report, thanks to this law ``today many disabled children in \nAmerica have the opportunity to obtain high-quality educational \nexperience tailored to their needs and circumstances, the priorities of \ntheir parents, and the judgements of their teachers.'' This report goes \non, however, to point out that the law has not kept up with the \nchallenges faced by today's schools. Discipline is a primary example. \nWhile IDEA provides protection for disabled students, many believe it \ngoes too far. That, while protecting disabled students, the law may \nunintentionally harm the educational progress of other students in the \nclassroom.\n  Senator Sessions' amendment attempts to fix this problem by \neliminating all due process for children with disabilities who have \ndisciplinary problems. Senator Harkin's amendment, on the other hand, \nattempts to address the problem by encouraging local school districts \nto implement uniform discipline policies while, at the same time, \nrecodifying current IDEA law as it relates to the discipline policy.\n  I oppose these amendments because I do not believe that either \namendment adequately addresses the problem of working toward a uniform \ndiscipline policy that allows school administrators to maintain \ndiscipline so that all children are offered the opportunity to learn \nand are not interrupted due to the actions of one child, while \nprotecting the civil rights of children with disabilities to receive a \nfree and appropriate education.\n  There is much work we need to do on this issue and I believe that we \nshould develop balanced policies that can be part of the discussion and \ndebate during the 2002 reauthorization of IDEA. We need to look for \npolicies that help prevent children with discipline problems from \nunnecessarily being identified as in need of special education. We need \nto ensure that quality alternative educational settings are developed \nfor those students who need alternative placements. And, most \nimportantly, we need to fully fund IDEA so that children with \ndisabilities receive appropriate treatment.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to explain my vote against the \nSessions amendment. I do believe that we need a more uniform standard \nof discipline for disabled students, however, I do not believe that it \nis prudent for the Senate to consider such an important policy matter \nin such a short amount of time. I share several of the Senator's \nconcerns about the need to revisit the discipline language in the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act, but I do not believe the \nreauthorization bill for the Elementary and Secondary Education Act is \nthe appropriate vehicle. The reauthorization of the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act is expected to be considered next year. I \nlook forward to having a fuller debate on this complex issue at that \ntime.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to give an explanation for votes \nthat I made earlier today on the amendment offered by my colleague \nSenator Sessions and the second degree amendment offered by Senator \nHarkins. I voted against these amendments because ultimately I believe \nthat we should consider such proposals when the Senate debates the \nreauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, \nIDEA, next year.\n  I support the provisions in the Harkin amendment that would allow \nStates and local education agencies to establish and implement uniform \npolicies regarding discipline applicable to all children. This would \nallow school personnel to remove students from school for disruptive \nbehavior, if such behavior is determined not to be a manifestation of \nthe student's disability. The amendment further states that school \ndistricts must provide education services to such students in an \nalternative setting. Although I agree with my colleague that schools \nshould strive to uphold such provisions, I believe there may be special \nexemptions to this, such as when a student poses a violent threat to \neducators and other students.\n  I share the concern raised by my colleague from Alabama and have \nvoted in the past to reform discipline provisions to ensure safe and \norderly learning environments. However, such an important issue \ndeserves our full consideration and attention and I believe we should \ndeal with this in the context of IDEA reauthorization so we can have a \nfuller debate and adopt a more comprehensive approach.\n  I look foward to working with both of my esteemed colleagues on these \nand other important elements of the IDEA when it is reauthorized next \nyear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. How much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes 42 seconds.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, in response to some of the remarks by the \nSenator from Massachusetts, let me say this is not an issue about \ntrying to deprive those students with disabilities of an education. \nThis is an issue of standards of conduct. Oh, sure, the Federal \nGovernment does put some money into IDEA, but most of it does come from \nthe taxpayers of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the Commonwealth of \nVirginia, and the State of Alabama. That is the whole issue of the \nHarkin-Hagel amendment in the first place. It has been an unfunded \nmandate.\n  To cite the comments and cast aspersions on my remarks, which were \ntaken from a court decision--these individuals from Richmond City \npublic schools, Fairfax County public schools, were under oath. Just \nbecause a General Accounting Office report doesn't refer to these \nsituations doesn't mean they did not occur. Those individuals presented \nthemselves before a court and swore under oath what happened. There are \nschool records of it. They were subject to cross-examination.\n  For the Senator from Massachusetts to say these are just concocted, \nfalsified stories, unfortunately is not an accurate statement. These \nare incidents that occur time after time.\n  The Senator from Alabama and I are not saying that disabled students \ncause trouble all the time. But it does happen, from students who are \ndisabled\n\n[[Page S6247]]\n\nand students who have no disabilities --they cause problems in schools. \nWe think the standards of conduct should be fair and equal in their \ntreatment, with proper due process and equal protection. That is what \nthe issue is, and no amount of unfair aspersions, raised voices, and \nhistrionics can avoid the facts of what we are trying to do, to \npreserve local autonomy and safe schools as well as equal and fair \ntreatment.\n  I yield whatever time I had.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the school system does treat differently \nstudents who bring drugs and guns to school. There is no doubt about \nthat. I know Senator Harkin feels strongly about this, and Senator \nKennedy does. Senator Harkin and Senator Kennedy opposed, when we had \n74 votes on the juvenile bill, an amendment that simply said if you \nbring a gun to school, you can be treated as any other child for \ndisciplinary purposes. That got 74 votes in this body. It is time to do \nsomething about this.\n  Do we not love children if we simply say a child who acts illegally, \nwho abuses other children, who is sexually aggressive against girls in \nthe classroom, even teachers, who curses teachers in the classroom--\nengaging in that activity, if it is not connected to their disability, \nshould they be protected and given a special status, as they absolutely \nare here?\n  All this amendment says is, if a child has a disability, as Senator \nHarkin used the example, a hearing disability, and that is connected to \ntheir misbehavior, then they cannot be denied services in the school. \nThey can remain there, and they are entitled to a hearing even on \nwhether or not they go to a special classroom.\n  We do not deny hearings. But we are simply saying it is time for the \nschool principals and teachers to be given some respect. It is time for \nschool students, as the 14-year-old about whom I read here, who said \nshe can't respond but she is abused regularly--her glasses are knocked \noff. The girl told her she was going to kill her, and she was afraid to \ngo to school. That child is getting no relief and cannot get it, it \nseems.\n  I believe we have a modest step forward in making progress. \nUnfortunately, the Harkin amendment undermines everything the amendment \nI have offered seeks to do.\n  It is return to the status quo. It is return to the Federal \nGovernment micromanaging school classrooms and discipline problems. It \nis not healthy for America.\n  All we are trying to do is exact some balance. The House passed a \nmuch stronger bill earlier last month with 246 votes. That vote did not \nprovide the kinds of hearings that our bill does. I believe this is the \nright approach. It is time to respond to the educators.\n  Senator Kennedy says the Federal Government is paying for this. We \nknow the Federal Government is not paying for this. We know we are \npaying only a fraction of the cost. It is basically an unfunded Federal \nmandate on local schools in America. They are required to do all of \nthese things.\n  Newsweek had an article on a student who was called ``the meanest kid \nin Alabama.'' He had an aide who went with him from the time he got on \nthe schoolbus until the time he got to class, all through class, and \nthen on the way home on the bus. One day he assaulted the schoolbus \ndriver, and the aide, I think, tried to stop him.\n  Those are the kinds of problems we have created under this law that \nseems to be impossible to deal with. I think the Disabilities Act is a \nhistoric step forward. We want to keep every child in the regular \nclassroom who can possibly be kept there.\n  I have visited schools in Alabama. I have seen schools with children \nin wheelchairs in the classroom. I have seen blind children in the \nclassroom. I think that is wonderful. But if a child in a wheelchair \nsells dope, should they be treated differently from any other child who \nsells dope in school?\n  That is all we are saying. But even then that child would have to \nhave a hearing, and the school would have to show that the action he \nwas being disciplined for was not a result of the disability before he \ncould be removed from the classroom.\n  This is a modest step forward to deal with a problem that is very \nreal for teachers all over this country. If you go into their schools \nand talk to them, you will hear them talk about it. If you have friends \nwho are teachers, ask them about it.\n  There are many actions in this legislation that are unfair and cannot \nbe justified, in my opinion.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand there are 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Virginia if he \nwould please provide to my office these specific examples and the \nschools because I would like to take a look at those. I would like to \nlook at them because, under the 1997 bill that we passed, if you bring \na bomb or a gun or drugs to school, you are out. You are out. So I \nwould like to ask publicly if the Senator from Virginia would provide \nthose to my office so we can take a look at those to see why there is \nthis disagreement. In the 1997 bill, which we passed 98-1 on the Senate \nfloor, if you bring a bomb or drug or guns to school you are out.\n  I say to the Senator from Alabama that I realize he has good \nintentions. All of us want discipline in schools. I brought two kids \nthrough public schools. Of course, we want discipline in our public \nschools. None of us wants our teachers or busdrivers to be subject to \nviolence by kids who may harm them or harm themselves. None of us wants \nthat. We want safe schools.\n  That is why in the process of 26 years we have worked hard on a \nbipartisan basis in the Senate and in the House to fashion and change \nthis legislation so that we meet the needs of those public schools. \nThat is what the 1997 bill was all about. It is working. Let's not turn \nthe clock back and segregate these kids as we did in the past. We have \ncome too far for that. That is what the Sessions amendment does. It \njust segregates these kids.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute thirty-two seconds.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the Harkin amendment does not do the \njob. I urge its defeat. It has the pretense of improving the law, but \nit does not in any way.\n  Under the amendment, the schools would not be free to set uniform \ndiscipline provisions for all students. The double standard that now \nexists would continue to exist. Our amendment does not completely \nremove the double standard, but it makes substantial progress after \nproviding a hearing to that student to ensure they are treated fairly. \nEven if the bad behavior that a school seeks to address in the \nclassroom has no relation to the child's disability, the school would \nbe forced to keep that disruptive or even violent student in the \nclassroom.\n  If a child, for example, were blind, and if there were an excellent \nblind school nearby, the Harkin amendment would deny the school and the \nparent the right to agree--it would take both of them agreeing--to \naccept the average daily allowance for that student and apply that to \nthat school, if the parent wanted to make up the difference and get the \nkind of high-quality education that might not be available in that \nschool.\n  I believe this is a concern for children. I believe it is \ncompassionate in every way. It simply tries to give our beleaguered \nprincipals, teachers, and schools more options to deal with a very real \nproblem.\n  I thank the Chair. I urge defeat of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 802.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 36, nays 64, as follows:\n\n[[Page S6248]]\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 187 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--36\n\n     Akaka\n     Biden\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Collins\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Feingold\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--64\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Conrad\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Johnson\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n  The amendment (No. 802) was rejected.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and I move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, yesterday during rollcall votes 185 and 186, \nI was necessarily absent to attend services in connection with the \npassing of Mrs. Barbara Bailey. Mrs. Bailey was the spouse of the late \nJohn Bailey, the legendary former chairman of both the Connecticut \nState Democratic Party and the Democratic National Committee. She was \nalso the mother of Barbara Kennelly who represented the 1st \nCongressional District of Connecticut from 1983 through 1999. She was a \nremarkable woman and her passing saddens us all.\n  Had I been present for the votes, I would have voted as follows: On \nrollcall vote No. 185, the Domenici amendment as modified, I would have \nvoted ``no.'' On rollcall vote No. 186, the Schumer amendment, I would \nhave voted ``aye.''\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 604, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 4 \nminutes for debate to be followed by a vote on or in relation to the \nSessions amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we have a real problem in education \ntoday. It is a mandate that we know we do not fully fund. We are paying \nabout 10 percent of the cost of IDEA. We ought to be paying 40 percent, \naccording to our agreement. We have voted to increase that funding \nfully now.\n  The next thing we need to do is deal with the Federal regulations \nthat are contained in this book that teachers and principals are having \nto deal with on a daily basis. Most of you have heard from your \nteachers and schools. You know the way we are administering the \nDisabilities Act does not work.\n  My amendment would simply say that a child, after a hearing where it \nis found that they are disruptive or perform an illegal or improper act \nin school that was not a product of their disability, would be treated, \nfor disciplinary purposes, as any other child. That would mean that a \nchild who sold dope, even though they may have a mobility disability, \nwould be treated as any other child that sold drugs in a classroom. I \nthink that is the right approach.\n  The House passed a bill much stronger which said flatout that any \nchild, whether disabled or not, would be treated the same for \ndisciplinary purposes.\n  This is a more modest step, but I believe a good step, in dealing \nwith the problem that we are hearing about from all our teachers. I \nurge passage of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition? The Senator \nfrom Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I know that all Senators--I talked with \nthem in the well--are concerned about discipline in classes. This \nSenator is no different. I put two kids in public schools. We are all \nconcerned about discipline in the classroom. But the Sessions amendment \nis the wrong approach. To segregate kids with disabilities and take \nthem out and put them in a separate setting is not the right thing to \ndo.\n  The Sessions amendment would cease services to these kids with \ndisabilities. That is not the right thing to do. There may be other \nthings we can do to help provide for discipline in the classroom but \nnot to segregate kids with disabilities. That is extreme.\n  Those of us who have lived in families with siblings who were \ndisabled and watched them taken from our families and our communities \nand sent halfway across the State, segregated from their friends, do \nnot want to go back to that. That is what the Sessions amendment does.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time set \naside in the order entered last night from 1 to 2 for morning business \nbe terminated. There will be no morning business if this unanimous \nconsent agreement is agreed to. We want to move along with this bill. I \nhave spoken to the people interested and they have been very courteous \nand have acknowledged it would be better to not do morning business \nthen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nAllen, Bond, and Voinovich be listed as cosponsors of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Is all \ntime yielded back?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding the Senator from \nAlabama wishes to vote----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to table has been made and is not \ndebatable.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding this amendment we just completed--it \ndid not pass on a vote of 50-50. The Senator from Alabama wishes to \nvote on this again. With the consent of the Senator from Alabama and \nthe Senator from Iowa, it would seem it would be in\n\n[[Page S6249]]\n\neveryone's interest that we would schedule a vote at a time certain on \nthe motion to reconsider.\n  My unanimous consent request is it would be after the completion of \nthe work on the amendment of the Senator from North Carolina, which is, \naccording to the order we entered last night, the next to be debated.\n  In short, we will complete the debate on the Helms amendment, vote on \nthat, and immediately go to a vote on the motion of the Senator from \nAlabama, with 1 minute on the side of the Senator from Alabama and 1 \nminute for the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Is there a request before the Senate?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, there is.\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object, I merely want to understand \nwhat the request is.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from West Virginia, if this unanimous \nconsent request is finalized, we are going to go ahead and complete the \ndebate on the amendment offered by the Senator from North Carolina. \nFollowing a vote on that amendment, we would come back and vote again \non the motion that was just made.\n  Mr. BYRD. Why is the Senate voting again on that motion?\n  Mr. REID. Because the Senator from Alabama wishes to have a vote, and \nthe fact is, we have not tabled the motion to reconsider on the initial \nmotion that I made, and the motion the Senator from California made to \ntable.\n  We are trying to enter into this agreement. If that does not work, \nthen the Senator from Alabama is going to suggest the absence of a \nquorum to try to figure a way to get out of that and in the meantime we \nwill waste a lot of time around here.\n  Mr. BYRD. Is the motion to table before the Senate?\n  Mr. REID. It is before the Senate, but it has not been agreed to.\n  Mr. BYRD. Was there a vote in progress on that motion?\n  Mr. REID. No.\n  Mr. BYRD. There was not. So the Chair has not ruled on the motion to \ntable. Therefore, the vote is still to be had, whether it be by voice, \nby division, or by rollcall.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from West Virginia is, as usual, right.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have no objection to the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for Members of the Senate, then, we are \ngoing to now begin debate on the amendment of the Senator from North \nCarolina.\n\n\n                      Amendments Nos. 574 And 648\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of the Helms amendments Nos. 574 and 648.\n  The Senate will be in order. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nfor me to make my remarks from my seat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I believe the pending business has already \nbeen announced by the Chair; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will restate the question, \nplease.\n  Mr. HELMS. Is it my understanding that the amendment became the \npending business by unanimous consent? Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  As the largest and most universally acclaimed youth-serving \norganization in the world, the Boy Scouts of America has led millions \nof young boys to respect and abide by the fundamental virtues of duty \nto God and respect for individual beliefs, loyalty to their country and \nrespect for their country's law, service to others, voluntarism, \ntraining of boys in responsible citizenship, in physical and mental \ndevelopment, and in character development.\n  This came about early in the last century. It was a curious turn of \nevents that brought Scouting to America in the year 1910.\n  The year before, in 1909, a Chicago publisher, William D. Boyce, had \nbeen traveling in Europe.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, may I ask my friend to yield for a moment. \nIt is very difficult to hear the Senator. Would you be willing to hold \nyour microphone because it is very difficult for us to hear your \npresentation.\n  Mr. HELMS. I am delighted. I didn't know anyone wanted to listen to \nit.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Senator Murray and I are hanging on your every word and \nwe want to hear.\n  Mr. HELMS. Does the Chair suggest I start over?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator would like.\n  Mr. HELMS. It was a curious turn of events that brought Scouting to \nAmerica in 1910. The year before that, in 1909, a Chicago publisher, \nWilliam D. Boyce, had been traveling in Europe and got lost in a dense \nfog while he was in London. It was a Scout--not by that name but a \nScout--who came to Boyce's aid and guided him through the fog to his \nhotel. Afterwards, the boy refused a tip from Mr. Boyce explaining that \nas a Scout, he would not and could not take a tip for doing a good \nturn.\n  Since that time, almost a century has elapsed, and the character and \nthe reputation and the admiration that people have for the Boy Scouts \nof America has intensified year after year.\n  Last June, a year ago, the Supreme Court found it essential to uphold \nconstitutional rights of Boy Scouts of America, oddly enough, to abide \nby and practice the Boy Scout moral guidelines for membership and \nleadership, including no obligation to accept homosexuals as Boy Scout \nmembers or leaders.\n  Yet in spite of the Supreme Court's landmark decision, radical \nmilitants continue to attack this respectable organization--the Boy \nScouts of America.\n  Specifically, these militants are pressuring school districts across \nthe country to exclude the Boy Scouts of America from federally funded \npublic school facilities based on what they did in one instance. They \ndecided to press for exclusion of the Boy Scouts from the schools \nbecause the Boy Scouts would not agree to surrender their first \namendment rights and because they would not accept the agenda of the \nradical left.\n  I asked the Congressional Research Service, among others, to inform \nme as to how many school districts have already taken such hostile \naction against the Boy Scouts. The Congressional Research Service \nreported to me that at that time at least nine school districts were \nknown to have attacked the Boy Scouts of America, and, in the majority \nof the cases, they had done so in outright rejection of the Supreme \nCourt's ruling protecting the Boy Scouts' rights, which is now the law \nof the land.\n  Which is precisely why I again decided to offer the amendment \nentitled ``The Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act.'' This pending \namendment--which unanimously passed the House of Representatives--would \nfor once and for all put a complete end to the arrogant treatment being \ndirected by various school districts across this Nation at the Boy \nScouts of America,\n  Specifically, the pending amendment stipulates that if a public \nelementary school, or a public secondary school, discriminates against \nthe Boy Scouts of America--or any other youth group similar to the Boy \nScouts--in providing equal access to school facilities, then that \nschool will be in jeopardy of losing its Federal funds.\n  Now, before opponents work themselves into a frenzy, it may be well \nto make clear on exactly how this proposed amendment would work: it \nstipulates that the Office of Civil Rights within the Department of \nEducation be given statutory authority to investigate any \ndiscriminatory action taken by school authorities against the Boy \nScouts of America.\n  The Office of Civil Rights was established to handle discrimination \nproblems that occur within the public school system. My amendment would \ndirect the Office of Civil Rights to handle cases of discrimination \nagainst the Boy Scouts precisely the same as the Department of \nEducation currently handles other cases of discrimination--barred by \nFederal law and which may result in termination of Federal funds.\n\n[[Page S6250]]\n\n  It should be noted, Mr. President, that according to CRS, \n``historically, the fund termination sanction has been infrequently \nexercised--by the Office of Civil Rights--and most cases are settled at \n. . . the investigative process . . .''. In other words, when the \nOffice of Civil Rights warns a school to get its act together, the \nschool usually listens.\n  Therefore, it is not likely that any school will be in fact ever that \nits funding eliminated; unless it adamantly refuses to provide the Boy \nScouts of America equal access to school facilities.\n  It will not be handled willy-nilly. It will be based on specific \nevidence.\n  Needless to say, I do hope that the Senate will uphold the \nconstitutional rights of the Boy Scouts of America to have equal access \nto school facilities.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi, the Republican \nleader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the manager in opposition to this \namendment for allowing me to go ahead and speak now. Ordinarily, we \nmake a real point to go back and forth. So I appreciate that. I will be \nbrief and to the point.\n  I rise in support of this amendment. I think it is an amendment that \nshould basically be accepted by all of us. I don't know quite how to \nreact to the fact that in America even the Boy Scouts seem to be under \nattack. Is motherhood and apple pie next? Is there nothing sacred \nanymore?\n  I don't have a conflict of interest. I came from such a small, rural, \npoor area that we didn't even have a Boy Scout troop. I was a Cub \nScout. Somehow or other we managed to have a Cub Scout troop. I enjoyed \nthat. I never got to be a Weeblo or a Boy Scout. I missed it.\n  I have been very supportive of the Boy Scouts, and I have attended \nEagle Scout ceremonies. I have been to Boy Scouts events that \nrecognized great Americans who started off as Scouts--such as Jerry \nFord when he got a special recognition.\n  It is not as if I am defending something from which I directly \nbenefited. But, quite frankly, I think we all benefit from \norganizations such as the Boy Scouts. Their fundamental principles are \nrooted in basic good things such as duty to God and respect for \nindividual beliefs, loyalty to one's country and respect for its laws, \nservice to others, voluntarism, and training of youth in responsible \ncitizenship, in physical and mental development, and in character \nadvancement.\n  These are all such fine goals. I have watched this organization \ntransform young men's lives, as the Girl Scouts with girls. They have \ngiven them an opportunity to help themselves, to support causes bigger \nthan themselves as the saying goes now, and to improve their community \nby involvement.\n  I think in no way should we diminish the importance of that, or take \naway what they do for boys and girls of all races and ethnic and \nreligious backgrounds.\n  Now what does this amendment do? The title is the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica Equal Access Act. It sounds good to me. I assume there are \ngoing to be those who say this is something we shouldn't do or it gives \nthem some advantage. But all it says is that if a public elementary \nschool or public secondary school has a designated open forum, then \nthat school cannot discriminate against the Boy Scouts of America or \nany youth group on the basis of its membership or leadership criteria \nor on the basis of its oath of allegiance to God and country.\n  If a public school did discriminate against the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica, then that school would be in jeopardy of losing its Federal \neducation funds.\n  I know the Supreme Court rendered a decision recently saying a \nreligious group could have time and access to space at a school if all \nother groups have access. You do not have to attend, but if you are \ngoing to have an open policy, then you have to let everybody have an \nopportunity to have access to the space in the school. This is a very \nmeritorious and I think very defensible position to have.\n  The Boy Scouts have become the largest voluntary youth movement in \nthe world with a worldwide membership totaling more than 25 million. \nOver 6 million of those participants come from the United States alone.\n  There have been a series of decisions in the courts that I think \nrelate to this. The U.S. Supreme Court held in Boy Scouts v. Dale that \nthe Boy Scouts are a private organization and, as such, they can decide \nwho can be in their organization if they wish.\n  There was a decision recently involving the Boy Scouts in the U.S. \ndistrict court in Florida which said that Broward County could not \nevict Scouts off school property.\n  So there are decisions at the district court level and from the \nSupreme Court affecting this. But of the attacks on the Boy Scouts, \nsome people would say it is no real problem. It is having an impact. \nBased on the Boy Scouts' stand on their principles, eight of the United \nWay agencies nationwide have withdrawn their financial support from the \nBoy Scouts of America. We have seen that there have been some 359 \nschool districts which have severed sponsorships with the Scouts since \nlast June's ruling.\n  So it is affecting the Boy Scouts in terms of financial support, and \nit is affecting them in that schools are beginning to prohibit Boy \nScouts from being able to have sponsorships and meet in their schools.\n  So clearly it is having an effect. We have reached the point now \nwhere when a Boy Scout troop comes out--four or five boys; or girls who \nare Girl Scouts--they get booed because they are there during the \nPledge of Allegiance. Surely, we cannot reach that kind of ugliness in \nAmerica.\n  So I think it is very important that we have this amendment added. It \nwould require that public schools treat the Boy Scouts of America \nexactly the same as they do all other groups meeting in the schools; \nthat is all. Surely, the least we can do is to allow them to have equal \naccess.\n  So while there may be some wringing of hands and assertions of what \nthis amendment does way beyond what it does, or its intent, they just \nwant to be treated the same as everybody else --nothing more, nothing \nless.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I do want to be heard on this issue. But \nin fairness to the other side, I would like to defer so long as I can \nfollow the Senator, in this order, because of a timing problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Perhaps I could make a quick unanimous consent request. I \nam going to speak for 2 minutes and then ask Senator Murray if she \nwould really open the debate with about--how many minutes does the \nSenator need?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Ten minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. And then go to Senator Inhofe.\n  Is that acceptable?\n  Mr. INHOFE. That would be fine.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that be the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Republican leader for making \nhis remarks concise. I do really appreciate the opportunity given to me \nby Senator Kennedy to manage the opposition to this amendment. The \nreason I feel very strongly about it is that this amendment is not \nabout the Boy Scouts. My kids were Scouts. I will never forget that. \nThey are really old now. I am a grandmother now. But I remember when \nthey were in their uniforms. My kids were Scouts.\n  This amendment is not about Scouts because the Supreme Court has \nalready ruled that the Boy Scouts have the absolute right to take their \nprograms into the public schools. That issue has been resolved.\n  So I believe--and I am going to reserve my time, and I will explain \nwhy I have reached this conclusion--that this amendment is unnecessary; \nthat it is gratuitous. It is hurtful to a group of people. It divides \nus again as a country. It brings in this Chamber an issue that divides \nus, that hurts people, and I believe--and Senator Murray is going to\n\n[[Page S6251]]\n\nspeak to us as a former school board member with a tremendous amount of \nauthority on this--it is a slap at local control, something my friends \non the other side of the aisle revere.\n  So I hope in the course of this debate--and I know we go uphill when \nthis comes up--we face the facts of what this is about. I hope, in the \ncourse of debate, people will look inside their hearts to decide what \nthis amendment is really about. It is not about the Boy Scouts having \nthe ability to meet in public schools. That has been determined. It is \nabout hurting a whole group of people, a minority in this country, for \nabsolutely no good reason.\n  I hope people will have the courage to come to this Chamber, to speak \nout, to be heard, to lift up this debate, and that we will have a good \nvote against this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to my friend and colleague from \nWashington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from California for \nyielding me time.\n  Mr. President, I believe that Scouting--whether it is the Boy Scouts \nor Girl Scouts--really can help kids develop their character and build \nimportant skills. And that is important. In fact, Scouting has been an \nimportant part of my life and my own children's lives.\n  I was a Brownie. I was a Junior Girl Scout. I was a Girl Scout. I was \na Brownie Leader. I was a Girl Scout Leader. And, in fact, I was even a \nBoy Scout Leader for my son's troop. So I know about Scouting. This \namendment is not about scouting.\n  This amendment is about imposing a Federal mandate on local schools \nthat could essentially overwhelm their facilities and strain their \nability to meet their first responsibility, which I believe we all \nunderstand is to educate our students.\n  The Helms amendment essentially takes a problem that does not exist \nand uses it to dictate the decisions that local school boards make.\n  There are several problems with this amendment, but first and \nforemost, it really is not needed, as the Senator from California said. \nRight now, under Federal law, Scouts receive the same protection and \naccess as any other group--nothing more, nothing less--and that is the \nway it should be. And that is not just my opinion; it is our Federal \nlaw, known as the Equal Access Act.\n  Let me read to you part of that statute. It says:\n\n       It shall be unlawful for any public secondary school which \n     receives Federal financial assistance and which has a limited \n     open forum to deny access for a fair opportunity to, or [to] \n     discriminate against, any students wishing to conduct a \n     meeting within that limited open forum on the basis of the \n     religious, political, philosophical or other content of the \n     speech at such meetings.\n\n  That is the law right now--on the books in black and white. So this \namendment is unnecessary because current Federal law already requires \nequal access. Not only do groups such as the Boy Scouts already have \naccess under Federal law, the courts are reaffirming that access.\n  In fact, just this last Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a \nNew York State school had to let a religious organization use its \nfacilities since it was already allowing nonreligious organizations to \ndo the same thing.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a Washington Post \narticle which explains this ruling printed in the Record after my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Equal access is already in the law. It was just upheld \nby the U.S. Supreme Court. Groups such as Scouts have equal access. \nTherefore, this amendment is not about the question of equal access. \nThis amendment, however, is about special access. Frankly, we ought to \ncall this proposal the ``unequal access amendment'' because it selects \none group over all others for special protection.\n  There is a second problem with the amendment. I served on a local \nschool board. I know what it is to have limited meeting space in a \nschool and to have organizations that want to use that space who come \nbefore you and beg and plead for that ability. Right now schools make \nthose decisions based on their own circumstances within the law. \nSchools might not have enough space. They might not have the budget for \nthe extra cleanup required for groups to use these facilities or \nadditional groups to use them. They might not have the staff to lock up \nthe building after hours. Teachers might not have the time in the \nschoolday to rearrange their classrooms. Maybe there are only a few \nrooms available after school and they are already needed for other \nthings such as tutoring or they have already been given to another \ngroup. There might be insurance or liability concerns.\n  Because of all those variables that local school boards have to live \nwith on a weekly basis, those decisions are made at the local level. \nSometimes those local policies keep schools from having to pick one \ngroup over the other, from picking winners or losers.\n  The Helms amendment would overrule all of those local policies, all \nof those local decisions, and pick one winner and require every school \nto accommodate them or risk losing their Federal funding.\n  Scouts already have the same protections as similar organizations, \nand local schools already make good legal decisions based on those \ncircumstances.\n  Before I close, I note that I am eager to see how some of my \ncolleagues vote on this amendment which, as I have noted, is not about \nScouting. It is about forcing decisions on local schools. In recent \nyears some of my colleagues have spoken at great length about the \nimportance of local control in educational decisions. Of course, having \nserved on a local school board, I reminded them that most decisions are \nmade at the local level and that there is a limited Federal role for \nefforts such as helping disadvantaged students and reaching national \neducational goals. Frankly, I do not see how setting up a special \nnational privilege for just one organization falls in that role.\n  Recently on the Senate floor my amendment to reduce school \novercrowding was defeated on a party-line vote. Opponents on the other \nside said those decisions should be made at the local level. They \nignored the fact that funding was optional and flexible, meaning it \ncould be used for class size reduction or teacher training or \nrecruitment. Opponents of my amendment said local control was more \nimportant than an effective, targeted, flexible initiative.\n  Now we get to see if all those Members will stand up to the \nprinciples they have advocated. This Helms amendment is far more \nintrusive. It is not optional. Unlike my amendment, the Helms amendment \nhas nothing to do with schoolday learning. It is definitely a Federal \nmandate on local schools. It definitely takes decisions out of local \nhands. Frankly, I do not see how anyone who has called for more local \ncontrol will support this Helms amendment. This vote will be very \ntelling.\n  The Helms amendment addresses a problem that does not exist. Groups \nsuch as the Scouts already have equal access through existing law. \nInstead, this intrusive amendment provides special, unequal access for \njust one group and overrules what is happening at the local level.\n  I will share with my colleagues how frustrating and difficult it can \nbe, as a school board member, to make decisions about who can use your \nfacilities. I have been in front of many parents who were unhappy with \ndecisions that school boards have made. This Helms amendment may well \nforce a school board to tell a group, perhaps a church group that is \nalready using their gym, that because of the Helms amendment and fear \nof a lawsuit, if they don't change their mind, we will have to override \nfacilities use by that group. This amendment may well force a school to \ntell another group that because of our Federal law, the Boy Scouts come \nin first.\n  I care about Scouting. I want our Scouts to have facilities. I want \nit to be under equal access, not special protection. That is what the \nHelms amendment does.\n  I thank my colleague from California and yield back my time to her.\n\n[[Page S6252]]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Washington Post, June 1, 2001]\n\n                       Justices Back Bible Group\n\n\n                  access to school facilities widened\n\n                           (By Charles Lane)\n\n       The Supreme Court ruled yesterday that a New York state \n     school may not prohibit an evangelical Christian children's \n     club from meeting on its premises, a decision that may have \n     cleared the last legal obstacles to religious groups' long-\n     sought goal of having the same access to school facilities as \n     other organizations.\n       By a vote of 6 to 3, the court held that the Milford \n     Central School's effort to deny the after-school use of its \n     building to the Good News Club, but not to other, \n     nonreligious groups, was a form of discrimination on the \n     basis of religious viewpoint, and thus violated the \n     constitutional guarantee of free speech.\n       The Good News Club, which operates thousands of chapters \n     around the country, urges children as young as 6 to accept \n     Jesus Christ as a personal savior. The school argued that, in \n     barring the club from meeting there, it was following a New \n     York law designed to avert any appearance of official \n     sponsorship of religious worship and to protect children from \n     getting the impression that the school endorses a particular \n     religion.\n       But the court rejected the notion that the club's use of \n     the school would create a kind of pro-religious pressure on \n     children, noting that children could not attend the club's \n     meetings unless their parents approved.\n       ``[W]e cannot say the danger the children would misperceive \n     the endorsement of religion is any greater than the danger \n     that they would perceive a hostility toward the religious \n     viewpoint if the Club were excluded,'' Justice Clarence \n     Thomas said in the opinion he wrote for the court.\n       Conservative legal scholars noted that the case fits into a \n     recent trend in which the court has adopted a more \n     accommodating position toward religion in public places when \n     it believes that it is merely maintaining a fair balance \n     between religious and secular activity. That could mean \n     future support for President Bush's ``faith-based'' social \n     services initiative, or for school vouchers, they said.\n       ``It will be much harder for anyone to argue that a faith-\n     based organization's social service treatment program has \n     crossed a line, becoming, in essence, `too religious,' '' \n     said Douglas Kmiec, dean of the Catholic University law \n     school.\n       But Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for \n     Separation of Church and State, said the decision maintains a \n     distinction between state support for religious instruction \n     and extracurricular religious activity, and therefore ``has \n     no spillover into the voucher area.''\n       Of the 4,622 Good News Club chapters around the country, \n     about 527 meet regularly in public school buildings. \n     Supporters of the group said the ruling gives a significant \n     boost to the club and others like it.\n       ``It's no secret that it helps them attract children when \n     they meet in a more convenient location,'' said Gregory S. \n     Baylor of Annandale-based Religious Liberty Advocates, which \n     filed a friend of the court brief on behalf of Good News's \n     parent organization, the Child Evangelism Fellowship Inc. \n     ``Prior to this, a lot of school districts were nervous about \n     letting them in. Now I can say, `Read the Supreme Court \n     case.' ''\n       Opponents agree with this forecast, but they said it shows \n     how the court has titled the church-state balance in favor of \n     religion.\n       ``This is really religious worship directed at young \n     children,'' said Jeffrey R. Babbin, an attorney who filed a \n     friend of the court brief on behalf of the Anti-Defamation \n     League of B'nai B'rith, which backed the school. ``Our \n     concern is that what can't be done in school shouldn't be \n     done right after. Often kids can't go home right after \n     school.''\n       The case began in 1996 when two parents, the Rev. Stephen \n     D. Fournier and his wife, Darleen, sought to move the \n     meetings of their Good News Club chapter from a local church \n     to Milford's only school building, which houses all classes \n     from kindergarten through 12th grade.\n       School authorities in the 3,000-resident rural community \n     refused, saying that the Good News Club was not simply a \n     discussion group that talked about morals from a religious \n     viewpoint, but a form of religious instruction.\n       The Good News Club's sponsoring organization, the Child \n     Evangelism Fellowship, based in Warrenton, Mo., says that its \n     purpose is to ``evangelize boys and girls with the Gospel of \n     the Lord Jesus Christ and to establish (disciple) them in the \n     Word of God and in a local church for Christian living.''\n       Good News Club meetings revolve around prayer, songs, \n     stories and games drawn from the Bible, and some of the \n     children attending are ``challenged'' to declare Jesus Christ \n     as their savior.\n       The Fourniers sued in federal court. The New York-based \n     appeals court sided with the school, but because its ruling \n     clashed with a St. Louis-based appeals court's decision in \n     favor of access for another Good News Club, the Supreme Court \n     agreed last year to decide the dispute.\n       In the court opinion yesterday, Thomas said that this case \n     was essentially no different from previous ones in which the \n     court had upheld the right of a Christian parents' group to \n     show a film at a public high school in the evening and of \n     Christian students at the University of Virginia to receive \n     the same funding for their publication as other groups.\n       When the state operates a ``limited public forum'' in which \n     citizens may express their views, Thomas wrote, ``speech \n     discussing otherwise permissible subjects cannot be excluded \n     . . . on the ground that the subject is discussed from a \n     religious viewpoint.''\n       Thomas was joined by the court's other conservative-leaning \n     members--Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices \n     Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy. \n     He also picked up the vote of Justice Stephen G. Breyer, a \n     liberal, who wrote a separate opinion to emphasize that he \n     supported the club's position only insofar as it was asking \n     for nondiscrimination by the school. He said important issues \n     remained to be examined, especially whether a reasonable \n     child might indeed see the club's presence at the school as \n     an endorsement of religion.\n       Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter and Ruth Bader \n     Ginsburg dissented.\n       ``It is beyond question that Good News intends to use the \n     public school premises not for the mere discussion of a \n     subject from a particular, Christian point of view, but for \n     an evangelical service of worship calling children to commit \n     themselves in an act of Christian conversion,'' Souter wrote.\n       The case is Good News Club v. Milford Central School, No. \n     99-2036.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nOklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I know the distinguished Senator from \nWashington is very sincere in her remarks, but I believe there is a \nproblem in insisting that we are legislating on a situation that \ndoesn't exist. I will point out examples of that.\n  When Senator Helms first started, his microphone wasn't quite on high \nenough and we were not able to hear his remarks. I will repeat the \nfirst couple of things he said. He talked about the Boy Scout movement \nin our Nation as being part of the largest voluntary youth movement in \nthe world, with U.S. membership totaling over 6 million. He also \nmentioned the three basic fundamental principles.\n  The fundamental principles of the Boy Scouts include, one, a duty to \nGod and respect for individual beliefs; two, loyalty to country and \nrespect for the laws of the land, service to others, and a spirit of \nvoluntarism; and, three, the training of youth in responsible \ncitizenship, physical and mental development, and character \nadvancement.\n  As a private organization, the Boy Scouts of America has the right to \nselect persons it believes will provide the leadership that measures up \nto the high caliber of standards of this fine institution. Boy Scouts \nand other similar groups have a constitutional right to associate \nfreely, and our publicly funded schools should not inhibit that right \nof access to public school facilities.\n  Not only is this my opinion; it has been found to be the law of the \nland by the Supreme Court. In June of last year--this has been alluded \nto--in Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, the Supreme Court ruled that Boy \nScouts have the constitutional right to specifically exclude homosexual \nmembers and leaders. The Helms amendment was prompted by the denial of \npublic school access to groups such as the Boy Scouts even after this \nSupreme Court decision.\n  For example, the Broward County school board voted to keep Boy Scouts \nfrom using public schools to hold meetings, in direct violation of the \nSupreme Court's decision. Luckily, in the Boy Scouts v. School Board of \nBroward County, in March of this year, the U.S. district court in \nFlorida issued an injunction to block the county's attempt to evict the \nScouts from public school property.\n  Unfortunately, this is not an isolated case. This is why I make the \npoint that there is a problem out there. The Congressional Research \nService, which Senator Helms alluded to, has reported that at least \nnine school districts have publicly attacked Boy Scouts, which is in \ndirect contradiction of the ruling of the Supreme Court.\n  Let me give a couple examples of this. In Chapel Hill, NC, the Chapel \nHill-Carrboro school board voted, on January 11, 2001, to give Scouts \nuntil June to either go against the rules of their organization or lose \ntheir sponsorship and meeting places in schools. In New York City, the \nNew York City school chancellor, Harold Levy, said the school system \nwould not enter into any new contracts with the Boy Scouts of America. \nThis is something that happened after that Supreme Court decision. The \nLos Angeles City Council has ``directed all of the city's departments \nto review contracts with Boy\n\n[[Page S6253]]\n\nScouts and order an audit of those contracts to ensure compliance with \na nondiscrimination clause.''\n  In Madison, WI, it is the same thing. It goes on and on--quite a \nlengthy list.\n  The repetitive, hostile actions taken against the Boy Scouts are \ninexcusable and against the law and should be stopped immediately.\n  The Helms amendment reinforces the constitutional rights of Boy \nScouts and the Supreme Court decision upholding those rights. This \namendment states that if a public school has designated ``open forum,'' \nthen the school cannot discriminate against Boy Scouts of America or \nany youth group on the basis of its membership or leadership criteria \nor on the basis of its oath of allegiance to God and country.\n  The oversight provisions of the amendment ensure that the Office of \nCivil Rights within the Department of Education will protect the Boy \nScouts as it protects other groups that have been or are discriminated \nagainst. We are talking about antidiscrimination in this amendment.\n  The amendment proposes that any public school receiving Federal \nfunding from the Department of Education must allow the Boy Scouts or \nother similar youth groups equivalent access to school facilities and \nmust not discriminate against these groups by requiring them to admit \nhomosexuals as members or leaders or any other individuals who reject \nthe Boy Scout oath of allegiance to God and country.\n  So I just submit that I disagree, and it is an honest disagreement \nwith the Senator from Washington. There is a problem, and it is \nnecessary to legislate against this problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I will propose a unanimous consent \nrequest for the order of speakers.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Durbin have 10 minutes, and that \non our side Senator Enzi have up to 15 minutes. Then if somebody comes \non that side to speak, I propose that there be a Democratic speaker. \nBut if they are not here, I ask that Senator Smith have up to 10 \nminutes, and then a Democrat speaker, and then Senator Brownback have \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I have a \nquestion I would like to ask at some point to propound about the \nlanguage of this amendment. When might I do that?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I propose that we have an order of speakers and----\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I may be heard on this.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Senator from West Virginia, it appears with \nall these speakers that have been lined up, it would be sensible, as \nfar as I am concerned, that a question be asked before the speeches are \ngiven, not after.\n  It is my understanding that the Senator from West Virginia simply \nwants to ask a question for someone to answer during the discussion of \nthis amendment; is that right?\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I hope that the Senator from West Virginia can be \nrecognized immediately to ask his question. Is there any objection to \nthe Senator asking his question?\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. There would be no objection on my part if the Senator \nfrom Illinois is OK with that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the majority whip and all Senators. I wish to get a \nclarification of a definition. I think it is well that I pose this \nquestion now.\n  I don't intend to go into the background at this point, except to say \nthat I have been concerned about some of the things that have been said \nand some of the actions that have been taken with respect to Boy \nScouts. I was very disappointed when at the Democratic Convention there \nwas a demonstration--not by all Democrats by any means, and I feel sure \nit wasn't a part of the convention plans. But I was embarrassed at the \nboos and the disrespect shown by some of the participants at that \nconvention, which I did not attend; I was watching television. I have \nbeen concerned about other hostile actions that have since been \ndirected at the Boy Scouts of America.\n  Certainly, my intention up to this moment has been to vote for this \namendment. I do have a question, however. The question deals with \ndefinitions. I would like a better definition or clarification of the \nterm ``youth group.'' In paragraph 2 of section 2(a), I read the \nfollowing:\n\n       . . . denies equal access or a fair opportunity to meet to, \n     or discriminates against, any group affiliated with the Boy \n     Scouts of America or any other youth group . . .\n\n  I will repeat that: ``. . . or any other youth group.''\n\n       . . . that wishes to conduct a meeting within that \n     designated open forum, on the basis of the membership or \n     leadership criteria of the Boy Scouts of America or of the \n     youth group that prohibits the acceptance of homosexuals, or \n     individuals who reject the Boy Scouts' or the youth group's \n     oath of allegiance to God and country, as members or leaders.\n\n  My problem with that is ``youth group'' could include skinheads, and \nit could include Ku Klux Klan youth groups or any other ``hate'' \ngroups. That is what I am concerned about.\n  I know what we are talking about--the Boy Scouts. That is one thing. \nBut I hesitate to open the language up to just any ``youth'' group. \nThat is my problem. I would like for someone to clarify the definition \nof ``youth group'', or perhaps offer a modification so that we will all \nknow what we are talking about.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If the Senator will yield for a response to that.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am glad to.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. We are working with the primary sponsor of the \namendment to get a further definition and clarity on that so that we \ncan directly respond to the appropriate question of the Senator from \nWest Virginia. We will do that as soon as possible.\n  Mr. BYRD. I appreciate that. I have discussed this with the sponsor, \nMr. Helms, and two of his staff members.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. If the manager will yield, I join the Senator \nfrom West Virginia in asking for a clarification because I think it is \nvery important that we know what we are talking about.\n  I am here standing for the proposition that tolerance is a two-way \nstreet; that we should tolerate the gays and lesbians in our community, \nbut we should also tolerate the Boy Scouts in our community.\n  Clearly, there are some groups that have national charters that this \nGovernment recognizes, such as the Boy Scouts, and there are groups \nthat do not. That kind of a distinction perhaps ought to be made \nbecause I think we all want to be voting for the right thing. There are \nsome groups, such as the skinheads, that I don't want to be voting for \ntoday. I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his question.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has been consumed.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the terminology which I read here includes \nthis excerpt:\n\n       . . . The Boy Scouts' or the youth group's oath of \n     allegiance to God and country . . .\n\n  Mr. President, as a former member of the Ku Klux Klan--and this is no \nsecret to anybody; it has been known to the people of this country for \nat least 50 years, so I am not telling anything new. But there is no \ndoubt that that organization purports to swear allegiance to God and \ncountry.\n  I do not want to open this up to just any group--just any group that \nswears allegiance to God and country. That is why I raise the question. \nI think there must be a clarification of this. At least I am going to \nbe on record by what I am saying here, that I am not, regardless of how \nI vote on this amendment--I hope this can be clarified, and I hope \nthere can be some modification of the language.\n  On the record, I am not supportive of letting just any ``youth \ngroup'' come under the canopy of the definition of that term.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield to me for just a moment?\n  Mr. BYRD. If I have time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator be given 60 \nseconds additional time so I may engage him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Ms. Cantwell). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Senator Durbin is anxious to be heard. I thank my friend.\n\n[[Page S6254]]\n\n This amendment is troubling, and the Senator from West Virginia has \nput his finger on a very serious problem with this. What if a group \nsprings up--I am just going to use a name--the Timothy McVeigh Youth \nGroup and has in its charter antihomosexual language. It is my \nunderstanding, after checking with attorneys, in fact, they would be \ngiven special privileges because they have an antihomosexual charter.\n  My friend has raised a very important issue, and I thank him for it.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator. I prefer to use the Ku Klux Klan. We \nknow what we are talking about there. If one wishes to look at the \noath--I will say the oath of the Ku Klux Klan, and there are associate \ngroups and affiliated groups. Women used to be in the Klan; maybe young \npeople. I do not recall.\n  When it comes to patriotism, to God, to country, the words of that \norganization are superlative in that respect. How closely the actions \nfollowed the words is something else.\n  This language needs to be clarified. It needs to be modified. I do \nwant to support the amendment. I am speaking only as a Senator from \nWest Virginia. That is the way I see it. I hope there will be some \nmodification of that language.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I renew my unanimous consent request \nthat I put forward. I ask that the Democrats who are in turn speaking \nwill not speak for more than 15 minutes in the unanimous consent \nrequest I put forward.\n\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I do know the \nnames the Senator talked about. We should cut it off there. This could \ngo through the entire afternoon. Those names you mentioned be the only \nones.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I am not prepared to enter into a time agreement.\n  Mr. REID. That is my question. I am saying I am happy to agree to the \ntimes as you set forth, and the names you have mentioned, but after \nthat, we will just have jump ball here.\n  Mrs. BOXER. No problem. Madam President, I can now say, after Senator \nDurbin, Senator Wellstone will follow. That is our list at this time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object, do I understand there is \ntime available on our side?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Yes, there is.\n  Mr. WARNER. Is it restricted to this amendment?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. We are attempting to restrict it.\n  Mr. WARNER. A gentleman's and gentlewoman's understanding.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have an amendment pending at the desk that I want to \nwithdraw and need about 12 minutes to address the reason for which I am \nwithdrawing it.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Can the Senator do it afterwards?\n  Mr. WARNER. I will be delighted to do it after, if the Senator will \nbe kind enough and indicate in the unanimous consent request for me to \ndo that.\n  Mr. REID. That is the question: After what? We have a couple \namendments pending on which we are going to be voting. That will \nprobably take a while. The Senator may have to wait several hours.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I certainly will be delighted to do that \nso long as I, hopefully, can have some assurance for not more than 10 \nminutes during the course of the day. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the previous order is \nmodified. Under the previous unanimous consent order, the Senator from \nIllinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair. Madam President, I am opposed to \ndiscrimination--discrimination based on race, creed, color, gender, or \nsexual orientation. I am sorry that the Boy Scouts of America, which \nwere an important part of my youth, an important part of my family, \nhave now become a symbol that is being debated in the Chamber of the \nSenate. I am sorry this organization that has meant so much to so many \nis now being trivialized or symbolized by this debate. But it is a \nfact, and it is a fact that the amendment that has been offered by \nSenator Helms raises many questions.\n  I do not think the question is whether or not Boy Scout chapters have \naccess to public schools. As the Senator from Washington said, that is \nnot even debatable. The Supreme Court has ruled on that as late as this \nweek. They had a specific ruling saying that no school district can \nkeep any Boy Scout troop out of a public school. They have access. This \namendment is not necessary. It is already the law of the land.\n  The amendment by Senator Helms goes further. The amendment by Senator \nHelms says that no school district can discriminate against a youth \ngroup that also says homosexuals may not belong.\n  This raises some serious problems because there are school districts \nin States across America, including the State of Illinois, which have a \nstatement of policy, and they say: We will not let any groups be \nsponsored by our schools if they discriminate on the basis of race, \ncreed, color, gender, or sexual orientation. It is just a school \npolicy. You want your school group to be sponsored by the school? No \nway if they discriminate.\n  I would imagine those statements of policy were passed at school \nboard meetings without a dissenting vote. Who is going to vote against \nthat: That you would want a school district sponsoring a group that \ndiscriminates? Yet what Senator Helms says in his amendment is that if \nyour school district sticks with that policy of nondiscrimination in \nsponsorship, you lose your Federal funds.\n  What does that mean to the school district of the city of Chicago? \nHundreds of millions of dollars coming in to help kids. With the Helms \namendment, it is gone. It is not just Chicago. Many other States are \nalso affected.\n  This amendment, which may have been offered as a tribute to the Boy \nScouts or for whatever reason, has become much more. This has gone way \nbeyond the Boy Scouts, I say to my colleagues in the Senate. What this \namendment is trying to do is, frankly, create an environment which is \nantithetical, antagonistic to the beliefs of many school districts \nwhich have basically said: We will not sponsor organizations that \ndiscriminate. Yes, we may be forced to bring some in to have access to \nour schools, but we are not going to sponsor them.\n  According to Senator Helms, if you do not sponsor them, it is \ndiscrimination. If it is discrimination, guess what. You lose your \nFederal funds.\n  Let me go to the point raised by Senator Byrd from West Virginia. \nSenator Byrd touched on an important point. He talked about what kinds \nof youth groups we are discussing. Senators started using hypothetical \ngroups: What about skinheads, this group, that group, that happen to \nhave some awful beliefs but also happen to discriminate against those \nof a different sexual orientation? As I read the Helms amendment, the \nschool not only has to open the door to have access to use the school, \nbut they also have to be willing to sponsor the group, and if they do \nnot sponsor that group and others such as it, then they run the risk of \nlosing their Federal funds.\n  Is this a farfetched idea that a group such as that might arise? I \nwish it was. I will tell my colleagues about my own home State of \nIllinois. Have you ever heard of the World Church of the Creator? Mr. \nPresident, I remind my colleagues, they did hear about it in the news \nnot long ago.\n  This is a white supremacist organization that advocates openly the \nmurder of Jewish individuals and people of color. It has what it calls \n``holy books,'' ``ministers,'' and religious ceremonies all grounded in \ntheir ``religion'' of white supremacy.\n  Do my colleagues know when they heard about them? They heard about \nthem in July of 1999. A young man named Benjamin Smith went on a \nshooting rampage throughout Springfield, IL, Urbana, Decatur, Skokie, \nChicago, and Northbrook. He wounded nine and murdered Won-Joon Yoon, a \ndoctoral student at Indiana University, and he killed Ricky Birdsong, \nan African American, the former Northwestern University basketball \ncoach.\n  Mr. Smith wounded and killed these individuals because he hated those \nwho were different from him and because his religion, the World Church \nof the Creator, supported taking violent action against them.\n  If the World Church of the Creator approached a school in Illinois \nand asked that school sponsor their youth group, under the Helms \namendment, if\n\n[[Page S6255]]\n\nthey said no, they would lose their Federal funds. Why? Because the \nWorld Church of the Creator also has a very clear policy when it comes \nto homosexuals. The World Church of the Creator does not allow \nhomosexuals in the membership or in their leadership.\n  Think of the situation we are creating. Imagine serving on a school \nboard with no pay under these circumstances. Senator Helms, in trying \nto pay a tribute to the Boy Scouts, has opened the door wide for \nmischief from every crazy group in America that wants to not only use \nschool premises but be sponsored by schools. If they don't go along, \nguess what. They get either a lawsuit or the loss of Federal funds.\n  I consider this amendment a complete disaster. It is a disaster when \none considers the impact it has on schools across America that are \ntrying to live under the four corners of the law. The Supreme Court has \nsaid open your doors for access, but the Supreme Court doesn't say a \nschool has to sponsor the group, provide the schoolbus, make sure they \nhave some sort of special treatment within the school, give them a page \nin the yearbook.\n  Do we want the World Church of the Creator to have a page in the \nyearbook of your child's high school? I certainly don't. I am \nembarrassed that this organization calls Illinois home. In an open and \nfree society, these things are allowed to exist, but they are not in a \nsituation where they ought to receive special treatment, which Senator \nHelms wants to give them under this amendment.\n  I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, take time to \nread this carefully. This is not as simple as it sounds. The language \nSenator Helms has put in this bill will create nothing but trouble for \nschool districts across America which will now be forced to face \nimpossible decisions as these hate-filled groups come in, one after the \nother, asking for special treatment.\n  Join me in voting no against the Helms amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I have spoken to the Republican manager of the bill. The \nSenator from Wyoming is next, and then Senator Wellstone will be \nrecognized for up to 15 minutes. Senator Daschle, the majority leader, \nwishes to use part of Senator Wellstone's 15 minutes. Senator Wellstone \nhas given consent to give part of his time to Senator Daschle. We will \nnot use any more time, but there will be another speaker, if that is OK \nwith the Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. That is correct. We will maintain the same flow of \npeople as under the unanimous consent request.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have another speaker. The next Democrat after Senators \nWellstone and Daschle would be Senator Clinton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the order will be so \nmodified.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise in support of amendment No. 648, \nthe Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act, offered by my distinguished \ncolleague from North Carolina, Senator Helms. I am certain, with some \nmodifications, any of the inflammatory groups that have been mentioned \nwill be excluded from the amendment. The amendment was intended to be \nsimple and straightforward in its purpose, to ensure the constitutional \nrights of 6 million Boy Scouts in the United States are not violated by \npublic schools that receive Federal education funds.\n  The Boy Scouts of America is one of the oldest and largest youth \norganizations in the United States and in the world today. The \norganization teaches its members to do their duty to God, to love their \ncountry, and to serve their fellow citizens. And they do that. The Boy \nScouts have formed the minds and hearts of millions of Americans and \nprepared these boys and young members for the challenges they are sure \nto face for the rest of their lives.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in defending the Boy Scouts from \nunconstitutional discrimination by supporting the Helms amendment.\n  It has been said earlier in the discussion that this is an \nunnecessary amendment. It brings to mind two things. First, when did we \nstop doing unnecessary amendments around here? And second, this would \nnot be brought up if it were not necessary.\n  I have had a number of opportunities, needs that should never have \nhappened, to defend the Boy Scouts and make sure they have places to \nmeet. I have a list of five times it happened during the year 2000, and \neight times already this year. This is a young year.\n  An Iowa city school board voted to prohibit Boy Scouts from \ndistributing any information in schools because of Scouts' membership \ncriteria. Greg Shields, the national spokesman for Boy Scouts of \nAmerica, said, ``We simply ask to be treated the same way as any other \nprivate organization . . . [and] that our free speech and right to \nassemble be respected just as we respect the rights of others.''\n  The New York Times reported that New York's Chappaqua School District \nofficials were able to coerce two local Boy Scout troops into signing a \ndocument that denounced national policies of the Boy Scouts as a \ncondition to allowing the troops access to school property.\n  I ask unanimous consent this list be printed at the end of my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit No. 1.)\n  Mr. ENZI. Boy Scouts has been a part of my education. I am an Eagle \nScout. I am pleased to say my son was in Scouts. He is an Eagle Scout. \nI say it is part of my education because each of the badges that is \nearned, each of the merit badges that is earned, is an education. I \ntell schoolkids as I go across my State and across my country that even \nthough at times I took courses or merit badges or programs that I \ndidn't see where I would ever have a use for them, by now I have had a \nuse for them and wish I had paid more attention at the time I was doing \nit.\n  Boy Scouts is an education. It is an education in possibilities for \ncareers. I can think of no substitution for the 6 million boys in \nScouts and the millions who have preceded them. There are dozens on \nboth sides of the aisle who have been Boy Scouts.\n  I always liked a merit badge pamphlet on my desk called \n``Entrepreneurship.'' It is the hardest Boy Scout badge to earn. It is \none of the most important ones. I believe small business is the future \nof our country. Boy Scouts promote small business through their \ninternship merit badge. Why would it be the toughest to get? Not only \ndo you have to figure out a plan, devise a business plan, figure how to \nfinance it, but the final requirement for the badge is to start a \nbusiness.\n  I could go on and on through the list of merit badges required in \norder to get an Eagle badge. There are millions of boys in this country \nwho are doing that and will be doing that. They do need places to meet. \nThey are being discriminated against. They are being told they cannot \nuse school facilities.\n  It isn't just school facilities; it is Federal facilities. A couple \nof years ago, we had an opportunity to debate this again on floor, and \nit had to do with the Smithsonian. Some Boy Scouts requested they be \nable to do the Eagle Scout Court of Honor at the National Zoo and were \ndenied. Why? The determination by the legal staff of the Smithsonian \nthat Scouts discriminate because of their support for and encouragement \nfor the spiritual life of their members. Specifically, they embrace the \nconcept that the universe was created by a supreme being, although we \nsurely point out Scouts do not endorse or require a single belief or \nany particular faith's God. The mere fact they asked you to believe in \nand try to foster a relationship with a supreme being who created the \nuniverse was enough to disqualify them.\n  I read that portion of the letter twice. I had just visited the \nNational Archives and read the original document signed by our Founding \nFathers. It is a good thing they hadn't asked to sign the Declaration \nof Independence at the National Zoo.\n  This happens in the schools across the country. Other requests have \nbeen denied. They were also told they were not relevant to the National \nZoo. That is kind of a fascinating experiment in words. I did look to \nsee what other sorts of things had been done there and found they had a \nWashington Singers musical concert, and the Washington premiers for \nboth the ``Lion King'' and ``Batman.'' Clearly, relevance was not a \ndetermining factor in those decisions.\n\n  But the Boy Scouts have done some particular things in conservation \nthat\n\n[[Page S6256]]\n\nare important, in conservation tied in with the zoo. In fact, the \nfounder of the National Zoo was Dr. William Hornaday. He is one of the \npeople who was involved in some of the special conservation movements \nand has one of the conservation badges of Scouts named after him.\n  If the situations did not arise, this amendment would not come up. \nBut they do arise, as I mentioned with the list of eight incidents \nalready this year. Four of those are on a statewide basis.\n  Last summer the Supreme Court in Boy Scouts of America v. Dale held \nthat the Boy Scouts were entitled to full protection under the first \namendment right of expressive association. The High Court held that \nState laws such as New Jersey's law of public accommodation \nunconstitutionally violated the first amendment rights of this \nvenerable organization if they were applied to force the Boy Scouts to \naccept Scoutmasters whose lifestyles violated the Boy Scout oath. The \nHelms amendment will ensure that public schools that receive public \neducation funds do not force the Boy Scouts to check their first \namendment rights at the schoolhouse door.\n  The Helms amendment simply requires that the Boy Scouts are treated \nfairly, as any other organization, in their efforts to hold meetings on \npublic school property. It does not require public schools to open \ntheir doors to any organization for before- or after-school meetings on \npublic school property. It provides if the school is going to provide \nan open forum for youth or community groups before or after school, \nthat school must allow the Boy Scouts the chance to use school property \nfor their meetings.\n  Unfortunately, many school districts are bending to the pressure of \nfar left interest groups in their attempt to deny the constitutional \nrights of the Boy Scouts of America. A number of school districts have \nprohibited the Scouts from meeting on public school property or have \npressured local Scouting troops to denounce their very principles on \nwhich the organization was founded before they can have meetings there.\n  An example of this discrimination is in Broward County, FL, where the \nschool board voted last November to prohibit the Boy Scouts of America \nfrom using public schools to hold meetings and recruitment drives. This \nis part of a growing trend of local schools, which are imposing \nviewpoint discrimination against the Boy Scouts because they disapprove \nof the Scout's message and the way they put this message into practice. \nFortunately, the Federal courts have not looked favorably on this \nviewpoint of discrimination against the Boy Scouts in the early legal \nchallenges to these actions.\n  In March of this year, the U.S. District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of Florida issued a preliminary injunction against the Broward \nCounty School District to block their attempt to keep the Boy Scouts \noff public school property. The district court found that since the \nschool district allowed numerous other groups to use public school \nfacilities, they had established a limited forum. Accordingly, they \nwere not allowed to discriminate against Boy Scout speech simply \nbecause they disagreed with the Scout's viewpoint on homosexuality. In \ngranting this injunction, Judge Middlebrooks wrote:\n\n       The constitutional rights to freedom of speech or \n     expression are not shed at the school gate.\n\n  I have to mention, these are examples of where the Scouts were able \nto use the courts to assure that they were not discriminated against. I \nam pretty sure everybody in America recognizes if you have to use the \ncourts to get your rights to use school buildings, it costs money. It \ncosts time. This amendment eliminates that cost and eliminates that \ntime, to allow the organizations to have the same rights as the other \ngroups at school.\n  It is unfortunate, sometimes, that we have--the legal system is very \nimportant in the country but it has some interesting repercussions. Our \nsystem of lawsuits, which sometimes are called the legal lottery of \nthis country, allow people who think they have been harmed to try to \npoint out who harmed them and get money for doing that. It has had some \ndifficulties for the Boy Scouts.\n  I remember when my son was in the Scouts their annual fundraiser was \nselling Christmas trees. One of the requirements when they were selling \nChristmas trees was that the boys selling trees at the lot had to be \naccompanied by two adults not from the same family.\n  I did not understand why we needed all of this adult supervision. It \nseemed as if one adult helping out at the lot would be sufficient. The \nanswer was, they have been sued because there was only one adult there \nand that adult was accused of abusing the boys. Two adults provided \nsome assurance that did not happen.\n  The interesting thing is, it was just me and my son at the lot and we \nstill had to have another adult in order to keep the Boy Scouts from \nbeing sued.\n  They run into some of the same difficulties with car caravans.\n  So the legal system of this country has put them in the position \nwhere they are doing some of the things that they are doing. The legal \nsystem of the country has caused some of the discrimination that is \ndone.\n  It is something we need to correct. This discussion of the Helms \namendment is timely. On Monday of this week, the Supreme Court held \nthat a public school in New York was not allowed to exclude the Good \nNews Club, which is a private Christian organization for gradeschool \nchildren, from using public school facilities for the group's \nafterschool meetings. In the Good News Club v. Milford Central School, \nthe Court determined that the school violated the club's first \namendment free speech rights by discriminating against the group's \nviewpoint. The Helms amendment would assure that these free speech \nprotections would also apply to the Boy Scouts of America.\n  The Boy Scouts of America is one of the oldest and largest youth \norganizations in the United States and the world today. The \norganization teaches its members to do their duty to God, to love their \ncountry, and serve their fellow citizens. The Boy Scouts have formed \nthe minds and hearts of millions of Americans and prepared these boys \nand young men for the challenges they are sure to face the rest of \ntheir lives. It is an essential part of Americana. I urge my colleagues \nto join me in defending the Boy Scouts from constitutional \ndiscrimination by supporting the Helms amendment.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n\n           examples of boy scouts being discriminated against\n\n       On May 21, 2001, the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education \n     Network--an activist homosexual organization--reported that \n     ``After launching a campaign last September [against the Boy \n     Scouts] the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network has \n     tracked a total of 359 school districts which have severed \n     sponsorships with the Scouts since the Supreme Court ruling \n     last June'' [www.glsen.org].\n       On May 11, 2001, the Associated Press reported that the \n     Iowa City School board voted to prohibit the Boy Scouts of \n     America from distributing any information in schools because \n     of the Scouts membership criteria. Greg Shields, the national \n     spokesman for Boy Scouts of America said, ``We simply ask to \n     be treated the same way as any other private organization . . \n     . [and] that our free speech and right to assemble be \n     respected just as we respect those rights of others.\n       On February 8, 2001, the Ashbury Park Press reported that \n     the State [of New Jersey] is considering a rule change that \n     would bar school districts from renting space to the Boy \n     Scouts of America because of their position on homosexuality.\n       On February 7, 2001, The Arizona Republic reported that the \n     Sunnyside School District, in Tucson [two-sawn], Arizona \n     decided to charge the Boy Scouts of America fees to use \n     school facilities, even though no other groups have to pay \n     fees. The ACLU executive director said that, ``While Boy \n     Scouts, atheists, Nazis, even Satanists have the right to \n     express their views, government should not use public money \n     to promote them.''\n       On January 28, 2001, the Boston Globe reported that the \n     Acton School Committee in Massachusetts decided to prevent \n     the Boy Scouts from distributing literature at school--even \n     though other groups can do so. In defending its actions, \n     Acton School Committee cited Massachusetts law, which says \n     that schools cannot sponsor the Boy Scouts.\n       On January 14, 2001, the New York Times reported that New \n     York's Chappaqua School District officials were about to \n     coerce two local Boy Scout troops into signing a document \n     that denounced the national policies of the Boy Scouts of \n     America as a condition for allowing these troops access to \n     school property.\n       On January 13, 2001, the Wisconsin State Journal reported \n     that the Madison School Board voted unanimously to post a \n     condemnation against the Boy Scouts of America in all 45 \n     school districts.\n\n[[Page S6257]]\n\n       On January 11, 2001, the News & Observer reported that \n     ``The Chapel Hill-Carroboro school board voted to give Scouts \n     until June to either go against the rule of their \n     organization or lose their sponsorship and meeting places in \n     schools.''\n       On December 18, 2000, the Seattle Union Record reported \n     that a state coalition of advocates for gay and lesbian \n     students has asked Seattle Public Schools to restrict the Boy \n     Scouts of America's access to students and school buildings.\n       On December 2, 2000, the New York Times reported that the \n     Schools Chancellor barred New York City public schools from: \n     bidding on contracts with city schools, sponsoring Scout \n     troops or allowing the Scouts to recruit members during \n     school hours.\n       On November 20, 2000, the Associate Press reported that in \n     Mount Pleasant, Michigan, School boards in Minneapolis and \n     New York City, as well as other city and state governments \n     and groups nationwide, have recently cut support of the \n     Scouts because of its gay policy. In the Detroit suburb of \n     Plymouth, a teachers union asked its school board to ban \n     groups--including the Boy Scouts--that discriminate against \n     gays.\n       On November 16, 2000 Fla. Today reported that ``Broward \n     County's school board voted unanimously to keep the Boy \n     Scouts of America from using public schools to hold meetings \n     and recruitment drives because of the groups ban on gays.'' \n     [District Court intervened.]\n       On November 15, 2000 the Telegram and Gazzete reported that \n     in Worchester, Ma, ``Superintendent of Schools Alfred Tutela \n     . . . banned the Boy Scouts from holding meetings in the \n     properties of the Wachusett Regional Schools District.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, prior to my colleague, Senator \nWellstone, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my colleague, I thank him for adding to this \ndebate. But if you believe in the rule of law, which we all do, the \nSupreme Court has spoken very clearly on this point. The Boy Scouts \nhave equal access to every single public school in this country. The \nSupreme Court has so declared. So I, again, say to my friend, what is \nthe purpose of this amendment? It is gratuitous, it seems to me. It is \nunnecessary. It hurts a group of people. It divides the country. We \nalready know the Boy Scouts have equal access. With all the remarks he \nhas made, if schools are not allowing that, they are breaking the law.\n  We do not need another law which, by the way, opens up a can of \nworms, as Senator Byrd, who supports the underlying amendment, says. It \nis a can of worms. It could invite people in who you really do not \nwant. He mentioned the Ku Klux Klan and skinheads and other groups.\n  I appreciate being given this 1 minute.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute before my \ncolleague from Minnesota speaks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I think some of the reasons the \nSenator from California is raising may be valid to the point that this \nshould pass 100-0. If this is not seen as a particularly contentious \nissue, if it is something that is going to happen and it is agreed to \nanyway, I hope we will all support the Boy Scouts. This is, indeed, \nabout the Boy Scouts, and it is important to that organization that has \n23 million members worldwide. I think it would be a good statement of \nsupport to them.\n  This issue is about the Boy Scouts and there are legitimate issues \nthat have been raised. I think we can tighten the language; if some \npeople are concerned about the expansiveness of ``youth group,'' make \nit just about the Boy Scouts and pass it 100-0.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMinnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, the majority leader is on the floor. \nI will limit my remarks to 3 minutes.\n  First of all, I am a son of a Jewish immigrant who fled persecution \nfrom Ukraine and then Russia. I grew up in a family where I was taught \nit was wrong to discriminate against anyone. I have tried to teach my \nchildren and my grandchildren the same. I am against discrimination of \npeople because of nationality, race, gender, ethnicity, or sexual \norientation.\n  I commend the Boy Scouts for all of the good work they have done for \npeople. But I am very saddened that the Boy Scouts have engaged in what \nare discriminatory policies towards gays and lesbians. I think that is \nmost unfortunate for what is otherwise a very fine organization.\n  There was a piece of legislation on this floor a number of years ago \nwhich said that any school district that ``promoted homosexuality'' \nwould be cut off from Federal funds. Then I looked at the operational \ndefinition of it down a number of paragraphs, and that included \ncounseling. So if you have a young man in high school and he goes to \nsee a counselor, and if he says: I am gay, my friends disowned me, my \nparents have disowned me, and I feel worthless--I do a lot of work in \nsuicide prevention and the mental health field. Unfortunately, a high \nincidence of suicide is among boys who are gay.\n  The way the Court has ruled, it is clear that if, in fact, community \ngroups come into schools, so can Boy Scouts. That isn't even the issue. \nThe question is whether or not if a school district has a policy of \nnondiscrimination and it chooses not to sponsor the Boy Scouts because \nthe Boy Scouts discriminate against this group of citizens--against \ngays--it would no longer be able to do so, which then would provide Boy \nScouts with not access but with special treatment.\n  That is wrong. It is wrong to say to any school district in any State \nand to any school board that you have to change your policy; that you \nhave to sponsor a group which goes against the very values that you \nhave professed, which is what we should not do; that is, discriminate \nagainst any group of citizens, any children anywhere.\n  That is why I oppose this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I think what the Senator from Minnesota \nsaid so eloquently, passionately, and accurately probably leaves little \nleft to be said in regard to what this amendment is.\n  I rise today to express my disappointment with this amendment.\n  The Senate has been debating the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct--off and on--for more than eight weeks now.\n  This is an important debate. We are talking about the blueprint for \nfederal education policy and funding.\n  So far, this has been an unusually bipartisan debate.\n  We have been making principled compromises, and real progress.\n  And now this.\n  Let me be clear: I believe the Boy Scouts should have the same access \nto public school facilities as any other private organization.\n  But I fear that is not what this amendment is about.\n  I oppose Senator Helms' amendment for two reasons.\n  First: It could usurp the rights of states, counties and local \ncommunities to make certain decisions for their own schools.\n  Under this amendment, communities that feel strongly that \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation is wrong could face a \nterrible choice. They could either disregard their own conscience. Or \nthey could follow their conscience and lose millions of dollars that \ntheir children's schools need.\n  Both sides have said, throughout this debate, that one of our goals \nshould be to find ways to allow communities to make more decisions \nabout their own schools, not fewer.\n  This amendment does exactly the opposite.\n  The second reason this amendment is such a disappointment to me is \nthat--in my opinion--it tolerates discrimination.\n  A year and a half ago, Congress awarded the Congressional Medal of \nHonor--the highest honor this nation can bestow on civilians--to the \n``Little Rock Nine.'' More than a generation ago, as children, they had \nthe courage to help desegregate the Little Rock public schools.\n  Back then, millions of Americans--in Little Rock and across this \nnation--believed that segregation was a moral imperative.\n  There are many people today who believe that discriminating against \ngays and lesbians is also a moral imperative. I understand that. But \nthat is not the American way.\n  Over the years, I've been honored with awards from many groups.\n\n[[Page S6258]]\n\n  There are only a few that I keep in my office in the Capitol. One is \nan award I got three years ago this week from the National Capital Area \nChapter of the Boy Scouts.\n  It's a sculpture of a young boy. I keep it in my office because of my \nprofound respect for the good work the Boy Scouts have done in this \ncountry for more than 90 years.\n  We believe in principled compromise. But we cannot compromise on \nfundamental issues of civil rights.\n  Supporters of this amendment say they are merely defending the \nconstitutional right of free association. They say they are simply \nprotecting the right of a private organization to set its own rules.\n  But the Supreme Court has already ruled that the Boy Scouts have the \nsame right as any other community or youth group to use school \nfacilities.\n  This amendment seeks special rights for one organization. It could \nforce communities to grant that organization special privileges--or \nlose thousands, perhaps millions of dollars in federal education aid.\n  It is sad to see the Boy Scouts--a group that has worked for more \nthan 90 years to avoid political polarization--being used now by some \nto foster political polarization in this Senate, and in our society as \na whole.\n  I hope my colleagues will reject this amendment. I hope that we can \nwork together to finish this good bipartisan education bill because our \nchildren's future, our country, and the rights of all people, \nminorities, and those who are not minorities, stand in the balance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, if I could have 2 minutes to associate \nmyself completely with the majority leader's eloquent statement, I rise \nin opposition to this amendment for all of the reasons that the \nmajority leader has just outlined; but also, further, to say I was \nhonored to serve for 8 years as the Honorary Chair of the Girl Scouts \nof America. I know the value of the Girl Scouts and the Boy Scouts.\n  To deprive any youngster of the opportunity to participate over this \nissue strikes me as regrettable at the very least.\n  The Girl Scouts don't discriminate. We have had an organization that \nhas gone for so many years without any of this difficulty. It should be \nup to the local level to determine whether or not a local school \ndistrict wishes to have the Boy Scouts offer these services to \nyoungsters in their schools and in their districts.\n  I am absolutely amazed that my friends on the other side would \npropose an amendment that so totally eviscerates local control. It is \nalready unnecessary, as we know, with respect to the use of facilities. \nThe Supreme Court has already, as it did again yesterday, reaffirmed \naccess to public school facilities.\n  If we are saying that having the Boy Scouts either in its present \nform or with slight modifications determined by the local parents and \nthe schools would in any way jeopardize all Federal funding, it just \nabsolutely amazes me that people on the other side could make such an \nargument.\n  So I believe, with all my heart, that we should not be discriminating \nagainst anyone in our country. But certainly a local district that \ntries to work out whatever its problems are with the Boy Scouts, and \nmakes a decision that it considers in the best interests of its \nchildren, should not face the peril of losing all Federal funding that \nshould be made available to educate our children, which is what we have \nbeen debating now for more than a month.\n  So I hope all of us will join in rejecting this amendment and making \nclear that we respect the Boy Scouts, we respect the Girl Scouts, and \nwe especially respect local control over educational facilities and \nopportunities.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nOregon is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I think I am going to come at \nthis issue more differently than any of my colleagues who have spoken \nso far.\n  I stand here as an Eagle Scout. I stand here as an Oregon Senator. I \nstand here as one who believes that gays and lesbians are due equal \nrights. I have tried to demonstrate that in the way I have conducted my \nservice in the Senate, by supporting Jim Hormel's nomination to be an \nAmbassador for our country, by being the cosponsor, with Senator \nKennedy, of hate crimes legislation, and by now endorsing a new version \nof ENDA that has a broader religious exemption. I believe I stand here \nwith some credibility when I come to the issue of tolerance.\n  One of my core values is that if we are to be true disciples, we \nshould love one another. I try actively not to discriminate. But I \nbelieve I just heard the majority leader and the Senator from New York \nsay that the Boy Scouts have a right to be in the schools but we can \ndiscriminate against them. And that is what impels me to this Chamber \nthis morning.\n  This amendment of Senator Helms is not raised in a vacuum. It hurts \nme personally, as one of five sons of my parents to have the Eagle \nbadge, and the father of another Eagle, and another son on the way to \nEagle, to see the values of that organization held up to ridicule by \nsome on the left who I believe are terribly intolerant and who do \ndiscriminate against people of faith whenever they can.\n  I will tell you that in my working with the Human Rights Campaign, \nthe folks there with whom I have worked have been very respectful of \nreligious faith and have worked with me regarding religious \norganizations under the proposed ENDA law. I think that was a tolerant \nthing for them to do.\n\n  My great frustration is trying to say to the right and to the left: \nToleration is a two-way street. What I have heard back and forth this \nmorning is intolerance on both sides. I will tell you, as a Republican, \nhow disappointed I was to see from the Republican Steering Committee \nthis morning chapter and verse of instances where a homosexual man and \nScout leader was also a pedophile. The inference they are trying to \ndraw is that if you are a homosexual, ergo, you are a pedophile and \ncannot be a Scout leader. That is no more true than the proposition \nthat a man who coaches a girl's soccer team will necessarily sexually \nabuse the girls.\n  We have to get beyond these stereotypes. This is wrong; this is \nintolerant; and it goes both ways.\n  So I believe Senator Helms is here in good faith. I believe he is \ngoing to amend his amendment. I believe we can narrow it in a way to \nexclude those groups who do not have national charters with this \nGovernment or in some way to say that, yes, we do feel a need to stand \nup for the Boy Scouts of America.\n  Assuming we find that language, I intend to vote with Senator Helms \nbecause, I will tell you, what I learned as a Scout is an ideal that I \nwant to see preserved for our country. And I don't want them excluded \nfrom the national parks; I don't want them excluded from our public \nplaces; because I believe what I learned as a Boy Scout is as \ninvaluable and as enduring today as it was when I learned it as a 12-\nyear-old boy.\n  Madam President, we are doing a school bill here because we want to \nhelp our kids. Let me tell you what I learned as a Scout. We memorized \nit. I have to use these glasses now. I didn't then. But these are the \nqualities I would like taught in school: A Scout is trustworthy, loyal, \nhelpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, \nclean, and reverent.\n  Then you come to the Scout oath. The last phrase is what everybody \nfocuses on anymore. I didn't even know what it meant in a modern \ncontext when I learned it as a boy. It is:\n\n       On my honor I will do my best\n       To do my duty to God and my country\n       And to obey the Scout law;\n       To help other people at all times;\n       To keep myself physically strong,\n       Mentally awake,\n       and morally straight.\n\n  Do you know what I knew as a boy about ``morally straight''? I didn't \nknow anything about gays or lesbians or ``straight.'' What I was taught \nthat meant was that as a boy and a young man I should be sexually \nabstinent and that as an adult and a married man I should be sexually \nfaithful to my spouse. Is that wrong? I know that that is a tough \nstandard, but I say the U.S. Senate should keep that ideal high. And we \ncan do it by supporting the Boy Scouts of America.\n  So while we are working out the language on the Helms amendment, I \nthank the Senator from North Carolina for the spirit of the amendment \nthat\n\n[[Page S6259]]\n\nsays these ideals, these values are valuable still.\n  Madam President, I think what is often lost in this debate about the \nBoy Scouts is how it is even organized. The Boy Scouts is a national \ninstitution with a national charter with this Government, and it is put \nout for any group that wants to sponsor it. They are called chartering \ninstitutions. Most of the chartering institutions are churches and \nsynagogues. Some are police stations. Some may even be a school \ndistrict. But I tell you, we ought to understand the spirit of \nreligious accommodation. It ought to apply to the Boy Scouts as well. \nBut in many cities in our country, this organization is being singled \nout for discrimination, and it is wrong because this is a standard.\n  These are values that I want taught in public school. And these are \nvalues that when I live them, my life is better for it and my pursuit \nof happiness is more full.\n  So I hope we can find the right language because this Eagle Scout \nfeels a need to vote for the Boy Scouts of America on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, with the agreement and the graciousness \nof Senator Brownback, we will have Senator Murray speak for 3 minutes, \nand I ask unanimous consent to speak for 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will never forget my daughter when she was that little \nBrownie girl. All the women Senators are giving the proceeds of our \nbook to the Girl Scouts. There isn't anyone on this side of the aisle \nwho doesn't believe it is very important to have organizations such as \nthese to help our kids. We also believe, however, if you read this \namendment, it is not about equal access for the Boy Scouts.\n  I yield to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I want to respond quickly to the \nSenator from Oregon. I was concerned with his mischaracterization of \nthose who oppose this amendment. As I heard him, I felt he was saying \nthose who support this amendment support the Boy Scouts and the values \nof the Boy Scouts, and those who oppose it oppose the Boy Scouts.\n  I tell the Senator from Oregon and our colleagues, that is absolutely \nnot the case. I have sat here and listened to the entire debate. \nEveryone who has opposed this amendment has spoken about the Boy Scouts \npersonally in their own lives, including me. I remind the Senator from \nOregon that I was a Brownie. I was a junior Girl Scout. I was a Girl \nScout. I was a Brownie leader. I was a junior Girl Scout leader. I was \na senior Girl Scout leader, and I was a Boy Scout leader for my son.\n  I think the Boy Scouts do a tremendous job in this country for a lot \nof young people, and I want them to continue to do that.\n  The opposition to this amendment comes because the Boy Scouts already \nhave equal access to our facilities. They have them under current law, \nand it has been affirmed by court decisions. The concerns on our side \nare that this amendment and the language of the amendment as written \nwill give the Boy Scouts access above and beyond any other group that \nasks for a school facility.\n  As a former school board member, the bind that will put our school \ndistricts in, as they look at this language and are told that if a \nchurch group comes to them and another group, perhaps seniors who are \nlooking for tutoring, and Boy Scouts, is that they will have to pick \nthe Boy Scouts over those other groups. School boards make these \ndecisions based on a lot of different local decisions: On space, on how \nthe facility will be used, on how many janitors they are going to have \nto hire, on what other kinds of demands there are on their facilities. \nTheir underlying goal as a school board is to make sure the kids in \ntheir district are educated. We have to leave this decision in their \nhands and not put language into the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct that forces them to choose one group over another.\n\n  Equal access is currently provided under law and by the courts. What \nwe cannot do is tie the hands of school boards to give unequal access \nto a group, even though all of us on the floor may agree that it is a \ngreat group.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I say to Senator Murray, I don't cast aspersions \non anyone. But I have heard a few say that the Boy Scouts are \ndiscriminators and therefore should be discriminated. I have heard that \nin several remarks. I am only making reference to that. I believe some \nlegitimate concerns about the amendment have been raised. I am hearing \nfrom some that the Boy Scouts are out of date and old-fashioned. I am \nsaying they ought to remain in fashion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nKansas is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I appreciate that. I rise in support of the amendment. \nThis is one that should pass 100-0. Hearing some of the comments on \nboth sides of the aisle, I am not sure I understand why there should be \nany opposition to it.\n  I will read the applicable part of the amendment. It is on page 2. It \nsays to any State educational agency, if a school, or schools served by \nthe agency, denies equal access or a fair opportunity to meet or \ndiscriminates against any group affiliated with the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica or any other youth group that wishes to conduct a meeting \nwithin that designated open forum--and that is where the language is \nbeing worked on right now--on the basis of the membership or leadership \ncriteria of the Boy Scouts, their funding is limited.\n  As the Senator from North Carolina pointed out, most of these never \nget to that point. The Department of Education looks at it, \ninvestigates. It is worked out at the local school district level. This \nall gets worked out. The operative point here is that if the Boy Scouts \nare going to be discriminated against, you are going to go into a \nprocess of being reviewed on your Federal funding.\n  Is this a legitimate concern? Some have raised the point this is not \na legitimate concern. Let's look at the headlines. In the year \nfollowing the decision of the Supreme Court, the Boy Scouts v. Dale, \nwhich affirmed the Scouts' right of free association--that is the issue \nhere, right of free association, in the Constitution; it has been a \nraging storm. The New York Times has compared the Scouts to a hate \ngroup. Robert Scheer of the Los Angeles Times characterizes Scouts \nas engaged in hateful politics. They have been accused of bigotry. \nActivists groups have expressed being appalled at some of the Scouts' \npositions. Unfortunately, many school districts have responded to the \ncontroversy by attempting to discriminate against the Boy Scouts.\n\n  This is a point I am reiterating from the Senator from Wyoming, a \nformer Eagle Scout. I, unfortunately, was not an Eagle Scout. We didn't \nhave the Boy Scouts in Parker, KS. I wish we had. My son was in the Boy \nScouts. It is a great organization. Some of the school districts have \nfollowed on after this sort of hyperbole and rhetoric regarding the Boy \nScouts and they have started to respond.\n  Listen to what is happening.\n  In Seattle, the home State of the Presiding Officer, from the Seattle \nUnion Record:\n\n       Safe Schools Coalition Asks for Restricted Access for \n     Seattle Scouts.\n\n  From the South Florida Sun-Sentinel:\n\n       Broward School Board to Review Scouts' Lease.\n\n  From the Detroit News:\n\n       Plymouth Schools to Vote on Ban on Scout Meetings.\n\n  This is an active issue against the Boy Scouts of America. People are \nsaying the Boy Scouts is a good organization: we like the Boy Scouts, \nare part of the Boy Scouts, continue to be a part of the Boy Scouts; we \nshould let them have public access. If you think this is an \ninsignificant amendment, vote for it 100-0 then.\n  Unfortunately, the school districts' response to this controversy is \nbased on what other people are saying about\n\n[[Page S6260]]\n\nthe Boy Scouts of America and not what the Boy Scouts are doing or \nsaying. In Kansas, we have a tradition and a thought that is \nappropriate to bring here; that is, that you take people at their word. \nRather than attempting to characterize the nature of the Boy Scouts as \nan organization or offering just my opinions on that, I think we ought \nto let them speak for themselves. We talk a lot on the floor about \ncharacter, the need for character, the need for that in this country. \nEverybody would agree we need character. We need to bring back those \nfundamental principles that this country was built upon.\n  Are the Boy Scouts a part of that? First and foremost, consider the \nquestion of whether or not Scouts are a hate group, as some have \nalleged. It is important to go back to the roots of this 90-year-old \norganization, look at the values upon which they exist.\n  Let's consider their oath the Senator from Oregon was citing, which I \nthink is so beautiful. It is something we all ought to memorize as U.S. \nSenators and others:\n\n       On my honor I will do my best\n       To do my duty to God and my country\n\n  ``In God we trust,'' above the halls of the Senate, major door \nthrough which we walk.\n\n       And to obey the Scout law;\n       To help other people at all times;\n       To keep myself physically strong,\n       mentally awake,\n       and morally straight.\n\n  As a parent of five, I like that. I think that is pretty good. I \nthink that is pretty good character education. I don't see anything \nhateful in it. However, the oath does refer to the Scout laws. Maybe we \nneed to look to see if this is a hate group or not.\n  In the Scout group, they call for trustworthiness. A Scout tells the \ntruth, keeps his promises. Honesty is part of his code of conduct. \nPeople can depend on him. A Scout is loyal. A Scout is true to his \nfamily, Scout leaders, friends, school, and Nation. A Scout is helpful. \nA Scout is concerned about other people. He does things willingly for \nothers without pay or reward. That is a nice notion to bring back.\n\n  A Scout is friendly. A Scout is a friend to all. He is a brother to \nother Scouts. He seeks to understand others. He respects those with \nideas and customs other than his own.\n  A Scout is courteous. A Scout is polite to everyone, regardless of \nage or position. He knows good manners make it easier for people to get \nalong together. A Scout is kind. A Scout understands there is strength \nin being gentle. He treats others as he wants to be treated. He does \nnot hurt or kill harmless things without reason. A Scout is obedient. A \nScout follows the rules of his family, school, and troop. He follows \nthe rules of the school. He obeys the laws of his community and \ncountry. If he thinks these rules and laws are unfair, he tries to have \nthem changed in an orderly manner rather than disobeying them.\n  A Scout is cheerful. A Scout looks for the bright side of things. He \ncheerfully does tasks that come his way. He tries to make others happy. \nThey may be being tasked on that one at this point in time.\n  A Scout is thrifty. A Scout works to pay his way and to help others. \nHe saves for unforeseen needs. He protects and conserves natural \nresources. He carefully uses time and property. A Scout is brave. A \nScout can face danger, even if he is afraid. He has the courage to \nstand for what he thinks is right, even if others laugh at or threaten \nhim. And they are being threatened today.\n  A Scout is clean. A Scout keeps his body and mind fit and clean. He \ngoes around with those who believe in living by these same ideals. He \nhelps keep his home and community clean. He helps keep his home and \ncommunity clean. A Scout is reverent toward God and faithful in his \nreligious duties. Listen to this one. He respects the beliefs of \nothers.\n\n  I don't see any hate espoused there. In fact, quite the contrary, the \nScout law advocates respecting the beliefs of others. Yet the Scouts' \nbeliefs are not being respected here and they are being singled out for \ndiscrimination, and some are even alleging they are discriminatory. \nHelping others is part of it, as are being gentle and treating others \nwith respect. That is part of their core values. Considering all of the \nviolent and hateful influences which our children are exposed to on an \nhourly basis, I find it supremely ironic that school boards are so \nconcerned with the influence of an organization whose slogan is ``do a \ngood turn daily.''\n  Looking at the Scouts' founding principles may not be enough to clear \nthe record. Perhaps it is better to take them at their word regarding \nthe particular issue of this debate--their stand on having homosexual \nleaders. The question I believe many school boards in the country are \nasking is, Are the Boy Scouts of America a homophobic organization? To \nwhich I would aggressively respond: No. No, they are not. Even in their \nown creed they say ``respect for diversity.''\n  I want to put in a quote the Boy Scouts forwarded:\n\n       The Boy Scouts of America respects the rights of people in \n     groups who hold values that differ from those encompassed in \n     the Scout Oath and Law, and the Boy Scouts of America makes \n     no effort to deny the rights of those whose views differ to \n     hold their attitudes or opinions.\n\n  That is what the Boy Scouts say and do themselves. Scouts come from \nall walks of life. They are exposed to diversity in Scouting that they \nmay not otherwise experience. I know from my work with the Scouts, it \nis a diverse group. It gives a lot of opportunity to a lot of kids. The \nBoy Scouts of America aim to allow youth to live and learn as children \nand enjoy Scouting without immersing them in the politics of the day.\n  I think this last quote from the Boy Scouts is particularly \nappropriate. In truth, this debate is not about the Scouts--it is about \nthe politics of the day into which the Scouts have been swept. They \nhave had this motto, and they have had these views and they have been \nan organization 90 years. As far as the politics of banning one of the \noldest and most noble youth organizations in this country from public \nproperty, we cannot, should not, and we must not let this happen.\n  I call on all of my colleagues in the Senate to pass this worthy \namendment. With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, the Helms amendment is a solution in \nsearch of a problem. The Senator from North Carolina says his amendment \nis needed because schools are excluding the Boy Scouts from using their \nfacilities, and this is simply not true. Just this week, the Supreme \nCourt reaffirmed the right of groups such as the Boy Scouts to use \npublic school facilities. This amendment is about punishing schools \nthat decided to no longer sponsor the Boy Scouts because of their \nexclusionary membership policy.\n  Currently, 359 school districts, with a total of 4,418 schools in 10 \nStates, including Massachusetts, no longer sponsor the Boy Scouts. This \nis the statute in my State of Massachusetts:\n\n       Extracurricular activities, advantages, and privileges of \n     public schools include all extracurricular activities made \n     available, sponsored, or supervised by any public school. No \n     school shall sponsor or participate in the organization of \n     outside extracurricular activities conducted at such school \n     that restricts student participation on the basis of race, \n     color, sex, religion, national origin, or sexual orientation.\n\n  This does not prohibit school committees from allowing the use of \nschool premises by independent groups with restrictive membership. \nTherefore, they can use the facilities. The Massachusetts statute \nindicates they can't be made to sponsor.\n  The Helms amendment is attempting to override the State statute and \nthe decisions being made locally. I think that is unwise, unnecessary, \nand wrong. Although the schools do not sponsor the Boy Scouts, the \nScouts are still given access to school facilities as any other group. \nThe Boy Scouts may have a constitutional right to use public school \nfacilities. They do not have the right to demand school sponsorship. \nYet that is exactly what the amendment allows them to do.\n  The amendment also contains a harsh punishment on the schools that \ndecide no longer to sponsor the Boy Scouts with the loss of all Federal \neducation funds. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against the \nHelms amendment.\n  Madam President, we have been on the floor for 8 weeks attempting to \ntry to fashion and shape legislation that\n\n[[Page S6261]]\n\nwas going to enhance the education of children all over this country. \nWe have a good bill, and it seems to me to be unwise in that effort to \nbring effectively something that these children have no control over. \nWe are giving accountability to the children to exceed themselves in \nthe challenge they are facing. We put additional challenges on \nteachers, on parents, on schools. We are encouraging the States for \ngreater participation and involvement. Now we have this amendment, the \nresults of which would deny the benefits of the advantages of this \nlegislation to reach many different children in our country. It seems \nto me to be unwise. I hope the amendment is defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. As the Chair knows, I obtained unanimous consent that I \nmight deliver my remarks from my chair for obvious reasons.\n  I have listened in fascination to the discussion on the Senate floor \nthis morning and this afternoon. It bears out exactly what I was told \nwas going on in the way of the lining up of opposition on the other \nside to this amendment by the homosexual-lesbian leaders in this area. \nLet me say at the outset that I don't like the corruption of a once \nbeautiful word ``gay'' which has been adopted as a description of \nconduct that is anything but that.\n  It is all right with me if the other side wants to make a political \nfootball out of this thing, but they were not prepared and they had not \nbeen energized when this amendment came up the first time. In any case, \nI have heard here that the Boy Scouts are not being discriminated \nagainst and all of this is false, and so forth and so on.\n  Let me give a few examples. On May 11 of this year, the Associated \nPress reported that the Iowa City school board voted to prohibit the \nBoy Scouts of America from distributing any information in schools \nbecause of the Scouts' membership criteria. A spokesman for the Boy \nScouts of America:\n\n       We simply ask to be treated the same way as any other \n     private organization and that our free speech and right to \n     assemble be respected just as we respect the rights of \n     others.\n\n  On February 8 of this year, the Asbury Park Press reported that the \nState of New Jersey is considering a rule change that would bar school \ndistricts from renting space to the Boy Scouts of America because of \ntheir position on homosexuality.\n  On February 7 of this year, the Arizona Republic reported that the \nSunnyside School District in Tucson decided to charge the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica fees to use school facilities, even though no other groups have \nto pay for use.\n  The ACLU executive director said:\n\n       While Boy Scouts, atheists, Nazis, even satanists have a \n     right to express their views, Government should not use \n     public money to promote them.\n\n  What goes on here? Is this not really an attack by one group on the \nBoy Scouts of America? Of course, it is. Why do you think these people \nhave been standing up and telling how long they served in the Girl \nScouts in a tearful sort of way? The goal here is the goal of the \norganized lesbians and homosexuals in this country of ours.\n  On January 28 of this year, the Boston Globe reported that the Acton \nSchool Committee in Massachusetts decided to prevent the Boy Scouts \nfrom distributing literature at school even though all other groups can \ndo so. In defending its actions, Acton School Committee cited \nMassachusetts law that says schools cannot sponsor Boy Scouts.\n  On January 14 of this year, the New York Times reported that New York \nChappaqua School District officials were able to coerce two local Boy \nScout troops into signing a document that denounced the national \npolicies of the Boy Scouts of America as a condition for allowing these \ntroops access to school property.\n  Don't you see what is going on here? The Supreme Court knocked them \nin the head. The Supreme Court stood up for the Boy Scouts of America, \nexactly as I am trying to stand up for them.\n  I am a little bit sick at my stomach at some of the mewling and \npuking that has gone on in this debate this morning and this afternoon.\n  On January 11 of this year, the News and Observer, my favorite \nnewspaper in Raleigh, NC, said that the Chapel Hill- Carrboro School \nBoard voted to give Scouts until June--la-di-da--either to go against \nthe rule of their organization or lose their sponsorship and meeting \nplaces in schools.\n  I have two or three more pages. If anybody is interested, Madam \nPresident, I will be glad to read them into the Record. Otherwise, I am \ngoing to place them in the Record so they can be examined when the vote \nhas been taken, and if the other side manages to defeat this amendment, \nas has been advocated and worked for by the organized groups to which I \nhave been referring, then it will be there for the public to see who is \nwho and who is for what.\n  I am going to pause momentarily, but I will be back, because Senator \nKyl has been waiting to address this amendment. I thank the Senator for \ncoming. I yield to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I rise in support of the Helms amendment. \nSince 1910, for the past 91 years, the Boy Scouts of America have been \ninstilling in young boys the values of personal responsibility, \ncommunity, and duty to God, respect for individual beliefs, and \npatriotism. Millions of boys have become better citizens because of the \navailability of Scout troops in their communities.\n  I respect the message of the Boy Scouts and respect their commitment \nto instilling these ethical and moral values in young boys. \nUnfortunately, there are some who do not respect the Boy Scouts' \nmessage. Some school boards are taking action to prevent the Boy Scouts \nfrom distributing recruitment information and holding meetings and not, \nas has been suggested, because some more appropriate group needs the \nspace but because of what the Scouts believe. That is why I have chosen \nto speak today to voice my concerns regarding the discrimination the \nBoy Scouts are facing and to support the Helms amendment that will \nallow the good work of the Scouts to continue in schools.\n  Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Boy Scouts' first \namendment right of association to create their own criteria for Scout \nleaders, even if that means prohibiting homosexual leaders in order to \nuphold its focus on strong moral values. That was in Boy Scouts v. \nDale.\n  Since that critical Supreme Court decision, the Boy Scouts have \nexperienced serious discrimination for exercising their \nconstitutionally protected rights, and that is not right.\n  Boy Scout troops across America are facing obstacles put in place by \nschool boards. In a Wall Street Journal article from last July, it was \nnoted that poor minority children will suffer the most as a result of \nthis all-out attack on the Boy Scouts.\n  It is vital to hold Scout meetings in local public schools, \nparticularly in inner-city neighborhoods because often that is the only \nsafe place for these kids to congregate.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts said the amendment is a solution \nlooking for a problem, but the Congressional Research Service has \nreported already nine specific school boards have taken action to \nrestrict Boy Scout access to public school facilities. The Senator from \nNorth Carolina had just gotten started reciting a litany of examples \nwhere this has occurred and apparently has several more pages from \nwhich he can read.\n  This is a problem, unfortunately, that requires a solution, and the \npoint of his amendment is to stop the trend so we do not have any more \nexamples and so the Boy Scouts do not have to continually litigate \nevery time they want to enforce their constitutional rights.\n  This Congress has taken action over and over where the Supreme Court \nhas guaranteed rights to a group or an individual or a cause of one \nkind or another, and we have sought to embody in the law a remedy so \nthat the entity or the group does not have to constantly go to court to \nbattle for these constitutionally guaranteed rights. That is what is \nmeaningful about the kind of action that is being proposed today.\n  An example as recently as November 2000, the Broward County School \nBoard voted to prevent the Boy Scouts altogether from using public \nschools to hold meetings and recruitment drives. They challenged this \nin the Federal\n\n[[Page S6262]]\n\ncourt, and the Boy Scouts won the initial victory.\n  In March 2001, the district court issued a preliminary injunction \nthat will allow the Boy Scouts to continue their regular meetings and \nrecruitment.\n  Yes, it is true that some have argued there is a remedy for the Boy \nScouts to enforce their constitutionally protected rights. Why wouldn't \nwe want to assist them so they do not have to go through expensive \ncourt litigation every time another school board decides to take this \nkind of discriminatory action.\n\n  This past Monday, the Supreme Court held that a public school \nviolated the Christian organization's free speech rights by excluding \nthe club from meeting after school. The Court found the school was \ndiscriminating against the club because of its religious nature, and \nthe Court rejected this viewpoint discrimination.\n  More and more the Court is acknowledging the fact it is appropriate \nfor us to protect these kinds of rights. There are about 85,000 Cub \nScouts and Boy Scouts in my own State of Arizona. They rely on every \npublic elementary school in Arizona to open the cafeteria or another \nroom in afterschool meetings and help Scouts distribute information.\n  I have gone to these schools and participated in the awarding of \nEagle Scout badges, for example. I suspect almost all of us have done \nthat, and it makes us feel very good to be supporting these youngsters \nwho really want to become very good citizens.\n  Even in my State of Arizona, the Boy Scouts have been subjected to \nthis kind of discriminatory practice by school boards. One district \noutside of Tucson will simply not sponsor Scouting anymore. It has \nnothing to do with the need of other school activities for the space \nthat has been devoted to the Scouts.\n  Another school district began charging fees for the Scouts to use its \nfacilities, but the same district does not charge a fee for any other \ngroup. Why charge the Scouts? The district said the Boy Scouts do not \nmeet the goals and objectives of the school district.\n  In another district, school employees took it upon themselves to \nthrow away recruitment fliers in order to prevent the Boy Scouts from \ngetting its information out to the students.\n  I think the need for this is clear. The Boy Scouts need our help to \nensure equal access to our public schools. They should not be forced to \ncontinually go to court to protect their constitutionally guaranteed \nrights.\n  If they are denied access for legitimate purposes, this amendment \ndoes not apply. It is only to enforce their right against \ndiscrimination. They are experiencing hostility and exclusion from some \npublic schools. It has to stop.\n\n  The Helms amendment ensures they are not going to have to go to court \nto protect their rights. They will continue to be able to meet and \nteach young boys strong moral values. I hope others will join in \nsupporting this very important and needed amendment to this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to \ndiscuss this issue. I think it is an important issue. There is a real \nproblem we need to wake up and face. As a former Boy Scout and former \nEagle Scout, I feel strongly about it and want to share some remarks on \nthe subject.\n  We grew up in a little community outside of town with nine boys in \nthe community. Of the nine, eight became Eagle Scouts and one was a \nLife Scout. We always teased him, why he didn't finish, and he always \nsaid he regretted not having completed the program, one step from being \nan Eagle Scout.\n  Every Thursday evening, we went to town, and we had to pool our cars. \nA parent or kids who had their license would drive to our meeting. We \nwould do camps together. We did the Scout oath and Scout laws every \nThursday night:\n\n       On my honor I will do my best\n       To do my duty to God and my country\n       And to obey the Scout law;\n       To help other people at all times;\n       To keep myself physically strong,\n       mentally awake,\n       and morally straight.\n\n  I never thought that much about it, but over the years that had an \nimpact on my life. In our town, people remained in Scouts into their \nsenior year in high school.\n  The first time I came to Washington was with a Boy Scout troop. We \nhad a 50th anniversary of that troop, and 60 had been Eagle Scouts. \nFrom the 9 boys of my little community, 15 miles outside of the town, \nevery one of them had a full degree from college, several have Ph.D.'s, \nlaw degrees, and advanced degrees. One is a medical doctor. One is a \ndentist.\n  It meant a lot to me. We also did the Scout laws every Thursday \nnight: A scout is trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, \nkind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty--that is a good word we don't use \nmuch anymore--brave, clean, and reverent. The word ``God'' is used and \nthe word ``reverent'' is used, but it is decidedly not a sectarian \norganization. Not one bit of the literature or otherwise suggests that. \nTo the contrary, it is an organization that encourages boys to develop \na spiritual side and to recognize that they are indeed more than a \nrandom collection of particles but are created persons. That is a key \ncomponent of the Boy Scouts.\n  Several years ago my friend, Senator Enzi from Wyoming, talked about \nbeing an Eagle Scout, as is his son. He told a story about the \nWashington zoo in the U.S. capital. The Washington zoo would not allow \nthe Boy Scouts to have a Court of Honor. And, by the way, one of the \nfounders of the Washington zoo was one of the founders of Boy Scouts. \nThey were not allowed because they discriminate against atheists. The \noath required that boys do their duty to God. They said if you were an \natheist, you could not take the oath; therefore, you were a \ndiscriminatory organization and you could not use the property at the \nWashington zoo to have a Court of Honor.\n  We raised that point. It was not lightly taken. There were letters \nwritten to defend it. But when confronted with it, the leader of the \nzoo capitulated and apologized and said that was not a good policy and \nthey would not continue to adhere to it.\n  What is troubling to me is that we have skirted the issue some, but \nthere is a group of Americans who believe very strongly--and I don't \ndisparage their motives--that the Boy Scouts' position on gay \nScoutmasters is not appropriate, and they have set about to punish the \nBoy Scouts. I don't think there is anybody here who would deny it. They \nare politically active. They work United Fund committees, and they work \nschool boards and city councils. And they seek to get them to eliminate \nBoy Scouts from public facilities. That is what is happening. There is \nno mystery about that.\n\n  We give a lot of Federal money to school systems. I don't believe \nevery time something irritates us that the Federal Government ought to \nget involved, but I feel strongly abut this. The Supreme Court of the \nUnited States upheld the right of the Boy Scouts to make this \ndetermination.\n  Some say there is no discrimination going on against the Scouts. \nThere plainly is. It will plainly continue. As far as I am concerned, \nif there is a school system in America that says to a little Boy Scout \ntroop, such as troop 94 in Camden, AL, you can't have a meeting on \nschool grounds because of your policy concerning your leadership and \nthe behavior of your members, you can't have it here, even though the \nSupreme Court said yes, as far as I am concerned, they don't need \nFederal money and I am not voting to give it to them.\n  That is where we are. I am not sure exactly how the language is going \nto come out. I know Senator Helms would like to make sure there was the \nleast possible controversy over it. I would like that also. I firmly \nbelieve we ought to affirm through governmental entities and \norganizations the kind of character-building program to which the Boy \nScouts are committed. ``Do a good turn daily'' is the motto.\n  I read and clipped an article that brought tears to my eyes, an \narticle in one of the newspapers about Boy Scouts in Rwanda. They had \nall their uniforms confiscated, but they had their kerchiefs. The \npicture with that article showed those Scouts at a hospital in war-torn \nRwanda, cutting the grass. They were interviewed, and they said: We \nalways do a good turn daily. I\n\n[[Page S6263]]\n\ntried to get them some help. The article went on to say that when the \ntotalitarian leader took over, he oppressed the Scouts; he took their \nuniforms and their books, and he forced all the young people to join, \nfor lack of a better word, a Hitler-type youth group of which everybody \nhad to be a part. They refused. They stayed true to their oath. Under \noppression we have the finest example of commitment. That was very \nmoving to me.\n  These ideals are wonderful ideals. I find it difficult for anyone to \nconclude that there is something unhealthy in the way the Boy Scouts do \nbusiness. It ought to be affirmed and nurtured. A school system that \nwill not provide them their constitutional right does not deserve a \ndime of Federal money, in my opinion. I think the Helms amendment will \nhelp deal with that and get some attention from around the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today, the U.S. Senate made a strong \nstatement in support of the right of the Boy Scouts of America and \nother youth groups to enjoy equal access and a fair opportunity to use \nthe facilities of our Nation's public schools. I am proud to have \njoined my Senate colleagues in supporting an amendment to S. 1, the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, which will codify in Federal \nlaw recent decisions by the Supreme Court of the United States \nupholding these basic rights of equality and fairness for the Boy \nScouts.\n  I am also a strong supporter of the right of private organizations \nsuch as the Boy Scouts to organize as they wish. My son was on Eagle \nScout, and I know firsthand the values on which the Boy Scouts and the \nGirl Scouts stand. The Scouts stand for strong moral character, duty to \nGod, a respect for the rule of law, service to others and loyalty and \nallegiance to country. Based upon these high standards, the Boy Scouts \nand any such private organization should be allowed to determine its \nown membership without interference. This prerogative has been upheld \nby the U.S. Supreme Court as recently as this week, and I commend the \nSenate for endorsing this fundamental right.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by the Senator from North Carolina, Senator Helms. This \namendment, the Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act, is very clear in \nits purpose, which is ``To prohibit the use of Federal funds by any \nState or local educational agency or school that discriminates against \nthe Boy Scouts of America in providing equal access to school premises \nor facilities.'' I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  It is appropriate that this amendment be considered and adopted on \nthis education bill. Since its founding in 1910, the Boy scouts of \nAmerica, BSA, has complemented youth education with a program that \nteaches skills and values that will help those youth throughout their \nlifetimes. Over the past 91 years, more than 100 million young men and \nwomen have been served by Scouting. For those young people, Scouting \nhas provided a program of values and leadership, joined with an \nopportunity to improve themselves by helping others.\n  The BSA is primarily concerned about the youth it serves. Its mission \nstatement states: ``The mission of the Boy Scouts of America is to \nprepare young people to make ethical choices over their lifetimes by \ninstilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law.'' The Scouting \nprogram has three specific objectives, commonly referred to as the \n``Aims of Scouting.'' They are character development, citizenship \ntraining, and personal fitness. The methods by which the aims are \nachieved are Advancement, Uniforms, Outdoor Program and Skills, Youth \nLeadership, Patrol Method, Community Service, and Adult Association. In \naddition, the Scouting Program through a variety of means works to \nprevent child abuse, drug abuse, hunger, functional illiteracy, and \nteen unemployment.\n  Scouting has become an American institution, a natural element in \nmost communities. Scouts exemplify the values outlined in the Scout \nOath and Law and dedicate themselves to serving their communities.\n  The BSA respects the rights of people and groups who hold values that \ndiffer from those encompassed in the Scout Oath and Laws, and the BSA \nmakes no effort to deny the rights of those whose views differ to hold \ntheir attitudes or opinions. Likewise, the Boy Scouts of America aims \nto allow youth to live and to learn as children and enjoy Scouting \nwithout immersing them in the politics of the day. Unfortunately, \ncertain groups dissatisfied with the Boy Scouts of America's membership \npolicies and the moral views on which they are based have suggested \nthat the BSA not have the privilege of meeting in public schools or \ndistributing recruitment information at public schools. I do not agree \nwith that suggestion. Just as other student or community groups are \npermitted to have access to public school facilities, the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica should have the same access.\n  I am proud of my association with the Boy Scouts of America. I \nstrongly support the amendment that would permit the Boy Scouts to have \nequal access to public school facilities. This amendment is consistent \nwith the decision by the United States Supreme Court which reaffirmed \nthe Boy Scouts of America's standing as a private organization with the \nright to set its own membership and leadership standards.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the amendment offered by Senator Helms \nentitled the ``Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act'' aims to ensure \nthat the Boy Scouts of America has access to our nations' public school \nfacilities. The Boy Scouts already have access to our public schools, \naccess that is guaranteed by the Constitution. As recently as this past \nMonday, the Supreme Court confirmed in the case of Good News Club v. \nMilford Central School that when a public school establishes a limited \nopen forum, the school may not discriminate on the basis of viewpoint \namong groups wishing to use that forum. Under that decision and its \npredecessors, the Boy Scouts already have the same right to use public \nschools as any other group. We do not need to echo the Constitution's \nclear protections through an amendment to the reauthorization of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  Moreover, this amendment does more than simply reiterate what the \nSupreme Court has already made clear about access to our public \nschools. It conditions federal funding on the willingness of school \ndistricts to accept groups with ``membership or leadership criteria, \nthat prohibit the acceptance of homosexuals.'' Districts that refuse \nspace to any groups besides the Boy Scouts, or groups with similar \nviews on homosexuality, are subject to no Congressionally-mandated \npenalty. Indeed, the only specially protected viewpoint under the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act would become the refusal to \naccept gays and lesbians. I am uncomfortable with the Congress \nendorsing these particular views above all others, and I believe that \nthe courts would likely find this to be impermissible viewpoint \ndiscrimination. The Supreme Court has stated that: ``Regulations which \npermit the Government to discriminate on the basis of the content of \nthe message cannot be tolerated under the First Amendment.'' Simon & \nSchuster, Inc. v. Members of the N.Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 112 S. \nCt. 501, 508 (1991). In my opinion, this amendment would do precisely \nwhat the Court has said the First Amendment prohibits.\n  I oppose the Helms amendment because it accomplishes nothing except \nto provide special and unprecedented protection for one particular and \ndeeply controversial view, the Boy Scouts' decision to ``prohibit the \nacceptance of homosexuals.'' This is not the job of Congress, and it \nshould not interfere with the important work we are doing to reform our \neducation system. It is also worth noting that this amendment does not \nprevent schools from withdrawing their sponsorship of the Boy Scouts, \nas some supporters have stated. It simply guarantees the organization \nthe access that they already have.\n  This amendment is unnecessary. This debate needs to be about the \neducation of our children, about pressing problems such as providing \nhigh quality teachers; ensuring access to technology; funding programs \nto assist low-income and disadvantaged students;\n\n[[Page S6264]]\n\nand, renovating and repairing deteriorating schools. We have had a good \ndebate on these issues over the past several weeks and have done so in \na bipartisan and cooperative manner. As we come to what may be the \nclosing hours of our consideration of the critical issue of education \nreform, I urge my colleagues to maintain the focus on our school \nchildren and the quality of the programs, facilities and services they \nreceive and to oppose this divisive and unnecessary amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Helms \namendment. Under our Federal Constitution and laws, public schools are \nalready required to provide equal access to their facilities. This \namendment, therefore, is unnecessary. As such, its only result would be \nto divide our communities rather than bring them together.\n  It is unfortunate that an organization that has meant so much to our \nnation has now become the object of a larger debate on civil rights and \nnational unity. This amendment is not a vote on the legitimacy of the \nBoy Scouts as a national institution. Rather, it is a vote on the \ndirection in which we want our country to go.\n  I have heard from constituents who are opposed to this amendment. One \nwas a teacher who spoke eloquently to the divisiveness of the \namendment. He wrote:\n\n       Dear Senator Feinstein:\n       As your constituent, I strongly urge to oppose the Helms \n     amendment to the Education Bill (S. 1), which would deny all \n     Federal education funding to any school that has been found \n     to discriminate against the Boy Scouts or any other youth \n     group that denies membership to gays and lesbians.\n       Aside from being politically divisive and unrelated to the \n     underlying bill, the Helms amendment is completely \n     unnecessary and is a punishment in search of a problem. The \n     use of public school facilities is governed by the First \n     Amendment. The Helms amendment does nothing to further the \n     goals of improving education and serves only as an anti-gay \n     attack. I urge you to oppose this amendment and look forward \n     to hearing your views on this important issue.\n\n  Other constituents voiced their concerns about the message of \nintolerance such an amendment would carry if passed. A family from \nValley Glen, CA wrote:\n\n       We are very much offended by the discrimination that the \n     [Boy Scouts of America] is able to operate with under the \n     blessings of the U.S. Supreme Court. On one hand we applaud \n     the actions of school boards, city councils, police \n     departments, corporations and United Way agencies for \n     standing up for what they believe. On the other hand, as \n     members of Temple Beth Hillel (Valley Village, CA), we are \n     quite proud of our Pack 311 and Rabbi Jim Kaufman's stand \n     that the basic program is great and that the best way to make \n     change is from within.\n       Additionally, as a family who is very active in the Girl \n     Scouts . . ., we are quite proud that [the Girl Scouts] are \n     inclusive of all girls and their families.\n       Our tax dollars should not be used to support the \n     discrimination that the ``Boys Scouts Equal Access Act'' is \n     trying to affirm. We urge you to help to defeat this act and \n     to help to hold the [Boy Scouts of America] to the same \n     standards that the country as a whole is striving for. The \n     [Boys Scout of America] is a great American institution \n     and we hope that it can continue to be so following the \n     same non-discriminatory rules as the rest of the country.\n\n  Here are my views on the matter: first, the Supreme Court has already \nspoken to the issue of equal access for private organizations. Last \nyear, the Court ruled in Dale v. Boy Scouts of America that the Boy \nScouts had a First Amendment right to prohibit gay men and lesbians \nfrom serving as leaders in the Boy Scouts. What this decision means is \nthat the governments cannot directly penalize the Boy Scouts for \nconstitutionally protected views and policies, as the New Jersey public \naccommodations law had sought to do in the case. Nor can they \nindirectly penalize the Scouts by denying access to public facilities \nand other benefits available to other private groups.\n  So, for me, the matter is settled. Already a school must allow access \nto an organization like the Boy Scouts, regardless of the \norganization's viewpoints, or risk losing federal funding. The \nConstitution already protects the Boy Scouts and similar youth groups, \nso there is no reason for Congress to intervene.\n  I also oppose the Helms amendment because of its sweeping potential \nto limit the rights of state and local governments to make decisions \nfor their own school districts, and for their own children, as to their \ncommunities' tolerance of discrimination. One provision of the \namendment in particular troubles me: It would provide special \nprotection to groups that prohibit the acceptance of homosexuals. \nBasically, it singles out for protection a type of discrimination. A \nconsensus developing in our country is that discrimination of this kind \nis wrong. Across the nation, local jurisdictions are voting to prohibit \ndiscrimination against gays and lesbians.\n  In my hometown of San Francisco, a city that prides itself on the \ndiversity of its views and the diversity of its people, a cornerstone \nof the community is its belief that basic civil rights protections \nshould extend to every American, and not only to a few and under \ncertain circumstances. A vote in favor of this amendment would be an \nindictment against the people of San Francisco and of their rich \ntradition of accepting others.\n  And it would be an indictment of the many other communities \nthroughout California and the rest of the nation that promote diversity \nand tolerance for all. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, \nwhich would foster a sense of division and disunity.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the work of the Boy Scouts of America is \ncommendable, and I am proud to have been a Boy Scout. However, I must \noppose the amendment offered by the Senator from North Carolina, Mr. \nHelms, on constitutional grounds.\n  The Helms amendment would prohibit federal education funding for \nschools, school districts, or States that deny access to their \nfacilities to the Boy Scouts, or other such organizations that \ndiscriminate based on sexual orientation. In fact, the Supreme Court \nhas already held that if school districts provide some groups access to \ntheir facilities as an open forum, they must provide all groups equal \naccess to those facilities. The Helms amendment is not needed to assure \nthe Boy Scouts equal access if a local school district decides to open \nits facilities to outside groups.\n  Regrettably, the effect of the Helms amendment as drafted is to give \nspecific groups additional rights to school resources not afforded to \nother groups. As such, the amendment would thus violate the first \namendment by singling out groups that discriminate on the basis of \nsexual orientation for special treatment. Just as government may not \nretaliate against or be hostile toward a particular viewpoint, it may \nnot endorse or show favoritism toward such a message. I do not believe \nthat the Federal Government should single out particular policies for \nspecial protection using the power of education funding.\n  Because the Helms amendment violates the first amendment, I will vote \n``no.'' I hope that the amendment can be revised in conference to \nprotect all groups from unfair treatment at the hands of federally \nfunded schools based on the views that they express. That would be the \nright, and the constitutional, way to handle this issue.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to share my thoughts on \nSenator Helms' amendment that would deny Federal education funds to \nschools that deny access to the Boy Scouts of America.\n  I want to be very clear that my vote against this amendment in no way \nrepresents a vote against the Boy Scouts of America. I have always \nbeen, and will continue to be, a strong supporter of the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica. The Boy Scouts provides an opportunity for our children to \ncreate and accomplish goals, increasing their sense of self worth and \ndiscipline. Boy Scouts learn about the importance of maintaining \nrespect and honor for themselves and others, and Scouts are often \nexcellent role models for their peers. I am firmly convinced that \norganizations like the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts play an important \nrole in the development of well-adjusted and productive children.\n  I voted against this amendment because I felt it provided a Federal \nsolution to a local issue, and I think that is wrong. Under current \nlaw, local school board members decide which organizations are \npermitted to meet in their schools. I want community members and school \nboard members to continue to have that ability. They know best what \ntheir children need, and their decisions reflect local values and \npriorities.\n  I further want to point out that the Boy Scouts already have equal \naccess\n\n[[Page S6265]]\n\nto our schools under current law. I firmly believe that the Boy Scouts \nshould be allowed in our schools, and I am pleased that the Supreme \nCourt has upheld the right of the Boy Scouts to have equal access to \nour public schools. Should there be cases where the Boy Scouts are \ndenied access to our schools, I think our judicial system is well \npositioned to determine whether a school's decision was fairly and \nequitably reached.\n  I felt that this Supreme Court decision fairly addressed the issue of \nequal access while keeping control at the local level. I further felt \nthat this decision would give the necessary support to the Boy Scouts \nof America to meet in our schools without necessitating Congressional \nintervention. For these reasons, I voted against this amendment.\n  In my mind, a better alternative, in the form of an amendment \nintroduced by Senator Boxer, existed. I supported that amendment, which \naffirms the right of the Boy Scouts to meet in our schools without \nimposing a Federal mandate.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, if I could direct a question to the \nSenator from North Carolina, does the Senator have an idea how much \nlonger he wishes to have this matter debated, just so we can inform \nSenators when we can expect a vote?\n  Mr. HELMS. I would say not more than 4 more hours.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator has said for not more than 4 more hours, so \neveryone should keep that in mind. If Senator Helms uses the time he \nwants, we would vote about 5:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I was listening to the debate and wanted \nto come down and offer a few thoughts.\n  First of all, I have heard all the people talking about their days in \nScouting. I wish I could add to those voices except I was not \nnecessarily the cleanest cut kid in the world. As a matter of fact, I \ntried Scouting for only about 3 weeks. So I cannot join the chorus of \nthose who were Eagle Scouts and made it on to the U.S. Senate. But \nscouting was something that I witnessed growing up. I saw a lot of \npeople whose lives it transformed. Perhaps if I had stayed with \nScouting my life would have been transformed a little earlier than it \notherwise was.\n  I have seen many children over the years whose lives have been \ninfluenced so greatly by Scouting. The Eagle Scout ceremonies I have \ngone to honor incredible people. They honor not only the Scouts \nthemselves, but the leaders of the Scout troops who dedicate so many \nhours to young people and their development. These are the types of \nactivities we should be encouraging.\n  But I also wanted to add a few words. We do not want to be gay \nbashing around this Chamber. At least I do not believe we should be. \nPeople have the right to live their lives as they choose to live their \nlives. But I believe in freedom in America. I believe, for instance, if \nthere was a group of people who believe in a gay lifestyle, they may \nrequire that same lifestyle or belief of their leadership. I believe \nthat group should be allowed all of its constitutional rights; the \nright to require that their leaders have their same beliefs. This is, \nto me, a matter of freedom.\n  The Boy Scouts have chosen what they want and what they determine as \ntheir organization. In America, we should be able to have these types \nof organizations.\n  As a matter of fact, there is a group called the Royal Rangers. For \nthose who are not familiar with the Royal Rangers, they are Christian \norganizations who believe that the Boy Scouts have become too \nsecularized. So the Royal Rangers was formed to bring more of a \nChristian perspective to scouting because they did not feel that the \nBoy Scouts were meeting their religious needs.\n  The point of that is they did not try to change the Boy Scouts. They \nrespected the Boy Scouts' right to believe and to operate how they were \noperating. But instead of trying to destroy the Boy Scouts or try to \nhurt the Boy Scouts, they formed their own organization based on their \nown beliefs. That is the direction we should be going in this country.\n  If people want to form their own organization, they can form it based \non their own beliefs--that really is what America is supposed to be \nabout. This amendment here simply says that a group that has a certain \nbelief system, and has proven that their belief system leads to good \ncitizenship, then we should be encouraging this group. We should not be \ndiscriminating against those groups going into our public school \nsystems.\n  I hope we can get a bipartisan vote in favor of this amendment. I \nbelieve that in the long run this amendment will be good for America \nbecause I believe the Boy Scouts are good for America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, this is just to notify Senators, Democrats \nand Republicans, that when this amendment is finished, whatever time \nthat may be, we have a number of other matters that will be completed \ntoday. Whenever this amendment is completed, we have a number of other \nimportant amendments to move to. Senator Gregg told me earlier today he \nhas at least one other amendment that could take a little bit of time, \nmaybe two other amendments. But this is to notify everyone we are going \nto work tonight until we finish this bill. If we cannot finish it late \ntonight, then we will come back tomorrow and finish it. It was \nannounced as early as Monday. We are going to work until we finish this \nbill. I know people feel very strongly about this issue and other \nissues developed during the day.\n  We want to make sure everyone has every opportunity to speak and let \nthe Senate know how they feel. But I think there is a time that comes \nwhen we have to vote. As my friend, Mo Udall, said in the House one \ntime when he came to appear before a committee: Everything has been \nsaid, but not everyone has said it.\n  I think we may be arriving at that point in the near future on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, it is, frankly, really a \nsad day when we have to be here on the floor of the Senate to defend \nthe Boy Scouts of America as if they have done something wrong and they \nhave to be defended.\n  I have seen a lot of things since I have been in this place. We have \nhad a lot of interesting debates on a lot of interesting subjects. I \nsit at the desk of Daniel Webster. Daniel Webster didn't know about the \nBoy Scouts of America in his time. I cannot imagine what Webster would \nthink if he were here today to listen to this debate--or Washington or \nJefferson or any of the great leaders.\n  I rise today without equivocation to support the amendment of my \nfriend from North Carolina, to protect one of America's treasures, the \nBoy Scouts of America.\n  I would like to call your attention to the photograph behind me \nduring the course of these brief remarks. These are the bad people we \nare keeping out of our schools, these young boys. I had two sons who \nwere Boy Scouts. I was a Boy Scout.\n  I can't think of anybody who is hurt to be a Boy Scout. When you talk \nabout precluding ``the Scouts,'' the Boy Scouts from being in a school, \nwhat does that mean? Does it mean if a Boy Scout comes in in his \nuniform for his class, is he going to be thrown out of class and sent \nhome? I guarantee you, if some boy came into class and created a \ndisturbance, it is highly unlikely he would be thrown out of class \nunder the current rules and regulations that some teachers have to \nface.\n  I am trying to be as unemotional as I can about this, but this is \nsuch an outrage. The organization, the Boy Scouts of America, has one \nof the most rich traditions and history in American history, in \nAmerican culture for all time. How many Boy Scouts are there whose \nnames are on that Vietnam Wall? How many Boy Scouts were in the \ngreatest generation that Tom Brokaw talked about? How many Boy Scouts \nled the fight in World War I? How many?\n  These are the boys we want to keep from having their meetings in \nschools that receive billions of taxpayer dollars. I never thought I \nwould see the day when I would have to stand on the Senate floor and go \nto bat for the Boy Scouts to have that right. But do you know what. \nSenator Helms, I am proud to stand here with you and do it.\n  We need to do it. Then we will do it. I am with him.\n\n[[Page S6266]]\n\n  The Boy Scouts of America was recognized by Federal charter in 1916 \nto provide an educational program for boys and men to build character \nand to train citizens--yes--to promote reverence for God and country. \nHow horrible that must be. We are going to promote reverence for God \nand country in this time of political correctness. Isn't it awful that \nsomebody might take an oath of allegiance to God and country? What are \nwe coming to? How bad does it have to get before we wake up?\n  Some of the people who are standing here today in opposition to \nSenator Helms on this amendment not too long ago were standing on this \nfloor defending the right to immerse a crucifix in urine and get \nFederal dollars to display it as art--the same people. That is what we \nhave come to in America. God bless us.\n  The largest voluntary youth organization and movement in the world--\nthe Boy Scouts--is under siege right on the Senate floor. Six million \nAmerican boys are members from a wide diversity--religious, ethnic, \neconomic, disability, special needs, honor students, Eagle Scouts, all \nof it--are under siege.\n  A large number of Boy Scouts are sponsored by local churches. They \nmeet in church basements.\n  This tradition should be revered and protected by the Federal \nGovernment, not attacked by the Federal Government. We shouldn't \ndiscriminate against an organization because it teaches boys morality.\n  Senator Helms says we are going to condition Federal education money \non a State or locality not discriminating against the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica. And Senator Helms is right. He is absolutely right. In your \nheart you know he is right.\n  On June 28, 2000, the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case \nBoy Scouts of America v. Dale, upheld the first amendment rights of Boy \nScouts of America to maintain its almost century-old moral code and its \nstandard for membership and leadership.\n  The Supreme Court concluded that the Boy Scouts have a right under \nthe first amendment to set standards for membership and leadership by \nconcluding that the first amendment protects the right of a private \norganization to determine its own membership.\n  The Senate has conditions for membership in this body. Maybe we \nshouldn't have any conditions. Should we be attacked by the same \ngroups?\n  The Boy Scouts embrace the following oath. I want to repeat that \noath. I think it has been repeated here before. But it is the central \npurpose of why we are here. Why does Senator Helms need to be here to \noffer this amendment to protect the Boy Scouts? Why? Here is their \nhonor code and the oath that they take:\n\n       On my honor I will do my best\n       To do my duty to God and my country\n       And to obey the Scout law;\n       To help other people at all times;\n       To keep myself physically strong,\n       mentally awake,\n       and morally straight.\n\n  These boys, and boys like them, by the millions, are being told they \ncan't even have a meeting in their school or in a school in some \ncommunities across America.\n  I will tell you something. Rome died from a lot less than this. When \nyou dilute your moral code to this extent, and if this keeps up, the \nobituary for America is going to be written. And it is sad to see it is \nbeing written here on the floor of the Senate.\n\n  When the count is taken, I know where I want to be, and I know where \nSenator Helms is going to be.\n  This is wrong, pure and simple. It is wrong to do this to this \norganization. There is an organized campaign against the Boy Scouts. It \nis under siege by the American Civil Liberties Union. It is attacked.\n  The Boy Scouts have recently suffered discrimination and unfounded \naccusations of prejudice resulting in discriminatory actions being \ntaken against the organization and its members.\n  I know this has been said before. It is not meant to be a cheap shot. \nIt is meant to bring up a point. Senator Byrd talked about it.\n  Delegates at the Democratic National Convention on August 17, 2000, \nbooed the Boy Scouts while the Boy Scouts were leading the delegates in \nthe Pledge of Allegiance. Not all Democrats did that. Very few \nDemocrats did that. But they did it. No one threw them out of the \nconvention. No one threw them out of the meeting. They sat there under \ntheir rights booing the Boy Scouts for leading their convention. If I \nhad been a Democrat at that meeting, I would have sought them out and \nhad them thrown out. What a sad day in America.\n  On September 5, 2000, in Framingham, MA, the superintendent of \nschools considered prohibiting the local Boy Scout troop from \nrecruiting other Scouts on school grounds for exercising their \nconstitutionally protected rights. Can you believe that? They cannot \neven recruit a Boy Scout on the grounds of Framingham, MA, schools.\n  You wonder why we have problems in America. Should you really be \nsurprised when you hear that children shoot children or children commit \ncrimes or children don't respect their parents or children don't \nrespect their authority? What are we telling them? What message are we \nsending here? How bad does it have to get before America wakes up?\n  We are in this age of political correctness. That is what we are \ntalking about here--political correctness.\n  Another shocking example of this same thing is in Robbinsdale \ndistrict elementary school in Minnesota. One of the teachers in that \nschool states that she will not let the Boy Scouts into her classroom.\n  Again, is that the Boy Scouts, the organization, a Boy Scout in his \nuniform--or a Girl Scout, for that matter?\n  The teacher wrote to the State attorney general:\n\n       Schools and teachers who continue to do business as usual \n     with the Boy Scouts of America participate in discrimination \n     through complicity, acceptance through silence. I will not.\n\n  That was printed in the Star Tribune on September 3, 2000.\n  The State of Connecticut has banned contributions to the Boy Scouts--\nbanned contributions to the Boy Scouts by State employees through a \nState-run charity. Can you believe that? It is unbelievable. I never \nthought I would live to see the day that this would happen in this \ncountry.\n  If Jefferson, Madison, Hamilton, and Washington aren't rolling in \ntheir graves now, I can't imagine what would ever motivate them to.\n  Let's look at some of the horrible, terrible things the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica do.\n  Let me read from the Bergen County Record of May 29, 2001. This is a \ngood example of what the Boy Scouts do:\n\n       Americans marked Memorial Day with solemn remembrance by \n     making pilgrimages to grave sides, bearing flowers and flags \n     to honor soldiers who sacrificed their lives in battle.\n       ``It means a lot to me, coming out here and seeing the \n     veterans,'' said Boy Scout Lee Booker, 15, as he helped place \n     miniature American flags at the foot of 46,850 veterans \n     headstones at the Memphis National Cemetery in Tennessee.\n\n  And those boys can't meet on school grounds? And you wonder why we \nare losing our kids.\n  Is it time to defund the Boy Scouts of America? Is this the group \nthat we want to expel from our public schools? That is what this is all \nabout.\n  I applaud the Boy Scouts for all the wonderful contributions that \ngroup has provided to American society. I am proud to have an Eagle \nScout on my staff--one that I know of; there may be more. Jeff \nMarschner is a shining example of what an important contribution the \nBoy Scouts of America make to all of us.\n\n  They ought to be held in esteem. When they ask to have a meeting, \nthey ought to be asked: Which room do you want?\n  What have they done that is so wrong? The answer is, nothing. What \nthey have done is so right. And they are being punished for it.\n  I am going to say it: Every leader in this country who takes that \nposition--local, State, or Federal--ought to have to pay a political \nprice for it. I would say to my critics on this: What were you doing on \nMemorial Day while the Boy Scouts of Tennessee were placing miniature \nAmerican flags on the tombstones of Tennessee soldiers?\n  All persons have the right of freedom of speech and freedom of \nassociation. And the Boy Scouts have earned theirs. I hold the first \namendment rights of every American in esteem. Freedom of association is \nfundamental. I do not support the Government attacking groups because \nof their membership\n\n[[Page S6267]]\n\npolicies. Some membership policies I don't like. I don't like the KKK. \nI don't like the skinheads. I don't like those organizations. And \nanybody who can stand in this Senate Chamber and equate them to the Boy \nScouts has a real serious problem.\n  If the first amendment is gutted for the cause of forcing the Boy \nScouts to change their membership policies, what is next?\n  The Boy Scouts, as an organization, is empowered by our Constitution \nto determine their own membership criteria--not the Federal Government, \nnot a State, not a local government, not a local school board, not a \nmayor, not a Governor, not the President, not any unelected bureaucrat \nin this country. Only the Boy Scouts have a right under the \nConstitution of the United States to determine their membership \nrequirements for their Boy Scouts, for these boys. That is who has the \nobligation and the responsibility to do it, and no one else under this \nConstitution.\n  Children--boys, girls--are this Nation's most precious resource. Yet \nthis is what we do to them in this Senate Chamber--unbelievable.\n  I support the Helms amendment. I have never been prouder in my entire \npolitical life than I am today to stand here with Senator Jesse Helms \nin support of this amendment. I cannot think of one issue that I have \never stood here and talked about that I am more proud to do than what I \nam doing today. It is not discriminatory. It is fair and simple. It is \nto protect the Boy Scouts from discrimination, that Boy Scouts cannot \nbe banned from schools that receive millions and millions--and \nbillions--of dollars.\n  The education bill has money. This bill has money, more money than we \nhave ever given to education from this body. And all Senator Helms is \nasking is that governments that accept this money not discriminate \nagainst these young men, and young men like them, shown in this \npicture. Is that asking too much? I certainly hope not.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. If the other side is willing to yield back its time, I \nwill yield back my time.\n  Mr. REID. We have no time to yield back, but we are ready for a vote, \nMadam President.\n  Mr. HELMS.

The yeas and nays have already been ordered. \nThe question now is on agreeing to Helms amendment No. 648. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 51, nays 49, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 189 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--51\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Carnahan\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Johnson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--49\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The amendment (No. 648) was agreed to.\n\n\n                             Change of Vote\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, on rollcall vote 189, I voted yea. It \nwas my intention to vote nay. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent I be \npermitted to change the vote since it will not affect the outcome.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, may we have order in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent to explain my vote. I ask unanimous \nconsent for 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, the Senate is not in order. I will not \nproceed until it is in order. This was a very important vote.\n  Madam President, I want Senators to get out of the well. I am \nentitled to be heard, and I want other Senators to have the same \nrespect and same entitlement.\n  This was not an easy vote for me. I believe just as strongly as any \nSenator on that side of the aisle about the rights of the Boy Scouts \nand about the respect we ought to show the Boy Scouts. I was ashamed \nand embarrassed by the actions of some people--not by the Democratic \nParty--by some people at the Democratic Convention who may or may not \nhave been delegates, in showing disrespect for the Scouts.\n  Having said that, I had some concerns about this language, and I took \nthose concerns to the author of the amendment, Mr. Helms. He indicated \nhe would try to have that language changed. Several other Members on \nthat side of the aisle voiced their sentiments as being equal and \nsquare with mine: That the language needed to be clarified and \nmodified.\n\n  The language was this language: ``Any other youth group.'' Similar \nlanguage is used in at least one other place in the amendment.\n  My question was: What is the definition of ``youth group'' as it is \nbeing used in this amendment? The definition in the amendment reads as \nfollows:\n\n       Youth Group--the term ``youth group'' means any group or \n     organization intended to serve young people under the age of \n     21.\n\n  That can be a Black Panthers group. That can be a skinhead group. \nThat can be a Ku Klux Klan group. I do not mind speaking on that \nsubject. I detest the Klan. I have been a member of it. That is not \nnews. Everybody in this Senate knows that, and I do not carry that \nbadge with pride. But I do not want the Ku Klux Klan or any other hate \ngroup in our schools. So, I thought there ought to be a clarification \nand better definition of ``youth group.''\n  I came to the floor when the vote occurred. Nobody came to me and \nsaid: With regard to your concern, we have changed the language, or, we \nhave not. Nobody said that.\n  When I saw on the television screen that the vote on the amendment \nwas in progress, I came to the floor, and I went to Senator Helms. I \nsaid: Was there a modification of that language?\n  He said: No.\n  He was in accord with having a modification but he said, ``they \ndidn't want it modified.'' I do not know who ``they'' were. But in any \nevent, faced with having to vote up or down on this amendment, I voted \nfor it, but I am still concerned that the definition of ``youth group'' \nwas not changed. I am concerned because that request, which I think was \na reasonable request, was somehow rejected by somebody. I voted for the \namendment.\n  I take the floor now to say I hope that in conference that language \nwill be changed. The distinguished Senator from Oregon, Mr. Smith, \nearlier suggested that it be changed to mean groups that have national \ncharters. I believe I am correct in the way he stated it--groups that \nare nationally chartered. That would be fine with me. But that change \nwas not made.\n  I only take the floor now to explain my vote and to express my \nregrets that what I thought was a very reasonable request was \napparently just rejected out of hand.\n\n[[Page S6268]]\n\n  I hope that attention will be given in conference to changing this \nlanguage to make it clear that the term ``other groups'' pertains to \ngroups that are nationally chartered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment of \nSenator Helms that just passed be allowed to be amended as Senator Byrd \nhas explained it and as some Members lobbied to have it changed. I \nthink it will be a better amendment. If it is not done here, it ought \nto be done in the conference committee. We all understand that. No one \nwants this opened up to skinheads, Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan, or any \nother hate group, but we want to say the standards of the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica are standards and values that are valuable still.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, did the Senator make a unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, we, in good faith, during \nthe 8 weeks of this debate have been doing amendments side by side. If \nyour side has an amendment, we have an amendment. We have been doing \nthat and have done it 25 times. We certainly have done it the last week \nmany times. I personally--and I don't know how anyone else feels--think \nthat is not a bad idea as long as we have the opportunity to have our \namendment debated, if we have an amendment we believe is an appropriate \namendment, and we would be happy to show it to any Member who wants to \nsee it and we have a right to vote on the Helms amendment, which has \nalready been voted on. If you want to modify, that is fine, but we want \nan opportunity to have an up-or-down vote. We have done it for weeks \nand I don't see why this amendment should be any different.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I withdraw my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is withdrawn.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I listened to the Senator from West Virginia. A similar \namendment has already passed in the House of Representatives, so we \nhave the House language and this language. It is identical. If we \nfollow past precedence, there is not the flexibility to take into \nconsideration what the Senator from West Virginia has requested. That, \nI think, is part of the reality in terms of the way these institutions \nrun. They have passed a similar amendment by a voice vote, we passed an \namendment, and for all intents and purposes that is what will be before \nthe conference. If we follow the precedent, that flexibility that the \nSenator had mentioned would not be before the conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, we have been discussing this matter \nover the last few moments. I ask, after I have given a description of \nour circumstances, that Senator Byrd be recognized for a unanimous \nconsent agreement.\n  Just for the notification of our colleagues, we would then recognize \nSenator Boxer who has the right to offer a second-degree amendment. It \nis a freestanding, side-by-side amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. To my own amendment.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That will be offered. Then we will also have the \nSessions amendment vote.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Reserving the right to object, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. May I inquire if we could amend the consent request, if \nSenator Byrd would allow me to be recognized for 30 seconds prior to \nhis statement?\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I do \nnot object to the request of the Senator, but just to make sure I \nunderstood, was there an original request? Did Senator Daschle make a \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I only asked Senator Byrd be recognized to make the \nunanimous consent request. Following that, we would go to a vote on the \nSessions amendment. After the Sessions amendment is disposed of, we \nwould recognize Senator Boxer for purposes of offering another \namendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. A second-degree.\n  Mr. LOTT. You were just announcing the intention with regard to how \nto proceed? The UC was to allow Senator Byrd to offer a modification, \nand then I believe the Senator just wanted 30 seconds to speak?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Prior to Senator Byrd.\n  Mr. LOTT. I withdraw my reservation.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, may we have order in the Senate?\n  Madam President, in an effort to help the Senate to reach the best \npossible product of the amendment's status at this point, so that a \nconsensus of minds in this body may come to a conclusion as to what in \ntheir judgment seems to be the best outcome, I ask unanimous consent \nthat on page 2 of the amendment, section 2 titled ``equal access'' \nsubsection (a), paragraph (2), line 12 thereof, be amended as follows: \nTo insert the words, following the word ``group\": ``listed in title 36 \nof the United States Code as a patriotic society,'' and I ask unanimous \nconsent further that I may be allowed, additionally, to amend the \namendment, as modified, which is presently pending, in a second place.\n  The second place being on page 4 under section (C), titled ``Youth \nGroup,'' on line 8 strike the comma following the numerals ``21'' and \ninsert the following: ``and which is listed in title 36 of the United \nStates Code as a patriotic society.''\n\n  So I am asking to amend the bill in two places with the amendment--I \nam asking to amend the pending amendment, as modified, in two places \nand as I have outlined.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, is it now not in order to move to the \nSessions amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate must first adopt the Helms \namendment, as amended and modified.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nNo. 574, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 574), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, as I understand, each side now has 1 \nminute to make their presentation prior to the vote on the Sessions \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, we are on the verge and so close to \nmaking a realistic and fair and just step in dealing with the \ncomplications and frustrations our school systems are wrestling with \nevery day involving disciplinary situations with disabled students. \nAnyone who talks to them knows it is a very real problem.\n  Our legislation is a middle-ground position. It is more cautious than \nthe Gorton amendment which got almost 50 votes. It is more modest than \nthe House amendment that passed. It simply says, if a child is disabled \nand commits a violation of discipline rules that would result in \ndiscipline for them, they would be treated as any other child, unless \nand only after a hearing has been held to ensure that the misbehavior \nthe child committed was not connected to that disability--because some \nchildren have emotional problems and have difficulty containing \nthemselves. Those children would not be able to be disciplined like \nother students.\n  We think this is a fair and progressive step. I urge your support. I \nbelieve with the Vice President we would be able to pass this. I urge \nits consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\n[[Page S6269]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, the Senator from Iowa is not here. I \nwill take one moment.\n  We have fought for 25 years to try to mainstream disabled children. I \nremember when there were 5 million who were kept in the closets and \nshut away. IDEA may not be perfect, but we have a GAO study, which is \nan authoritative study, that says the changes that were made 2 years \nago on discipline seem to be working.\n  The previous vote was 50-50. We are divided.\n  Next year we are going to have a complete reauthorization of IDEA. \nWhy have a major step backward in terms of assisting the children in \nthis country?\n  If we have to change it, let's do it at the time we have the \nreauthorization--not on the basis of a 50-50 vote or 1 hour of debate \nand discussion on this measure.\n  Make no mistake about it. If we accept the Sessions amendment, \nhistory will record this as the first major step backward instead of \nforward with regard to disabled children.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nreconsider. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. \nSmith) is necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting, the Senator from New \nHampshire (Mr. Smith would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Lincoln). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 51, nays 47, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 190 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--51\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Conrad\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Johnson\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (OR)\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--47\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Inouye\n     Smith (NH)\n       \n  The motion was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I send amendment No. 562 to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 562.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding, and authorize \n appropriations for, part F of title I of the Elementary and Secondary \n                         Education Act of 1965)\n\n       At the end of title IX, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 902. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The afterschool programs provided through 21st Century \n     Community Learning Centers grants are proven strategies that \n     should be encouraged.\n       (2) The demand for afterschool education is very high, with \n     over 7,000,000 children without afterschool opportunities.\n       (3) Afterschool programs improve education achievement and \n     have widespread support, with over 80 percent of the American \n     people supporting such programs.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) Congress should continue toward the goal of providing \n     the necessary funding for afterschool program by \n     appropriating the authorized level of $1,500,000,000 for \n     fiscal year 2002 to carry out part F title I of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965; and\n       (2) such funding should be the benchmark for future years \n     in order to reach the goal of providing academically enriched \n     activities during after school hours for the 7,000,000 \n     children in need.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 803 to Amendment No. 562\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 803 to amendment No. 562.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Equal Access to Public \n     School Facilities Act.''\n\n     SEC. 2. EQUAL ACCESS.\n\n       In General.--No public elementary school, public secondary \n     school, local educational agency, or State educational \n     agency, may deny equal access or a fair opportunity to meet \n     after school in a designated open forum to any youth group, \n     including the Boy Scouts of America, based on that group's \n     favorable or unfavorable position concerning sexual \n     orientation.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I need literally a minute.\n  In this amendment, we are codifying what the Supreme Court has said, \nand that is every group, including the Boy Scouts, has equal access to \nschool facilities. It is very simple. It is very straightforward. It \nstays away from the can of worms we believe was opened in the Helms \namendment.\n  I hope all of our colleagues, 100 strong, will vote in favor of this \nsimple, straightforward statement that all groups, regardless of their \nviewpoint, be allowed equal access to the public schools.\n  I yield the floor. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I rise in opposition to this \namendment, and I wish to express some concerns regarding it.\n  We just adopted an amendment which I think addressed the issue at the \ncore, and that was concerning the treatment of the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica.\n  The Boy Scouts of America, as many people know, has been recently \npursued by a number of organizations saying they were not going to \nallow them to\n\n[[Page S6270]]\n\nparticipate and use public schools for Boy Scout meetings. That was the \ndirection of the amendment on which we worked.\n  I will point out what some of the organizations and schools are \npursuing with the Boy Scouts. They are saying: Look, we do not want to \nallow them to have access to our schools. We do not want to allow them \nto meet.\n  Listen to some of these examples:\n  On May 11, 2001, the Associated Press reported the Iowa City School \nBoard voted to prohibit the Boy Scouts of America from distributing any \ninformation in schools because of the Scouts membership criteria. Greg \nShields, the national spokesman for Boy Scouts of America, said:\n\n       We simply ask to be treated the same way as any other \n     private organization . . . [and] that our free speech and \n     right to assemble be respected just as we respect those \n     rights of others.\n\n  On February 8, 2001, the Asbury Park Press reported that the State of \nNew Jersey was considering a rule change that would bar school \ndistricts from renting space to the Boy Scouts because of their \nposition on homosexuality.\n  On February 7, 2001, the Arizona Republic reported that the Sunnyside \nSchool District in Tucson decided to charge the Boy Scouts of America \nfees to use school facilities, even though no other groups have to pay \nfees.\n\n  The ACLU executive director said:\n\n       While Boy Scouts, atheists, Nazis, even satanists have the \n     right to express their views, Government should not use \n     public money to promote them.\n\n  On January 28, 2001, the Boston Globe reported that the Acton School \nCommittee in Massachusetts decided to prevent the Boy Scouts from \ndistributing literature at school, even though other groups can do so. \nDefending its actions, Acton School Committee cited Massachusetts law \nwhich says schools cannot sponsor the Boy Scouts.\n  On January 14, 2001, the New York Times reported that New York's \nChappaqua School District officials were able to coerce two local Boy \nScout troops to sign a document that denounced the national policies of \nthe Boy Scouts of America as a condition for allowing these troops \naccess to school property.\n  I have several more pages of examples. The reason I wanted to point \nthese out is to show what the problem is, and that is, the Boy Scouts \nare being threatened to have access to public schools denied. That is \nthe reason for the amendment. That was the reason for the Helms \namendment.\n  The Boy Scouts is a 90-year-old organization with millions of members \nin the country. My guess is a fair number of Members of this body were \nBoy Scouts or their children are Boy Scouts. Senator Nelson of Nebraska \nwas an Eagle Scout. Senator Smith of Oregon was an Eagle Scout. Senator \nEnzi's son was an Eagle Scout. Senator Landrieu's family members were \nEagle Scouts.\n  My point in saying this is here is an organization that has been next \nto God and country and mom and apple pie for as long as we can think \nof, and it is being pursued. It is being pursued, being castigated. The \nACLU executive director mentioned the Boy Scouts in the same sentence \nas atheists, Nazis, and satanists. They are trying to categorize them \nin a dark category, a negative category, and all they want to do is do \na good deed daily. That is their motto. They are being pursued.\n  What did we do? What was the response this body voted on by a bare \nmargin of victory? This body said we are not going to tolerate them \nbeing pursued or kept out of school buildings. We said in this \namendment: If you are going to try to keep them out of school \nbuildings, then we are going to review the Federal funding for you \nbecause we so strongly believe in this organization--90 years old, \nbasic value training, character training in which many people in this \nbody participated.\n  The Senator from California then proposes an additional amendment \napparently trying to address much of the same topic. In that amendment, \nshe puts forward:\n\n       No public elementary school, public secondary school, local \n     educational agency, or State educational agency, may deny \n     equal access to meet after school in designated open forum to \n     any youth group, including the Boy Scouts of America, based \n     on that group's favorable or unfavorable viewpoint concerning \n     sexual orientation.\n\n  She is trying to cover it. The problem is it does not cover it. It \ndoes not cover this for the Boy Scouts. It does not have any \nenforcement mechanism for the Boy Scouts. They are going to have to go \ninto court with this language the same as they would right now to try \nto get access to public schools in school districts across the country \nthat are trying to deny them access.\n\n  What we did instead was flip the burden. We flipped it to the school \ndistricts, saying: If you are going to deny the Boy Scouts, you are \ngoing to have to state why and clearly to the Federal educational \nagency if you are going to continue to get Federal funds. We put the \nonus and burden on the school districts in the Helms amendment, which \nis the proper and appropriate place to put it, instead of draining \nthese private coffers of the Boy Scouts of America to pursue lawsuit \nafter lawsuit in various jurisdictions to simply get access to public \nschools.\n  What do you want to do? The Boxer amendment, while on its face would \nlook fine, puts the burden back on the Boy Scouts. It says the Boy \nScouts are going to have to go to court to get access. You have this \nlaw, yes; you have the Supreme Court ruling; but you are going to have \nto go to court and spend thousands and, at the end of the day, millions \nof dollars to get access to public schools for the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica. Let's deny apple pie access to public schools next. They are \ngoing to make the Boy Scouts spend millions of dollars to get in and \nhave a meeting at the public school.\n  That is not appropriate. That is not the right place, to put this \nburden on the Boy Scouts. They raise private moneys to do character \neducation and do what all of us laud, I believe, in this body. I \nbelieve all of us laud the Boy Scouts and what they are after and what \nthey are doing. Maybe that is not the case. Maybe some do not. I hope \neverybody supports the Boy Scouts.\n  This is not the right way to go. The Boxer amendment puts the burden \nback on the Boy Scouts to spend millions of dollars to fight their way \ninto public schools. We should not do that. We do not need to do that. \nI would rather the Boy Scouts spend millions of dollars on camping, \ndoing things as a scouting troop, as my son did when he was a part of \nthe Boy Scouts, as some of the Eagle Scouts here did. I would rather \nthey buy campgrounds and land to explore and take care of \nunderprivileged youth, as Boy Scouts do across the country. I would \nrather they take underprivileged youth from inner cities as part of the \nBoy Scouts, take them to the countryside and camp and spend millions of \ndollars doing that rather than millions of dollars in court simply to \ngain access to the public educational institutions in our country for \nwhich we provide substantial funding.\n  That is why this amendment is flawed and should fail and why I oppose \nthis amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose and vote against this amendment \nbecause we are shifting the burden back to the Boy Scouts and making \nthem fight their way into the public schools. We really do not need to \ndo that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. With all due respect to my distinguished colleague, I \ndon't quite understand the argument that the Boy Scouts will have to \nfight their way into the schools. Constitutionally, they cannot be \ndenied access to the schools now. They cannot be denied access. I \nsuspect if one argues that you are going to have to fight your way in, \nthere is the implication a lot of schools are trying to keep the Boy \nScouts out.\n  Second, since Brown v. The Board, you cannot keep black kids from \ngoing to school. If we had an amendment that took the language out of \nBrown, parroted it, as my distinguished colleague from California does, \nfrom the 1998 Supreme Court case that sets out this principle--we \ncannot do this--it means every black child has to spend thousands of \ndollars to fight their way into the schools.\n  One of the things that distinguishes the United States of America, \nwhen the Supreme Court of the United States speaks clearly, and \nparticularly when the Senate then legislatively parrots the exact \nlanguage that the Supreme Court uses--guess what. The American\n\n[[Page S6271]]\n\npeople, even those who do not agree, obey. That is the pattern we have \nin this country.\n  The idea that there will be Boy Scouts--and I was a Boy Scout and \nproud of it; I was an Explorer Scout; I support the Scouts; I will \nmatch my merit badges against my colleague's merit badges--Boy Scouts \nstanding with tin cups in front of schools saying, ``We need to raise \nmoney to go to Federal court to make sure we can get in,'' is not going \nto happen. Theoretically, it could happen, just as theoretically today \na school in the State of Delaware, or Kansas, could say, ``We will not \nlet black folks in.'' Theoretically, that can happen. Guess what. The \nblack parents have to go to court.\n  This is as much a threat to the Boy Scouts having to raise millions \nand millions of dollars as black folks having to raise millions and \nmillions to get access to public schools. There is a constitutional \namendment.\n  My friend--and he knows he is my friend--Senator Helms from North \nCarolina, has an amendment that I voted against. I think it got pretty \nwell cleaned up by the Byrd amendment, but it has some arcane problems. \nI will not take the time of Senators and bore them, but the reason it \nis probably still unconstitutional, although I have no objection to the \nway it got cleaned up--the reason it is arguably still unconstitutional \nis it is not content neutral because--and this is a constitutional \nprinciple--we will deny a school district funds--money--if in fact they \ndiscriminate, they violate the Constitution, by not letting in Boy \nScouts or like organizations that determine their leadership based on \ncriteria that are their own, to which others may object.\n  The problem with that is, technically, constitutionally, it does not \ninclude every group in the world. It does not include every group in \nthe world. It is no longer viewpoint neutral. It says we are only going \nto penalize school districts that discriminate against one type of \norganization as opposed to all. I know that is not my friend's \nintention, but that is why the amendment is still probably flawed, \nalthough I am willing to take a chance on it.\n  As I said to my friend from California, I am not sure this amendment \nis needed. I will support it. I think we all should support it. All we \nare doing is supporting the Supreme Court decision.\n  On this idea that we have to go further, then it seems to me you \nshould say, okay, we will cut off all moneys to all schools that \nviolate the Supreme Court's rulings that you are not allowed to have \norganized prayer. How about that one? Does anybody want to sign up on \nthat one? Same folks who want to sign up on this want to sign up on \nthat? I don't think so. I don't think we will have people running \nacross the aisle saying, look, if that school district or that school \nallowed organized prayer--and I am not opposed to prayer, obviously, \nbut that is what the Supreme Court said, in a Supreme Court decision.\n  What is done if a school violates the decision? Bring an action. Very \nfew schools violate. But to make the Helms amendment content neutral--\nand I did not want to start playing games, and I know occasionally it \nis suggested I am too constitutional. The mistake I make is I teach \nconstitutional law. My mother would say a little bit of knowledge is a \ndangerous thing.\n  The truth is, if you wanted to make the Helms amendment pass \nconstitutional muster, you could arguably say, OK, as long as you do \nnot discriminate, you deny school funds to any school district that \nviolated any constitutional right of anybody. That is why technically \nit is not constitutional. It doesn't do that. It protects only one \nviewpoint as opposed to all viewpoints.\n  I don't want to get into that because the truth is, we all know on \nthis floor, nobody, if we are a private citizen, is going to go home to \nthe school district and say, by the way, I don't like the fact that the \nBoy Scouts don't allow homosexual Scout leaders so I will go to the \nschool board meeting tomorrow and insist they be blocked access to my \nschool.\n  This is a bit of a charade. Everybody on the floor supports the Boy \nScouts. We may disagree whether they should or should not allow \nhomosexuals to be members. And I think they should. We may disagree on \nthat. But no one disagrees on the ruling of the Supreme Court which \nsays you cannot discriminate against them because the Court ruled it is \nOK for this organization to say we don't want homosexual Scout leaders. \nThat is what the Supreme Court said. It is OK. I accept that. It is the \nSupreme Court of the United States of America.\n  I also accept the fact that the Supreme Court says you cannot \ndiscriminate against the Boy Scouts because of the decision they made.\n  I think it is Kafkaesque. We are arguing about something on which we \ndon't disagree. This is about politics. This is a political game we are \nplaying. It is a joke--who is more Boy Scout. I am as big a Boy Scout \nas anyone here. We can all compare merit badges and our support for the \nBoy Scouts. So let's not make a mockery of this thing.\n  The fact is there is a technical, legal, constitutional argument that \nthe last amendment is unconstitutional. That is the core of the \nobjection of those who voted for it before it got amended. After it has \nbeen amended, it is arguably still unconstitutional. I am willing to \ntake a chance on it. I am satisfied to let it go at that.\n  This clearly is constitutional. This clearly restates what I thought \nwe all want. No school district can deny Boy Scouts access if they have \naccess for anybody.\n\n  Again, I conclude by saying the idea this could cost the Boy Scouts \nmillions of dollars I find a bit of a stretch.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I rise in opposition to the amendment and point out one of \nthe real values of Boy Scouts is that it isn't designed to be \ncompetitive. It isn't designed to see who is the best Boy Scout, who \nhas the most merit badges, who has better merit badges. It is designed \nto teach young men good values. It is designed to teach young men about \nthe world. It is designed to teach young men about possible careers. \nThat is being thwarted.\n  I will not repeat everything I said this morning. I am sure that is a \nrelief. I hope Members look at the record. I am convinced they did not \npay attention when I spoke earlier. An important point: The record of \nfive cases a year ago, where the Boy Scouts had to go to court. We are \nnot talking hypothetical; we are not talking about the possibility that \nsomebody's constitutional rights were violated. We are talking about \nactual situations. Some of those will be resolved over the years at \ngreat cost. We are not talking hypothetical on the cost either.\n\n  I am not going to pretend to be a constitutional lawyer because I am \none of the few people here who is not a lawyer at all. But I was a Boy \nScout. I am watching what is happening to the Boy Scouts in this \ncountry.\n  Five times in the year 2000, this instance came up. I have to tell \nyou, already this year, eight times. That is just ones that I was able \nto find, which means they are ones that made national press. It doesn't \nmean it is all the instances of it happening.\n  The five last year and the eight this year are cases where it \nhappened in school. I am not talking about all of the discrimination \nthat there is out there against the Boy Scouts. I am just talking about \nin school.\n  We cleared up the definitional problem that I think would have made \nthat a near unanimous vote before. It should have made it a near \nunanimous vote before. Now we have an amendment that tries to eliminate \nanything that the Helms amendment could have done. Here is how it \neliminates it. It does it in two ways.\n  It eliminates the enforcement mechanism. There was not anything in \nthe Helms amendment that automatically took money away from schools. \nThere was a review process. If the review process said they \ndiscriminated, there was the possibility that they would lose their \nfunds.\n  Enforcement: There is no enforcement in this amendment. It may say \nwhat the Constitution says, but it doesn't provide enforcement. The \namendment we agreed to before, that provides enforcement.\n  The second problem is this one allows discrimination against the Boy \nScouts. The wording in here does not preclude--this is a big problem \nwith the school--does not preclude charging them exorbitant rates. They \nwould still\n\n[[Page S6272]]\n\nhave equal access; they would have, depending on how you took it to \ncourt, a fair opportunity. But it would not be the same thing as in the \nHelms amendment where you could not be charged discriminatory fees to \nkeep the Scouts out. Every one of those things would require another \ncourt action.\n  I am not an attorney. I am told a lot, when I go back to Wyoming, \nthat one of the problems in this country is we have too many attorneys. \nThey talk about the old towns in the West where the first attorney came \nto town and he went broke. In other towns the first attorney came to \ntown, he was accompanied by another attorney, and they both did very \nwell. That is what is happening to the Boy Scouts. We have enough \nattorneys; they can all do very well at the expense of the Boy Scouts.\n  The dollars being spent on litigation ought to be spent on good \nprograms for youth. We have been talking throughout the education bill \nabout the need to do things for youth, the need to have kids taken care \nof after school. This is an organization where you do not take care of \nthe kids after school, the kids help take care of us after school. We \nare talking about a communitarianism group, a group focused on helping \ntheir community through their volunteer efforts.\n  In order to get your Eagle award you have to do a community project--\nnot a personal project, not a family project. It has to be a community \nproject. So these kids get to find out what voluntarism is. It is not \nvoluntarism for them. It is that grand distinction; it is for other \npeople, that chance to do something for other people.\n  We need to make sure every time we can get a free program such as the \nBoy Scouts that will teach character and take care of the community, we \ndo everything we can to promote it. We have taken care of this through \nthe Helms amendment. We can destroy it through the Boxer amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, as soon as Senator Reid is done, I will \nclaim the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I wanted to ask a question of the manager. \nI am speaking to a Chamber empty on the minority side.\n  The question we have on this side is, When, if at all, are we going \nto vote on this? Does anybody know? Maybe one of the managers is in the \nback. It is now 4 o'clock, approximately. We have an amendment that \nsays:\n\n       No public elementary school, public secondary school, local \n     educational agency, or State education agency, may deny equal \n     access or a fair opportunity to meet after school in a \n     designated open forum to any youth group, including the Boy \n     Scouts of America, based on that group's favorable or \n     unfavorable viewpoint concerning sexual orientation.\n\n  A little different from my friend from Wyoming, I am a lawyer. If \nthere is something wrong with this legally, I suggest voting against it \nas some did on the underlying amendment that passed. It does not seem \nto me, at this late time, we are going to benefit by continuing to talk \nabout this. So I would like to get something from the minority.\n  This morning I talked to Senator Helms. He said he wanted 4 more \nhours. That at least gives people an idea how much time it will take. \nDoes anyone have any idea how much longer the minority wishes to debate \nthis 1-paragraph amendment?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, as far as I am aware, I am the last \nspeaker. I was just waiting to get an opportunity to speak.\n  I do not know. There may be someone else over here who is welling up \nin their chest with a speech, but as far as I know, I am it.\n  Mr. REID. I will say to my friend, if they are not now, they will \nafter your speech.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Maybe there will be a rush of people on your side, \nalthough I do not think so. I would not want to defend this amendment.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from California yielded to me. I apologize to \nmy friend from Texas. I return the floor to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say thank you to my friend from Texas. I will only \nspeak for about 60 seconds, and then I am happy to yield the floor.\n  There are some days when I wonder where I am and what I am doing. \nThis is really one of those days.\n  I have an amendment that simply codifies a Court decision that was a \nvictory for the Boy Scouts of America. When it was announced, everyone \nsaid: OK, in our Nation, regardless of an organization's viewpoint, \nthey have a right to equal access to our public schools; freedom of \nspeech. For those people, and I count myself among them, who believe we \nare all God's children, and I abhor discrimination against anyone for \nany reason, including their sexual orientation, I thought: This is \ntough because if a school district really has a strong feeling and they \nbelieve this to be a fight for civil rights, they are still going to \nhave to let the Boy Scouts in. But that is America. We allow equal \naccess and that is the way it is.\n  Now I have an amendment that simply guarantees this equal access, \nthat says the Senate agrees on equal access for all groups, whatever \ntheir view is on sexual orientation. And I have people who stand up and \nsay I am undoing the Boy Scouts.\n  Again, my most enduring memory of my little girl, who is now a mother \nherself, is her in her little outfit when she was a little Brownie, and \nthe character building that went with that. So no one can get up on the \nother side and say Members on this side do not care. We do care.\n  This amendment, again--and then I will yield the floor to my friend \nbecause I know he has reasons that he is against this, and I am \ninterested to hear his explanation--simply says what the Supreme Court \nsaid: Equal access for the Boy Scouts to every single public school in \nAmerica because every group, regardless of their viewpoint, has a right \nto have such equal access.\n  So I am kind of glad I proposed this amendment. I am kind of stunned \nthat anyone would be against it. But that is their right, their \nprivilege. As a matter of fact, it is their duty if they find something \nwrong with it. But I thought the Supreme Court decision was cheered by \nthe Boy Scouts, and I am a little stunned that my Republican friends \nsomehow do not view it that way.\n  I hope we will have a bipartisan vote in favor of this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, if someone showed up from Mars and \nlistened to this discussion, I am sure they would be convinced that \nthis was somehow a simple amendment that was protecting the Boy Scouts. \nBut they would be convinced only if they showed up in the last 30 \nminutes, because we spent much of this day debating and voting on an \namendment by Senator Helms that said if a school system denied access \nof facilities on a nondiscriminatory basis to the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica, they would lose Federal funds.\n  In listening to our dear colleague from California, you would think \nBoy Scouts using public schools would be a noncontroversial amendment. \nMaybe if you came from Mars 30 minutes ago you would be convinced of \nthat. But if you came from Mars an hour ago, you would realize that \nafter a lengthy debate 49 Members of the Senate voted to not deny \nFederal funds to school systems that discriminate against the Boy \nScouts of America. We had a vote on exactly this subject. The vote was \n51-49.\n  What is wrong with the amendment that is before us? There are several \nthings that are wrong with it. I think I can explain it pretty simply.\n  First of all, we have an unequivocal statement in the bill right now \nwith a Helms amendment that says you lose Federal funds if you deny the \nBoy Scouts of America the ability to use your facilities after school \non a nondiscriminatory basis.\n  How does the Helms amendment work? It has an enforcement mechanism. \nThat enforcement mechanism is, you lose Federal funds. So the Boy \nScouts of America don't have to go out and hire a lawyer, go to the \ndistrict court, the circuit court, and the Supreme Court to get to use \nthe local schools for Scout meetings after school. The Helms amendment \nhas an enforcement mechanism in it.\n  Second, the Helms amendment says the Boy Scouts can use the \nschoolhouse on a nondiscriminatory basis, which means they cannot be \ncharged a higher fee than anybody else. They cannot face separate rules \nthan anybody else, where they could be denied\n\n[[Page S6273]]\n\nthe right to hand out material, for example. That is the Helms \namendment. That is the position of the education bill as it now stands.\n  We voted on that issue. The vote was 51-49. Where I come from, that \nis about as close as you can get and have a determinant result.\n  Now in comes this amendment which says no public elementary school or \npublic secondary school or local education agency or State agency may \ndeny equal access. No one is opposed to this freestanding, but this now \nclouds the position of the underlying bill.\n  Why is this amendment a very weak amendment which does virtually \nnothing to protect the Boy Scouts? Let me explain why.\n  First of all, there is no enforcement mechanism. Unlike the Helms \namendment, which is currently part of this bill, there is no \nenforcement mechanism if a school violates the law. What would that \nforce the Boy Scouts of America to do? It would force the local troop \nto hire a lawyer and to go to court. You could literally dissipate the \nassets of the Boy Scouts of America in trying to enforce a bill that \nhas no enforcement clause in it.\n  The amendment which is now in the bill, which is undercut by adding \nthis amendment to it, has an enforcement mechanism, because you lose \nfunding, and any school faced with giving up Federal funding is going \nto allow the Boy Scouts to use their facility.\n\n  Second, this amendment does not guarantee that the Boy Scouts would \nbe able to use the facility on an equal basis. They couldn't \ndiscriminate against the Boy Scouts or anybody else in terms of using \nit. But it does not have a provision, as the Helms amendment does, to \nguarantee that you don't have to pay a higher fee or that you wouldn't \nget to use it on an equal basis or you wouldn't be able to hand out \nmaterials\n  I am not saying this is a bad amendment. If this had been offered \nfreestanding, if we had not debated the other amendment all day long, I \nthink some might have found some merit in it.\n  My point is, we have a provision in the bill that has an enforcement \nmechanism, which this does not. We have an unequivocal statement in the \nbill that was passed 51-49. My basic position is that this actually \nweakens the bill by putting two provisions in it, one which is strong \nand enforceable and has an enforcement mechanism, and one which does \nnot.\n  Therefore, my view is, with all due respect, that we have already \ndecided this on a 51-49 vote, and if your objective is to guarantee \nthat the Boy Scouts of America get to use the schoolhouse like other \norganizations, then the thing to do would be to leave the provision \nwhich is currently in the bill there and to reject this amendment.\n  If we adopt this amendment, then we have two amendments in the bill \nthat are very different. Then you are going to leave it up to conferees \nto decide which one they want to take.\n  If your objective is to have the strongest possible language for the \nBoy Scouts, I assert--this is a free country, and people have their own \nopinions--that the way to keep the strongest language is to not dilute \nit by putting weaker language without an enforcement mechanism next to \nit. With all due respect, that is why I am going to vote no on it.\n  I would be very happy to yield to my dear friend.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, if the Senator will yield for a brief \ncomment and question, my objective is to make sure the Boy Scouts have \naccess to the school.\n  My worry is, having been the guy who wrote the statutory language on \nflag burning, the Supreme Court is going to rule unconstitutional the \nHelms amendment, if you pass it. Ask any conservative or liberal \nlawyer. There is a 60-percent chance that will happen.\n  I view it in the exact opposite way, although approaching it with the \nsame objective as my friend from Texas does. The reason to include this \nother provision is to have a fail-safe constitutional guarantee because \nwhat the Court is going to say on the Helms amendment--which I support \nas amended--is the following. It is going to say that you do not have a \nguarantee to take away funds from any school district that denies \nhomosexual organizations the right to be in the school. You do not deny \nfunds to any organization or any school that denies or permits prayer \nin school, which is unconstitutional.\n  The Court is going to look at it and say it is not content neutral. \nThat is what I mean. I know my friend from Texas knows as well. That is \nwhy--it is not content neutral--the same rationale that declared my \nconstitutional statute against flag burning unconstitutional. It was \nnot content neutral.\n  I argue, for those of you who truly want to make sure the Boy Scouts \nhave access, even if you voted for and support the Helms amendment--\nwhich I think is a reasonable position--you should vote for this \namendment as well because it guarantees you double protection.\n  This is clearly, unequivocally constitutional. The Helms amendment, \nas amended, is unquestionably constitutional.\n  I yield the floor. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, responding very briefly, first of all, if \nyou believe a provision is unconstitutional, in my opinion, you ought \nto vote against it. We sort of hide behind this idea of ``let the \nSupreme Court decide.'' But when we put our hand on the Bible and swear \nto uphold, protect, and defend the Constitution, in my opinion, we are \nswearing to do that.\n  I personally do not believe the Helms amendment is unconstitutional. \nWe have passed amendments and bills all the time that deny or grant \nFederal funds based on what a school system does. But everybody has \ntheir own opinion about that.\n  My basic position is that the Helms amendment is quite strong and has \nan enforcement mechanism. This amendment would require that the Boy \nScout troops all over America get lawyers and go to court on an \nindividual basis. It would be really unenforceable, except with the \nexpenditure of tremendous amounts of money that the Boy Scouts don't \nhave.\n  I think we have a strong measure in the bill now. Fifty-one Members \nvoted for it. My suggestion is, keep it strong if you want the Boy \nScouts in schools, and I would vote no on this. Obviously, people have \nother opinions. That is why----\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator from Texas yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate the Senator yielding. I also appreciate the \ndiscussion on the amendment.\n  I may be off base, but I am reading the amendment, and it says:\n\n       . . . State educational agency, may deny equal access or a \n     fair opportunity to meet after school in a designated open \n     forum to any youth group, including the Boy Scouts of \n     America, based on that group's favorable or unfavorable \n     position concerning sexual orientation.\n\n  Maybe I am misreading that, but it looks to me as if it is an \ninvitation for gay activist groups, for all kinds of groups, to meet. \nIf you give access to the Boy Scouts, then you have to give access to \ngay activists in elementary schools, grade schools, schools up to the \n12th grade, senior high schools.\n  Mr. GRAMM. May I respond to that?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Please do.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me respond by saying, remember Senator Byrd got up and \nasked that we change the Helms amendment because it had language in it \nthat said ``or other groups.'' So the argument was made by Senator Byrd \nthat the language in the Helms amendment that said ``other groups'' was \nso vague that it could include Nazis, skinheads.\n  My point is, this language is at least as broad as the language we \ntook out of the Helms amendment because this requires that they open it \nup to any youth group, including the Boy Scouts. And the question is, \nDo we want to force public schools to open up to skinheads? Or to the \nKu Klux Klan? I do not think we do.\n  Senator Byrd made the point. I supported him in changing the Helms \namendment because it said: Boy Scouts or other groups. And we made that \nchange by unanimous consent.\n  Now we have this amendment before us that says that we open it up \n``to any youth group, including the Boy Scouts'' without regard to \ntheir view on sexual orientation. But what about their view on America \nor race or numerous other things?\n\n[[Page S6274]]\n\n  I am saying that the criticism Senator Byrd raised of the Helms \namendment--that it opened it up for all these hate groups--that same \ncriticism can, and I think should, be leveled against this amendment. \nMaybe it should be corrected by modifying these other youth groups to \nassure they are groups that have a Federal patent, for example.\n  But I simply say that the point Senator Byrd made was as valid \nagainst this amendment as it was against the Helms amendment and we \nchanged the Helms amendment.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 803, As Modified\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to make that \nmodification, as we allowed that modification to be made in the Helms \namendment, to mirror that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). Is there objection?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. GRAMM. No, let's not object.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I just want to understand.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Instead of saying ``other youth groups,'' we would say \nthat have a national charter. It would mirror the Helms amendment.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. OK. So you would insert that language? You would \nstrike the language ``any other youth group'' and instead insert those \nin section 36?\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is absolutely correct. We would do it the same way \nwe allowed you to modify yours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n        In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Equal Access to Public \n     School Facilities Act.''\n\n     SEC. 2. EQUAL ACCESS\n\n       In General.--No public elementary school, public secondary \n     school, local educational agency, or State educational \n     agency, may deny equal access or a fair opportunity to meet \n     after school in a designated open forum to any youth group, \n     listed in title 36 of the U.S. Code as a patriotic society, \n     including the Boy Scouts of America, based on that group's \n     favorable or unfavorable position concerning sexual \n     orientation.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleague for making that point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am glad that correction was made, but that does not \nchange any of the other points I made. There is no enforcement \nmechanism here. We have a provision in the bill that does have an \nenforcement mechanism. So we are weakening our commitment to it by \nputting this amendment in the bill.\n  Secondly, we do not have any guarantees that the Boy Scouts--while \nthey might be permitted to come to the school grounds, they might be \ncharged a higher fee or separate conditions may be imposed on them. And \nfor both those reasons, I believe this amendment ought to be rejected.\n  We have already acted on it. It was a tough vote. It was 51-49 as to \nwho wanted to guarantee the right to the Boy Scouts. I think we have \nspoken. I think this is a weaker amendment.\n  I hope we will not move away from the strong, unequivocal position we \ntook that the Boy Scouts of America, and their commitment to God and \ncountry, is a commitment we believe belongs in every schoolhouse in \nAmerica where they want to operate. So I urge my colleagues to reject \nthe amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, this week, this month, we have been \nseeking to redefine the role of the Federal Government in education in \nour country.\n  For much of this day we have spent our time in this Chamber trying to \nmake sure that Boy Scouts have the opportunity to have their meetings \nand their activities in our public schools.\n  As a number of my colleagues, I was a Boy Scout. As a number of our \ncolleagues, I am the father of not one Boy Scout but two Boy Scouts. \nOne just made Star this past week, two steps away from Eagle. The other \nguy is a new guy, brand new, just was a Weeblo, just crossed over. He \nis going camping tomorrow night with Troop 67 to Lum's Pond outside \nNewark, DE.\n  My friends, we have talked about this long enough today. I suggest \nthat we call a halt to this debate and go ahead and vote. There are \nthose of us who want to go camping with the Boy Scouts this weekend. I \ndon't want to be here tomorrow night talking about this issue; I want \nto be camping.\n  Mr. REID. I would ask we vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I have a couple comments I would like \nto make regarding this amendment.\n  We have talked in the abstract on this issue of: Will the Boy Scouts \nhave to sue to get into schools or will they not? There have been some \nallegations made. Several Members have said this is not the case.\n  I want to put a real case in front of us. On January 11, 2001, the \nNews & Observer reported that the Chapel Hill-Carroboro school board \nvoted to give Scouts until June to either go against the rule of their \norganization or lose their sponsorship and meeting places in schools.\n  That was January of this year. That school board says: By June, you \neither change--go against the Boy Scouts organization--or lose your \nprivileges to get into the schools.\n  We have two different proposals in front of us: the Helms amendment \nthat was adopted and the Boxer amendment that is being proposed.\n  Under the Helms amendment that was adopted, the school board in this \ndistrict would be the one that would have to say: This is why we are \nblocking the Boy Scouts from being in this school. This is what we are \ndoing. And if they don't, if they don't have the rationale, then they \nare going to lose their Federal funding.\n  Under the Boxer amendment, which is basically the current law, the \nBoy Scouts have to sue to say: We have a right to be in this school. \nThat is the law today. The Boxer amendment just basically renews the \nlaw as it is currently today. The Boy Scouts would have to sue to say: \nLook, we are not going to go against our Federal charter, and we still \nwant into the school. This is current law, what this school district \ndid. The Boxer amendment basically puts forward current law again. So \nthe Boy Scouts would have to hire a bunch of lawyers to go against the \nschool district--in this situation as well as in hundreds of thousands \nof situations across the country--to get into the school.\n  That is a real live case. That is an example of what we are talking \nabout. The Boxer amendment does not cure that.\n  On the other hand, the Helms amendment that was adopted--by a very \ntight vote, a close vote--would say that the Department of Education \ngoes to the Chapel Hill School District and says: Why are you blocking \nthe Boy Scouts? And if you are going to continue down this road, we are \ngoing to pull Federal funding. So then it is on the school districts, \nin that particular case, to defend as to why they are blocking the Boy \nScouts or they will get their Federal funding pulled.\n  The Boy Scouts have an access to be able to get in. They have a tool \nto be able to get there. On the other side, they have to fight their \nway through court. And for those who are saying: You are dreaming up \ncases, here is an example:\n  I read five others when I took the floor earlier. There are more that \nI could read. The simple point of this is, thankfully, the amendment is \nbeing changed some, so it is not all organizations--skinheads and \nothers, but the fact of it is, who are you going to put the burden on, \non the school district or are you going to put it on the Boy Scouts?\n  The Boxer amendment puts it on the Boy Scouts. The Helms amendment \nputs it on the school district. I hope we will all say we want the Boy \nScouts in the schools. We don't want to charge them a bunch of money to \nget there. We don't want to charge undue fees. We don't want to charge \nthem more to be able to get into the schools. That is the point.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Boxer amendment, if they \nsupport the Boy Scouts and keeping them from having to spend a lot of \nmoney just to get into the schools, places where they presently deserve \nto be.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n803, as modified.\n\n[[Page S6275]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n562, as amended.\n  The amendment (No. 562), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this might not be the case, but there is \na possibility that it might be the case, and that is, to my knowledge, \nSenator Clinton is going to speak for 1 to 2 minutes on her amendment, \nand I understand it is going to be accepted.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator let me speak?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I withhold the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Better \nEducation for Students and Teachers Act.\n  Education no longer simply involves students learning the \nfundamentals of reading, writing, and arithmetic. Rather, students must \npossess the resources to compete and succeed as we proceed into the \nnew, highly technical millennium. The computer and the Internet have \nbecome integrated into every aspect of our lives, and are becoming \nessential teaching tools in our schools and a basic component of any \nclassroom.\n  To meet this challenge, we must strive for innovative ideas and to \ndetermine exactly how we can maximize the Federal Government's \nresources because: Even on its best day the Federal Government can \nnever be a replacement for local administrators, educators, and \nparents.\n  Simply put, New Mexicans are in a far better position to know exactly \nwhat our schools and students need than government officials here in \nWashington.\n  Most Washingtonians probably do not know the Corona School District \nhas 82 students, the Deming School District has 5,300 students, and the \nAlbuquerque School District has 85,000 students. Additionally, the \nGallup School District encompasses nearly 5,000 square miles, an area \ngreater than Rhode Island and Delaware combined.\n  My point is simple, a one-size-fits-all approach cannot work in New \nMexico and will not work in many areas of our country. Consequently, we \nmust have solutions that are flexible and meet the diverse needs of our \nStates, school districts, and schools.\n  I want to take a couple of minutes and provide my perspective on how \nwe arrive at the point we are today with the BEST bill.\n  Not too long ago during the mid 1990's a number of us came to the \nconclusion that the current K-12 education status quo could no longer \nbe maintained. I think this realization may have been spurred by \nSenator Frist's excellent work as the chair of the Senate Budget \nCommittee Task Force on Education. The task force produced: ``Prospects \nfor Reform: The State of American Education and the Federal role.''\n  The report asked the simple question of ``how well are our children \ndoing?'' The answer was mediocre at best because student achievement \nhad stagnated over the past two decades even though America had \nestablished a record of near universal access and completion of high \nschool. Thus, the report concluded that we must address the issue of a \nquality educational system. In other words the need for academic \ncompetence and rigor.\n  Building upon the excellent work of the Task Force, Senator Frist \nsoon introduced the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999 \ncommonly referred to as Ed-Flex. The bill simply said: one size does \nnot fit all and thus, States should be allowed to waive-out of the \nregulations pertaining to certain Federal K-12 education programs.\n  Ed-Flex already existed as part of a demonstration program and \nSenator Frist's bill merely sought to provide all 50 States within that \nsame flexibility. The Senate passed the bill overwhelmingly by a vote \nof 98-1 and within a month the President had signed the measure into \nlaw. Unfortunately, after the passage of Ed-Flex for a variety of \nreasons there was not any further fundamental changes made to our K-12 \nsystem. Instead, since the last reauthorization of the ESEA in 1994 \nthere is no approach that we learned is a complete failure: merely \nproviding more funding.\n  In 1996 the Federal Government spend about $23 billion on education \nand within a few short years the number ballooned to over $42 billion \nin FY 2001. The logical conclusion is that a near doubling of \neducational funding would result in dramatic improvements in student \nachievement. Sadly, for all of our funding we simply do not have the \nmatching results.\n  For instance, in 1996 the average reading score for a 4th grader was \n212 and the Federal Government spent about $11 billion on the ESEA. \nFive years later, Federal spending on the ESEA has nearly doubled to \n$20 million, while the average reading score of a 4th grader remained \nat 212.\n  In New Mexico, the number of 4th graders testing at or above \nproficient in reading actually fell from 23 percent in 1992 to 22 \npercent in 1998. I submit that we are not receiving a very good return \non our investment, a near doubling of funding with no corresponding \nimprovement. Imagine savings a greater and greater portion of your \npaycheck each week and after 5 years actually having less money. I \nthink it is fair to say that very few individuals would stand for these \nresults, if instead of students we were talking about our retirement \nsavings.\n  Thus, we are now debating the BEST bill because many of us believe we \nsimply must have a new approach to measuring academic success. The bill \nfundamentally alters the practice of Washington deciding the best \neducational practices and then distributing increasingly greater and \ngreater sums of money without any accountability.\n  Make no mistake, we have not abandoned our commitment to providing \nthe necessary resources to our States and school districts. In fiscal \nyear 2001 ESEA spending totaled $18.4 billion.\n  President Bush's fiscal year 2002 budget proposal requested a $19.1 \nbillion authorization for ESEA for fiscal year 2002, a 9-percent \nincrease.\n  Building upon the President's proposal, the FY 2002 budget resolution \nincludes the President's 9-percent increase in federal education \nspending for reading education, the Individuals and Disabilities \nEducation Act, IDEA, and teacher training.\n  I think it is also important to note that on May 3 when the Senate \nbegan debate, the BEST bill already authorized $27.7 billion for ESEA \nin FY 2002, a 57-percent increase over 2001 and nearly\n\n[[Page S6276]]\n\n$190 billion over the authorization period of FY 2002-2008.\n  If one does not believe that is enough then you will be interested to \nhear how much spending we have added since May 3:\n  $11 billion in ESEA and other education spending for a total of $38.8 \nbillion in FY 2002, an increase of 120 percent over FY 2001.\n  $211 billion in ESEA and other education spending for a total of $416 \nbillion over the seven year authorization period of the bill.\n  And of that total, $112 billion is mandatory spending under the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act.\n  With the preceding as a backdrop, I believe the BEST bill follows the \nPresident's promise to leave no child behind by ensuring academic \nsuccess through a fresh approach to education like: Accountability.\n  Our schools will be held accountable for their progress in educating \nour children through high standards, testing, and consequences for \nfailure.\n  Every child in grades 3-8 will be tested in reading and math \nproficiency annually. In New Mexico alone about 151,000 students will \nbe tested. Also, the State will receive an additional $4.5 million next \nyear and more than $33 million over the next 7 years to offset any new \ncosts.\n  Instead of simply continuing to receive increased Federal funding in \nthe face of failure, schools will now face consequences for persistent \nfailure.\n  Schools failing to demonstrate improvement will face corrective \naction, parents will be given the option of public school choice and \nsupplemental services for their children, and ultimately a school's \npersistent failure could lead to reconstitution.\n  Consolidation of duplicative education programs will provide maximum \nlocal flexibility to focus on improving student achievement. For \ninstance, title II of the BEST bill created a new State teacher \ndevelopment grant program with a substantially larger pot of money by \ncombining all of the current teacher funding. States will have the \noption to use the funding for professional development, teacher \nmentoring, merit pay, teacher testing, as well as recruiting and \ntraining high-quality teachers.\n  For example, New Mexico maintains a commendable student-teacher ratio \nof 15.2 and under the bill will no longer be required to use a portion \nof these funds for class size reduction. Instead, New Mexico will have \nthe option to use that money for teacher recruitment and retention \nprograms or maybe additional training.\n\n  The new accountability provisions will ensure that historic increases \nin Federal education funding will be based upon school performance. The \nbill includes the President's Reading First initiative to ensure all \nchildren and kindergarten through third grade become proficient readers \nby the end of third grade. The bill also includes programs to create \nMath and Science Partnerships, Strengthen After-School Care, and \nprovide for Early Childhood Reading Instruction.\n  Parents and the public will be given detailed school-by-school report \ncards on the performance of their schools. Parents will have the option \nto transfer their child from a failing public school to an effective \npublic school with transportation provided or to redirect their child's \nshare of federal funds towards tutoring or after-school academic \nservices. Parents will be given the option to transfer their child out \nof a persistently unsafe public school to another public school of \ntheir choice.\n  As Congress proceeds, one of its primary missions will be to \ndetermine what is working, what is not working, and what can be \nimproved to give our children a better chance of succeeding in the \nfuture.\n  Before I conclude, I want to briefly talk about several provisions \nthat are of personal importance to me:\n  First, Senator Dodd and a bipartisan group of Senators joined me \nearlier this year to introduce the Strong Character for Strong Schools \nAct. I think it is important to note that reform does not only apply \nmath, science, and reading; instead we must also reform the culture of \nour schools.\n  Our bill will be part of an amendment offered by Senator Cochran and \nseeks to encourage the creation of character education programs at the \nState and local level by providing grants to eligible entities. I \nbelieve our bill builds upon the highly successful demonstration \nprogram to increase character education that was contained in the last \nESEA bill.\n  Since 1994, the Department Of Education has made $25 million in \n``seed money'' grants available to 28 States to develop character \neducation programs. Currently, there are 36 States that have either \nreceived federal funding, or have enacted their own laws mandating or \nencouraging character education. Thus, the time is now to ensure that \nthere is a permanent and dedicated funding source available for \ncharacter education programs.\n  I also believe schools must not only have the resources for core \nmissions like teaching reading, writing, math, and the sciences, but \nthe additional resources to face emerging challenges.\n  Thus, I am extremely pleased the Senate has accepted an amendment \nauthored by Senator Kennedy and I to increase student access to mental \nhealth services by developing links between school districts and the \nlocal mental health system.\n  School districts would partner with mental health agencies, juvenile \njustice authorities, and any other relevant entities to better \ncoordinate mental health services by: Improving preventive, diagnostic, \nand treatment services available to students; providing crisis \nintervention services and appropriate referrals for students in need of \nmental health services and continuing mental health services; and \neducating teachers, principals, administrators, and other school \npersonnel about the services.\n  Finally, we must provide our school districts and schools with the \nresources to both recruit and retain the best available teachers for \nour children.\n  Earlier this year I introduced the Teacher Recruitment, Development, \nand Retention Act of 2001. I am very pleased to see elements of that \nbill included in the pending legislation. I am also grateful the Senate \nhas accepted my amendment that will allow States the option of using \nTeacher Quality funds for the creation of Teacher Recruitment Centers. \nTeacher Recruitment Centers will serve as statewide clearinghouses for \nthe recruitment and placement of K-12 teachers. The centers would also \nbe responsible for creating programs to further teacher recruitment and \nretention within the state.\n  Thank you and I look forward to the working with my colleagues on \nthis important issue and final passage of this bill.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, before turning to my tuition tax credit \namendment, I am pleased to inform the people of Arizona that an \nagreement has been reached to allow the T.J. Pappas School to remain \nopen and eligible for federal funds, including homeless education \nfunds.\n  As I understand it, a modified version of the amendment I have \noffered to secure this objective will be incorporated into the bill \nshortly.\n  The Pappas School is well-known and well-regarded in the greater \nPhoenix area because it combines a high-quality education with \nessential social services required by the homeless students who attend.\n  I have visited the school and I believe that the work that they are \ndoing is good work. I also believe that it would be a grave disservice \nto children who have already borne significant misfortune if the \nFederal Government deprived them of the opportunity to attend an \ninstitution that serves them so well.\n  Last fall, President Bush visited the school and came away impressed \nby the commitment of the staff and the hope that those dedicated \nprofessionals have instilled in their students.\n  The agreement that was hammered out by my self, Senator Feinstein, \nSenator Murray, and Senator Boxer, revises the language in the \nunderlying bill to allow Pappas and a number of\n\n[[Page S6277]]\n\nother worthy schools to continue serving children in need. It also \nensures that essential safeguards for homeless students and their \nfamilies are protected.\n  Of course, a homeless child should be able to attend any school he or \nshe wishes--whether it be the school he or she attended before becoming \nhomeless, or a school like Pappas that addresses their distinct needs \non a transitional basis with the objective of enabling them to return \nto a mainstream school.\n  I am very pleased that despite some fundamental philosophical \ndifferences, it was possible to reach this agreement.\n  Mr. President, I want to make a brief statement on behalf of Senator \nMcCain and myself and others who have worked out the language of an \namendment which will permit some schools for homeless children to \ncontinue to operate.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record an article from the \nArizona Republic of June 14, 2001, relating to just one of the success \nstories of this school, the Thomas J. Pappas School.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              ``From the Arizona Republic, June 14, 2001''\n\n                          Pappas Valedictory?\n\n\n                  sole graduate may be last for school\n\n                           (By Karina Bland)\n\n       Crystal Sumlin is all there is to the Class of 2001, \n     graduating tonight from the Thomas J. Pappas School for \n     homeless children.\n       She is the school's first--and possibly last--graduate \n     depending on a vote expected today in Congress to ban federal \n     funding for homeless schools. The School is under fire for \n     segregating kids from their public school peers.\n       ``If it weren't for Pappas, I don't think I would have made \n     it to graduation,'' Sumlin said. ``And I know I wouldn't be \n     going to college.'' The school, open for more than a decade, \n     added a high school three years ago, so its oldest students \n     are juniors. But Sumlin, 17, who has almost straight A's--she \n     got a C in trigonometry--finished her course work a year \n     early.\n       Despite the uproar in Congress over her school, Sumlin is \n     thinking only of finishing up a report on Arizona's \n     unemployment rate and the new dress she'll wear under her \n     black cap and gown.\n       Sumlin, her three younger sisters and little brother have \n     been at Pappas for three years after a lifetime of switching \n     schools. One year, she switched schools seven times.\n       She said her family moves about every three months, usually \n     because the rent is too high, the landlord complains of too \n     many kids, or her brother Jason, 16 and in a detention \n     center, sometimes gets into trouble.\n       But they've been in the same place since November, the \n     longest most of the kids remember without a move. They've \n     lived in a shelter, cheap motels and apartments.\n       ``I hate moving,'' Sumlin said. ``When I got older, I \n     thought I wanted to travel, but, now, I don't know. I think \n     I'll find a place and stay in it.''\n\n\n                            eye on the ball\n\n       Shy at first, Sumlin starts talking and her plans spill \n     out: Arizona State University in the fall. Maybe a class this \n     summer to start. She wants to be an attorney.\n       School officials are helping her apply for financial aid \n     and promising a scholarship.\n       ``I'm going to be somebody,'' she said.\n       She is determined, said Mary Michaelis, the school's \n     student services coordinator. And, unlike many kids at \n     Pappas, Sumlin is pushed by her mother, Velma Williams, to do \n     well.\n       ``She is too big on school, my mom is,'' Sumlin said. ``She \n     says I'm not going to drop out if she has anything to do with \n     it.''\n\n\n                             mom helps out\n\n       Williams has everything to do with it. She volunteers at \n     the school and stops by regularly to check on her kids.\n       ``I push my kids a little harder than most people push \n     their kids so that they make something of their lives and not \n     have to work a job like I'm working now,'' Williams said.\n       She works 40 to 50 hours for less than $300 a week, \n     collecting bills for a telemarketing company.\n       She knows about unpaid bills. Her phone doesn't work \n     because she spent the money on new shoes, stockings and a \n     rented limousine for Pappas', and the girls', first prom.\n       They'll eat bologna for a week.\n       She is raising six kids.

Mr. President, I will briefly explain what we accomplished \nin this amendment. An agreement was reached to allow the Thomas J. \nPappas School in Arizona to remain open and eligible for Federal funds, \nincluding these homeless education funds. A modified version of the \namendment I offered to accomplish this will be incorporated into the \nbill shortly.\n  For the information of my colleagues, the Pappas School is well known \nand very well regarded in the greater Phoenix area because it combines \na high-quality education with essential social services required by the \nhomeless students who attend the school.\n  I have visited the school, and I know the work they are doing is very \ngood. I also think it would be a grave disservice to the children who \nhave already borne significant misfortune in their lives if the Federal \nGovernment deprived them of the opportunity to attend an institution \nthat has served them so well.\n  Last fall, president Bush visited the school and came away very \nimpressed by the commitment of the staff and the hope those dedicated \nprofessionals have instilled in their students.\n  The agreement I speak of was hammered out by Senator Feinstein, \nSenator Murray, Senator Boxer, Senator McCain, and myself, and revises \nthe language in the underlying bill to allow the Pappas School and a \nnumber of other worthy schools to continue serving children in need.\n  It ensures essential safeguards for homeless students, and their \nfamilies are protected. Of course, a homeless child should be able to \nattend any school, whether it is the school he or she attended before \nbecoming homeless or a school that addresses their distinct needs on a \ntransitional basis with the objective of enabling them to return to a \nmainstream school.\n  I am very pleased, despite fundamental philosophical differences, it \nwas possible to reach this agreement. We have done something for \nhomeless children, and for that I think we should be rightly proud.\n  Secondly, Mr. President, I would like to offer a few words about an \namendment that I will not be offering. I believe that these comments \nwill go some distance toward explaining the reasons why I plan to vote \nagainst final passage of the bill before us.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to say a few words about \nmy amendment number 580.\n  I will not be offering this amendment so that there will be no blue \nslip problems with the House.\n  This amendment, like the Gregg amendment, that--unfortunately--was \ndefeated earlier this week, would make real reforms that address the \nurgent need to improve elementary and secondary education in our \ncountry.\n  The tax bill that we passed last month takes a very important first \nstep along these same lines by allowing\n\n[[Page S6278]]\n\nthe Coverdell education IRAs to be used not only to facilitate savings \nfor college education but for grades K through 12 as well.\n  While the administration of our schools is and should remain a local \nresponsibility, we have a compelling national interest in improving the \nquality of K through 12 education.\n  And there are ways to discharge that responsibility without adding to \nthe bureaucracy in Washington and without adding new mandates.\n  As has been noted repeatedly during debate on this bill: It is a fact \nthat America is currently not educating the workforce it needs for the \neconomy of the 21st century. Raising overall achievement will enhance \nAmerica's competitiveness.\n  It is a fact that international tests reveal that American high \nschool seniors rank 19th out of 21 industrialized nations in \nmathematics achievement and 16th out of 21 nations in science \nachievement.\n  Ironically, this threat to our competitiveness is the result of our \nfailure to apply the very principles undergirding our economy's success \nin the area of education.\n  Our Nation has thrived because our leading industries and \ninstitutions have been challenged by constant pressure to improve and \nto innovate. The source of that pressure is vigorous competition among \nproducers of a service or a good for the allegiance of their potential \ncustomers or consumers.\n  So why not promote innovation by producers and choice for consumers \nin the field of education?\n  The quasi-monopoly of public education today discourages this \ninnovation.\n  We must find a way to promote innovation and opportunity through \ngreater choice of parents. Those are the concepts that have built this \ncountry through our great free market economic system, and it is the \nsame concept that can improve our educational system.\n  The other problem with our education system is that too many of our \nchildren are literally being left behind.\n  Anyone who has followed this debate has heard the particulars, but \nthey demand our repeated attention: Thirty-seven percent of American \nfourth graders' tests show that they are essentially unable to read. \nFor Hispanic fourth graders, the proportion is 58 percent, and for \nAfrican-American fourth graders, it is 63 percent.\n  As President Bush has repeatedly noted, far too many of America's \nmost disadvantaged youngsters pass through public schools without \nreceiving an adequate education. It is intolerable that millions of \nchildren are trapped in unsafe and failing schools.\n  Parents should have a right in the United States of America to get \nthe best education possible for their children as they see it, and the \namendment I offer today will help secure that right.\n  My amendment would provide a $250 tax credit, $500 for joint filers, \nto partially offset the cost of donations to tuition scholarship \norganizations.\n  These organizations--usually founded by business leaders--that \nprovide tuition scholarships to enable needy youngsters to attend a \nschool of their families' choosing. The idea first came to light about \na decade ago when the first one was founded in Indianapolis. Now there \nare more than 80 such programs serving more than 50,000 students \nnationwide.\n  For families who benefit, these programs are a godsend. A study that \nwas just released by the Kennedy School of Government found that 68 \npercent of parents awarded scholarships are very satisfied with \nacademics at their child's school compared with only 23 percent of \nparents not awarded scholarships.\n  I should pause on that point to observe if this amendment became law \nand scholarships were to become more widely available, the schools \nthese students left would have a much greater incentive to improve than \nis the case today.\n  Because we anticipate that the tax credit would foster competition, \nwe anticipate that its adoption will bring improvement of all schools, \nnot just a few.\n  But today, the problem is that demand for scholarships far outstrips \nsupply, even though these low-income families must agree to contribute \na significant portion of the total cost of tuition.\n  For example, in 1997, 1,000 partial tuition scholarships were offered \nto needy families in the District of Columbia. Nearly 8,000 \napplications were received.\n  Another example: In 1999, 1.25 million applied for 40,000 \nscholarships in a national lottery. Clearly, there is a huge unmet \ndemand for this kind of assistance.\n  In 1997, Arizona implemented an innovative plan to meet that demand \nin our State: A $500 tax credit to offset donations to organizations \nthat provide tuition scholarships to elementary and secondary students. \nThe results: Upwards of $40 million in donations to tuition scholarship \norganizations.\n  The number of school tuition organizations operating in my State of \nArizona is up from 2 to 33, and the organizations have a very wide \nrange of emphasis and orientations. For example, they range from the \nJewish Community Day School Scholarship Fund to the Fund for Native \nScholarship Enrichment and Resources to the Foundation for Montessori \nScholarships.\n  Nearly 15,000 Arizona students, nearly all of them from disadvantaged \nbackgrounds, have received this scholarship assistance.\n  While some have charged that the law was unconstitutional--\nparticularly given the explicit prohibition on direct aid to parochial \nschools in Arizona's constitution--our State supreme court recognized \nthat allowing taxpayers to use their own money to support education is \na different matter and upheld the program.\n  And consistent with previous holdings on the subject, the U.S. \nSupreme Court declined to review the decision.\n  In other words, the Arizona tax credit should be embraced by those \nconcerned that Federal dollars going to vouchers which students would \nthen take to the school of their choice could possibly be \nunconstitutional.\n  In Arizona, you do not have public dollars being given to students in \nthe form of vouchers which are then taken to the school of their \nchoice.\n  Instead, what we provide is that if people want to contribute money \nto a duly qualifying scholarship fund, that scholarship fund can then \ngive that scholarship to needy students and those students can take \nthat scholarship to whatever school in which they want to be educated \nand the donors receive a tax credit.\n  That is constitutional. It does not violate any notion of separation \nof church and state.\n  And yet it permits people to help those who need the help the most to \nhave the flexibility that only the most wealthy in our society have \ntoday: the ability to take their kids to the school of their choice.\n  I have come to believe that it offers the best possible way \nto resolve this problem of choice and innovation.\n\n  It meets the constitutional challenges; it involves the private \nsector; it involves personal donations; it does not give the Federal \nGovernment the task of funding and administering a large voucher \nprogram.\n  Yet it gets the benefits to the students who need it the most, who \nare willing to contribute part of their own income to match that \nscholarship and pay the tuition at the school of their choice.\n  Now when I brought this amendment up during the debate on the tax \nbill, I listened carefully to the arguments that were offered in \nopposition by my colleague, Senator Bingaman.\n  In his remarks, my colleagues made two basic contentions.\n  First he said:\n\n       What we are saying [if we pass this amendment] is we will \n     not appropriate money directly to those schools, but we will \n     give each taxpayer a $250 credit if they will give that $250 \n     to the private school. That, to men, seems to be a pretty \n     direct way of providing Federal support for private and \n     parochial schools.\n\n  But as Arizona Republic columnist Robert Robb noted, this argument \nequating tax credits with direct appropriations ``ultimately rests on \nthe odious theory that government is entitled to all your money, and \nanything it doesn't grab is in fact expended.''\n  Senator Bingaman went on to argue that it would be imprudent to enact \na proposal this ``costly'' at a time ``when we are unable to make [a \ncomparable] commitment to the public schools.''\n  But the recent history of the bill before us today rebuts the premise \nof that argument.\n\n[[Page S6279]]\n\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated this credit could cost \nthe Federal Treasury $43.4 billion over a 10-year period.\n  Meanwhile, the Budget Committee's staff report that, as of last week, \nthe Senate has added $211 billion to this bill for a total seven-year \nprice tag of $417 billion.\n  And given the concern about public schools, it is also worth noting \nthat this tax credit is neutral as to whether scholarships should be \nused at public or non-public schools.\n  Scholarships could be used to offset tuition costs at a private \nschool, or to pay the tuition costs families in most states must pay to \nenroll a child in a school across district boundaries.\n  I hope that my colleagues will think about what a magnitude of \ndifference that money would make in the lives of our children: $43 \nbillion would finance 12.4 million $3,500 scholarships.\n  Think of the opportunity provided to those 12.4 million students with \na $3,500 scholarship to take them out of the condition of education \nthey are in now, out of the failing school, out of the unsafe school, \nand to a school where they can achieve, where they can learn, where \nthey can be competitive, where they can learn their full potential.\n  I have said many times that if we can get education right, almost \neverything else in this country will follow. By ``we,'' I do not just \nmean the Federal Government. In fact, I mean primarily the parents and \nlocal school folks.\n  First, it will help people realize their full potential.\n  Second, it will make them more qualified to compete for the kinds of \njobs that are going to exist in the future.\n  Third, it will help our Nation compete. We are going to need to \ncompete in a world environment.\n  Fourth, it is going to make us more secure because we are going to \nhave the kind of young students who can invent the things that are \ngoing to help us keep our technological edge when it comes to national \nsecurity.\n  Fifth, it is going to make us better citizens.\n  I have been somewhat appalled at what some of our schools do not \nteach about the history of this great country of ours, about the \nfoundation for the self-governance we have, about the need for people, \nespecially young people, to participate in our democratic Republic.\n  I fear that generations of Americans are growing up not being taught \nthe fundamentals of our society, our Government, and our free-market \nsystem that we were taught, and I think fairly well.\n  If we go a couple generations without teaching our children \naccurately and adequately in subjects from math and reading to history \nto government to economics and all the other subjects that students in \nthis complex world have to master, then we are not going to progress as \na nation and be the leading superpower and the leader of the world we \nare today, in economic terms or in terms of human rights, democratic \nprinciples, and other societal values.\n  If we get education right, we can flourish in all of these areas, and \nif we stay 19th out of 21 countries on these tests, then Americans are \nnot going to be as well educated and we will be overtaken by other \nnations.\n  We have led the world in foreign aid and assistance. We have led the \nworld in our insistence on human rights.\n  In other words, America stands for what is good on this Earth, and \nfor us to continue to be the leader of the world to promote these \nvalues requires an educated citizenry, a citizenry that will be \neducated and committed to these ideals, to these propositions.\n  We cannot sustain that kind of education with the system we have \ntoday. The scholarship tuition credits I am proposing with this \namendment will enable parents to allow their children to be educated in \nthe very best schools for those students and to enable them to escape \nthe kind of system we have today to one where each child can grow to \ntheir full potential. We must demand nothing less of our system.\n  This scholarship tax credit is an idea whose time has come, and that \nis why I have pressed it repeatedly and will continue to do so.\n\n\nAmendments Nos. 571 as Modified, 527 as Modified, 457 as Modified, 582 \n as Modified, 432 as Modified, 585 as Modified, 586, 587 as Modified, \n588, 589, 590, 591, 592 as modified, 593, 595, 512 as Modified, 435 as \n      Modified, 386, 424, 516, 804, En Bloc, to Amendment No. 358\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, I rise in support of the Cochran \namendment to the Better Education for Students and Teachers Act. \nSpecifically, I would like to speak to two elements of this amendment \nthat are of particular importance to me and my State of Iowa.\n  I would first like to speak to a portion of this amendment that \naddress an often overlooked segment of our student population, gifted \nand talented children. There are approximately three million children \nin the United Sates who are considered gifted and talented. It is \nimportant to point out that these gifted and talented children do not \nsimply possess an extraordinary level of intelligence, but they \nactually have a unique way of thinking and learning. Gifted and \ntalented children look at the world differently and often have a \ndifferent way of interacting socially. As a result, gifted and talented \nstudents have different educational needs from other students.\n  These remarkable children have enormous potential. Today's gifted and \ntalented child may grow up to become a leader in the field of science \nor a world-renowned performer. However, this will not happen \nautomatically. Gifted and talented children need to be challenged and \ntheir unique skills must be nurtured. Currently, many gifted and \ntalented children do not receive the educational programs and services \nthey need to live up to their potential. In fact, many gifted and \ntalented children lose interest in school; they learn how to expend \nminimum effort for top grades, have low motivation, and develop poor \nwork habits. Others abandon their education altogether and drop out of \nschool. This is a tragedy not only for the students, but also for our \nsociety.\n  Much of the Federal role in education is focused on helping Stats to \nmeet the needs of disadvantage students and students with special \nlearning needs. Currently, the availability and quality of gifted and \ntalented educational services varies widely from State to State. This \nsituation adversely affects all gifted and talented students, but \nespecially disadvantaged students. In areas without adequate public \nschool services for gifted and talented students, more well-off parents \ncan afford to place their children in a private school that offers \ngifted and talented programs or pay for private supplemental equational \nservices like tutors and summer camps. Meanwhile, disadvantaged \ntalented and gifted students remain in public school settings that \ncannot meet their unique educational needs without federal assistance.\n  My gifted and talented initiative, which is contained in the Cochran \namendment, will help to ensure that ALL gifted and talented students \nhave the opportunity to achieve their highest potential by providing \ngrants, based on State's student population, to State education \nagencies. These grants will be used to identify and provide educational \nservices to gifted and talented students from all economic, ethnic, and \nracial backgrounds--including students with limited English proficiency \nand students with disabilities. My proposal outlines four broad \nspending areas but leaves decisions on how best to serve these students \nto states and local school districts.\n  The legislation ensures that the Federal money benefits students by \nrequiring the State education agency to distribute not less than 88 \npercent of the funds to schools and that the funds must supplement, not \nsupplant, funds currently being spent. Additionally, rather than simply \naccepting Federal funds, States must make their own commitment to these \nstudents by matching 20 percent of the Federal funds. The matching \nrequirements will help ensure that programs and services for gifted \neducation develop a strong foothold in the States.\n  The Cochran amendment also reauthorizes the Javits Gifted and \nTalented Students Education Program. The Javits Program is a research \nprogram that funds a national research center and provides grants to a \nwide range of public and private entities in order to build a \nnationwide capability to meet the special educational needs of gifted \nand talented students. The research results from the Javits Program \nprovide invaluable tools to help schools and teachers learn how to \nidentify gifted and talented students and improve gifted and talented \nprograms. I would like to emphasize that, because of the nature of this \nprogram, a continued Federal commitment is required. It simply wouldn't \nbe practical or prudent to ask each State to conduct its own research \ninto gifted and talented education. And yet, the research fostered by \nthis program remains essential in ensuring that teachers have the best \npossible information about how to help gifted and talented students \nreach their full potential.\n  I am pleased that my own State of Iowa is one of the leaders in \ngifted education. Indeed, I have learned of many\n\n[[Page S6287]]\n\nremarkable young people and dedicated education professionals through \nthe advocacy efforts of the Iowa Talented and Gifted Association. I \nhave come to believe, strongly, that Congress must support initiatives \ndesigned to identify and serve the special learning needs of gifted and \ntalented children.\n  Our Nation's gifted and talented students are among our great \nuntapped resources. However, our help is needed to ensure that States \nand local school districts are able to address the unique educational \nneeds of gifted and talented students. In the spirit of the President's \nchallenge to leave no child behind, I would urge my colleagues to \nremember America's gifted and talented children.\n  I would also like to express my support for another portion of this \namendment that addresses an important educational need in our country. \nThe Cochran amendment reauthorizes provisions for the National Writing \nProject. The National Writing Project is a nationally recognized \nnonprofit organization that works to improve student writing \nachievement by improving the teaching and learning of writing in the \nNation's schools. Each summer, successful writing teachers at 167 local \nsites in 49 States, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia attend \nannual summer institutes through the National Writing Project. At these \nsummer institutes, teachers examine their classroom practices, conduct \nresearch, and develop their own writing skills. After completion of one \nof these summer institutes, the participating teachers return home and \nprovide professional development workshops for other teachers in their \nhome schools and communities. These follow-up activities are conducted \nthroughout the entire academic year in order to maintain and encourage \ncontinued use of writing skills. As a result, the National Writing \nProject is able to reach far more teachers than would be possible \nthrough directly administered professional development activities and \nteachers are able to reap the benefits the whole year long.\n\n  I proud to say that the National Writing Project has a long and \nsuccessful history in Iowa. The Iowa Writing Project was initiated in \n1978 and was among the first in the Nation. Since its inception, over \n8,000 teachers have taken part in the annual summer institutes. And, \nthis group of teachers has served as the means of administering and \nconducting workshops and in-service training programs for many more \nthousands of Iowa teachers. In fact, upon returning home from attending \none of those summer institutes, Iowa Writing Project participants can \nin turn impact as many as fifty percent or more of their fellow \neducators in their community. Thus, the relatively small number of \nteachers who participate in the Iowa Writing Project summer institutes \ncan provide professional development opportunities in writing for \nentire communities.\n  The success of the National Writing Project has resulted in \nsubstantial support in the areas where it has been implemented. In \nfact, for every dollar of Federal funding, writing project sites \ngenerate more than six dollars in support from States, host sites, and \nother public and private sources. Yet, while the National Writing \nProject has a regional focus and widespread local support, the 167 \nlocal sites could not operate without the coordination and support \nprovided by the national organization. At a time when both institutions \nof higher education and businesses are increasingly discovering that \nAmericans do not have the writing skills they need to be successful, it \nis essential that we support proven writing programs, like the National \nWriting Project.\n  The two portions of this amendment which I have addressed are \nexamples of areas where there are clear educational needs that cannot \nbe met by states alone and where our existing efforts have proven \nsuccessful. I support the general goals of the B.E.S.T. bill, including \nconsolidating or eliminating programs that are not working or that \ninterfere with decisions that are more properly made at the State or \nlocal level. However, where our efforts have been shown to be \nsuccessful and needed, our support should be maintained. Therefore, I \nwould urge my colleagues to support the Cochran amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to thank my colleague from \nMississippi, Senator Cochran, for including my legislation \nreauthorizing the smaller learning communities program in his amendment \nrelated to national activities. I am also grateful to my colleagues for \nsupporting this amendment. My legislation ensures that the currently \nauthorized and funded smaller learning communities program, which I \nsponsored during the 1994 reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, continues. This program provides funds to \nschool districts to assist in the creation of smaller learning \ncommunities or ``schools within schools.'' This is an extremely \nimportant program that we know works to improve student achievement and \nmake our schools safer.\n  In the past 40 years, schools--especially high schools--have been \ngetting bigger and bigger. In today's urban and suburban settings, high \nschool enrollment of 2,000 and 3,000 are commonplace; in some places \nlike New York City school enrollments near 5,000. Research demonstrates \nthat students in schools of this size do not perform as well as \nstudents in smaller schools and large schools are less safe.\n  Research also has shown that small schools and large schools broken \ndown into smaller learning communities are superior to large schools on \nvirtually every measure of educational success. Student achievement is \nhigher in small school environments. Students in these schools tend to \nhave higher grades, test scores, and honor roll membership, even when \nother variables such as teacher quality or community characteristics \nare considered. Furthermore, students from small school environments \nare more likely to finish high school. They also are more likely to be \nadmitted to college, do well once they are there and complete their \nstudies. These results are even more pronounced for minority and low-\nincome students. Because teachers have fewer students in smaller \nschools they can know their students better, minority and low-income \nstudents are less likely to be overlooked. As a result, the creation of \nsmaller learning communities can be an effective way to address the \nachievement gap between poor students and their more affluent peers.\n  Smaller learning environments also address non-academic learning \nbecause they provide an environment where students can learn how to \nparticipate actively in their school community. Student attitudes are \noverwhelmingly more positive in small schools. Students are far more \nlikely to be involved in extracurricular activities than students in \nlarge schools. In order to have a sufficient number of players on the \nteam or members of the club, all students must participate in small \nschools. In contrast, in large schools many students do not have a \nchance to participate in these important school experiences unless they \ndisplay some special talent. Research has demonstrated that \nparticipating in extracurricular activities contributes significantly \nto student learning and makes it less likely that the student will drop \nout of school or have poor attendance.\n  Smaller learning communities also result in safer schools. Large \nschool environments tend to promote feelings of isolation and \nalienation. In contrast, smaller learning communities promote a sense \nof belonging and community. Since there is an undisputed relationship \nbetween students' feelings of alienation and school violence, the \ncreation of smaller learning communities is a very effective strategy \nfor preventing the occurrence of acts of school violence that have \nbecome tragically commonplace in schools across the country in recent \nyears. In smaller learning environments, problems in interpersonal \nrelationships or other difficulties can be addressed before they lead \nto violence. Because teachers can get to know all students on a \npersonal level, smaller learning communities go a long way towards \nensuring that all students feel they belong and that they are safe. \nThis makes the creation of smaller learning communities an important \nmethod of preventing school violence.\n\n  Smaller learning communities also help to decrease teacher attrition \nand therefore improve the quality of instruction. Teachers working in \nsmaller learning environments often feel that they have more \nopportunity to teach instead of dealing with paperwork and discipline \nproblems that are more common in larger school environments.\n\n[[Page S6288]]\n\nUnder such circumstances, teacher morale is improved making good \nteachers less likely to ``burn out.''\n  I have been advocating for small schools and the creation of smaller \nlearning communities for a number of years. The smaller learning \ncommunity program was first authorized in 1994. The program was funded \nin FY 2000. Last year, a total of 354 schools serving over 400,000 high \nschool students in 39 States were awarded grants to plan, develop and \nimplement strategies that would personalize the learning environment \nfor students.\n  The legislation allows for local decisionmaking with respect to how \nto build smaller learning communities. Some of the most common \nstrategies include: (1) creating career academies that offer students \nacademic programs organized around a broad career theme, often building \non team teaching methods; (2) implementing mentoring systems in which \nteachers, counselors, and other school staff advise students on a \npersonal level; and (3) creating schools within schools so that smaller \ngroups of students take all or most of their classes together--often \nfrom the same team of teachers and/or administrators and often \noperating in distinct areas of the school facility. All of these \nstrategies are designed to create a more individualized learning \nenvironment.\n  In my home State of New Mexico, the Albuquerque School District \nreceived a substantial grant under this program last year, which will \nallow them to create smaller learning communities in six of their high \nschools and hopefully with additional funding through this program they \nwill be able to do so in all of the city's high schools. I was able to \nvisit one of these schools recently and see the good work being done \nwith some of the funding from this program. I visited Cibola High \nSchool, where they have created a school-within-a-school for ninth \ngraders with their small schools grant. Taking into account evidence of \na high drop out rate at ninth grade, the faculty at Cibola decided to \nmove all of the ninth graders into one corridor and divide them into \nfive teams. Each team of teachers meets together two to three times a \nweek to discuss instructional strategies and any concerns about \nstudents on their team. The grant allowed them to hire four more \nteachers reducing pupil/teacher ratios. They also created two lunch \nperiods within the school so that the ninth graders have their own \nlunch. Preliminary data indicates that the work at Cibola has been \nquite successful. The drop out rate declined from 9 percent to a little \nover 1 percent. Eighty-six percent of the ninth graders earned all of \ntheir credits last year and moved on to the tenth grade. Students, \nteachers and parents continually comment on how the new arrangements \nhas helped students to be successful. The schools reports that students \nfeel safer and less worried about the transition to high school. \nTeachers comment that they enjoy teaching more since there are fewer \ndiscipline problems and they have more opportunity to work with \nstudents one-to-one. I have a letter from Linda Sink, the principal at \nCibola High School, summarizing the success at the school.\n\n  I also note that teachers and administrators in schools in Las Lunas, \nNM were also delighted to receive a smaller learning communities grant \nlast year. They are confident that the career academy, which will open \nin August 2001, funded through this grant will do much to improve the \neducational experience of their students. This academy will offer core \nacademic content within the context of career programs in pre-\nengineering, electronics, culinary arts, criminal justice, education \nand health services.\n  No doubt small schools in themselves are insufficient to address all \nof the problems that are facing our nation's educational system. But \nthe strategy of reorganizing our large schools into smaller learning \ncommunities is a proven method of reform which attacks many if not most \nof the challenges facing schools today. Throughout the history of \neducation parents of means have sent their children to small schools \nbecause they have known that in smaller schools their children will \nhave the opportunity to connect with adults who care about them and can \ngive consideration to their learning needs. With your support, small \nschools can continue to be created in order to provide children with \nlearning environments that help all children succeed.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 386\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask unanimous consent that Senators Hollings, Bingaman, \nLandrieu, Cleland, and Johnson be added as original cosponsors to my \namendment.\n  This amendment is fairly simple, and I hope all of my colleagues can \nsupport it.\n  It would extend the Justice Department's school resource officer \nprogram for 6 years. It authorizes $180 million per year through 2007 \nfor the wildly successful COPS in Schools Program. This is the same \namount appropriated for the program in each of the last 2 years, the \nsame amount requested by the administration in its Budget, and it's \nenough money to hire 1,500 resource officers per year.\n  This is a great program. Police departments and schools get together \nand they file their application jointly, based on the community's \nneeds. To date, the Justice Department has funded over 3,800 school \nresource officers. They are 3 year grants, totaling up to $125,000 per \nofficer. That's about $40,000 per year, usually enough to fund the \nofficer's whole salary.\n  Why offer this amendment now. Well, the bill before us is designed to \nimprove our schools, but without my amendment it does not include \ndedicated funds to hire school resource officers. And authority for \nCOPS in Schools, one of the most successful school safety programs out \nthere, expired last year.\n  My amendment has been endorsed by the National Association of School \nResource Officers, by the National School Safety Center, by the Center \nfor the Prevention of School Violence, by the National Education \nAssociation, and by the Fraternal Order of Police.\n  Why do school safety experts, line officers, the resource officers \nthemselves, and the heads of police departments across the country, and \neducators support this amendment. Because they know COPS in Schools \nworks. They know school resource officers can help quiet troubled \nschools halls, can quickly stop a violent incident, and can mentor \nstudents.\n  What are school resource officers. These are specially-trained police \nofficers, men and women who work in and around elementary schools, \nmiddle schools, and high schools. They work with teachers, parents, and \nkids to identify and combat school-related crime and disorder problems. \nThey get to know the students. They are their counselors and their role \nmodels, and, when necessary, they enforce the law.\n  D.A.R.E. police officers would be eligible to receive funding under \nthis amendment, just as they are under the current COPS in Schools \nprogram.\n  I recently sat down with all of the school resource officers in \nDelaware. My State has embraced the concept, today, 16 members of the \nDelaware State Police serve as school resource officers. So do two \nmembers of the Wilmington Police Department, and one Newark police \nofficer.\n  And about 1 year ago, I held a field hearing on school safety at the \nWilliam Penn High School in Delaware. One of the witnesses was Delaware \nState Police Corporal Jeff Giles. Jeff told me low successful he has \nbeen as a school resource officer, how the kids feel safer, the school \nis more secure, and parents and teachers are put at ease.\n  This program works, COPS in Schools is a success. Let me tell you a \nstory: When a high school in my State, Lake Forest High School, tried \nto phase out its school resource officer because of a lack of funds, \nthe kids walked out. They walked out of school to protest Corporal Gary \nFournier's, dismissal! The kids would not let their school resource \nofficer go, they liked having him around so much. We found some funds \nthat let the school keep Corporal Fournier on, but it should never have \ncome to that.\n  Now, I was pleased the appropriators saw fit to include $180 million \nfor COPS in Schools last year. And it looks like the Administration \nwants to continue the program at the same level this year. But year-to-\nyear appropriations are no substitute for a multi-year authorization.\n  Schools need to have assurances this is a program that's here to \nstay. City\n\n[[Page S6289]]\n\ncouncils and other local governing bodies need to be able to pass their \nbudgets knowing the Federal Government is there to help. Today, as we \ndebate this education bill, authority for the whole COPS program has \nexpired and with it, the COPS in Schools program's future is unclear.\n  That just shouldn't be the case. A lot of these school resource \nofficers are heroes, and we shouldn't end the program that helps fund \nthem. Take a look at the tragic shooting this past March in Granite \nHills High School in El Cajon, CA. Local officials there have stated \nthat but for the quick response of Rich Agundez, that school's resource \nofficer, lives may have been lost. In the weeks following this \nshooting, San Diego school officials decided to station resource \nofficers in all of their 180 schools.\n  We should help communities like San Diego. We should make sure they \nhear the message, loud and clear, that this Senate agrees with them. \nLet's give school resource officers to every school that wants one. \nLet's give parents a little peace of mind that their kids are safe when \nthey get on that school bus and head off to learn. Let's give teachers \na hand in maintaining order in their classrooms.\n  Let's pass my amendment and fund the COPS in Schools program. It \nworks. It works, and I challenge any of my colleagues to tell me \notherwise.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 640 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask consent, further, to withdraw amendment numbered \n640.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask consent following final passage, \nuntil the close of business today, the two managers be permitted to add \na managers' amendment to the bill, provided that the amendment is \nagreed to by both leaders and both managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Without objection, the Jeffords substitute amendment No. 358 is \nagreed to.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n\n\n                            rural education\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to shift the direction of the \neducation debate for a moment. For the past few weeks, we have been \ndebating now best to engage the Federal Government in ways to improve \nour K-12 schools. There has been a lot of constructive debate on a \nnumber of important topics. An amendment that I planned to offer, S.A. \n387, would have addressed another important topic relative to our \nschools: recruitment and retention of teachers in rural areas.\n  I have spoken with Senator Kennedy and agreed to withdraw my \namendment, but I want to speak for a moment about its importance. My \namendment would have increased the scope of current loan forgiveness \nprovisions for teachers, including an expansion of eligibility to those \nteachers who teach in districts identified within the Rural Education \nAchievement Program.\n  I offered this amendment because there is a significant need in our \nrural schools for assistance in attracting and keeping good teachers. \nMy amendment may have helped that situation.\n  I understand that the issue of rural teacher recruitment and \nretention is one that needs further investigation, though, and am \npleased that Senator Kennedy has agreed to address the needs of rural \nschools in Senate HELP Committee hearings. We need to better understand \nrural needs and find effective ways to provide our rural schools, home \nto roughly 17 percent of students throughout the country, with the \nresources they need to delivery a quality education.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Thank you for bringing this important matter before us \nin the Senate. I agree with you that we should take a closer look at \nthe needs of our rural schools, and I look forward to looking at how \ndifferent mechanisms, including teacher loan forgiveness programs, can \nhelp meet the needs of our rural schools.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Thank you, Senator, for giving your attention to this \nissue of great importance to rural schools in my home State of Montana \nand throughout the country\n\n\n                           amendment no. 505\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, yesterday we passed amendment No. 505 by \nunanimous consent. The amendment relates to BIA schools. The \nlegislation was considered by the Indian Affairs Committee and the \namendment was cosponsored by the distinguished Chair and Ranking Member \nof that Committee. I would like to note for the record that the Navajo \nnation has some concerns regarding some of the provisions in that \namendment. I understand that Senators Inouye and Campbell are working \nwith my office and representatives of the Navajo nation to address \nthose concerns. I'd like to ask Senator Inouye if my understanding is \ncorrect?\n  Mr. INOUYE. We are working to address those concerns and hope to be \nable to make any necessary changes to the amendment in conference.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I'd like to thank my distinguished colleagues for their \nefforts. I also ask my Chair, Senator Kennedy, for his assistance \nduring the conference to make any necessary amendments to the \nunderlying bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would be happy to work with Senator Bingaman on making \nany necessary changes related to this amendment during the conference.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, with the passage of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act of 1965, there has always been broad support \nfor the Federal Government to provide assistance and leadership to the \nStates and localities, the entities that serve as the primary sources \nfor implementing our education system. Over these past 36 years, we \nhave had thoughtful debates regarding the Federal role in both \nestablishing and overseeing education policy. Through these spirited \ndiscussions, we have tried to create initiatives that emphasize \nexcellence for all students.\n  Over the past 3 years, the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee has closely examined elementary and secondary education. In \nthe 106th Congress, two dozen hearings were held regarding the ESEA \nreauthorization. One of the very first hearings the committee held this \nyear featured Secretary Paige and focused on the President's education \ninitiative.\n  All 20 members of the HELP Committee worked together to draft S. 1 \nand unanimously voted the bill out of committee. Following committee \naction, I and several of my colleagues worked with the White House to \nfurther refine the committee bill that has now passed the Senate.\n  S. 1, the Better Education for Students and Teachers Act, begins a \nnew chapter that not only sets goals designed to improve student \nperformance, but provides a road map for achieving those goals. With \nthe leadership of President Bush, and the leadership of many Senators \nfrom all parties, we have, before us, legislation that better targets \nresources and provides greater accountability at both the State and \nlocal levels.\n  Our goal must be to ensure that every child will obtain the knowledge \nnecessary to succeed in our society and in our economy. To ensure \nprogress toward this goal, the legislation before us will establish \naccountability measures for every school, school district and State in \nthe country, so that the public can see whether or not they are making \nannual academic progress.\n  The House and Senate conferees will soon begin their work in putting \ntogether a final product that will hopefully not set unrealistic goals \nand undermine our overall goal of leaving no child behind. If we are \nnot very careful, the result of our efforts might be havoc rather than \nhelp for our education system and the students it is designed to serve.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with all of my colleagues in \nwriting a conference report that will provide the foundation for every \nchild in this Nation to receive a quality education.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Gregg, and the other members of the committee. I would like to \njoin the managers in thanking all of the committee staff for their hard \nwork. Particularly, I would like to thank my staff, Sherry Kaiman, \nSusan Hattan, Scott Giles, Jenny Smulson, Andy Hartman, Justin King, \nCarolyn Dupree, Leah Booth, Ann Clough, Sallie Rhodes, and Frances \nColeman for their efforts. I also want to thank Wayne Riddle and Jim \nStedman from the Congressional Research Service and Mark\n\n[[Page S6290]]\n\nKoster, Liz King, and Bill Baird from the Office of Legislative Counsel \nfor their tremendous contribution in shaping S. 1.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, education is, and should be, among our top \npriorities here in the Senate.\n  Parents know that the quality of a child's education can make or \nbreak that child's future. Businesses understand that they cannot \ncompete in this high-tech world without a well trained and well \neducated workforce.\n  That is why what we are doing here today, and have done in the past \nfew weeks is so important.\n  We have had an opportunity to put aside partisan differences to craft \na federal education policy that will strengthen schools, increase \naccountability, empower parents, and give our teachers and \nadministrators the resources they need to give our children the \neducation they deserve.\n  In many respects, we have been successful. The bill itself takes some \npositive steps toward improving public education in America. It \nprovides for annual testing of students and a process for identifying \nand turning around failing schools. It requires that high standards be \nset for all students. It targets federal education resources towards \nthe students who need the greatest assistance. It includes a new early \nreading initiative to promote literacy. Ands it contains other \nimportant provisions to help increase parental involvement in their \nchildren's education.\n  In addition, we were able to make a number of key improvements to the \nunderlying bill during the Senate debate. The bill now includes \nlanguage calling for full funding of title I for disadvantaged children \nand full funding of the federal commitment to educate children with \ndisabilities. We increased funding for bilingual education and after-\nschool programs. We provided additional funding to improve and \nmodernize resources in school libraries. We passed additional changes \nto make sure that States use high quality tests to gauge the progress \nof students. And we passed an amendment that I was proud to cosponsor \nthat will help recruit more teachers.\n  I am also pleased that the Senate accepted my amendment to provide \n$180 million to put more school resource officers in our schools. These \nofficers are specially trained to prevent school violence and to \nquickly respond to crimes, while serving as mentors and role models and \nproviding guidance to students.\n  Despite these important steps that we have taken, I must say that I \nam truly disappointed by some missed opportunities.\n  We missed an opportunity to make reducing class sizes a priority when \nthe Senate voted against Senator Murray's amendment to increase funding \nfor the 100,000 teacher initiative and ensure that it is not \nconsolidated with other teacher quality programs.\n  We missed an opportunity to help our States renovate and build new \nschools when the Senate voted against Senator Harkin's amendment to \nreauthorize a bi-partisan school construction plan.\n  But above all else, we missed an opportunity to resolve the issue of \nadequate funding for all the education reforms that this bill requires.\n  The truth is, we can stand here and make eloquent speeches about all \nthese needed changes in our education system, many of which I \nwholeheartedly support, but without the resources to back up these \neloquent words, nothing will change. I am hopeful that even more \nresources can be directed toward education during the conference \ncommittee negotiations and though the annual appropriations process \nthat will begin shortly.\n  I believe that on the whole this bill takes a dramatic step in the \nright direction. It improves accountability, empowers parents, and \nbegins to make the types of investments that our teachers and students \ndeserve and need.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the education \nreform bill. I am encouraged by the renewed emphasis President Bush and \nmany in Congress have placed on education and I welcome this \nopportunity to share my views on this important subject.\n  Improving elementary and secondary education has long been a goal of \nthose of us in Congress. However, for too long, the debate at the \nFederal level has focused on the same old ideas that boil down to more \nspending without ensuring results and more Federal control of local \nschools. That is why I am pleased that President Bush has put forward a \nplan for education that takes us in a new direction. S. 1, the Better \nEducation for Students and Teachers Act, encompasses the President's \nmain goals and puts the Federal role in education on the right track.\n  Since 1965, when Congress embarked on its first elementary and \nsecondary education initiative, the Federal Government has continued to \nexpand its role in the area of education. Yet, while the Federal role \nin education has increased, accountability has not. The Federal \nGovernment continues to spend more and more on education while creating \ncomplicated and overlapping programs that may or may not address the \nneeds of local schools. In fact, research has shown that, while Federal \nfunding for education has increased substantially over the last 30 \nyears, students' test scores have not shown improvement.\n  The BEST Act seeks to change this situation by taking steps to ensure \naccountability for the use of Federal education dollars. Under this \nbill, States will be required to develop their own strategy to measure \nimprovement and hold schools and school districts accountable through \nthe use of State-run assessments. In this way, schools and school \ndistricts that fail to help students achieve can be identified so that \nassistance can be provided and necessary corrective action taken.\n  Going hand in hand with the need for greater accountability is the \nnecessity for increased flexibility for States and local school \ndistricts. Part of the problem of stagnant student achievement despite \nincreased Federal funding is that Federal funding comes with a \ndisproportionate degree of Federal control. Federal micro-managing of \nclassrooms ties the hands of teachers and can actually prevent them \nfrom meeting the individual needs of students.\n  We in Washington must face the fact that we cannot possibly know \nwhat's best for every school in America. My home State of Iowa contains \na wide variation of school districts from rural to urban. Students in \nDes Moines are likely to have different needs from those of students in \nLineville. What works in Davenport may not work in Sioux Center. How \nthen can we in Washington direct Federal funding to meet the needs of \nall the students of Iowa, much less vastly different regions of our \ncountry, without providing for a substantial degree of local control? \nIf States are to meet tough new goals for student achievement, they \nmust be given the freedom to do so without having their hands tied by \nunnecessary Federal regulations. This bill does just that by \nconsolidating related programs into more flexible block grants and \nallowing schools to waive certain Federal regulations in return for \nresults.\n  It is also essential that parents have the opportunity for greater \ninvolvement in their child's education. Under the BEST Act, school \nreport cards will be issued so that parents will have information on \nthe quality of their child's school, and support will be given to local \neducational agencies and nonprofit organizations to implement parental \ninvolvement programs that are designed to improve student performance. \nIn addition, parents of disadvantaged students in failing schools will \nbe given the choice to move their children to a better school.\n  In closing, while this bill does provide for a substantially \nincreased investment in elementary and secondary education, it does so \nin a framework of real reform that provides greater flexibility to \nstates and local school districts in return for demonstrated results. \nThis bill represents a shift from the old Washington-knows-best view of \neducation to one which empowers states, local communities, and parents \nto improve student achievement. President Bush has called on us to \nensure that no child in America is left behind. The Better Education \nfor Students and Teachers bill will put us on course to meet that \nchallenge.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \ninnovative and far-reaching legislation before us, the Better Education \nfor Students and Teachers, BEST, Act. The Senate for several weeks has \nbeen considering this reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, ESEA, which was first enacted in\n\n[[Page S6291]]\n\n1965 as part of President Johnson's war on poverty. While the anchor of \nthis law has always been title I--a program to provide support to low-\nincome and disadvantaged students--ESEA has evolved over the past 35 \nyears to also include important professional development, technology \nand after-school programs. The bill before us today makes significant \nchanges to education policy, reflecting our commitment to make the \nFederal Government an effective partner in reforming the nation's \npublic schools. We all hope these reforms will be the right ones for \nour children. While I do have some concerns about the commitment of the \nPresident and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to \nadequately fund the programs in the BEST Act, I am willing to take them \nat their word, to leave no child behind.\n  During the Senate's consideration of the BEST Act, a variety of \namendments offered by Senators on both sides of the aisle have been \nconsidered. I would like to take a moment to highlight just a few of \nthese.\n  First, I want to express my thanks and appreciation to the managers \nof this bill, Senators Kennedy and Gregg, for accepting an amendment \noffered by Senator Hatch and myself to re-authorize Department of \nJustice grants for new Boys and Girls Clubs in each of the 50 States. \nIn 1997, I was proud to join with Senator Hatch and others to pass \nbipartisan legislation to authorize grants by the Department of Justice \nto fund 2,500 Boys and Girls Clubs across the Nation. This bipartisan \namendment authorizes $60 million in Department of Justice grants for \neach of the next five years to establish 1,200 additional Boys and \nGirls Clubs across the Nation. These grants will bring the total number \nof Boys and Girls Clubs to 4,000 to serve 6,000,000 young people by \nJanuary 1, 2007.\n  In my home State of Vermont, this long-term Federal commitment has \nenabled Vermonters to established six Boys and Girls Clubs, in \nBrattleboro, Burlington, Montpelier, Randolph, Rutland, and Vergennes. \nIndeed, Vermont's Boys and Girls Clubs received more than $1 million in \nDepartment of Justice grants since 1998. I am hopeful this amendment \nwill ensure future funding for these successful youth programs.\n  Some of the most publicized and often-discussed provisions of the \nBEST Act are the expanded requirements for student assessment, \nspecifically the annual testing of schoolchildren in Grades 3 through \n8. The legislation will require states to establish comprehensive \nassessment systems in order to evaluate the achievement of their \nschools and students. Accountability in education is important. \nParents, students, teachers, and taxpayers should know how their \nschools are performing. However, it is important that testing be used \nas a diagnostic tool in an overall assessment system and not become a \nreform in its own right. Tests should measure school progress based on \nstandards that are part of a high-quality curriculum. My home State of \nVermont has a fine tradition of high expectations in education and \ncurrently has in place a comprehensive framework for school standards \nand accountability. I am hopeful that the new role of the Federal \nGovernment outlined in the legislation before us will reinforce, not \nundermine, state and local efforts to improve student performance.\n  For small States--like Vermont--the costs associated with \nimplementing a large-scale assessment system can be prohibitively \nexpensive. During consideration of the BEST Act, the Senate approved \ntwo key amendments that will help lessen the burden on the States. \nFirst, the Senate overwhelmingly passed an amendment to require that \nthe Federal Government provide at least 50 percent of the costs of \ndeveloping and administering the testing requirements in the underlying \nbill. If the Federal Government does not provide these funds, the \nStates will not be required to administer the tests.\n  Second, the Senate adopted an amendment to have the General \nAccounting Office conduct a study to evaluate the true costs to the \nStates for the testing provisions. This report will be completed prior \nto the implementation of the Best Act's assessment requirements. If the \nGAO finds the costs to be higher than anticipated, the Senate should \nreturn to the issue. We must not require reform from our States--\nespecially small States without providing the necessary resources to \nsupport those reforms. We must not set our schools and students up for \nfailure.\n  In addition to these important testing-related improvements, the \nSenate also approved an amendment to fully fund the Federal \nGovernment's portion of the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct, IDEA. This is a crucial issue and one that education officials \nback in our home States have been pushing for--for the Federal \nGovernment to fulfill its responsibility. The Senate also agreed to \nauthorize full-funding for the title I program, a strong reflection of \nour commitment to providing resources to schools that educate low-\nincome and disadvantaged students.\n  While several other amendments were approved that will strengthen the \nBEST Act, I was pleased that the Senate rejected some proposals that \nwould have weakened our commitment to public school education. In \nparticular, I was pleased that the Senate rejected an amendment that \nwould have directed public dollars to private schools. I have long had \nconcerns about using Federal tax dollars to support private schools \nthrough vouchers. Although I support the options private schools \nprovide for some of our Nation's youth, our primary responsibility must \nbe to ensure that our public schools are the best they can possibly be \nin order to give our children the education they deserve. Rather than \nsend precious public funds to private or religious schools, we must \nensure that all public schools in the United States have the resources \nto provide a high quality education for all of our Nation's children.\n  By approving the legislation before us today, we will be taking the \nfirst step toward enacting quality education reform in our Nation's \nschools. The second step will come later in the year when Congress and \nPresident Bush determine the funding level for these Federal programs. \nIn recent days many of my colleagues have spoken about the need for \nadequate funding for these reform efforts. I want to add my voice to \nthat debate. Unless we commit ourselves to providing the resources \nnecessary for States to carry out the reforms outlined in this bill, we \nwill be doing serious harm to our children.\n  I will vote in support of this bill today with the belief that it \nwill improve the educational and learning opportunities of the school \nchildren in Vermont and across the Nation. I urge my colleagues to \ncontinue our commitment to education and to provide the resources \nnecessary to ensure that this far-reaching legislation achieves its \ngoals.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. 1, \nthe Better Education for Students and Teachers Act (the ``BEST'' Act), \nwhich will reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. \n(``ESEA'').\n  President Bush has appropriately indicated that education reform is \nhis number one priority. The BEST bill, which is based on the \nPresident's blueprint, is premised on the President's goal: ``No Child \nLeft Behind.'' I share the President's goal. Our educational system \nmust leave no child behind.\n  Education is the key to a better quality of life for all Americans. \nFrom early childhood through adult life, educational resources must be \nprovided and supported through partnerships with individuals, parents, \ncommunities, and local government. The federal government has a \nlimited, but important role in assisting states and local authorities \nwith the ever-increasing burdens of education.\n  Originally passed in 1965, the ESEA provides authority for most \nfederal programs for elementary and secondary education. ESEA programs \ncurrently receive about $18 billion in federal funding, which amounts \nto an estimated 7 cents out of every dollar that is spent on education.\n  Nearly half of ESEA funds are used on behalf of children from low-\nincome families, under Title I. Since 1965, the federal government has \nspent more than $120 billion on Title I.\n  Despite the conscientious efforts of federal, state, and local \nentities over many years, our education system continues to lag behind \nother comparable nations. Nearly 70% of inner city fourth graders are \nunable to read at a\n\n[[Page S6292]]\n\nbasic level on national reading tests. Fourth grade math students in \nhigh poverty schools remain two grade levels behind their peers in \nother schools. Our high school seniors score lower than students in \nmost industrialized nations on international math tests. And, \napproximately one-third of college freshman must take a remedial course \nbefore they are able to even begin college level courses.\n  The underlying issue is--do we just pour more taxpayer dollars to \nperpetuate these mediocre results or do we take some bold new \ninitiatives?\n  Increased federal education funding, increased state and local \nflexibility in their use of federal funds, and increased accountability \nare all components of this bill that are steps in the right direction.\n  First, in regard to funding, Republicans, Democrats, and Independents \nwill continue to support increased education funding. Last year, nearly \n$44.5 billion was appropriated to the Department of Education. This was \na $6.6 billion increase from Fiscal Year 2000 levels. Without a doubt, \neducation will receive another significant increase this year when \nCongress passes the appropriations bill that funds the Department of \nEducation.\n  Next, in regard to flexibility, the BEST bill significantly increases \nstate and local flexibility in the use of their federal education \ndollars.\n  In the current fiscal year, the ESEA funds over 60 programs. Most of \nthese programs have a specified purpose and a target population.\n  Our schools do not need a targeted one size fits all Washington, D.C. \napproach to education. While schools in Boston, Massachusetts may need \nto use federal education dollars to hire additional teachers to reduce \nclassroom size, schools in other parts of the country may wish to use \nfederal dollars for a more pressing need, like new text books. \nFederally targeted programs for a specified purpose do not recognize \nthat different states and localities have different needs.\n  Who is in a better position to recognize these local needs, Senators \nand Representatives in Washington, D.C. or Governors, localities, and \nparents? Those Virginians serving in state and local government and \nserving on local school boards throughout the Commonwealth are \ncertainly in a better position than members of Congress from other \nstates to determine how best to spend education dollars in the \nCommonwealth of Virginia.\n  The BEST Act increases flexibility and local control. The Straight \nA's provisions of this bill and the Teacher Empowerment provisions \nserve as two good examples.\n  The Straight A's provisions of this bill creates a 7 state and 25 \ndistrict demonstration program. Under the program, 7 states and 25 \ndistricts that choose to participate gain the flexibility to \nconsolidate a number of federal formula grant programs and integrate \nthese federal dollars with state and local monies that serve children.\n  In addition, S. 1, in its Teacher Empowerment provisions, \nconsolidates the targeted and inflexible class size reduction programs \nand the targeted Eisenhower Professional development program. The money \nin these programs is consolidated so states and localities can use \nthese funds for a variety of options, including hiring additional \nteachers, retaining high quality teachers, developing professional \ndevelopment programs, or to hire mentors, to name a few of the numerous \noptions.\n  Straight A's and the Teacher Empowerment provisions are key \ncomponents of the increased flexibility provided in the BEST bill.\n  Finally, accountability, in certain areas, is needed. Our education \npolicy is locking out many students and not providing them the key to a \nbetter life. It's time to move forward in education to ensure that all \nof our children are given the opportunity to receive a higher quality \nof education.\n  Let's seize this challenge.\n  President Bush's proposal to test students annually in grades 3-8 in \nreading and math, which is part of the BEST bill, is a strong proposal \nthat promotes accountability.\n  These tests will result in parents and teachers receiving the \ninformation they need to know to determine how well their children and \nstudents are doing in school and how well the school is educating. \nTesting also provides educators the information they need to help them \nbetter learn what works, improve their skills, and increase teacher \neffectiveness.\n  While some have expressed concern that President Bush's proposal \ncalls for too much testing, I have a different view. A yearly standard \ntest in reading and math will allow our educators to catch any problems \nin reading and math at the earliest possible moment. Tests are becoming \na vital part of life, no matter how onerous. If America is to survive \nin the rapidly emerging global economy, tests are a key part.\n  I note that Virginia has already recognized the importance of \ntesting, having installed an accountability system called the Standards \nof Learning (SOLs). In Virginia, we already test our students in math \nand science in grades 3, 5, and 8. The accountability provisions in the \nBEST bill will augment the Commonwealth of Virginia's Standards of \nLearning.\n  Mr. President, in summary, the evidence demonstrates that the $120 \nbillion spent on elementary and secondary education since 1965 has \nproduced mediocre results, at best. This bipartisan legislation is a \nstep in the right direction, and I look forward to President Bush \nultimately signing education reform legislation into law.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, for nearly 2 months the Senate has been \ndebating reform measures that would establish new goals for our \nteachers, our schools, our students and their parents. These \nsubstantial and creative measures passed the Senate today as part of \nthe reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  The legislation focuses on improving student achievement, student \nperformance, and school success through expanding accountability \nprovisions, increasing resources, improving technical assistance, and \nproviding mechanisms intended to help turn around schools which are \nfalling short. The bill seeks to ensure that local education agencies \nand States have the resources over the next four years to put a highly \nqualified teacher in every classroom. This provision also includes an \namendment that I offered which provides that the professional \ndevelopment training authorized for these teachers also include \ntraining in the use of computer technology to improve student learning \nin core academic subjects.\n  The bill also provides for over 125,000 new teachers to be paired \nwith mentors and to have the opportunity for year-long internships. The \nReading First provisions of the legislation authorize an important new \ninitiative that provides nearly $1 billion for States and local school \ndistricts to improve reading education, and help teachers get ready to \nensure that all children become proficient readers by the end of the \nthird grade. I am pleased that an amendment I offered, to permit funds \nunder this program to be used for family literacy programs, was \nadopted.\n  The bill also authorizes partnership grants, a new initiative \ndesigned to boost achievement in the areas of math and science through \nstrengthening and training and recruitment of highly qualified \nteachers; and continues the ``Preparing Tomorrow's Teachers to Use \nTechnology'' program, which trains teachers in the use of technology in \nthe classroom.\n  Mr. President, this legislation contains extremely complicated \ntesting requirements. I have reservations about the utility of such a \nfederal mandate, given the tests that are already administered in my \nState of Michigan. However, because I support the essential reforms \nalso included in this legislation, I have decided, on balance, to \nsupport the bill.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Senate is about to vote on one of \nthe most important pieces of legislation that we will debate this year. \nThe Elementary and Secondary Education Act has provided the framework \nfor the Federal role in education for more than 35 years. The bill \ncurrently before us, the Better Education for Students and Teachers \nAct, will chart the course for the Federal role in education for the \nnext seven years and beyond.\n  I strongly support maintaining local control over decisions affecting \nour children's day-to-day classroom experiences. The Federal Government \nhas an important role to play in supporting our States and school \ndistricts as they carry out one of their most important\n\n[[Page S6293]]\n\nresponsibilities the education of our children.\n  Every child in this country has the right to a free public education. \nEvery child. That is an awesome responsibility, and one that should not \nhave to be shouldered by local communities alone. The States and the \nFederal Government are partners in this worthy goal, and ESEA is the \ndocument that outlines the Federal Government's responsibilities to our \nNation's children, to those who educate them, and to our States and \nlocal school districts.\n  It is with this bill that we must find the right balance between \nlocal control and Federal targeting and accountability guidelines for \nthe Federal dollars that are so crucial to local school districts \nthroughout the United States.\n  Ninety percent of American children attend public schools. More than \n879,000 young people in my home state of Wisconsin are enrolled in \npublic schools, from pre-school through grade twelve. I am a graduate \nof the Wisconsin public schools, and I am proud to say that all four of \nmy children have attended them as well.\n  The legislation before us has generated vigorous debate in Wisconsin. \nI have heard from parents, teachers, school board members, school \nadministrators, school counselors and social workers, state officials, \nand other interested observers. And their comments are clear: they say \nthat the Congress must not undermine the targeted measures aimed at \nimproving education for disadvantaged students. They say that we must \nlive up to our commitment to fully fund the Federal share of elementary \nand secondary education programs.\n  If we are, as President Bush has said, to ``leave no child behind,'' \nwe should ensure that the programs created to help the most vulnerable \nchildren are fully funded.\n  We should fully fund title I, we should fully fund the Federal share \nof the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), we should \nfully fund Head Start, we should fully fund Impact Aid, and we should \nfully fund these programs in a fiscally responsible manner.\n  For too long, the Federal Government has failed to live up to its \npromise to fund these and other important education programs. During \nthis debate, some of our colleagues have argued that money is not the \nonly answer, and they are partially correct. In Wisconsin, however, \nwhere the State imposes limits on the amount of money that school \ndistricts can raise and spend annually, Federal funding is absolutely \ncritical. I have heard time and again from frustrated school board \nmembers who have to make the tough decisions about which programs to \nfund and which programs to cut. In this time of economic prosperity, we \nshould not pit groups of students against each other for scarce \neducation dollars.\n  In that regard, I am pleased that the Senate has passed amendments to \nthis legislation that authorize the full funding of title I and of \nIDEA.\n  Nevertheless, I cannot support a bill that includes a new, largely \nunfunded Federal mandate for annual testing in grades 3-8. As I noted \nearlier in this debate, the response to this proposal from the people \nof my state is almost universally negative. My constituents oppose this \nproposal for many reasons, including the cost of developing and \nimplementing additional tests, the loss of teaching time every year to \nprepare for and take the tests, the linking of success on these tests \nto ESEA administrative funds, and the pressure that these additional \ntests will place on students, teachers, schools, and school districts.\n  I am pleased that the Senate adopted amendments to help to ensure \nthat these tests are of a high quality, to award bonuses to States for \ndeveloping high quality tests rather than for the speed with which the \ntesting program is implemented, and to require a study by the General \nAccounting Office on the true costs of these tests to the States. I am \nalso pleased that the Senate adopted an amendment to increase the \nfunding provided for these tests by the Federal Government, but I \nremain concerned that this bill still falls far short of authorizing \nenough funding for this new Federal mandate.\n  I am concerned that this bill does not do enough to ensure that local \nschool districts will have the resources to help students be successful \non these tests. I am disappointed that the Senate failed to adopt an \namendment offered by the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone, of \nwhich I was an original cosponsor, which would have modified the annual \ntesting provisions to clarify that States would not have been required \nto implement the annual tests unless title I is funded at $24.7 billion \nby July 1, 2005, funding levels consistent with the Dodd-Collins \namendment adopted by the Senate.\n  I was also pleased to cosponsor an amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom South Carolina, Mr. Hollings, which would have allowed a State to \nopt out of the new federal testing requirements if the State already \nhas comparable accountability measures in place. Many States and local \nschool districts around the country, including Wisconsin, have such \nprograms. We should leave the means and frequency of assessment up to \nthe States and local school districts who bear the responsibility for \neducating our children. Every State and every school district is \ndifferent. A uniform testing policy may not be the best approach.\n  I have also heard from a number of my constituents that this Congress \nshould do nothing that would undermine the good that the Federal \nGovernment's support has done to help states and local school districts \nover the last several years. They told me that we should not undermine \nthe progress that we have made in smaller class sizes, in technology \neducation, in standards-based reform, and in accountability for \nresults.\n  I regret that this bill does not authorize class size reduction as an \nindependent program. And I particularly regret that the amendment to \nreinstate this program that was offered by the Senator from Washington, \nMrs. Murray, was defeated. I am baffled by the argument put forth by \nsome of our colleagues that smaller classes mean less to students than \nthe presence of a good teacher in the classroom. I would argue that \nboth are important. Of course, a good teacher makes a huge difference. \nBut even the best teacher in the country will have far better results \nwith 18 students instead of 50.\n  My home state of Wisconsin is a leader in the effort to reduce class \nsize in kindergarten through third grade. The Student Achievement \nGuarantee in Education, SAGE, program is a statewide effort to reduce \nclass size to 15 students in kindergarten through third grade.\n  The SAGE program began during the 1996-1997 school year with 30 \nparticipating schools. Now in the program's fifth year, there are \nnearly 600 participating schools.\n  According to the recently-released program evaluation for the 1999-\n2000 school year, conducted by the SAGE Evaluation Team at the \nUniversity of Wisconsin Milwaukee:\n  ``When adjusted for pre-existing differences in academic achievement, \nattendance, socioeconomic status and race, SAGE students showed \nsignificant improvement over their Comparison school counterparts from \nthe beginning of first grade to the end of third grade across all \nacademic areas.''\n  The study also found that ``teaching in reduced size classrooms is \ncharacterized by more individualization, time spent on teaching rather \nthan disciplining, class discussion, hands on activities, content \ncoverage, and teacher enthusiasm.''\n  The results speak for themselves. Smaller classes translate to better \ninstruction and better achievement.\n  The education community in my State is also deeply concerned and I \nshare this concern about proposals that would shift scarce Federal tax \ndollars away from the public schools they are intended to support.\n  I commend the work of the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, \nand the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Jeffords, and others who have worked \nso diligently these past weeks to negotiate compromise language with \nthe Administration on many of the issues that remained outstanding \nfollowing the HELP Committee's mark-up of this legislation. I regret \nthat I am unable to support this compromise for a number of reasons.\n  I am troubled by language in this compromise that would require \nschool districts to use up to 15 percent of their Title I money to pay \nfor supplementary services or transportation for public school choice \nfor students in schools\n\n[[Page S6294]]\n\nthat have failed to make adequate yearly progress for three years. This \nprovision would mean that a school that is already in trouble would \nhave as little as 85 percent of its Title I money available for school \nprograms. If Congress agrees to divert badly-needed Title I money for \nsupplemental services, it is all the more urgent that we fully fund the \nTitle I program.\n  I am also concerned about the so-called ``Straight A's'' performance \nagreement pilot program that is included in the bill. This provision \nwould allow seven States and 25 districts in effect to block grant most \nof their ESEA funding. I am pleased that this provision stipulates that \nthis funding cannot be used for private school vouchers and that it can \nonly be used for specified activities. I am also pleased that \nindividual school districts within the seven States that participate in \nthis program may apply to opt out of the State's performance agreement.\n  Supporters of this provision use terms like ``consolidation of \nFederal funds'' and ``flexibility,'' but let's be honest. This is a \nblock grant. This new version of the Straight A's proposal is an \nimprovement over earlier versions, but I remain concerned about the \nimpact this consolidation of funds will have on proven programs such as \nclass size reduction, 21st Century Community Learning Centers, and Safe \nand Drug Free Schools; and on professional development for teachers and \nother school professionals.\n  I regret that the Senate did not adopt an amendment offered by the \nSenator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, to remove the 21st Century \nCommunity Learning Centers from this block grant, an amendment which I \nsupported and which was supported by many of my constituents.\n  Another reason I will oppose this bill is the inclusion of an \namendment offered by the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions, pertaining \nto discipline procedures for special education students. This amendment \nis a huge step backward in the fight to protect the civil rights of \ndisabled students, and I hope that the conferees on this bill will work \nto improve this language to ensure that those rights continue to be \nprotected.\n  In closing, this debate gave us the opportunity to strengthen public \neducation in America. Unfortunately, many of the provisions contained \nin this bill may, in fact, undermine public education by blurring the \nlines between public and private, between church and State, and between \nlocal control and Federal mandates. I must therefore oppose the bill, \nand I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n\n\n                  in support of our nation's teachers\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise once again today in support of the \nover 3,000,000 teachers in this country.\n  In the early days of the debate on this education bill, I, along with \nSenator Collins, offered a Sense of the Senate amendment on May 8, \n2001. This amendment, which passed by a vote of 95-3, stated:\n\n     the Senate should pass legislation providing elementary and \n     secondary level educators with additional tax relief in \n     recognition of the many out of pocket, unreimbursed expenses \n     educators incur to improve the education of our Nation's \n     students.\n\n  Later, on May 23, 2001, on the tax reconciliation bill of 2001, the \nSenate passed a Collins-Warner amendment to provide teachers with such \ntax relief. The amendment passed the Senate by a vote of 98-2.\n  I worked with Senator Collins on this amendment because I recognize \nthat individuals do not pursue a career in the teaching profession for \nthe salary. People go into the teaching profession for different \npersonal commitments--to educate the next generation, to strengthen \nAmerica.\n  While many people spend their lives building careers, our teachers \nspend their careers building lives.\n  Simply put, to teach is to touch a life forever.\n  How true that is. I venture to say that every one of us can remember \nat least one teacher and the special influence he or she had on our \nlives.\n  Even though we are all well aware of the important role our teachers \nplay, it goes without saying that our teachers are underpaid, \noverworked, and all too often, underappreciated.\n  In addition to these factors, our teachers also expend significant \nmoney out of their own pocket to better the education of our children. \nMost typically, our teachers are spending money out of their own pocket \non: one, education expenses brought into the classroom--such as books, \nsupplies, pens, paper, and computer equipment; and, two, professional \ndevelopment expenses--such as tuition, fees, books, and supplies \nassociated with courses that help our teachers become even better \ninstructors.\n  These out-of-pocket costs place lasting financial burdens on our \nteachers. This is one reason our teachers are leaving the profession. \nLittle wonder that our country is in the midst of a teacher shortage.\n  Estimates are that 2.4 million new teachers will be needed by 2009 \nbecause of teacher attrition, teacher retirement and increased student \nenrollment.\n  While the primary responsibility rests with the states, I believe the \nFederal Government can and should play a role in helping to alleviate \nthe nation's teaching shortage.\n  Here is an example of such help. On a Federal level, we can encourage \nindividuals to enter the teaching profession and remain in the teaching \nprofession by reimbursing them for the costs that teachers voluntarily \nincur as part of the profession. This incentive will help financially \nstrapped urban and rural school systems as they recruit new teachers \nand struggle to keep those teachers that are currently in the system.\n  With these premises in mind, Senator Collins and I offered the \nCollins-Warner amendment to the Tax Reconciliation Act of 2001.\n  This amendment which, again, passed the Senate in a vote of 98-2, had \ntwo components. First, the legislation would have provided a $250 tax \ncredit to teachers for classroom supplies. This credit recognizes that \nour teachers dip into their own pocket in significant amounts to bring \nsupplies into the classroom to better the education of our children.\n  Second, this legislation would have provided a $500 above the line \ndeduction for professional development costs that teachers incur. This \ndeduction would particularly help low-income school districts that \ntypically do not have the finances to pay for professional development \ncosts for their teachers.\n  Unfortunately, this important Collins-Warner amendment was not \nincluded in the tax legislation that emerged from conference. Thus, the \ntax relief measure signed into law by President Bush did not contain \nthe Collins-Warner amendment.\n  The education legislation that will pass the Senate today, the Better \nEducation for Students and Teachers Act, the BEST Act, is based on a \nprinciple put forth by President Bush entitled, ``No Child Left \nBehind.''\n  As we move towards final passage of legislation that will implement \nreforms to achieve the goal of ``Leaving No Child Behind,'' we must \nkeep in mind the other component in our education system--the teachers. \nIf we fail to accord equal recognition to our teachers, our children \nwill be left behind.\n  Therefore, let me be clear: Senator Collins and I will not forget our \nteachers.\n  Senator Collins and I will continue to work hard to ensure that our \nteachers receive recognition in the tax code for the many personal and \nfinancial sacrifices they make to better the education of America's \nyouth.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the ``Better \nEducation for Students and Teachers Act.''\n  Education no longer simply involves students learning the \nfundamentals of reading, writing, and arithmetic. Rather, students must \npossess the resources to compete and succeed as we proceed into the \nnew, highly technical millennium.\n  The computer and the Internet have become integrated into every \naspect of our lives, and are becoming essential teaching tools in our \nschools and a basic component of any classroom. To meet this challenge, \nwe must strive for innovative ideas and to determine exactly how we can \nmaximize the Federal government's resources because: Even on its best \nday the Federal Government can never be a replacement for local \nadministrators, educators, and parents.\n  Simply put, New Mexicans are in a far better position to know exactly\n\n[[Page S6295]]\n\nwhat our schools and students need than government officials here in \nWashington.\n  Most Washingtonians probably do not know the Corona School District \nhas 82 students, the Deming School District has 5,300 students, and the \nAlbuquerque School District has 85,000 students. Additionally, the \nGallup School District encompasses nearly 5,000 square miles, an area \ngreater than Rhode Island and Delaware combined.\n  My point is simple, a one-size fits all approach cannot work in New \nMexico and will not work in many areas of our country. Consequently, we \nmust have solutions that are flexible and meet the diverse needs of our \nStates, school districts, and schools. I would like to take a couple of \nminutes and provide my perspective on how we arrived at the point we \nare today with the BEST Bill.\n  Not too long ago during the mid 1990's a number of us came to the \nconclusion that the current K-12 education status quo could no longer \nbe maintained. I think this realization may have been spurred by \nSenator Frist's excellent work as the chair of the Senate Budget \nCommittee Task Force on Education.\n  The Task Force produced: Prospects for Reform: The State of American \nEducation and the Federal Role. The report asked the simple question of \n``how well are our children doing?''\n  The answer was mediocre at best because student achievement had \nstagnated over the past two decades even though America had established \na record of near universal access and completion of high school. Thus, \nthe report concluded that we must address the issue of a quality \neducational system. In other words the need for academic competence and \nrigor.\n  Building upon the excellent work of the Task Force, Senator Frist \nsoon introduced the ``Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999'' \ncommonly referred to as ``Ed-Flex.''\n  The Bill simply said: one-size does not fit all and thus, States \nshould be allowed to waive-out of the regulations pertaining to certain \nFederal K-12 Education programs. ``Ed-Flex already existed as part of a \ndemonstration program and Senator Frist's Bill merely sought to provide \nall fifty states with that same flexibility.\n  The Senate passed the Bill overwhelmingly by a vote of 98-1 and \nwithin a month the President had signed the measure into law. \nUnfortunately, after the passage of ``Ed-Flex'' for a variety of \nreasons there was not any further fundamental changes made to our K-12 \nsystem.\n  Instead, since the last reauthorization of the ESEA in 1994 there is \none approach that we learned is a complete failure: merely providing \nmore funding.\n  In 1996 the Federal Government spent about $23 billion on education \nand within a few short years the number ballooned to over $42 billion \nin FY 2001. The logical conclusion is that a near doubling of \neducational funding would result in dramatic improvements in student \nachievement.\n  Sadly, for all of our funding we simply do not have the matching \nresults.\n  For instance, in 1996 the average reading score for a 4th grader was \n212 and the Federal Government spent about $11 billion on the ESEA. \nFive years later, Federal spending on the ESEA had nearly doubled to \n$20 billion, while the average reading score of a 4th grader remained \nat 212.\n  In New Mexico, the number of 4th graders testing at or above \nproficient in reading actually fell from 23 percent in 1992 to 22 \npercent in 1998. I would submit that we are not receiving a very good \nreturn on our investment, a near doubling of funding with no \ncorresponding improvement.\n  Imagine saving a greater and greater portion of your paycheck each \nweek and after five years actually having less money. I think it is \nfair to say that very few individuals would stand for these results, if \ninstead of students we were talking about our retirement savings.\n  Thus, we are now debating the BEST Bill because many of us believe we \nsimply must have a new approach to measuring academic success.\n  The Bill fundamentally alters the practice of Washington deciding the \nbest educational practices and then distributing increasingly greater \nand greater sums of money without any accountability. Make no mistake, \nwe have not abandoned our commitment to providing the necessary \nresources to our States and school districts.\n  In fiscal year 2001 ESEA spending totaled $18.4 billion. President \nBush's FY 2002 Budget proposal requested a $19.1 billion authorization \nfor ESEA for FY 2002, a nine percent increase.\n  Building upon the President's proposal, the FY 2002 Budget Resolution \nincludes the President's nine percent increase in federal education \nspending for reading education, the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act, IDEA, and teacher training. I think it is also important \nto note that on May 3 when the Senate began debate, the BEST Bill \nalready authorized $27.7 billion for ESEA in FY 2002, a 57-percent \nincrease over 2001 and nearly $190 billion over the authorization \nperiod of FY 2002-2008.\n  If one does not believe that is enough then you will be interested to \nhear how much spending we have added since May 3: $11 billion in ESEA \nand other education spending for a total of $38.8 billion in FY 2002, \nan increase of 120 percent over FY 2001; $211 billion in ESEA and other \neducation spending for a total of $416 billion over the seven year \nauthorization period of the Bill; and of that total, $112 billion is \nmandatory spending under the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct, IDEA.\n  With the preceding as a backdrop, I believe the BEST Bill follows the \nPresident's promise to ``Leave No Child Behind'' by ensuring academic \nsuccess through a fresh approach to education.\n  Our schools will be held accountable for their progress in educating \nour children through high standards, testing, and consequences for \nfailure. Every child in grades 3-8 will be tested in reading and math \nproficiency annually.\n  In New Mexico alone about 151,000 students will be tested. Also, the \nState will receive an additional $4.5 million next year and more than \n$33 million over the next seven years to offset any new costs.\n  Instead of simply continuing to receive increased Federal funding in \nthe face of failure, schools will now face consequences for persistent \nfailure. Schools failing to demonstrate improvement will face \ncorrective action, parents will be given the option of public school \nchoice and supplemental services for their children, and ultimately a \nschool's persistent failure could lead to reconstitution.\n  Consolidation of duplicative education programs will provide maximum \nlocal flexibility to focus on improving student achievement. For \ninstance, Title II of the BEST Bill creates a new State Teacher \nDevelopment grant program with a substantially larger pot of money by \ncombining all of the current teacher funding.\n  States will have the option to use the funding for professional \ndevelopment; teacher mentoring; merit pay; teacher testing; as well as \nrecruiting and training high quality teachers. For example, New Mexico \nmaintains a commendable student-teacher ratio of 15.2 and under the \nBill will no longer be required to use a portion of these funds for \nclass size reduction.\n  Instead, New Mexico will have the option to use that money for \nteacher recruitment and retention programs or maybe additional \ntraining.\n  The new accountability provisions will ensure that historic increases \nin Federal education funding will be based upon school performance.\n  The Bill includes the President's ``Reading First'' initiative to \nensure all children in kindergarten through third grade become \nproficient readers by the end of third grade. The Bill also includes \nprograms to create Math and Science Partnerships, Strengthen After-\nSchool Care, and provide for Early Childhood Reading Instruction.\n  Parents and the public will be given detailed school-by-school Report \nCards on the performance of their schools. Parents will have the option \nto transfer their child from a failing public school to an effective \npublic school with transportation provided or to redirect their child's \nshare of Federal funds toward tutoring or after-school academic \nservices.\n  Parents will be given the option to transfer their child out of a \npersistently unsafe public school to another public school of their \nchoice. As Congress proceeds, one of its primary missions will be to \ndetermine what is working, what is not working, and what can be \nimproved to give our children a better chance of succeeding in the \nfuture.\n\n[[Page S6296]]\n\n  Before I conclude, I would like to briefly talk about several \nprovisions that are of personal importance to me.\n  First, Senator Dodd and a bipartisan group of Senators joined me \nearlier this year to introduce the ``Strong Character for Strong \nSchools Act.''\n  I think it is important to note that reform does not only apply math, \nscience, and reading; instead we must also reform the culture of our \nschools. Our Bill will be part of an amendment offered by Senator \nCochran and seeks to encourage the creation of character education \nprograms at the State and local level by providing grants to eligible \nentities.\n  I believe our Bill builds upon the highly successful demonstration \nprogram to increase character education that was contained in the last \nESEA Bill. Since 1994, the Department of Education has made $25 million \nin ``seed money'' grants available to 28 states to develop character \neducation programs.\n  Currently, there are 36 States that have either received Federal \nfunding, or have enacted their own laws mandating or encouraging \ncharacter education. Thus, the time is now to ensure that there is a \npermanent and dedicated funding source available for character \neducation programs.\n  I also believe schools must not only have the resources for core \nmissions like teaching reading, writing, math, and the sciences, but \nthe additional resources to face emerging challenges. Thus, I am \nextremely pleased the Senate has accepted an amendment authored by \nSenator Kennedy and I to increase student access to mental health \nservices by developing links between school districts and the local \nmental health system.\n  School districts would partner with mental health agencies, juvenile \njustice authorities, and any other relevant entities to better \ncoordinate mental health services by: improving preventive, diagnostic, \nand treatment services available to students; providing crisis \nintervention services and appropriate referrals for students in need of \nmental health services and continuing mental health services; and \neducating teachers, principals, administrators, and other school \npersonnel about the services.\n  Finally, we must provide our school districts and schools with the \nresources to both recruit and retain the best available teachers for \nour children.\n  Earlier this year I introduced the ``Teacher Recruitment, \nDevelopment, and Retention Act of 2001.''\n  I am very pleased to see elements of that Bill included in the \npending legislation. I am also grateful the Senate has accepted my \namendment that will allow States the option of using Teacher Quality \nfunds for the creation of Teacher Recruitment Centers.\n  Teacher Recruitment Centers will serve as statewide clearinghouses \nfor the recruitment and placement of K-12 teachers. The Centers would \nalso be responsible for creating programs to further teacher \nrecruitment and retention within the state.\n  Thank you and I look forward to the working with my colleagues on \nthis important issue and final passage of this Bill.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the bipartisan bill that the Senate \nhas developed over the last 2 months makes major reforms in education \npolicy by focusing on student achievement and by making schools \naccountable for results. California's public schools should be \nstrengthened by this bill.\n  This bill includes several important reforms.\n  The bill extends the current requirement that states must have \nacademic standards for reading and math and also requires states to \nestablish standards for science and history.\n  Students must reach a proficient level within ten years by making \ncontinuous and substantial academic improvement.\n  To ensure that students are learning, states are required to test \nevery student in grades 3-8 annually in reading and math based on state \nstandards.\n  To ensure accountability, schools that fail for two consecutive years \nto make adequate yearly progress must be identified for improvement and \nalso must identify specific steps to improve student performance.\n  Local school districts must correct failing schools and states must \ncorrect failing districts either through new curriculum, restructuring \nthe school, or reconstituting the school staff.\n  In order to improve teacher quality, this bill authorizes grants to \nstates for teacher certification, recruitment, and retention services.\n  The bill enhances programs for limited English proficient children by \nproviding teacher training and funds for programs to improve the \nEnglish proficiency of these students.\n  The bill authorizes $1.5 billion for afterschool programs to help \nstruggling students get tutoring and other help.\n  There are many other important provisions.\n  It is my hope that this bill will offer opportunities for progress to \nmany California students, school officials, parents and the public.\n  California students perform very poorly compared to students in many \nother states. Our schools are struggling on virtually every front. \nCalifornia has some of the largest classes in the nation; California \nhas overcrowded and substandard facilities; California has 30,000 \nuncredentialed teachers and a projected enrollment rate triple that of \nthe national rate.\n  Here are some examples of how California's schools fall short:\n  Thirty-four percent of California's schools that participate in Title \nI are identified for improvement compared to the national average of 19 \npercent, according to the U.S. Department of Education.\n  Only 20 percent of California's fourth grade students are proficient \nin reading, ranking thirty-six out of thirty-nine states. California \nranks thirty-two out of thirty-six states for proficient eight graders \nin reading, at twenty-two percent, according to Education Weekly \nQuarterly Report, January 2001.\n  California is ranked seventh in the Nation for the highest number of \nLevel I Literacy citizens, the worst level possible, according to the \nNational Institute for Literacy.\n  California spent $5,462 per student in 1999, approximately $1,500 \nless than the U.S. average, ranking 42nd out of 50 states, according to \nRankings and Estimates; NEA Research, October 1999.\n  Now let's compare U.S. students to students in other countries. \nStudents in the United States also perform poorly compared to their \ninternational counterparts.\n  In literacy, 58 percent of United States high school graduates rank \nbelow an international literacy standard, dead last among the twenty-\nnine countries that participated, according to Education Week, April 4, \n2001.\n  U.S. eighth graders scored significantly lower in mathematics and \nscience than their peers in fourteen of the thirty-eight participating \ncountries, according to 1999 TIMMS Benchmarking Study.\n  The percentage of teachers in the United States that feel they are \n``very well prepared'' to teach science in the classroom is 27 percent. \nThe international average is twice that, peaking at 56 percent, \naccording to 1999 TIMMS Benchmarking Study.\n  U.S. students' knowledge of civic activities ranked third out of the \n28 countries that participated. However, those same students have been \nslipping in scores relating to math and science. Source: Civic Know-\nHow: U.S. Students Rise to Test, International Association for the \nEvaluation of Educational Achievement.\n  I am very pleased that the Senate approved several amendments that I \nsuggested.\n  One, title I funding: The bill revises the funding formula for title \nI, Education of Disadvantaged Children, to better reflect the growth in \npoor students for States with growing student populations, giving \nCalifornia an increase of $98 million over fiscal year 2001, at the \nPresident's fiscal year 2002 budget request level.\n  Two, title I use of funds: In an effort to better focus title I funds \non academic instruction, the bill prohibits school districts from using \nfunds for the purchase or lease of privately-owned facilities, \nfacilities maintenance, gardening, landscaping, janitorial services, \npayment of utility costs, construction of facilities, acquisition of \nreal property, payment of travel and attendance costs at conferences or \nother meetings, other than travel and attendance for professional\n\n[[Page S6297]]\n\ndevelopment. This is similar to the bill I introduced, S. 309.\n  Three, title I audit: The bill requires the Inspector General to \nconduct of audit to determine how title I funds are used and the degree \nto which they are used for academic instruction.\n  Four, master teachers: The bill includes my amendment to allow use of \nthe teacher training funds in the bill for school districts to create \nmaster teacher positions so school districts can increase teacher \nsalaries for excellent teachers to mentor and supervise other teachers, \nin an effort to keep new teachers in teaching. This is an outgrowth of \na bill I introduced on January 22, S. 120.\n\n  Five, small schools: The bill allows the use of Innovative Education \nfunds, title V, for States and districts to build smaller schools. The \nupper limits on the number of students would be for elementary schools, \n500 students; middle schools, 750 students; and high schools, 1,000. \nThis parallels my bill, S. 308.\n  Six, HeadStart teachers: The bill allows forgiveness of up to $5,000 \nof federal student loans for college graduates who agree to teach in \nHead Start programs, in an effort to put more trained teachers in pre-\nschool programs, similar to S. 123, which I introduced on January 22.\n  Seven, gun-free schools clarification: The bill includes several \nclarifications of the current Gun-Free Schools Act, the law which \nrequires a one-year expulsion for students who ``bring'' a gun to \nschool. This bill (1) includes students who ``possess'' a gun at \nschool; and (2) clarifies that the term ``school'' means the entire \nschool campus, any setting under the control and supervision of the \nlocal school district; and (3) requires that all modifications of \nexpulsions be put in writing.\n  It is a good bill. American education should benefit immensely from \nthis bill. Now the task is to provide sufficient funding and other \nresources to our schools to implement the reforms we are passing.\n  I look forward to working for the bill's final enactment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1, the \nBetter Education for Students and Teachers, or BEST Act. Debate on this \nbill has provided the Senate with an important opportunity to assess \nthe Federal Government's role in educating our children. It has given \nus the chance to strengthen the programs which are working and to \nreform those that are not. Most importantly the Senate has taken this \nopportunity to empower parents, teachers and local administrators with \nnew flexibility and resources, so that we can achieve the fundamental \ngoal of our schools: helping every student learn.\n  America's continued prosperity demands a well-educated workforce. In \ntheir lifetimes, our children and grandchildren will witness scientific \nand technological advances which are unimaginable today. Yet, their \nability to take advantage of these marvels will be dependent upon a \nstrong foundation in the fundamentals of learning--reading, writing, \nmath, and science. After all, a computer is nothing but a useless \nplastic and metal box, if a student doesn't know how to use it. \nLikewise, the Internet, with all its possibilities, is meaningless if a \nchild can't read the words on the screen.\n  Over the course of this debate, the American people have had the \nopportunity to view two contrasting visions for our Nation's schools. \nFor far too long, the vision of too many has been based on the \nWashington-knows-best philosophy of the last 35 years. Under this mind \nset, for every possible problem in our schools, the Federal Government \nshould design a new Government program with new government regulations \nand a new government bureaucracy. For instance, the Federal Government \nprovides only seven percent of total spending on education yet demands \n50 percent of all school paperwork. This requires 25,000 education \nprofessionals struggling to fill out forms in order to comply with \nWashington's onerous regulations rather than teaching students. What \nfolly and what a colossal waste of time, talent, and resources.\n  Under this flawed approach, a program is accountable if its \ntriplicate forms' are turned in on time and all the ``I's'' are dotted \nand their ``T's'' are crossed. Whether the program actually helps \nstudents learn has too often been an afterthought. Simply put, school \ndistricts are told to make their problems fit the federal government's \nso-called ``solutions'' rather than allowing schools the flexibility to \ndesign their own appropriate solutions.\n  This leads one to the question ``Has this approach worked?'' Not \nsurprisingly, it hasn't.\n  Unfortunately, too many American children are falling behind. A \nrecent study found that U.S. fourth graders are ranked third in the \nworld in science and compete favorably against their international \ncounterparts in math. This same study shows that by the time these kids \nreach middle school, they finish near the middle of the pack in math \nand science. Worse still by high school, U.S. students rank 19th among \n21 industrial nations in Mathematics and 16th in Applied Sciences, \nThird International Mathematics and Sciences Study. These results are \nunacceptable. How can we tolerate a system in which the longer American \nstudents spend in school, the further they fall behind? We should not \nfool ourselves into thinking that America's international competitors \nwill sit idly by as we struggle to catch up. We must improve our \nschools now in order to ensure that America's students are prepared to \ncompete and succeed at the highest levels.\n  Another failing of this Washington-knows-best vision is the belief \nthat more money will magically solve all that ails our nation's \nschools. Let there be no doubt, resources are important and I am \ncommitted to providing substantial increases in education funding. In \neach of the past 2 years, Republicans in the Senate not only met \nPresident Clinton's education funding requests, but exceeded them by \nbillions of dollars. However, money is only part of the answer. The \ntitle I program was enacted in 1965, in an attempt to close the \nachievement gap between poor students and their wealthier counterparts. \nThirty-five years and $165 billion later, poor students still lag far \nbehind their wealthier peers by an average of 20 points on national \nachievement tests. Worse yet, a recent appraisal by the National \nAssessment of Education Progress found that the achievement gap among \nfourth grade students is growing even wider--NAEP, 4/6/2001.\n  I am proud to say that President Bush, through his ``no child left \nbehind'' blueprint, has offered us a better vision. This legislation \nexpresses the obvious truth that parents, teachers, principals, and \nadministrators have a better understanding of the needs of their \nstudents than the Washington bureaucrats who will never meet these \nchildren, never learn their names, and never come to understand their \nhopes and aspirations. This legislation provides States and local \nschools unprecedented flexibility to design and implement programs \ntailored to their needs with one requirement: results.\n\n  For the first time in history, we will establish a blueprint for \nholding schools accountable for producing results. States will be \nrequired to set high standards and demonstrate progress as measured by \nannual assessments. Now I recognize that annual testing is not the cure \nfor poor performing schools, much the same way that an x-ray cannot \nheal a broken bone. But the x-ray will allow us to better understand \nthe problems and more importantly, better develop the solutions. \nTesting will help parents and teachers evaluate their students and \nschools, determine which are struggling and why, and then ensure they \nreceive the help they need to meet high academic standards.\n  In a perfect world, these assessments would show that all of our \nchildren are learning and that all of our schools are preparing them \nfor the future. Unfortunately, experience tells us otherwise. \nTherefore, we must be prepared to provide both the resources to help \nthose schools which are committed to change and consequences for those \nwhich refuse. For those schools that spurn reform and chronically \nunderperform, I believe we must allow parents choices--whether that be \npublic school choice, supplementary tutoring services, or a private \ninstitution. I believe this point was best expressed by the editorial \nboard of one of my home state newspapers, The Paducah Sun, when it \nencouraged the President and Congress to ``change the formula for \nreform by putting power in the hands of parents--not education \nbureaucrats who have a\n\n[[Page S6298]]\n\nvested interest in protecting the status quo.'' I am pleased this bill \ntakes some positive, first steps in that direction by providing low-\nincome children with expanded access to charter schools, other public \nschools, and private tutors. I am deeply disappointed, however, the \nSenate rejected Senator Gregg's very modest proposal to provide these \nsame children in chronically poor performing schools with the option of \nattending a private school.\n  While the President's accountability and assessment provisions are \nclearly the hallmark of the BEST Act, one should not overlook several \nof the other key provisions included the bill. The President has stated \nthat every child should read by the third grade and the BEST Act \nincorporates his ambitious ``Reading First'' initiative to meet that \ngoal.\n  It also includes a new teacher empowerment initiative which allows \nschool districts increased flexibility in solving their unique \nprofessional development problems: whether that is through hiring new \nteachers, retraining current ones, instituting professional development \nprograms, recruiting other mid-career professionals, or reducing class \nsize.\n  I am also pleased that the BEST Act includes the Straight A's \nDemonstration championed by my colleagues, Senator Gregg and Senator \nFrist. Straight A's is the embodiment of local control. This \ndemonstration project would allow seven States, and up to 25 local \nschool districts, to receive most of their Federal funds in the form of \na single federal grant. In exchange for this unprecedented flexibility, \nthe participating school systems would be required to meet even higher \nstandards of academic achievement than already required in the BEST \nAct. Jefferson County Public Schools, the largest school district in \nKentucky, has expressed an interest in securing one of these Straight \nA's waivers and I hope this fine school system is given full \nconsideration.\n  Over the past several weeks, the Senate has engaged in an earnest and \nlively debate. I am particularly proud of an amendment I authored which \nthe Senate adopted ``The Paul D. Coverdell Teacher Protection Act.'' \nThis legislation builds upon the work of our colleague, Senator \nCoverdell, by extending liability protections to teachers, principals, \nadministrators who act in a reasonable manner to maintain order in the \nclassroom. I am honored that the Senate adopted this amendment in an \noverwhelming 98-1 vote, and I look forward to working with the BEST \nAct's conferees to ensure that it is included in the final conference \nreport.\n  This is not a perfect bill. At times during this debate, the Senate \nhas succumbed to the easy temptation to create more of the narrowly \ntargeted Government programs designed to satisfy needs of one interest \ngroup or another. I believe the Senate could have better served \nAmerica's local schools by simply providing them the necessary \nresources and allowing them the flexibility to design solutions which \nwill meet their particular needs.\n  However, while I may not agree with every amendment the Senate has \nadopted, I believe that on balance this legislation will empower \nparents, teachers, and local administrators with new flexibility and \nresources, so that we can achieve the fundamental goal of our schools: \nhelping every child learn.\n\n\n                       DIAGNOSIS AND PARTNERSHIP\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, two of the concepts that I am pleased to \nhave included in this legislation are the principles of ``diagnosis'' \nand ``partnership.''\n  I would like to thank Senators Kennedy and Gregg for their assistance \nin including this amendment in this legislation.\n  I am also very happy to be joined by my colleague George Allen of \nVirginia as the lead Republican sponsor of this amendment.\n  I can put a human face on this.\n  I have done several workdays in schools facing this situation in \nthroughout Florida.\n  These workday experiences taught me that when students struggle to \nmeet performance standards, there is not one uniform cause of failure.\n  Because of that, there cannot be one uniform remedy to turn a school \naround.\n  School ``A'' may need a revised curriculum, or better qualified \nteachers.\n  While school ``B'', whose students are scoring at the exact same \nlevel as school ``A'' may need English-language tutors and eyesight \nscreening for poor children who may not have had a vision test in their \nlives.\n  Perhaps the single most important action a school or a school \ndistrict, can take at the first sign that students are struggling is a \nthorough analysis of circumstances and conditions that are impacting \nstudent achievement.\n  It's my belief that this analysis should not only encompass factors \nthat are within the school walls, but outside the school walls, in the \ncommunity, as well.\n  Before we start applying remedies to a struggling school from a menu \nof options--let's take the first step and understand what the specific \nchallenges this particular school faces are.\n  It's common sense.\n  I use an analogy of a physician: she must first diagnose the specific \nailment, then she can prescribe the proper treatment.\n  It's important that this same ``diagnosis'' step be included in each \nand every State education plan in America.\n  This leads to part two: Encouraging partnerships.\n  In the course of identifying the particular challenges facing a \nstruggling public school, what happens if one or more of the factors \nimpacting student performance are outside the school?\n  What if one of the reasons that third graders are struggling to read \nis a very high percentage of adult illiteracy in the school district?\n  What if one of the reasons 8th graders are failing at math turns out \nto be a high absenteeism rate because of safety concerns on the walk to \nschool?\n  Such a finding needs be made public--and the school, county, State \nand Federal Government, along with community-based groups, should be \nencouraged to creatively build appropriate partnerships.\n  These partnerships can then get to work and try to mitigate outside-\nthe-school concerns.\n  My wife Adele brought to my attention a school in North Florida, \nAndrew Robinson Elementary in Jacksonville.\n  Principal Erdine Johnson, of Andrew Robinson Elementary school, \nrealized that many of her students could not do their best in the \nclassroom because of a wide range of health concerns.\n  Instead of just declaring that ``this was a `health' not an \n`education' issue'' the North Florida community sprung into action, and \nwe have a success story today.\n  In 1995, the University of Florida worked with Andrew Robinson to \nopen a pediatric health center on-site.\n  This pediatric center at Andrew Robinson offers services to the \nelementary school students, and provides health outreach to the \ncommunity.\n  The staff members at the Center are a vital link between a child's \nhome environment and their ability to learn in the classroom.\n  The Center works with parents on nutrition and wellness issues, and \nprovides preventative screenings for the children.\n  Children living in healthy environments are more ready to learn, and \nthat has meant better test scores, and better lives.\n  This is an example of what our amendment encourages--if a problem \noutside the schools is identified--we encourage creative community \npartnerships to help solve it.\n  Several organizations have joined Senator Allen and me in support of \nour amendment.\n  I would like to include for the Record a letter of support from \nDaniel Merenda, the President and CEO of the National Association of \nPartners in Education.\n  He says, ``Many of the problems facing our students are not because \nof the schools. These problems are created by circumstances and \nconditions found beyond the school.''\n  Once the information is made public about specific concerns outside \nthe school walls, Mr. Merenda predicts the creation of new partnerships \nand the strengthening of existing partnerships.\n  I agree with his assessment.\n  I also have a letter of support from the education organization \nCommunities in Schools, headquartered in Senator Allen's state of \nVirginia.\n\n[[Page S6299]]\n\n  And the Points Of Light Foundation also endorses this amendment in a \nletter I would like to submit for the Record.\n  I want to again thank Senator Allen for working with me on this \nissue, and offer thanks to my colleagues for accepting this amendment \nby voice vote.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Partners in Education,\n\n                                   Alexandria, VA, April 26, 2001.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     Hart Senate Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham, I write to support your suggested \n     ``Diagnosis'' language for the ESEA Reauthorization. As you \n     know the National Association of Partners in Education \n     represents thousands of schools, communities and businesses \n     throughout America who form effective partnerships to support \n     student success in and out of school. Our national network of \n     7,500 members coordinates the work of millions of volunteers \n     in schools.\n       We recently completed Partnership 2000: A Decade of Growth \n     and Change, a national survey of school districts in the \n     United States. The study examines school partnerships in a \n     decade during which education topped America's national \n     agenda. This survey of school partnerships provides a ``next \n     chapter'' to the baseline data we collected in 1990. The \n     survey shows that schools in 69% of districts nationwide are \n     now engaged in partnership activities compared to 51% in \n     1990. Over 35 million students benefit from school \n     partnerships today, 5.3 million more than in 1990. Nearly 3.4 \n     million volunteers serve in America's school partnerships, \n     roughly one for every 14 children in our schools. Volunteers \n     log approximately 109 million hours of work in and out of \n     schools, roughly equivalent to 52,000 full-time staff.\n       In light of these data, your suggested ``diagnosis'' \n     language makes sense. If community and business partners were \n     aware of the specific problems facing a school and causing \n     students to struggle, they could direct their energy and \n     attention to ``fixing'' the problem in and around the \n     schools. Schools can not do it alone.\n       Many of the problems facing our students are not because of \n     schools. These problems are created by circumstances and \n     conditions found beyond the school. Partnerships are an ideal \n     mechanism to address and resolve these problems. Your \n     suggested language for the reauthorization of ESEA will \n     require that schools or school districts take appropriate \n     steps to partner with community groups to mitigate the \n     problem.\n       Senator Graham, the data we have collected indicates \n     community partners are contributing time equivalent to 52,000 \n     full time staff to our schools . . . at no additional cost. \n     Can you imagine what this force could do if schools facing \n     problems were to ask for help? Your suggested language added \n     to the reauthorization of the ESEA could make a significant \n     and real contribution to the thousands of students who are in \n     failing schools.\n       Let me know how we can help. We need the reauthorization of \n     the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to truly help \n     America's school children. Your amendment does exactly that.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Daniel W. Merenda,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       Communities In Schools,\n\n                                      Alexandria, VA, May 3, 2001.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     Hart Senate Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: I am writing to support your suggested \n     ``diagnosis'' language for the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act reauthorization. I have served for 25 years as \n     president of Communities In Schools, the nation's leading \n     community-based organization helping young people stay in \n     school and prepare for life. Our network has grown to serve \n     more than 2,300 schools, providing access to community \n     resources for over 1.3 million students. Based on our \n     experience, I am completely convinced that school/community \n     partnerships are the most effective way to support student \n     success when non-academic factors must be addressed.\n       If schools and students do not perform well, the community \n     stands ready to help. A careful diagnosis of the reasons \n     behind poor performance, followed by a strong partnership-\n     building effort with community stakeholders, will turn around \n     an ailing school. I have seen it happen time and again.\n       Please let me know if I can be of help to you. Your \n     amendment to the ESEA is critically important to our nation's \n     children.\n           Most sincerely,\n                                              William E. Milliken,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              Points of Light,\n\n                                                      May 4, 2001.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham, I would like to take this opportunity \n     to lend our support to your ``Diagnosis'' language for the \n     Reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \n     (ESEA). The Points of Light Foundation was founded in 1990 \n     with the mission to engage more people, more effectively in \n     volunteer service to help serious social problems.\n       The Foundation works in conjunction with over 470 Volunteer \n     Centers cross the nation in building a grassroots service \n     infrastructure in order to address each community's most \n     pressing social dilemmas. As you know, all to often, youth \n     are disproportionately affected by negative societal forces. \n     We have found that the building of diverse, multi-sector \n     community coalitions, in addressing youth issues, is one of \n     the most effective protective factors. Your amendment \n     directly facilitates the creation and implementation of such \n     coalitions.\n       In closing I would like to commend you on your proactive \n     approach to ESEA Reauthorization and wish you the very best \n     success in mitigating those negative forces impacting our \n     nation's youth.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Robert K. Goodwin,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, as we come to the end of the debate on the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, ESEA, reauthorization bill, I \nwould like to share my thoughts on the bill. I plan to support S. 1, \nthe Better Education for Students and Teachers, BEST, Act, but not \nwithout serious reservations.\n  We have been working on this legislation for 3 years now, and we \ncertainly have made some needed improvements over current law. The bill \ncontains tougher accountability, more along the lines of what Senator \nBingaman and I pressed for back in 1994. For the first time, States, \ndistricts, and schools will be held accountable for improving the \nacademic performance of all students. Moreover, the bill requires the \ntimely identification of failing schools so additional resources and \nsupport can be supplied to help those schools turn around, coupled with \nreal consequences if that failure continues. We will have to be \nvigilant, however, to ensure that the accountability system is \nworkable, and not weakened, during Conference.\n  Over the past few weeks of debate, key amendments have passed, adding \nfurther value to the legislation. One such amendment was offered by \nSenators Harkin and Hagel to increase funding for IDEA by annual \nincrements of $2.5 billion until the full 40 percent share of funding \nis reached in fiscal year 2007. This amendment also frees up at least \n$28.9 billion, and up to $52.5 billion, in education funds by shifting \nIDEA funding from discretionary to mandatory funding. This amendment \nserves two worthy and important goals: meeting our commitment to fully \nfund IDEA and by doing so, freeing up some of the needed resources for \ntitle I and other elementary and secondary education programs.\n  I was pleased to support this extremely important amendment, as well \nas two amendments by Senator Wellstone to improve the testing regime in \nthe bill. The first amendment ensures that the assessments meet \nrelevant national testing standards and are of adequate technical \nquality for each purpose for which they are used. The Wellstone \namendment also provides grants to States to enter into partnerships to \nresearch and develop the highest quality assessments possible so they \ncan most accurately and fairly measure student achievement. The second \namendment makes the quality of the test, rather than speed in \ndeveloping the test, the factor for determining bonuses for states.\n  As my colleagues know, I have made improving our Nation's school \nlibraries a top priority in the Senate and during my time in the other \nchamber. Our school libraries have wasted away since dedicated Federal \nfunding was eliminated in 1981, and, as a result, too many students \nlack access to up-to-date, enriching books and other reading material. \nGiven the direct correlation between well-stocked, well-staffed school \nlibraries and literacy and overall student achievement, my amendment, \nwhich passed on an overwhelming 69 to 30 vote, authorizes $500 million \nfor up-to-date books and technology and other needed improvements for \nour Nation's school libraries. Moreover, it rightfully makes school \nlibraries a key component of our effort to increase literacy, as \nembodied by the President's Reading First initiative included in the \nbill.\n  I have also worked to bolster current law's parental involvement \nprovisions based on the simple fact that parental\n\n[[Page S6300]]\n\ninvolvement is a major factor in determining a child's academic \nsuccess. Parental involvement contributes to better grades and test \nscores, higher homework completion rates, better attendance, and \ngreater discipline. The bill already contained provisions I had pressed \nfor, including ensuring title I families can access information on \ntheir children's progress in terms they can understand; involving \nparents in school support teams that help turn around failing schools; \nrequiring technical assistance for title I schools and districts that \nare having problems implementing parental involvement programs; having \nStates collect and disseminate information about effective parental \ninvolvement practices to ensure schools have information on how to \nencourage and expand parental involvement; ensuring parents are \ninvolved in violence and drug prevention programs so parents can \nreinforce the safe and drug-free message at home; requiring States and \ndistricts to annually review parental involvement and professional \ndevelopment activities of districts and schools to ensure the \nactivities are effective; and requiring each local educational agency \nto make available to parents an annual report card which explains how a \nschool is performing.\n  In addition, this week, several amendments I offered to further \nstrengthen parental involvement were adopted. Key provisions were added \nto ensure that teachers will receive training on how to work with and \ninvolve parents in their child's education and to allow the use of \ntechnology to promote parental involvement. Most importantly, a grant \nfund of $100 million will be established to help districts implement \neffective parental involvement policies and practices. All of these \nchanges go a long way to ensuring a coordinated focus on bringing \nschools and parents together in the effort to increase student \nachievement, something that is particularly needed in light of the \nbill's annual testing requirement and other accountability mechanisms.\n  Also, I am pleased that this bill contains important provisions from \nmy Child Opportunity Zone Family Center legislation to foster the \ncoordination and integration of key services to improve student \nlearning.\n  In addition, I am pleased that the Senate handily rejected vouchers, \nwhich would have been the wrong approach to helping our public schools.\n  In the midst of all of these improvements, however, there are some \ntroubling aspects to this legislation--the lack of guaranteed \nresources, the testing regime, and the Performance Agreement block \ngrant.\n  While every Senator recognizes that historically, constitutionally \nand culturally, educational policy is the province of State and local \ngovernments, the Federal Government does play a role. And, we have \nplayed this role quite robustly since 1965. The role may be described \nas encouraging innovation and overcoming inertia at the local level so \nthat every student in America, particularly students from disadvantaged \nbackgrounds, has the opportunity to seize all the opportunities of this \ngreat country.\n  We have an obligation to continue to work with the States and \nlocalities, in a sense as their junior partner, but as an important \npartner, to ensure that every child in this country will have the \nability to achieve and obtain a quality public education.\n  President Bush and our Republican colleagues claim that this bill \nwill leave no child behind, but simply adding testing and flexibility \nto our elementary and secondary schools without providing adequate \nresources will not do the job.\n  I have had many opportunities to talk with the Secretary of Education \nand other leaders in this administration with respect to their \neducation goals. They talk a good game. They talk about accountability; \nthey talk about standards. But then when you ask them: Where are the \nresources? They say: Well, we really don't need resources.\n  That is just not the case. Every American understands that education \nis worthwhile and that we must invest in education, not just with words \nbut with dollars, to make a high quality education a reality in the \nlife of every child.\n  Access to increased resources and funding plays a crucial role in \nimproving student achievement and turning around failing schools. For \nexample, recent changes in the Texas public school financing system \nthat preceded President Bush's terms as Governor of Texas have led to \nsubstantially equalized access to revenue for low and high income \nschool districts. Accordingly, reports indicate that test scores in \nTexas have risen markedly in those poorest districts that received \nadditional money under the new financing plan. This has been the case \nespecially in Houston, the home of Secretary Paige.\n  Now, for the first time, these local school systems are getting the \nneeded funding to repair and modernize their schools, reduce class \nsize, improve professional development, and increase parental \ninvolvement--conduct the kinds of programs that really help children \nsucceed. A school district cannot pay for these programs with \naccountability; real resources are necessary. In addition to the lack \nof a real commitment of resources beyond Senator Harkin's IDEA \namendment, I am also particularly disappointed that both Senator \nHarkin's school construction amendment and Senator Murray's class size \nreduction amendment failed.\n  Another troubling aspect of this bill is structure of the mandate \nthat States test each student from grades 3 to 8 in order to receive \nFederal education funding. We all recognize that testing is an \nessential part of education, but this mandate puts a lot of practical \npressure on the States to harmonize their standards with their \nevaluations. Some States have found out it is not practical to give a \ntest to every child every year because the tests have to be very \nindividualized to capture all the nuances of those standards.\n  My sense is, and I have talked to educational experts in the States, \nthe sheer requirement to test every child every year for grades 3 \nthrough 8 will inexorably lead the States to adopt standardized testing \nwhich may or may not capture the standards in that particular State. So \nthis testing regime could unwittingly move away from one of the central \nelements we all agree on, carefully thought out standards and \nevaluations that measure those standards. And that is why I supported \nSenator Hollings amendment to give States flexibility to waive the \nmandate of annual testing if circumstances warrant. I am disappointed \nthe amendment failed.\n  I hope we all recognize that testing alone is not sufficient to \nimprove our schools. Identifying children who are falling behind and \nschools that are failing is just the first step. But, the hardest step \nis fixing the problem.\n  As we proceed to Conference, we need to ask ourselves: What are we \nreally doing to our kids? I believe we are imposing very strict testing \nregimes upon our children. Yet if we don't provide adequate resources \nto support improvement, such as smaller class sizes and quality \nteachers, we will just be setting them up for failure. We will be \nturning our backs on the children of this country, and I am sure that \nis no one's intention. That is why I will continue to fight for \nadequate resources to make sure that every child truly has the \nopportunity to achieve.\n  Another aspect of this bill that is of great concern to me is the \nPerformance Agreements demonstration program.\n  Otherwise known as Straight A's, this block grant has the potential \nto undermine the continued viability of important Federal standards, \nsuch as targeting funds to schools and children with the greatest \nneeds, improving teacher quality, strengthening parental involvement, \nand providing children with safe and drug free schools.\n  We have a longstanding commitment to the children of this country to \naddress the needs that the states and localities cannot. By placing \nFederal dollars into state and local block grants, without targeting \nthe Federal dollars on programs identified to be of great national \nconcern or ensuring compliance with Federal requirements and basic \ncommonsense guidelines, we may be abandoning the neediest children of \nthis country, denigrating parents' rights, and abrogating our \ncommitment to ensure that every child has the opportunity to obtain a \nquality education.\n  In fact, the States' track record in ensuring that low-income \nstudents get their fair share of education funds is less than \ncommendable. A March 2001\n\n[[Page S6301]]\n\nEducation Trust study of education finance equity found that in 42 of \n49 states there are substantial funding gaps between high and low-\npoverty school districts. The average gap for the Nation was $1,139 per \nyear per student. That translates into a total of $455,600 for a \ntypical elementary school of 400 students.\n  The Performance Agreement pilot is also not a benign, limited \ndemonstration project by any stretch of the imagination. Indeed, if the \nSecretary selects the 7 most populous States and the 25 largest school \ndistricts, the number of students subject to Straight A's would be as \nhigh as 51 percent of the Nation's student population.\n  For example, if the Secretary selects California, Texas, New York, \nFlorida, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Ohio to participate in Straight \nA's, then, based on 1998 figures, approximately 23 million children \nwould be subject to Straight A's. If the Secretary then chooses the 25 \nlargest school districts in states other than those 7 states, then over \n26 million children between the ages of 5 and 17 would be subject to \nStraight A's.\n  Earlier this week I discussed this issue and my amendment, No. 537, \nwhich sought to limit this unproven, Straight A's experiment to States \nand districts that serve a combined student population of 10 percent of \nthe total national student population.\n  I believe we must have ample opportunity to review and analyze data \nregarding this program's effect and its impact on student achievement \nbefore we consider subjecting more than half of our Nation's children \nto this new and unproven initiative, and I will continue to pursue this \nissue of the scope and consequences of this ``demonstration project'' \nas we move forward into Conference.\n  Another problem with this program is its impact on key existing and \nnew parental involvement protections.\n  During negotiations on the Performance Agreements, protections were \nadded to ensure that some of the parental involvement requirements of \ntitle I would have to be followed. Unfortunately, those protections \ndon't go far enough. Left unchanged, the bill would void large parts of \nthe title I parent involvement requirements and other key parental \ninvolvement provisions that I, along with the National PTA, Chairman \nKennedy, and others worked to include in this bill.\n  The last thing we should do is adopt an education bill that reduces \nparent involvement and family rights. We should not put families in a \nposition where they find themselves with fewer rights by virtue of the \nfact that the State or district in which they live has chosen to \nparticipate in this program.\n  Every other initiative to provide flexibility to States and \ndistricts, including Ed-Flex, has put parent involvement provisions off \nlimits, and this bill should too, and I will continue efforts to \naddress this issue to ensure that we protect, rather than weaken, \nparental involvement as S. 1 moves to Conference. Our Nation's parents \ndeserve nothing less.\n  Today, we live in a challenging, international economic order, and \nstudents from Rhode Island are not just competing with students from \nMississippi and California; they are all competing against the very \nbest and brightest around the globe. That requires investment. It \nrequires raising our standards and giving every child a chance to reach \nthose standards to ensure that we have the best-educated workforce that \nis competitive in a global economy.\n  If the education of our young people is truly the No. 1 domestic \npriority in the United States, as the President claims, then we must \nput our money where our mouth is. Unfortunately, we have not seen the \nadministration come forward and pledge the kind of resources necessary \nto achieve any real reform. Instead, we are in danger of having a risky \ntesting scheme and no accountability without the resources to make it \nall work.\n  While I support this bill and the significant reforms we have passed, \nI will continue to work vigorously to ensure that we provide every \nchild with the opportunity to achieve a world-class education.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I would like to express my \nsupport for the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Although my \nsupport is not without reservation, I believe that the bill before us \ntoday contains much that will ultimately benefit America's schools and \nthe children who attend them. The legislation's intent--increasing \nstudent achievement, narrowing the achievement gap among minority and \ndisadvantaged students, strengthening accountability, and increasing \nlocal flexibility--are important goals. Commitments in this bill to \nimprove school safety, to improve bilingual education, and to fully \nfund title I and IDEA were critical factors in my decision to cast an \naffirmative vote. Were it not for the inclusion of such key components, \nI would be less inclined to support this bill today.\n  The issue of education itself is non-controversial; the way in which \nwe educate our children, however, is. Because we are trying to define \nthe way in which we can improve education and the way that can best be \naccomplished, this bill deserves serious debate.\n  Personally, I have always believed that the Federal Government has a \nrole as a junior partner in crafting education policy. The U.S. \ngovernment in that role, though, should not usurp the State and local \ngovernments' power to make education decisions that are more \nappropriately handled at the State and local level. The line between \nthe Federal Government's role in education and the State's role is a \ndelicate one, and it should be respected.\n  One area where I believe this bill treads dangerously close to \ncrossing that line is with respect to the issue of unfunded mandates. \nSpecifically, as a former governor, I am concerned by the inclusion of \nlanguage in this bill that requires States to conduct assessments and \nmeet Federal standards of progress under threat of financial penalty, \nyet refuses to provide the resources local communities need to meet the \noften expensive requirements. This bill mandates 316 new tests \nnationwide, but it does not provide the funding to the States to \nimplement them. Such mandates are irresponsible and burdensome for \nState and local governments, and will force them to short change other \npriorities or raise local taxes. In my State of Nebraska, rigorous \nstandards and assessments are in place; the additional tests mandated \nby this legislation are not critical to improving our schools.\n  This issue aside, I am encouraged by the programs and the commitment \nto education quality improvement included in this legislation. The \nadoption and inclusion of the Mentoring for Success Act in ESEA is a \nvictory for children throughout the country who need the benefit of a \nstable and caring role model. Programs like this one, which seek to \nnarrow the gap between the have's and the have-nots, are vital. If no \nchild is truly going to be left behind by our education system, it is \nimperative that we fund initiatives like this mentoring program, as \nwell as other programs like the President's literary initiative, \nReading First. This bill contains these initiatives, and they are one \nof the reasons why I will support it.\n  Overall, this legislation makes great strides toward improving our \neducational system. It will help ensure that all children, especially \nthe neediest, will have access to the quality education they deserve. \nMeasures like loan forgiveness for Head Start teachers and efforts to \nimprove teacher quality, will assist in making certain that all \nchildren have access not to just any education, but access to a quality \neducation. As I previously indicated, this bill is headed in the right \ndirection, but it is not without flaws. I am hopeful that in the \nconference report critical funding issues will be addressed. While the \ninitiatives the Senate has approved are well intentioned, they will not \nbe worth the paper they are printed on if we cannot fully fund them. If \neducation is truly a priority for this Administration and for this \nCongress, the reality of funding levels in this bill must be carefully \nconsidered. It is with confidence that I will support this bill, \nhowever, in anticipation that the conferees will work together \ndiligently to author a conference report that is sensible, balanced, \nand fiscally responsible. Our children deserve nothing less; it is \nCongress' duty to make good on our promises to leave no child behind.\n\n\n           IMPROVING MATH, SCIENCE, AND ENGINEERING EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in our efforts to ensure that the United\n\n[[Page S6302]]\n\nStates remains an economic and military superpower in the 21st century, \nwe must strive to improve the quality of math and science education in \nthis country.\n  Unfortunately, our schools today need more support in preparing \nstudents--in sufficient numbers--to meet the needs of our country. The \nstatistics are alarming, as reported by the National Commission on \nMathematics and Science Teaching for the 21st Century, The Glenn \nCommission, and by the National Assessment of Education Progress, NAEP.\n  Less than one-third of all U.S. students in grades 4, 8, and 12 \nperform at or above the ``proficient'' achievement level in mathematics \nand science on national tests.\n  More than one-third of such students score below the basic level in \nthese subjects.\n  And, among 20 nations assessed in advanced mathematics and physics, \nnone scored significantly lower than U.S. students in advanced math, \nand only one scored lower in physics. Our students can and must do \nbetter.\n  In an effort to improve math and science education, I have joined \nwith Senators Roberts, Frist, Collins, and others in supporting much \nneeded legislation to help improve math and science education in \nelementary and secondary schools. This legislation is now part of S. 1, \nthe Better Education for Students and Teachers Act, the BEST Act.\n  Not only will the math and science provisions in the BEST Act help \nimprove math and science curriculum in our elementary and secondary \nschools, they will help our schools recruit even better math and \nscience educators, and make available additional professional \ndevelopment to these educators.\n  While I wholeheartedly support these provisions, I believe we must go \none step further. Not only should we improve math and science education \nat the K-12 level, we must do something to encourage more individuals \nto enter vocational schools and colleges and universities in pursuit of \nprograms of study in math, science, and engineering.\n  It is estimated that the technology driven economy of the 21st \ncentury will add approximately 2 million science and engineering jobs \nto the American economy between today and 2008.\n  For example, in one sector of America today, in Northern Virginia, \nthere are over 20,000 high-tech jobs going unfilled month to month.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee has issued a report that clearly \ndemonstrates America's crisis in meeting the demand in our economy for \npersons trained in the high-tech field. The report quotes Cato \nInstitute economist Daniel Griswold stating that, ``Americans are not \nearning specialized degrees fast enough to fill the 1.3 million high-\ntech jobs the Labor Department estimates will be created during the \nnext decade.''\n  In addition, the Judiciary Committee report refers to a Hudson \nInstitute estimate that states that the unaddressed shortage of skilled \nworkers throughout the U.S. economy could result in a 5 percent drop in \nthe growth of the GDP. That translates into approximately $200 billion \nin lost output, nearly $1,000 for every American.\n  In both the 105th Congress and the 106th Congress, we addressed the \nhigh-tech labor shortage by passing legislation to increase the ceiling \non the number of H-1B visas--a visa for highly trained foreign workers \ncoming to the United States to work in a high-tech position.\n  America was forced to do this because our educational institutions \nare simply not producing the number of personnel needed in the high-\ntech sector.\n  In an effort to provide incentives for Americans to pursue a high-\ntech education, the H-1B visa legislation contained very important \nprovisions that impose a $500 fee per H-1B visa petition that will be \nused to fund scholarships for Americans who choose to pursue education \nin these important fields. It is estimated that this fee will raise \nroughly $450 million over 3 years to create 40,000 scholarships for \nU.S. workers and U.S. students.\n  Once again, I whole heartedly support the H-1B scholarship fund. \nNevertheless, I believe that we in Congress must do more.\n  For the past several weeks, we have been discussing education reform \nin the Senate. However, during this debate we have failed to address \nthe question of whether our educational system is meeting our Nation's \nvital economic and national security needs.\n  Our national security is becoming more and more dependent on minds \ntrained in math, science, computer science, and engineering to survive. \nTo ensure our country's prominent role in the future, we must look \nwithin our borders to meet these needs.\n  Unfortunately, today, a look inside our borders shows that this \ncountry is facing a dire shortage of math, science, and engineering \nstudents. According to the National Science Foundation, NSF, the \nengineering, mathematics, and science fields show declining numbers of \ndegrees in the late 1980s and the 1990s:\n  From 1985 to 1998 there has been a 20 percent decrease in the number \nof people receiving bachelor's degrees in engineering, from 77,572 to \n60,914.\n  In the last 10 years, the number of students graduating with \nbachelor's in physics has dropped by nearly 20 percent, from 4,347 in \n1989 to 3,455 in 1998.\n  From 1986 to 1998 the number of students receiving bachelor's degrees \nin mathematics has decreased greater than 25 percent, 16,531 to 12,094.\n  From 1986 to 1998 the number of students receiving Bachelors in \nComputer Science dropped more than 30 percent, from 42,195 to 27,674.\n  While the U.S. produces fewer and fewer mathematicians, scientists, \nand engineers, the rest of the world is making up the difference. \nAmerica is importing them.\n  In several large countries--Japan, Russia, China, and Brazil--more \nthan 60 percent of students earn their first university degrees in the \nscience and engineering fields. In contrast, in the U.S., students earn \nabout one-third of their bachelor-level degrees in science and \nengineering fields, and this includes social sciences.\n  Engineering represents 46 percent of the earned bachelor's degrees in \nChina, about 30 percent in Sweden and Russia, and about 20 percent in \nJapan and South Korea. In contrast, engineering students in the United \nStates earn about 5 percent of all bachelor-level degrees earned in \nthis country.\n  The demand for science and engineering degrees will only increase. \nAccording to the National Science Foundation, during the 1998-2008 \nperiod, employment in science and engineering occupations is expected \nto increase at almost four times the rate for all occupations. Though \nthe economy as a whole is anticipated to provide approximately 14 \npercent more jobs over this decade, employment opportunities for \nscience and engineering jobs are expected to increase by about 51 \npercent, or about 2 million jobs.\n  America must now take steps to encourage, at all levels of our \neducational process, young people to undertake the training necessary \nto meet our Nation's demands.\n  We in the Congress must help in every way to redirect these students \nfrom other pursuits into curricula which will train them. This is an \nabsolute necessity if America is to remain secure economically in this \none world market and militarily with our national security commitments.\n  Accordingly, I offered an amendment to this education bill to \nencourage individuals to pursue programs of study in math, science, and \nengineering. This amendment is cosponsored by Senators Gordon Smith, \nAllard, and Allen.\n  The Pell Grant program is one of the most successful and respected \neducational initiatives taken by the Congress. The concept behind the \nPell Grant properly recognizes the needs of young people coming from \neconomic backgrounds which make it difficult for them to acquire higher \neducation.\n  I have in the past, and always will be in the future, a strong \nsupporter of the Pell Grant program.\n  Nevertheless, we in the Congress have an obligation when expending \ntaxpayer money, to do so in a manner that meets our Nation's needs. Our \nNation desperately needs more trained students in math, science, and \nengineering. That is an indisputable objective.\n  The Pell Grant program, in my judgment, offers Congress the \nopportunity to provide incentives for student recipients to pursue \ncurricula in math, science, and engineering.\n  My amendment provides a 50 percent greater award to Pell Grant \nrecipients\n\n[[Page S6303]]\n\nwho pursue a program of study in math, science, and engineering.\n  The amendment is as simple as that.\n  My Pell Grant amendment is one idea, but I am certain it is not the \nonly idea. As a member of the Senate's Education Committee, I hope that \nmy chairman, Chairman Kennedy, will schedule hearings to look into our \nsystem of higher education and whether this country is on track to \nproduce graduates who meet the current and projected needs of this \ncountry.\n  At this time, I withdraw my amendment in order to give the Education \nCommittee a sufficient opportunity to address this issue.\n  At some time in this Congress, I fully intend to reintroduce an \namendment along these lines after the committee has reviewed the \nissues, after I get the views of the administration, and after the wide \nrange of people who on a daily basis review the Pell Grant program have \nan opportunity to share their views as well.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 443\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to clarify why I voted \nagainst the Voinvich amendment No. 443 to the ESEA reauthorization bill \ndealing with loan forgiveness for Head Start teachers. It amends the \nHigher Education Act of 1965 to extend loan forgiveness for certain \nloans to Head Start teachers. I thoroughly agree with the ideas \nexpressed in this amendment and have supported incentives for teachers \nin the past. However, I could not support the amendment because it was \nnot germane to the ESEA reauthorization. I would have supported such an \namendment in the context of the Higher Education Act. The amendment \nprovided a tax credit for those individuals who agree to be employed as \na Head Start teacher for 5 consecutive years and have demonstrated \nknowledge and teaching skills in reading, writing, and early childhood \ndevelopment. I strongly believe that it is essential that we have \nqualified individuals employed in our Head Start programs and working \nwith our youngest children. However, I voted against the amendment, \nbecause it was not germane to the ESEA legislation. I did so because \ntogether with other leaders on the bipartisan negotiated education \ncompromise bill, I have agreed to vote against non germane amendments \nso that we will have a better chance to complete and pass this all-\nimportant ESEA reauthorization. The amendment passed 76-24 and I am \nhappy with the results.\n\n\n            EDUCATION PROGRAMS OF NATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE ACT\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, my amendment, the Education Programs of \nNational Significance Act, would reauthorize several elementary and \nsecondary education programs that have been effective in improving the \neducation opportunities of students throughout the country.\n  One example is the National Writing Project which as first authorized \n10 years ago and for the current fiscal year is funded at $10 million.\n  The National Writing Project has 169 sites in 49 States, the District \nof Columbia, and Puerto Rico. It provides training for 1 out of every \n34 teachers across the country. In addition, the National Writing \nProject raises $6 in local funding for every $1 in Federal funding it \nreceives, and has become a model program for improving teaching in \nother academic fields such as math, science, and reading.\n  Last fall, the Academy for Educational Development completed a study \nwhich shows the improvement of student writing achievement as a result \nof their teachers' involvement in the National Writing Project. The \nstudy evaluated the writing skills of 583 third- and fourth-grade \nstudents. The executive summary of the study states:\n\n       Overall, these findings show that students in classrooms \n     taught by NWP teachers made significant progress over the \n     course of the school year.\n\n  Last month, I held a Senate hearing in Bay St. Louis, MS which \nexamined the effectiveness of the National Writing Project in my State. \nI heard from teachers and school administrators who gave compelling \ntestimony about the positive results in their classrooms and the \nimprovement of their teaching skills attributed to participation in \nNational Writing Project training.\n  The amendment authorizes the continuation, subject to annual \nappropriations, of the National Writing Project.\n  The amendment also reauthorizes research based educational material \ndelivered by public broadcasting television stations under the Ready To \nLearn Television Act of 1992. The objective was to utilize the time \nchildren spend watching television to prepare them for the first year \nof school. Today we know this program has resulted in improved learning \nskills for the children.\n  Recent research from the University of Alabama and the University of \nKansas tells us that Ready to Learn is having a positive impact on \nchildren and their parents. The University of Alabama study found that \nReady to Learn families read books together more often and for longer \nperiods than nonparticipants. And, this is a fact that surprises many, \nReady to Learn children watch 40 percent less television and are more \nlikely to choose educational programs when they do watch.\n  Using the best research tested information available, Ready To Learn \nsupports the development of educational, commercial-free television \nshows for young children. Between the Lions, is the first television \nseries to offer educationally valid reading instruction which has been \nendorsed by the professional organizations that represent librarians, \nteachers and school principals. Its partners also include: The Center \nfor the Book at the Library of Congress; the National Center for Family \nLiteracy; the National Coalition for Literacy and the Home Instruction \nProgram for Preschool Youngsters. This broad-based support is \nunprecedented for a children's television show. It is well deserved \naffirmation of the Ready to Learn mission.\n  A recent study from the University of Kansas showed that children who \nwatched Between the Lions a few hours per week, increased their \nknowledge of letter-sound correspondence by 64 percent compared to a 25 \npercent increase by those who did not watch it. The parents and other \ncare givers of more than six million children have participated in the \nlocal workshops and other services provided by 133 public broadcasting \nstations.\n  I am encouraged by the success of Ready to Learn and look forward to \na new generation of children whose families will have access to the \ninformation needed to develop a learning environment before they are \nenrolled in school.\n  These are two of the Educational Programs of National Significance \nthat I have been personally involved in starting. The others that are \nincluded in this amendment are also proven examples of federally funded \neducation programs that will help us have a better educated student \npopulation throughout the Nation.\n  I urge Senators to support the amendment.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, throughout this debate, we have wrestled \nwith how we best improve education for all of our children; whether it \nis more money, more flexibility, more accountability, higher standards, \nless bureaucracy, more choice. All of these considerations and goals \nare worthy and certainly play an important role in ensuring that our \nchildren receive the best education possible.\n  But, there is one ingredient--one factor--that without fail, is the \nmost essential to a child's education and that is a parent. I submit \nthat there is no school building, no computer, no TV, no textbook that \ncan replace the role of a parent when it comes to educating a child. \nAnd accordingly, no government official or school official shares the \nsame interest as a parent in protecting and raising their child. I say \nthis because the amendment Senator Dodd and I are offering today is \nabout ensuring the rights and responsibilities of parents in raising \nand educating their children.\n  As parents, we entrust schools with our children in the hope and \nbelief that they will receive a strong education that will prepare them \nfor the future--that they will be taught and learn the basic \nfoundations for success--reading and writing, math and science. Parents \nexpect this.\n  What they don't expect and what many of them aren't even aware of is \nthat their children will be used as captive focus groups for marketers \nduring the school day. That is not part of the bargain and, I submit, \nit shouldn't be.\n\n[[Page S6304]]\n\n  Last year a GAO study found that marketers and advertisers are \nincreasingly targeting our children in the school setting. This is not \nsome freak occurrence. It is a calculated marketing strategy that is \nintended to get around parents and reach kids directly in a way they \ncould not normally. In a recent column raising concerns about this \nphenomenon, George Will notes how marketers now study ``marketing \npractices that drive loyalty in the preschool market'' and ``the \ndesires of toddler-age consumers.'' In addition, marketers advise that \n``School is. . .the ideal time to influence attitudes.''\n  There is no question that there is a lot of money to be made in \nmarketing to children. According to a report by the Motherhood Project \nat the Institute for American Values, in 1998 alone, children ages 4 to \n12 spent nearly $27 billion of their own money and influenced nearly \n$500 billion in purchases by their parents. As parents, many of us have \nprobably felt like it was a lot more than $500 billion at times.\n  I am all for free enterprise. But, there are boundaries. And, \nmarketers are crossing those boundaries when they seek to go into \npublic schools and collect marketing information on children without \nparental consent. A recent editorial in the Christian Science Monitor \nechoes this sentiment.\n\n       Schools are for learning, not market research . . . \n     Businesses do have a role in education. They can lend \n     financial and other kinds of support, and be recognized for \n     such. But educators and businesses also need to recognize \n     boundaries--and stay within them.\n\n  Congress has acted in the past to provide some boundaries to schools \nand protect parental rights and children's privacy. The Family \nEducation Rights Protection Act, the Protection of Pupil's Rights Act \nand the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act all provide parents \nwith some ability to protect how information is collected and shared on \ntheir children. None of these laws, however, protect parents' rights \nwhen third party marketers seek to collect similar information from \ntheir children in the classroom.\n  Our amendment seeks to address this gap in the law and reenforce \nthese boundaries by ensuring that when third parties want to come in to \nthe classroom and conduct market research and collect information on \nour children for strictly commercial purposes, they have to ask the \nparent.\n  We are not breaking new ground here other than filling in gaps in \nexisting law. In addition, parental consent is already required for \nmany other activities that occur in the schools, including \nextracurricular activities, field trips, and internet access. Indeed, \nparental consent is required before students may participate in the \nEverybody Wins Program that many Members and staff of this body \nparticipate in.\n  I know there have been concerns and questions raised about our \namendment and active lobbying against our efforts.\n  However, in working with the White House, I believe we have addressed \nmost of the these concerns as reflected in our modified amendment. We \nhave sought to minimize concerns over ``burden'' by requiring parental \nconsent for only those commercial/marketing activities that seek to \ncollect information on children.\n  In addition, we have attempted to provide local flexibility --while \nensuring parental involvement--by allowing local school boards to \nprovide additional exceptions to the consent requirements so long as \nthe information they seek to collect is not personally identifiable and \nthe school notifies the parents of their policy on these data \ncollection activities.\n  Despite our good-faith efforts to address legitimate concerns, I \nunderstand that some financial interests may oppose parental consent no \nmatter what. They are willing to argue that requiring parental consent \nimposes a burden on local schools.\n  I fundamentally disagree and submit that if we have come to the point \nwhere we consider parents a burden and parental consent a mandate--then \nwe have a bigger problem in this country. Parents a burden? I say we \nneed more such local burdens in our schools, not less. You simply can't \nget more ``local'' than a parent.\n  And as a corollary to this, I would suggest that these interests have \nit backwards. It is rather the local schools that are interfering in \nthe rights of parents. Schools exceed their authority when they allow \nthird parties to come in to the classroom and collect information on \nchildren for strictly commercial purposes.\n  We have tried to focus this amendment on those non-educational \nactivities that parents traditionally maintain authority over. Parents \nhave a tough enough time trying to raise and instill certain values in \ntheir children. Schools should not be a parent-free zone where \nmarketers get unfettered access to children that they would not \notherwise be able to achieve anywhere else.\n  There is nothing intended in this amendment to disadvantage public-\nprivate partnerships in our schools. And, in fact, most public-private \npartnerships have nothing to do with collecting personal information on \nchildren. Indeed, I continue to believe that many of these \nrelationships can be very positive for schools and students. We want to \nencourage, not discourage many of these relationships.\n  But, I submit that these public-private partnerships should be able \nto withstand the scrutiny of parents when they seek to collect \ninformation on their children. If it is in their child's interest--you \ncan be sure a parent will give their permission. I don't know of any \nreputable company whose business model would be based on intentionally \nskirting parental rights and targeting children directly in the \nschools. And, I doubt, that any business that relied on such a tactic \nwould be around very long.\n  I do, however, believe that the amount of interest and extensive \nlobbying that has been shown on our little amendment is a strong \nindication of how much money is being made on targeting kids in the \nschools and how important it is to some marketers to get around parents \nand get access to our children directly.\n  Our modified amendment was crafted in consultation with the \nAdministration, and is supported by the National Parent Teacher \nAssociation, Commercial Alert, the Eagle Forum, the American \nConservative Union, Focus on the Family, and the Motherhood Project at \nthe Institute for American Values, among other groups.\n  I am pleased with the acceptance of this amendment by the Senate and \nthank the managers for their work on this bill and on our amendment.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues as the bill is \nconsidered in conference.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent the Senate now proceed to the \nconsideration of House companion H.R. 1; that all after the enacting \nclause be stricken, and the text of S. 1, as amended, be substituted in \nlieu thereof, and the Senate proceed to vote on final passage of the \nbill; that the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference \nwith the House--\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object, I believe there has been a \nmodification.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I could restate it: I ask consent that the Senate \nproceed to consideration of the House companion, H.R. 1; that all after \nthe enacting clause be stricken, and the Text of S. 1, as amended, be \nsubstituted in lieu thereof, the bill be read a third time, and that \nthe Senate proceed to vote on final passage of the bill.\n  I further ask consent S. 1 be returned to the calendar.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The foregoing request is agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. We are about to go to final passage. I wanted to thank \nstaff on both sides. This bill has been on the floor for 7 weeks. Their \ntireless efforts, literally hours, days, nights, and weekends, on \nbehalf of moving this bill along have been extraordinary.\n  On my staff, of course, Denzel McGuire led the effort and did an \nexceptional job. Jamie Burnett, Rebecca Liston and other folks, so many \nit is hard to mention, as well as John Mashburn, Andrea Becker, Holly \nKuzmich, and Raissa Geary on our side have all worked extraordinary \nhours to make this work.\n\n[[Page S6305]]\n\n  We also thank the professional staff of Senator Kennedy, led by \nDanica and other members of their staff.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I express my thanks now, and I will do so at the \nconclusion and hope they understand we appreciate this.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will suspend, on behalf of Senator Warner, \nI ask unanimous consent to withdraw his previously submitted amendment \nNo. 792.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this will be the last vote of the week. \nThere will be no session tomorrow. We begin again on Monday. There will \nbe no votes on Monday. For the information of all Senators, the first \nvote will occur sometime on Tuesday, but we will be in session on \nMonday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n   The yeas and nays were ordered. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, before we turn to morning business, there \nis one thing I would like to say. I have been on the floor during the \nentire 8 weeks of this debate on the education bill. A great deal of \nthat time--about 6 of the weeks--I spent with Senator Jeffords as a \nmanager of this bill. I just want to make sure everyone understands his \ncontribution to this piece of legislation.\n  He was chairman of this committee. His substitute is what we \naccepted. In the kind of glow of having finished this legislation--we \nare all happy to finish a major piece of legislation; the President \nshould be happy--I just want to make sure everyone understands the \ngreat contribution to this piece of legislation made by the junior \nSenator from the State of Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I join my friend and colleague, Senator \nReid, in paying tribute to Jim Jeffords at the time of the completion \nof this legislation. As the Senator rightfully pointed out, Senator \nJeffords was really the architect of the development of the core \naspects of this legislation and presided over a very extensive markup. \nHe was able to bring the committee to a unanimous vote of support for \nthat legislation even though there were a good many differences that \nwere expressed. It does not surprise any of us who are on that \ncommittee because he has been a leader in the area of education over \nhis entire career in the Senate as well as in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  There are many features in this legislation that have been included \nof which he was really the architect many years ago. So I think all of \nus who are mindful of the progress that has been made join in paying \ntribute to Senator Jeffords for his remarkable leadership. I think this \nbody will continue to benefit from his continued involvement. We \ncertainly depend upon it, and I know America's children depend upon it \nas well.\n  I thank Senator Jeffords for all of his good work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/14/senate-section/article/S6305-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I am pleased to address the Senate to \napplaud the leadership being shown by President Bush during his visit \nwith leaders in Europe. I like the straightforward and forceful way he \nis expressing his views on international security issues, especially on \nthe subject of missile defenses.\n  In March, the President dispatched senior administration officials \naround the world to discuss with leaders of other nations the plans he \nwas considering to deploy defenses against ballistic missiles. The \nSecretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and high-level \nadministration teams have worked hard to ensure that our friends and \nallies understand why the United States intends to deploy these new \ndefensive systems.\n  This week European leaders are hearing directly from the President \nhis personal views on this issue. At his first stop in Madrid, \nPresident Bush said that the task of explaining missile defense \n``starts with explaining to Russia and our European friends and allies \nthat Russia is not the enemy of the United States, that the attitude of \nmutually assured destruction is a relic of the Cold War, and that we \nmust address the new threats of the 21st century if we're to have a \npeaceful continent and a peaceful world.''\n  The Prime Minister of Spain, Mr. Aznar, responded to President Bush's \nremarks by saying:\n\n       [I]t is very important for President Bush to have decided \n     to share that initiative with\n\n[[Page S6306]]\n\n     its allies, to discuss it with them, to establish a framework \n     of cooperation with his allies with regard to this initiative \n     and, as he announced, to also establish a framework for \n     discussions, cooperation, and a new relationship with Russia.\n\n  The Prime Minister also said:\n\n       What I am surprised by is the fact that there are people \n     who, from the start, disqualified his initiative and, in that \n     way, they are also disqualifying the deterrence that has \n     existed so far and probably they would also disqualify any \n     other kind of initiative. But what we're dealing with here is \n     an attempt to provide greater security for everyone. And from \n     that point of view, that initiative to share and discuss and \n     dialog and reach common ground with the President of the \n     United States is something that I greatly appreciate.\n\n  Today the news reports indicate that many other European leaders \nagree with the sentiments expressed by the Prime Minister of Spain. The \nmost conspicuous exceptions have been France and Germany.\n  I commend President Bush for his effort to modernize our defenses \nagainst terrorism and ballistic missiles. Internationally, we remain \nvulnerable to these threats. We can no longer intentionally choose to \naccept that on behalf of our citizens. Nor can peace-loving people \nanywhere in the world tolerate the continued intentional vulnerability \nthat this policy ensures.\n  President Bush realizes this and is doing what is necessary to remedy \nthe situation. He is making it clear that he will unilaterally reduce \nour stockpile of nuclear weapons to the lowest level, compatible with \nthe need to keep the peace. And he is consulting with our allies and \nothers in an effort to explore new agreements that will further protect \nour common security interests.\n  He acknowledges that everyone, not even our closest allies, will \nagree with us on everything, but President Bush holds out hope for new \nunderstandings. He said at one news conference:\n\n       I don't think we are going to have to move unilaterally, \n     but people know I am intent on moving forward.\n\n  The President is doing the right thing and setting the right tone in \nproviding this kind of leadership at this particular time. It is a very \nimportant step in achieving a higher level of security for all the \nworld, not just for the United States.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of quotations from those \nsupporting U.S. missile defense plans be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Quotes Supportive of U.S. Missile Defense Plans\n\n       Australia--Foreign Minister Downer (June 1, 2001): ``We've \n     said to the Americans that we are understanding of their \n     concerns about the proliferation of missile systems . . . if \n     a rogue state were to fire a missile at the United States, \n     would an appropriate response be for the United States to \n     destroy all of the people in that country? And I think, \n     understandably, the Americans are saying that may be a slight \n     over-reaction. And if that is all that their current \n     deterrence arrangements provide for, then I think it's \n     understandable that they should want to look for more \n     sophisticated and more effective, and at the end of the day, \n     more humane ways of dealing with these problems.''\n       Czech Republic--President Havel (June 13, 2001): ``. . . \n     the new world we are entering cannot be based on mutually \n     assured destruction. An increasingly important role should be \n     played by defense systems. We are a defensive alliance.''\n       Hungary--Prime Minister Orban (May 29, 2001): ``The logic \n     of the Cold War, mutual deterrence, would not give a reply to \n     the problems of the future. It is important that North \n     America and Europe should work jointly on solutions demanded \n     by the new realities.''\n       Italy--Prime Minister Berlusconi (June 13, 2001): ``We \n     agree that it is necessary for a new, innovative approach in \n     our policies towards these new threats.''\n       Defense Minister Martino (June 11, 2001): ``[Missile \n     defense] would not be directed against the Russian Federation \n     today; the aim is to protect us from unpredictable moves by \n     other countries. It is in the interests of peace, of all of \n     us.''\n       Japan--Prime Minister Koizumi (June 7, 2001): ``This is \n     very significant research because it might render totally \n     meaningless the possession of nuclear weapons and ballistic \n     missiles.''\n       Poland--President Kwasniewski (June 13, 2001): ``[The U.S. \n     missile defense plan is a] ``visionary, courageous, and \n     logical idea.''\n       Defense Minister Komorwski (May 27, 2001): ``Poland has \n     looked upon U.S. declarations on the necessity of \n     establishing a missile defense system with understanding from \n     the very start. We . . . see the modification of the project \n     to provide for a `protective shield' for European allies as a \n     step in the right direction. This can only enhance defense \n     capabilities but also strengthen the unity of NATO. The \n     territory of Poland and the Polish defense system may become \n     a key element of an allied missile defense structure.''\n       Secretary of the National Security Council Siwiec (May 18, \n     2001): ``The ABM Treaty . . . stands in the way of building a \n     new security system. The debate on the missile shield is not \n     unlike protests of steam engine users against the inventors \n     of rocket engines . . .''\n       Romania--Defense Minister Pascu (June 12, 2001): Romania \n     understands the U.S. desire for protection from missile \n     attack and would have ``no objection at all' even if the U.S. \n     proceeded unilaterally. Regarding those in Europe that \n     dismiss the threat of missile attack, Pascu said ``It is a \n     real danger. To some, it is not because they don't want it \n     [missile defense] done.''\n       Slovakia--Prime Minister Mikulas (June 8, 2001): ``We have \n     always perceived the United States as the protector of \n     democratic principles in the world and we understand the \n     alliance (NATO) as a defense community. So we consider the \n     missile defense project to be a new means of collective \n     defense . . ., a security umbrella for this democratic \n     society and therefore in general we support this project.''\n       Spain--Defense Minister Trillo (May 23, 2001): ``The [U.S.] \n     missile initiative . . . is neither an aggressive \n     initiative--it is a defensive one--nor a nuclear escalation, \n     but rather, on the contrary, a means of deterrence of the \n     buildup of nuclear weaponry.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/14/senate-section/article/S6306-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6306-S6307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       VOTE ON ESEA AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, the vote we just had recorded only \neight votes in the ``nay'' column, and one of those eight was mine. I \ndon't usually find myself that isolated. I thought on this occasion \nthat it would be appropriate for me to explain why I voted against this \nbill.\n  I am not sure what I would have done had my vote been decisive, \nbecause I recognize that we need to pass an elementary and secondary \neducation bill. We need to move forward on an issue that President Bush \nhas correctly identified as our No. 1 domestic priority. Nonetheless, I \nwas troubled enough by the bill that I voted against it and wanted to \nmake my reasons clear in the hope they might influence the conferees.\n  I have three reasons for voting against this bill. The first one is \nmoney. The cost of this bill is twice what it was when the bill hit the \nfloor to begin with. We added money here; we added money there. We had \na drunken sailor's attitude toward this situation: Education is \nwonderful; let's throw money at it.\n  I am troubled by that kind of view with respect to how we should \nlegislate around here. It struck me as being a bit out of control.\n  Secondly, as I heard more and more from the people in Utah who will \nhave to live under this bill, they kept saying to me, This feels an \nawful lot like a Federal straitjacket. This feels an awful lot like \nFederal control. This feels an awful lot like we are losing the power \nto run our own schools. I find that troubling as well. As some of my \ncolleagues have said, I didn't run for the federal school board; I ran \nfor the U.S. Senate.\n  Many of the decisions that were made with respect to this bill were \ndecisions that were made on the assumption that Washington knows better \nthan the local school boards, and that assumption troubles me.\n  It is because of the third reason, as I looked at the bill as a \nwhole, that I decided to vote against it. I am passionate enough in my \ncommitment to education that I could swallow the idea of more money. \nFrankly, if we were getting the right results, I could look the other \nway and say, Well, since we are getting the right results, I can \ntolerate increased Federal control.\n  But this bill is not a step forward in education. This bill is \noverwhelmingly timid. It has almost no significant new initiatives in \nit. It is simply funding the status quo to the maximum. The more I look \nat education, the more I think we need to break out of the status quo. \nWe need to try new things. But any time a suggestion was made that we \ntry something new, even on a pilot basis in a very limited sense in \njust a few places, it was swatted down.\n  People talk about Government as if inertia at rest is the problem, \nthat nothing ever gets done. It is my experience that it is inertia of \nmotion that is the problem with Government. It is not just the law of \nphysics. A body in motion tends to stay in motion and in the\n\n[[Page S6307]]\n\nsame direction, whether it is a body moving through space in the \nphysical world or whether it is a Government agency moving through \nregulations that always does things the same way. It keeps things \ngoing. It takes yesterday's answers and tries to force them on today's \nproblems.\n  As I look at this bill overall, I do not see the boldness, the \nfreshness, the challenge to do something different and try to break out \nof the old patterns that, frankly, were there when President Bush first \nsubmitted his education plan. We, in this body, have added so much \nbaggage to that exciting first motion that it is hard to recognize the \nPresident's initiatives in this bill. They are buried under piles of \nmoney and piles of directions that are rooted in the status quo and in \nthe past.\n  So I decided that the bill is going to pass, regardless of what I try \nto do. But if I can draw a little bit of attention to the fact that the \nbill is not, in fact, as bold, as innovative, and as hopeful as it \nstarted out to be by casting a negative vote, then that would justify \ncasting a negative vote.\n  I don't expect very many people will listen to what I have to say, \nand I don't expect very many people will pay attention to the vote I \nhave cast. But I remember when I first came here as a young Senator, \nsomeone said to me, Cast your vote with this in mind--how will you feel \nas you drive home thinking about it after the debate is over?\n  I decided that as I drove home thinking about this one that I would \ndrive home feeling better having cast the protest vote than I would if \nI had gone along with the large majority of my colleagues.\n  I don't mean to suggest that anyone who voted for this bill was not \nvoting out of complete, sincere dedication to the idea that this is \nsomething good. I don't mean to question the motives of anybody else. I \nsimply want to explain my own. This bill has grown too expensive. This \nbill has grown into too much Federal control. And the end result, in \nterms of timidity and support for the status quo, is simply not worth \nthose first two. That is why I opposed the bill.\n  I hope the product that comes back to us from conference will be \nbetter and that I will then be in a position to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to wish the United States \nArmy happy birthday. It was 226 years ago today, in 1775, that the \nContinental Army of the United States was formed. The United States \nArmy has had a monumental impact on our country.\n  Millions of men and women over the past 226 years have served in the \nsenior branch of our military forces. The Army is interwoven into the \nculture of America. Those who have had the great privilege of serving \nour country in the U.S. Army understand that.\n  Last week, I was in Crawford, Nebraska. I am helping with the \nrenovation of the historic barracks at the old Ft. Robinson in western \nNebraska.\n  Ft. Robinson was home to the U.S. Army's ``Buffalo Soldiers''--the \nheroic black soldiers who fought as part of the U.S. Army after the \nCivil War into the early 20th Century.\n  The 9th Cavalry Buffalo Soldiers called Ft. Robinson home from 1885 \nto 1898. And the 10th Cavalry Buffalo Soldiers were stationed at Ft. \nRobinson from 1902 to 1907.\n  It is also interesting to note that Nebraska was home to the 25th \nCavalry Buffalo Soldiers who were stationed at Ft. Niobrara, in the \nnorth central part of Nebraska, from 1902 to 1907.\n  The Buffalo Soldiers made up about twelve percent of the U.S. Army at \nthe turn of the Century and they served our country valiantly and with \ngreat distinction.\n  Eighteen Buffalo Soldiers earned the Medal of Honor, our Nation's \nhighest award, fighting on the Western frontier. Five more earned the \nMedal of Honor for service during the Spanish American War.\n  ``Duty, honor, country'' is the motto of the U.S. Army. It is \nAmerica. Every generation of Americans who have served in the U.S. \nArmy--from the Continental Army to the Buffalo Soldiers to today's \nfighting men and women--have been shaped by this motto.\n  It has molded lives in ways that are hard to explain, just as the \nArmy has touched our national life and history and made the world more \nsecure, prosperous, and a better place for all mankind.\n  On this 226th birthday of the U.S. Army, as a proud U.S. Army \nveteran, I say happy birthday to the Army veterans of our country. We \nrecognize and thank those who served and whose examples inspired those \nof us who have had the opportunity to serve in the U.S. Army.\n  It is the Army that has laid the foundation for all of this nation's \ndistinguished branches of service and helped build a greater, stronger \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, on this, the 226th birthday of the Army, I say Happy \nBirthday and, in the great rich tradition of the U.S. Army, I proudly \nproclaim my annual Senate floor ``HOOAH!''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I commend my dear friend from Nebraska for his remarks \ncelebrating the 226th anniversary of the Army. I am glad I was present \non the floor to hear the annual ``Hooah'' from a wonderful former \nsergeant who served with great distinction during the Vietnam conflict. \nHe is a wonderful Member of this body and a great friend to the \nveterans of America.\n  I served in the Army. I was a weekend warrior. I defended the shores \nof Connecticut from outside aggression over the years. But, I am deeply \nproud to have worn the uniform of the Army while rising to the rank of \nE4. I am even more proud of my friend for his wonderful service and for \nwhat he has done in public life after his service. I join him in \nwishing happy birthday to our friends in the U.S. Army.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, if I may respond to my friend from \nConnecticut, it is common knowledge that E4s run the Army, so I salute \nhim with a big ``Hooah.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/14/senate-section/article/S6307-3", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6307-S6312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ACT\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I want to spend some time talking about \nthe reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965, which we passed just a few minutes ago.\n  First, I commend my friend and colleague from Massachusetts, the \nchairman of the committee, for his continuing leadership in the area of \neducation. Senator Kennedy has been a tireless champion of children and \nfamilies and is now into his fifth decade here in the Senate. He has no \nequal when it comes to his passion for serving those in need, and \ndemonstrated that passion once again during his management of this bill \nover the past 6 or 7 weeks.\n  I also want to join with those who have commended our colleague, \nSenator Jeffords of Vermont. Senator Jeffords is the former chairman of \nthis committee. We were elected to Congress together more than a \nquarter century ago. He has been a wonderful friend and fellow New \nEnglander and in large part is responsible for the outlines of the bill \njust adopted by a substantial vote. In his quiet way, Jim Jeffords made \na very profound and strong imprint on this legislation.\n  Although much attention has been focused on political events over the \nlast few weeks associated with our colleague from Vermont, that should \nnot overshadow his substantive commitment to the quality of education \nin this country, and this reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act is one of the finest examples of his efforts \nover the years. So I commend him for his work.\n  I thank my friend from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, who is a \ntremendously bright and articulate Member of this body. We have our \ndifferences, but there is no more engaging Member, no one with whom I \nmore enjoy debating a subject. He is knowledgeable and deeply committed \nto these issues. He has very strong views, but is a very fair \nindividual, and he did a very fine job here on the floor. Other \nmembers, also have been very involved in this legislation, such as \nSenator Frist of Tennessee, who cares deeply about these issues;\n\n[[Page S6308]]\n\nJoe Lieberman, Evan Bayh, and Mary Landrieu; and especially other \nmembers of the committee on which I served--Tom Harkin, Jack Reed, \nPatty Murray, Barbara Mikulski, Jeff Bingaman, and our new colleagues, \nSenator Clinton from New York, and Senator Edwards. Also, Susan \nCollins, and Tim Hutchinson from Arkansas. Paul Wellstone has offered \nmany amendments in committee as well as on the floor, expressing his \nstrong appetite for improving the quality of public education in \nAmerica. Certainly, Tom Daschle, the distinguished majority leader, has \nbeen deeply involved in this debate and discussion over the last number \nof weeks and deserves a great deal of credit, along with Harry Reid, \nfor keeping the battle moving forward and the debate moving forward \nover these last days of the debate.\n\n  I thank Trent Lott, former majority leader, now minority leader, for \nhis work as well.\n  I am sure that I left some people out here, including the Presiding \nOfficer, the distinguished Senator from Michigan, Ms. Stabenow, who has \nalso been deeply involved in education matters for many years--long \nbefore she arrived as a new Member of this body, in her work in the \nother Chamber, and in her home State of Michigan on behalf of children \nand families. I thank her for her work as well. And, Senator Biden, \nwith whom I offered my comparability amendment, along also with Senator \nReed.\n  Madam President, this is not a bill I would have written. Nor is it \none that I expect our Republican friends would have written, were we \nallowed to write our own version of a framework for elementary and \nsecondary education. This is a compromise bill. There are parts of it \nabout which I am very excited and others about which I am disappointed. \nThis is not an uncommon reaction when a final vote on major legislation \nis called for.\n  But we are not through the process. This is step 1 for us. The other \nbody has adopted its version of the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct, and now we will meet in conference, to work out the differences \nbetween these two bills.\n  I believe our collective work over the past couple of months has \ngreatly improved the bill, and that is why I voted for it. \nNevertheless, I hope that it will come back from conference a stronger \nbill.\n  This bill will target resources to the neediest students in our \ncountry. It will make sure that classrooms are run by well-qualified \nteachers, and it will provide options to parents. Those are wonderful \nimprovements over the status quo. I heard my friend from Utah say this \nbill was nothing more than the status quo. That is not the case.\n  There also were many important amendments adopted, in many cases with \nbroad bipartisan support.\n  Senator Harkin and Senator Hagel put together what may be the most \nimportant amendment adopted in this bill, mandating full funding of the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act. After 26 years of waiting, \ncommunities, parents, teachers, and students finally will receive full \nfunding of special education. This is a major achievement.\n  I am very proud of the fact Senator Collins and I were able to get 79 \nvotes for full funding of title I over the next 10 years. I hope that \nwe can fully fund it more rapidly than that, but I believe, and my \ncolleague from Massachusetts who has a wonderful historical memory of \nthis law over the years may know, this is the first time we ever voted \nto fully fund title I, I am proud of this action.\n  Senator Kennedy's amendment will increase the number of qualified \nteachers in our classrooms. That is a major achievement.\n  Senator Wellstone's amendment ensures that the tests States develop \nto comply with this bill will be of high quality.\n  Senator Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas won strong bipartisan support to \nincrease support for bilingual education.\n  Our colleague from California, Senator Boxer, won support, I joined \nwith her, to increase resources to provide children with productive \nafterschool programs.\n  Senator Reed of Rhode Island deserves great credit for providing \nschool libraries with desperately needed resources.\n  The amendment of our colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, will \nstrengthen math and science partnerships. That improves the bill \ntremendously as well.\n  I was also pleased the Senate rejected efforts to include private \nschool vouchers in this bill by a significant vote. Not out of any \nnegative feelings about private education, but because with 50 million \nchildren in public schools and 5 million in private schools, resources \nare hard to come by, and we must do our best to improve the quality of \npublic education.\n  I am pleased as well the Senate accepted an amendment I offered, \nalong with the support of the chairman of the committee and others, for \nthe professional development of early childhood educators.\n  Also, the amendment I offered with Senator Shelby of Alabama to \nprotect student privacy was accepted by voice vote.\n  For children to be ready for school and to learn to read, their early \nchildhood educators must have the training to help them develop \nintellectually and socially, and this amendment contributes to that \ngoal.\n  The amendment I offered with Senator Shelby of Alabama to protect \nstudent privacy also was accepted by voice vote.\n  This amendment will ensure parents have the right to decide whether \ntheir children will be asked personal questions by marketeers for \ncommercial purposes during school time.\n  This is a growing phenomenon, one that is a growing concern of mine, \nthat classrooms are becoming market testing grounds. It is hard enough \nto educate a child. I do not think parents expect their children to \nbecome the subject of marketing surveys in school. Parents wouldn't \ntolerate this happening in their homes without their permission and \nthey should not have to tolerate it in their children's schools without \npermission.\n\n  Businesses can be great partners in the educational system. They have \na vested interest in a well-educated workforce. But the extent to which \nand how they are involved is something about which we all ought to be \nconscious.\n  But, I do have significant concerns about this bill. I am \ndisappointed that it does not include funds dedicated to reducing class \nsize and repairing crumbling schools. We know that these things improve \nstudent achievement and we will continue to fight for them.\n  I also am disappointed we adopted the Helms amendment, which \npurported to be about ensuring the Boy Scouts access to public school \nfacilities, a right already guaranteed them by the United States \nSupreme Court.\n  The Boy Scouts have a long tradition of doing wonderful things for \nAmerica's young men, but unfortunately the Helms amendment, in my view, \neffectively puts the Senate on record as approving the exclusionary \npolicies of the Boy Scouts and other organizations, and that is a sad \ncommentary as we enter the 21st century.\n  Most of all, I am concerned that while this bill demands \naccountability for low-income schools and school districts, and \nestablishes the goal of funding title I, we still have not received a \ncommitment from the President or our Republican colleagues to provide \nthe resources for Title I, special education, and other parts of this \nbill.\n  I would have hoped that by now the President would have said there \nwill be full funding of these programs during his administration. He \nhas, for whatever reasons, decided not to make that commitment. I am \nstill hopeful he will. That will go a long way in alleviating my \nconcerns about whether or not these reforms are going to give these \nchildren an opportunity to compete on a level playing field with other \nchildren who have the tools that will allow them to succeed. It does \nnot guarantee success, but it is an opportunity to succeed.\n  We have an obligation at every level, Federal, State, and local, to \nsee to it that all kids have a chance to succeed. It is important, if \nthis bill is going to reach its potential, to have the resources we \nwill need to give kids that chance.\n  That has not yet happened, and I am very uneasy as we go into the \nconference about whether or not those commitments will be forthcoming. \nIf\n\n[[Page S6309]]\n\nwe end up with nothing but tests and standards and leave needy children \nin this country in rural and urban areas without the resources to \nbenefit from real reforms, then we will end up with a self-fulfilling \nprophecy of children who fail tests, which will be taken as a further \nindictment of public education.\n  I know I am not alone in this concern. The chairman of the committee \nhas expressed this feeling over and over, and I am hopeful that as this \ndebate proceeds over the coming weeks, the commitments we have asked \nfor with regard to resources will be forthcoming.\n  And, finally, I am disappointed the Senate did not adopt an amendment \nwhich I offered along with Senator Biden and Senator Reid, with strong \nsupport of almost half of the Senate, calling for comparable \neducational opportunity services for all children within a State. We \nhave done that for 36 years within school districts. Some districts \nhave more students than 27 States in this country. For 36 years, they \nhave been able to provide a comparable educational opportunity. I think \nStates ought to meet that same criteria. This bill demands greater \naccountability from students, parents, teachers, school boards, and the \nFederal Government--the only entity we exclude from that is the States. \nI am disappointed that amendment was not adopted.\n  But, again, to conclude these remarks, my hat is off to the chairman \nof the committee, to Jim Jeffords, as I mentioned earlier, for his \nwork, to the members of our committee, going right on down the line to \nthe most junior member, Senator Clinton of New York. Also, our \nRepublican colleagues, including Judd Gregg, Bill Frist, Susan Collins, \nTim Hutchinson and the others, who worked hard to make this a better \nbill. While we disagreed and I had strong arguments with them on many \npoints, my respect for them is in no way diminished. In fact, if \nanything, it is enhanced by their commitment.\n  We are all trying to do our best for the children of this country and \nI hope that in the weeks ahead, we will be able to improve this bill \nfurther. Again, I thank the chairman of the committee and his staff and \nall of our staffs.\n  I will include all the names of people here. They worked so hard. \nFrom Senator Kennedy's staff, Michael Myers, Danica Petroshius, Jane \nOates, Roberto Rodriguez, Michael Dannenberg, Dana Fiordaliso, and Ben \nCope. From my staff, Lloyd Horwich, Shawn Maher, Jeanne Ireland, Grace \nReef, Sheryl Cohen, and John Carwell.\n  Bev Schroeder and Katie Corrigan of Senator Harkin's staff, Bethany \nLittle of Senator Murray's staff, Elyse Wasch and Michael Yudin with \nSenator Reed, Jill Morningstar and Jay Barth with Senator Wellstone, \nand Ann O'Leary with Senator Clinton.\n  Also, Carmel Martin and Dan Alpert with Senator Bingaman, Kimberly \nRoss with Senator Mikulski, and Crystal Bennett, with Senator Edwards.\n  Mark Powden, Sherry Kaiman, and Andy Hartman with Senator Jeffords. \nMichele Stockwell with Senator Lieberman, Elizabeth Fay with Senator \nBayh, and Kathleen Strottman with Senator Landrieu.\n  I also want thank the staff on the other side, especially Denzel \nMcGuire and Stephanie Monroe, with Senator Gregg, Holly Kuzmich with \nSenator Hutchinson, Maureen Marshall with Senator Collins, and Andrea \nBecker with Senator Frist.\n  And, I want to thank Joan Huffer with Senator Daschle and David Crane \nand John Mashburn with Senator Lott, and Sandy Kress and Townsend \nMcNitt, of the White House staff, for all of their help.\n  I remember Senator Kennedy and I were up one Saturday morning weeks. \nWe were in the building, walking around, and happened to see a door \nopen. We walked in and there were the staffs, trying to work out \ndifferences and work out language in the bill. We offer the amendments, \nwe get the attention, we appear before the cameras, but it is the \nstaffs of our offices who do tremendous work and develop great \nunderstanding of these issues.\n  I thank Senator Kennedy's staff, my own staff, the staff of the \nothers, both majority and minority for the tremendous effort and time \nthey put in to make this a better bill.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I want to, first, express appreciation \nto many of our colleagues and friends and then say a very brief word \nabout what I think this bill is really about.\n  I want to start off by thanking the extraordinary staffs, mine and \nthose of the members of our committee, Democrats and Republicans alike. \nWe are enormously blessed to have men and women who are committed and \ndedicated to trying to strengthen the educational system of this \ncountry. To a great extent I hope they feel some satisfaction this \nevening with the completion of this legislation.\n  As has been pointed out by my friend Senator Dodd, we had areas of \ndifferences but there was no real difference in our desire to send a \nvery clear message, which tonight we are sending to families all across \nthis country, that help is on the way.\n  The legislation that was passed a short while ago was not a \nDemocratic bill or a Republican bill; it was an education bill. Stated \nvery clearly with this extraordinary vote--91 votes in favor of this \nlegislation--this Senate is committed to the future of this country. \nThat is what this is about. It is about the hopes and dreams of \nchildren, their desire to excel in athletics and sports, but also in \nthe classrooms. When they have exciting and innovative and creative \nteachers, when they have interesting curricula and it is all well \ntaught and supported by parents--all of that is really about the future \nof America.\n  This vote this evening is a clear manifestation of what has been \nhappening over the past days on the floor of the Senate. Democrats and \nRepublicans were coming together on this central issue, the core issue, \nthe first issue for American families. All parents understand the \nimportance of children's dreams. We realize, really, the greatest \nlimitation on those children's dreams is the failure to provide the \nopportunity for those children's minds to be as expansive as they \npossibly can be, to be interested and informed, benefitting from \neducational opportunities which, hopefully, we have strengthened in \nthis legislation.\n  First, I thank Denzel McGuire and Stephanie Monroe of Senator Gregg's \noffice; Holly Kuzmich of Senator Hutchinson's staff; Maureen Marshall \nof Senator Collins' staff; David Crane and John Mashburn of Senator \nLott's staff; Mark Powden and Sherry Kaiman of Senator Jeffords' staff; \nLloyd Horwich of Senator Dodd's staff; Carmel Martin and Dan Alpert of \nSenator Bingaman's staff; and Elizabeth Fay of Senator Bayh's staff; \nMichelle Stockwell of Senator Lieberman's staff.\n  I also thank Sandy Kress, who has been enormously helpful to all of \nus in the Senate, Democrats and Republicans alike, representing the \nPresident. She is a person who understands the President's views very \ncompletely. She is a forceful fighter for the position of the \nPresident. But as I said on many occasions, she doesn't always say no. \nShe understands the importance of attempting to fight for the position \nof the President. I thank as well Townsend McNitt of the White House \nstaff as well, who was enormously valuable and helpful to us.\n  I thank Secretary Paige for his work. Secretary Paige really set the \ntone for this legislation. At the time of his swearing in, I asked if \nhe would be good enough to come up and meet with all the Democrats. He \ncame up for a meeting. We had very good attendance. I think almost our \nwhole Democratic caucus was in attendance. He stayed there until the \nlast question was asked. It was a very impressive presentation. Since \nthat time, he has been available and accessible to all of us on matters \nwith which we were concerned.\n  I could not possibly have made much difference in this effort \nwithout, really, the tireless work of my own staff: Jane Oates, Michael \nDannenberg, and Roberto Rodriguez, for their indispensable roles--all \nof our staff, of whom I am so proud. They are superb professionals who \ntake great pride in their work, as they should, and as I do in them.\n  My thanks go to Jim Manley for his able assistance; Danica \nPetroshius, Dana Fiordaliso, and Ben Cope for the amazing support over \nthe weeks--most of all to Danica Petroshius, whose leadership, energy, \nand vision has made all\n\n[[Page S6310]]\n\nthe difference. I thank Danica so much. Her friendship I value greatly.\n  I am very fortunate for in our staff we have not only great \nprofessionals, but they are also great friends. We have a good \nopportunity to work together. I am not always sure they felt that way \nfor every moment over these past 8 weeks, but I want them to know that \nis the way I felt about them.\n  Let me thank also our colleagues who were really indispensable. One \nof the things that makes it so satisfying to work on our committee, as \nwell as being productive, is there is a great coming together by \nDemocrats and Republicans.\n  I think the markups were enormously spirited with very good debate \nand discussion of different viewpoints. But there is a great deal of \nrespect for the opinions of each other. In our committee we have tried \nto work out some special responsibilities. All members have had great \ncommitment in the area of education.\n  Of course, when we think of Senator Dodd, we think of the children's \ncaucus and all the good work he has done in those areas, particularly \nin the afterschool programs.\n  Tom Harkin: We think of his efforts to make sure we are going to have \nmodern classrooms for our children.\n  Senator Mikulski has been singular in her work in trying to focus on \nthe digital divide to make sure we are not going to have the \ndisparities in the digital divisions what we have had in educational \ndivisions. She has been light-years ahead of the rest of us in \nunderstanding this and in helping us to try to minimize it.\n  Jeff Bingaman knows more about accountability than any other Member \nand has been such a leader in this area.\n  Senator Wellstone has been so passionate on so many different issues. \nI can think of his contributions, particularly on this legislation, to \ntry to make sure we address the quality of our testing and to make sure \nthat children are going to be treated fairly and equitably. I know he \nhas serious reservations about many of these provisions. Our committee \nis so much the better for having Senator Wellstone, as is the Senate.\n  Jack Reed comes from a long tradition of interest in education, not \nonly since he has been in the Senate but also as a House Member. He \nfollows in the Senate Claiborne Pell, who was chairman of our Education \nCommittee. Senator Reed understands the importance of quality education \nand the importance of parental involvement, and also the recognition of \nlibraries as a special priority to children. I still think we missed \nsome important opportunities in being able to adopt some of the Reed \namendments because we are enhancing dramatically the reading programs \nwhich the President has stood behind. We need good, effective libraries \nover the long range. Jack Reed understands this.\n  Senator Murray--I can still hear her eloquent pleas for us to go to \nsmaller class size--as a former schoolteacher, brings dimension to our \neducation issues which are unique. Senator Edwards, who is so much \ninvolved in the development of the education policy in North Carolina, \nwhich has really been singular in its achievement, shared with us these \nextraordinary lessons and made valuable contributions.\n  Senator Clinton probably has spent more time in schools in New York \nand as much as any Member of the Senate has spent time in schools, \nlearning and speaking. Of course, we were advantaged by the fact that \nwhen she arrived on our committee, she already had a lifetime of \ninvolvement in children's issues and educational issues. Since she \narrived on that committee, from the first day we benefited from her \nexperience.\n  I also thank Connie Garner of my staff for her tireless dedication. \nShe has worked on issues involving the disabilities questions. She left \na sickbed. She was there 3 weeks ago in a very important medical \ncondition, from which she has recovered. But she was quick to put aside \nthe attention to her own health in order to be in here and be with us \non these debates on matters dealing with disability. She is the proud \nmother of eight, at last count. Connie is the proud mother of a \ndisabled child, and she has made an extraordinary mark on disability \npolicy.\n\n  I want to finally thank the one who pulled all of this together for \nour committee, Michael Myers, with whom I have had the good opportunity \nto work on many different policy issues for years, starting with \nrefugees years and years ago, longer than he may want to remember. He \nhas the extraordinary ability to make a lot of different issues, policy \nquestions, and problems a great deal easier. He is a problem solver \nwith rare qualities. In an undertaking such as we had, he was \nabsolutely, extraordinarily valuable.\n  I thanked earlier Senator Jeffords and spoke about his very special \ncontributions.\n  I also thank Senator Gregg, who has spent a good deal of time here on \nthe floor. I always enjoy working with him--more often when we agree \nthan when we disagree. But it is always a pleasure.\n  Senator Frist--who has worked on education--and I have worked closely \ntogether on health care.\n  I thank Senator Hutchison, Senator Collins, and other members of our \ncommittee.\n  We had the benefit also of Senator Lieberman and Senator Bayh. \nSenator Bayh took special interest in education as a Governor. After \nbeing Governor, he brought those interests here to the Senate. He is \nnot a member of our committee but is as thoughtful about issues on \neducation as one can possibly imagine. Senator Lieberman has made \neducation one of his great areas of specialization and has been both an \nenormously helpful and valuable ally as we have pursued this issue.\n  I thank all of the outside groups who have worked with us. We tried \nto communicate as much as we possibly could as we were working through \nthis process. We tried to do as good a job as we could. I thought we \ndid a decent job. I am sure there are people to whom we owe an apology. \nI extend that apology. If we weren't able to get to you, or answer your \nquestions on some of these matters, we will take the opportunity now \nand invite those who are concerned about this to examine this bill and \nto give us their ideas as we go to the conference. We are very grateful \nfor all of the outside help and assistance we had.\n  I commend all the students, parents, and teachers who left an \nindelible mark on this legislation, and thank them for their commitment \nand willingness to put aside the divisions of the past and find \nconstructive compromise to improve education for all students and all \npublic schools across the country. It is a good bill. It has strong \nsupport.\n  I thank the floor staff, who are always available to us and who are \ninvaluable in working through complex and difficult situations on the \nfloor. They have been absolutely superb, wonderful professionals.\n  Finally, I thank Senator Harry Reid who was absolutely instrumental. \nHe is not on our committee, but I think at the end of these 8 weeks he \nknows more about education than perhaps he intended to at the start of \nthis legislation. He is learning more about every bill because there \nisn't an ally--having been here as long as I have been and having had \nthe good fortune to be a floor manager of legislation--there is no one \nwho has greater value as a floor manager than the Senator from Nevada. \nHe has extraordinary skills, and he uses them in amazing ways. He was \nable to get things achieved and move this process along. People might \nask, Well, how much of a difference does it make? It makes the \ndifference between success and failure. Make no mistake about it, it \nmakes the difference between success and failure. And we would not be \nhere with that success in terms of the strong support of the Members of \nthis body tonight had it not been for my friend and colleague, Senator \nReid. I am enormously grateful to him for all of his good work. I thank \nhim for all he has done. We look forward to seeing him in harness next \nweek on the Patients' Bill Of Rights. And hopefully he will be able to \ndispose of those 300 amendments, as he was able to dispose of the 300 \namendments that were offered to this bill and get us to final passage.\n\n  Finally, I thank the clerks and also all the pages for their help and \nassistance during this time.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I was not coming to hear the laudatory remarks of the \nSenator, but I appreciate having heard them. It\n\n[[Page S6311]]\n\nis not often in the Senate we have the opportunity to say good things \nabout each other; We are busy trying to get an amendment adopted or \ngive a speech we need to give, and all the things we need to do.\n  But I cannot help but reflect on the time I have had to spend with \nthe Senator from Massachusetts on this bill because my mind goes back \nto when I was just a boy, a student at Utah State University. I say to \nthe Senator, your brother was running for President, and I was enthused \nabout helping him. I was in Republican territory, Utah State University \nin Logan, UT. So I formed at that university a young Democratic club: \nYoung Democrats. And one of the prize possessions I have in the world \nis a letter written by John Kennedy after that successful election. I \nhave it hanging on the wall in my office in the Hart Building, where he \nacknowledged we formed this club and perhaps helped him a little bit.\n  I told the Senator the first day I came to the Senate what an honor \nit was for me to serve with Ted Kennedy, a person who is one of the \nwell-known people of the world, who has been such an example for how \nyou deal with your family for all of us.\n  For me, on a personal basis, I say to the Senator, to be able to \nlegislate with you has been a dream of a lifetime. And then to have the \nsenior Senator from Massachusetts say some nice things about me is even \nsomething that I never dreamed would happen. So there is mutual \nadmiration. I appreciate the Senator's nice remarks.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I did not have the opportunity to hear \nall of the remarks made by our distinguished colleagues, but I also \ncome to the floor to congratulate our colleague, Senator Kennedy, for \nthe remarkable job he has done in getting us to this point. I think it \nis fair to say--I hope the country understands this--this bill would \nnot be where it is today, we would not have passed it 91-8, if it were \nnot for his persistence, his incredible leadership, and the ability he \nhas to once again bring both sides together.\n  I have had the good fortune now to work with our colleague from \nMassachusetts on so many things, and I am awed, I am inspired, and I \nam, indeed, grateful for his friendship and for the extraordinary \nleadership he provides. So I thank him and congratulate him in \nparticular.\n  Let me also congratulate our colleague, Senator Jeffords. He has gone \nthrough a very difficult period. He began by providing us with \nleadership on the Republican side as we took up this piece of \nlegislation--now as an Independent, caucusing with us. He has voted and \nsupported this legislation all the way through. His leadership, his \ncommitment, his work also deserve special recognition.\n  He is not in the Chamber at this time, but I just want to say, on \nbehalf of the entire Senate, we thank him for what he has done and the \nmanner in which he has done it.\n  Of course, there are many others who have been very active. I cite \nespecially Senator Lieberman and Senator Bayh for their efforts in \nworking with Senator Kennedy. They have been extraordinary in their \nefforts to find common ground.\n  We started in our caucus in some ways divided. We ended this whole \ndebate more unified on education than we have been in a long time, and \nit is in part because of the work they have done.\n  Senator Dodd, with his passion, his commitment, deserves special \nrecognition as well. I salute him for the efforts he made to find ways \nto address the concerns he has with the bill. I thank him for his \nparticipation.\n  Let me finally say, as Senator Kennedy has, and others have already \nnoted, the one person who is not on the HELP Committee who probably had \nas much to do with getting this job done as anybody has--or ever will \non a piece of legislation--is our assistant Democratic leader. You can \nonly love Harry Reid if you know him. And I don't know of anybody who \ndoes not love him and have the affection for him that I do. He once \nagain demonstrated his value not only to our caucus but to the Senate \nand to the country with the manner and the tremendous ability he \ndemonstrates in working with us each and every day. He is the single \nbest person any manager could ever hope to have as they work to try to \nresolve outstanding differences, scheduling conflicts, and the array of \nchallenges we face in trying to work through any bill.\n  So I acknowledge and congratulate our dear friend, Senator Harry \nReid, our assistant Democratic leader, for the work he has done in \ngetting us to this point.\n  I will have a number of matters to raise as we prepare to close, \nMadam President, but at this point I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, before the Senator from South Dakota, the \nmajority leader, leaves the Chamber, on behalf of Senator Kennedy and \nmyself, I would like to acknowledge, Mr. Leader, that it is nice you \nsaid good things about us--and we really appreciate it--but everyone \nshould know, especially the people in South Dakota, that when things \ngot rough out here, we always had to turn to you.\n  We were able to do a lot of things. We had a good time working \ntogether. We enjoyed our partnership. But when it came time to make the \nreally tough decisions, we had to turn to you.\n  I would like to say this is the first real week of your leadership as \nmajority leader. I hope this is a message of things to come because we \nwere able, on a bipartisan basis--this was not the Democratic \nleadership pushing things through. We had to turn to you, and when it \nreally got tough, we were able to work this out. There was no better \nexample of that than today. It is a small miracle we finished today.\n  We had to go back to the office, bring you out here, and as a result \nof that, it was above our pay grade--Senator Kennedy and I--but it \ncertainly is not above your pay grade. As I have said so many times--\nand I appreciate your kind remarks about me --neither one of us could \nhave made this bill happen but for you.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I don't think we called on him more than 25 times a day, \nasking him to come out here to help us out.\n  But in a serious way, I just underline what Senator Reid has said: \nThe ultimate credit for this achievement is with the leader of the \nSenate; that is, our new leader and our friend, Senator Daschle. I \nthink all of us understand that is what leadership is really about. We \nwere able to get this done and done in a bipartisan way.\n  Senator Daschle announced when he assumed the leadership the way he \nwanted this institution to be run, and that is the way it was run. \nMembers all through this debate were able to have their views either \nvoted on or considered, unfettered by parliamentary gimmicks. The abuse \nof parliamentary technique was not in play. There was full, open, frank \ndebate and discussion and accountability. It is a breath of fresh air \nin terms of the functioning of this body. It is really what I think \nmost of us believe this body is really all about.\n  It is a real honor and pleasure to know Tom Daschle is leading this \ninstitution. I thank him for his words.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I also express my appreciation for all \nwho have been involved in this bill.\n  I say to Senator Kennedy, a number of people on this side of the \naisle have expressed their appreciation for your leadership. You are a \ngreat advocate, but also you manage a bill very well.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The process that we utilized worked well. Everybody got \ntheir votes and got their say. Matters went along fine.\n  President Bush, as a Governor, committed to doing something about \neducation in his State. He was hands on in that effort. As a result, he \nknew something about education when he ran for President. He determined \nthat it would not be business as usual. He was convinced that children \nwere being left behind, that they were finding themselves in seventh, \neighth, and ninth grades unable to do basic education work, and \ntragedies were in store for them. He got to know some outstanding \nindividuals in education in\n\n[[Page S6312]]\n\nTexas. One was Dr. Rod Paige, the superintendent of the Houston school \nsystem, 207,000 students, one of the largest in America.\n  Secretary Paige had made some real progress there. When he took over \nin 1995 in that school system, he found only 37 percent of the students \nwere passing the basic Texas test. He had been the dean of a school of \nhigher education. He determined that they could do better, and he \ninsisted that they do better. In 5 years, he doubled that number--1 \npercentage point from doubling --to 73 percent passing.\n  President Bush saw that. He appreciated that achievement. He was \ndetermined to try to bring that kind of progress throughout America. \nThat is why he selected Dr. Rod Paige as his Secretary of Education.\n  Dr. Paige eliminated social promotion. He improved testing. He \ncracked down on schools that did not work, and he cracked down on \ndiscipline problems. It was a real achievement of an extraordinary \ndegree that should give us all hope that we can make much better \nprogress with education than we think.\n  My wife taught. I have been in 20 schools this year. There are \nteachers around this country teaching their hearts out every day, \ngiving their level best to education. If we can create a system that \nnurtures them and allows their talents to flourish and not be clamped \ndown by rules and regulations and such, I believe we have the potential \nfor extraordinary progress in education.\n  Finally, I note that testing is critical because if you love children \nand you care about them and you do not want them to fall behind, you \nwill find out how they are doing. The parents need to know. The \nteachers need to know. The principals need to know. Everybody needs to \nknow whether learning is occurring.\n  When a child is falling behind in basic reading and math--and they \nwill have to be tested in this program--then you can deal with it. If \nwe let them get to junior high, high school, ninth grade, typically, \nand they can't do basic math and can't read effectively, they drop out. \nThat is a great tragedy. They will be left behind. We should not allow \nthat.\n  This bill will move us forward. The President will support \nunprecedented increases in education this year, but he wants that kind \nof reform. It is part of the bill. I am confident it will come out of \nthe conference committee in a way that he can support.\n  I thank Senator Daschle for his leadership and his time in the late \nevening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I compliment the distinguished Senator \nfrom Alabama for his comments. I agree with much of what I heard. I \nthink he is absolutely right. This is a real accomplishment. And for \npeople who care about education on both sides of the aisle, we made \nreal progress today. I am proud to be a part of it. I appreciate his \ncomments.\n  Madam President, I want to acknowledge the leadership of Senator \nLott, our Republican leader. He was majority leader when we started. We \nhad a number of discussions as we considered how to take up this bill. \nIt was Senator Lott who said: We are going to take it up, and we are \ngoing to let amendments roll. We are going to let amendments be \noffered. We are not going to use extralegal parliamentary devices. We \nare going to stay with the agreement we had under the power sharing. He \ndid it, and he did it with real style.\n  The day should not end without a recognition of Senator Lott's \ncommitment in that regard and the leadership he provided to allow us to \ncomplete the bill today.\n  Senator Judd Gregg from New Hampshire also deserves special \nrecognition. He stepped in at the end, completed the bill, as the \nRepublican manager. I acknowledge his leadership as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/14/senate-section/article/S6312-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6312-S6313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       COMMEMORATION OF FLAG DAY\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, two hundred and twenty-four years ago \ntoday, the United States was engaged in its War for Independence. I \nnote that the American Continental Army, now the United States Army, \nwas established by the Continental Congress, just two years earlier on \nJune 14, 1775. I express my congratulations to the United States Army \non its 226th birthday.\n  At the start of that War, American colonists fought under a variety \nof local flags. The Continental Colors, or Grand Union Flag, was the \nunofficial national flag from 1775-1777. This flag had thirteen \nalternating red and white stripes, with the English flag in the upper \nleft corner.\n  Following the publication of the Declaration of Independence, it was \nno longer appropriate to fly a banner containing the British flag. \nAccordingly, on June 14, 1777, the Continental Congress passed a \nresolution that ``the Flag of the United States be 13 stripes alternate \nred and white, and the Union be 13 stars white and a blue field \nrepresenting a new constellation.''\n  No record exists as to why the Continental Congress adopted the now-\nfamiliar red, white and blue. A later action by the Congress, convened \nunder the Articles of Confederation, may provide an appropriate \ninterpretation on the use of these colors. Five years after adopting \nthe flag resolution, in 1782, a resolution regarding the Great Seal of \nthe United States contained a statement on the meanings of the colors: \nred--for hardiness and courage; white--for purity and innocence; and \nblue for vigilance, perseverance, and justice.\n  The stripes, symbolic of the thirteen original colonies, were similar \nto the five red and four white stripes on the flag of the Sons of \nLiberty, an early colonial flag. The stars of the first national flag \nafter 1777 were arranged in a variety of patterns. The most popular \ndesign placed the stars in alternating rows of three or two stars. \nAnother flag placed twelve stars in a circle with the thirteenth star \nin the center. A now popular image of a flag of that day, although it \nwas rarely used at the time, placed the thirteen stars in a circle.\n  As our country has grown, the Stars and Stripes have undergone \nnecessary modifications. Alterations include the addition, then \ndeletion, of stripes; and the addition and rearrangement of the field \nof stars.\n  While our Star-Spangled Banner has seen changes, the message it \nrepresents is constant. That message is one of patriotism and respect, \nwherever the flag is found flying. Henry Ward Beecher, a prominent 19th \ncentury clergyman and lecturer stated, ``A thoughtful mind, when it \nsees a Nation's flag, sees not the flag only, but the Nation itself; \nand whatever may be its symbols, its insignia, he reads chiefly in the \nflag the Government, the principles, the truths, and the history which \nbelong to the nation that sets it forth.''\n  Old Glory represents the land, the people, the government and the \nideals of the United States, no matter when or where it is displayed \nthroughout the world--in land battle, the first such occurrence being \nAugust 16, 1777 at the Battle of Bennington; on a U.S. Navy ship, such \nas the Ranger, under the command of John Paul Jones in November 1777; \nor in Antarctica, in 1840, on the pilot boat Flying Fish of the Charles \nWilkes expedition.\n  The flag has proudly represented our Republic beyond the Earth and \ninto the heavens. The stirring images of Neil Armstrong and Edwin \nAldrin saluting the flag on the moon, on July 20, 1969 moved the Nation \nto new heights of patriotism and national pride.\n  Today we pause to commemorate our Nation's most clear symbol--our \nflag. An early account of a day of celebration of the flag was reported \nby the Hartford Courant suggesting an observance was held throughout \nthe State of Connecticut, in 1861. The origin of our modern Flag Day is \noften traced to the work of Bernard Cigrand, who in 1885 held his own \nobservance of the flag's birthday in his one-room schoolhouse in \nWaubeka, Wisconsin. This began his decades-long campaign for a day of \nnational recognition of the Flag. His advocacy for this cause was \nreflected in numerous newspaper articles, books, magazines and lectures \nof the day. His celebrated pamphlet on ``Laws and Customs Regulating \nthe Use of the Flag of the United States'' received wide distribution.\n  His petition to President Woodrow Wilson for a national observance \nwas rewarded with a Presidential Proclamation designating June 14, 1916 \nas Flag Day. On a prior occasion President Wilson noted, ``Things that \nthe flag stands for were created by the experiences of a great people. \nEverything\n\n[[Page S6313]]\n\nthat it stands for was written by their lives. The flag is the \nembodiment, not of sentiment, but of history. It represents the \nexperiences made by men and women, the experiences of those who do and \nlive under the flag.''\n  Flag Day was officially designated a National observance by a Joint \nResolution approved by Congress and the President in 1949, and first \ncelebrated the following year. This year, then, marks the 51st \nanniversary of a Congressionally designated Flag Day.\n  It is appropriate that we pause today, on this Flag Day, to render \nour respect and honor to the symbol of our Nation, and to review our \ncommitment to the underlying principles it represents. Today, let us \nreflect on the deeds and sacrifices of those who have gone before and \nthe legacy they left to us. Let us ponder our own endeavors and the \ninheritance we will leave to future generations.\n  Finally, as we commemorate the heritage our flag represents, may we \nas a Nation pledge not only our allegiance, but also our efforts to \nfurthering the standards represented by its colors--courage, virtue, \nperseverance, and justice. Through these universal concepts, We the \nPeople can ensure better lives for ourselves and our children, for \nthese are the characteristics of greatness. In doing so, we can move \ncloser to the goal so well stated by Daniel Webster at the laying of \nthe cornerstone of the Bunker Hill Monument on June 17, 1825. On that \noccasion he said, ``Let our object be our country, our whole country, \nand nothing but our country. And, by the blessing of God, may that \ncountry itself become a vast and splendid monument, not of oppression \nand terror, but of Wisdom, of Peace, and of Liberty, upon which the \nworld may gaze with admiration forever.''\n  I have long supported legislation which imposes penalties on anyone \nwho knowingly mutilates, defaces, burns, tramples upon, or physically \ndefiles any U.S. flag. I have also supported a constitutional amendment \nto grant Congress and the States the power to prohibit the physical \ndesecration of the U.S. flag. I regret that the Senate has yet to adopt \na Resolution for a flag protection Constitutional amendment.\n  I am pleased that the Senate adopted a Resolution to provide for a \ndesignated Senator to lead the Senate in reciting the Pledge of \nAllegiance to the Flag of the United States. This has added greatly to \nthe opening of the Senate each day.\n  Today I encourage my colleagues and all Americans to take note of the \nhistory and meaning of this 14th day of June. We celebrate our Flag, \nobserving its 224th birthday, and the 226-year-old Army which has so \nproudly and valiantly defended it and our great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/14/senate-section/article/S6313-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MICHIGAN'S GUN LAWS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on New Years Day 2001, the Governor of \nMichigan signed into law a bill to take discretion away from local gun \nboards to issue concealed gun licenses and require authorities to issue \nconcealed weapons licenses to any one 21 years or older without a \ncriminal record, with limited exceptions. Under the law, the number of \nconcealed handgun licenses in our State would grow by 200,000 to \n300,000 a ten-fold increase. Needless to say, the law has the potential \nto increase gun violence in Michigan and endanger the lives of \nthousands of people. Istrongly believe that this law is better suited \nto the old West than the new millennium.\n  I am pleased to report that hundreds of thousands of my fellow \nMichiganders agree with me. While the law was scheduled to take effect \non July 1st of this year, a coalition of law enforcement and community \ngroups from across our State called the People Who Care About Kids \ncollected 232,582 signatures on a petition to suspend the law and put \nit before the voters in 2002. One of those signatures was mine.\n  Now the issue is before the courts. Just last month, a State Appeals \nCourt ruled unanimously that the referendum process should proceed. And \nthis Wednesday the Michigan Supreme Court heard arguments on whether \nthe Appeals Court ruling should stand. For the good of my State and for \nthe safety of its citizens, I hope that the Supreme Court upholds the \nlower court ruling and lets the voters decide the issue. If voters are \ngiven the opportunity, I am confident that this wrongheaded effort to \nroll back Michigan's gun laws will be defeated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/14/senate-section/article/S6313-2", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6313-S6314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             BUDGET PROCESS\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, in this morning's Washington Post we \nfinally hear the truth. President pro tempore Robert C. Byrd tells it \nlike it is. Republican and Democrat, White House and Congress, and the \npeople generally take heed.\n  I ask consent that an article from the Washington Post be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 14, 2001]\n\n                             Inherited Mess\n\n                          (By Robert C. Byrd)\n\n       The president's budget director, Mitchell Daniels, has made \n     an impassioned plea [opted, June 5] for Congress to achieve \n     an ``orderly and responsible budget and appropriations \n     process'' this year despite the sudden turn-about in the \n     Senate from Republican to Democratic control\n       While lauding the president's continuing efforts to \n     civilize the tone of business in Washington, Daniels blamed \n     Congress for routinely circumventing budget resolution \n     ceilings to fund runaway appropriations. This year, he \n     predicted, would have been different had the Republicans \n     maintained control of the Senate, and he exhorted Democrats \n     to withstand the siren song of ``games and gimmicks'' in the \n     appropriations process so as to avoid upsetting the budget \n     apple cart.\n       Unfortunately, the deck is stacked against the \n     appropriators. The dice are loaded. The wheel is rigged. \n     Regardless of whether a Democrat or a Republican chairs the \n     Appropriations Committee, the unrealistically low budget \n     targets and tax-cut combo will again perpetuate a yearly hoax \n     on the American people.\n       Despite all the brave talk of fiscal restraint, the \n     Appropriations committees will quietly be asked to spend more \n     money than the budget allows. We know the president will ask \n     us to spend billions more on defense. We know we will be \n     asked to spend billions more on education. We know we have \n     billions of dollars in both unmet and unanticipated needs \n     that we will have a responsibility to fund.\n       We know this. The president knows this. The president's \n     budget director well knows this. The American people should \n     know this. The American people are entitled to truth in \n     budgeting. These programs are not just the priorities of a \n     Democratic Senate. These are the priorities of the president. \n     They are the priorities of the nation. They have to be \n     addressed.\n       Here is the true state of affairs. The budget pays lip \n     service to sizable funding increases for national security, \n     but it doesn't back up its promises with the necessary \n     resources. For non-defense programs, the budget falls $5.5 \n     billion below the level necessary just to keep pace with \n     inflation. What this means is that the nation is fiscally \n     frozen in time, unable to reduce massive backlogs in critical \n     programs that have been piling up for years, and equally \n     unable to anticipate emerging needs.\n       Simply put, the budget resolution and the tax cut combined \n     deny the resources that Congress--regardless of which party \n     is in power--needs to meet a growing nation's requirements. \n     The scarce dollars that are needed for education, Social \n     Security, Medicare, prescription drug benefits and the \n     many other important priorities of the American people \n     will have to come from somewhere.\n       Democrats do not want to resort to gimmicks or game. We \n     were outraged when the Republicans resorted to them--when \n     they hijacked the budget from the Budget Committee over the \n     objections of the Democrats, and then added insult to injury \n     by shutting Democrats out of the conference process. But when \n     a budget resolution allows for a massive tax-cut proposal yet \n     fails to allow for the increased funding for national defense \n     and for education that we all know the president will \n     request, the ``evasions and gimmickry'' have begun.\n       Appropriators welcome cooperation. We encourage \n     flexibility. We seek good-faith dealings with the White House \n     and with both sides of the aisle. We ask only that the \n     administration reciprocate in kind. A good place to start \n     would be to avoid preemptive finger pointing in the media.\n       To attempt to back the Senate Appropriations Committee into \n     a corner by suggesting that Democrats are suddenly in a \n     position to derail ``the first orderly, responsible budget \n     and appropriations process in many years'' is to belie the \n     facts. The budget process was anything but ``orderly and \n     responsible'' this year. In fact, the budget process has been \n     convenient political cover for ``games and gimmickry'' for \n     several years. And we all know it.\n       This is the scenario that the Democratic Senate has \n     inherited, and this is the reality that Congress and the \n     administration face in the coming months as we work our way \n     through the appropriations process.\n       The Senate Appropriations Committee will review the details \n     of the president's budget and we will, on a bipartisan basis, \n     do our best to produce 13 responsible and disciplined\n\n[[Page S6314]]\n\n     appropriations bills. It is my hope that we can address this \n     daunting challenge in a spirit of cooperation, and work \n     together to replace partisan rhetoric with responsible \n     solutions.\n       And if OMB Director Daniels really wants to help his \n     president change the climate in Washington, he can work to \n     stop the blame game in its very tired tracks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/14/senate-section/article/S6314-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT IN PORTLAND PUBLIC SCHOOLS\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the \nexceptional achievement of 8 schools in Portland, OR: Humboldt, \nMarysville, Chief Joseph, Woodmere, Clark, Grout, Kenton and Vestal \nElementary Schools.\n  We have spent 8 weeks in this Chamber talking about education. We \nhave debated the best ways to educate America's children, to raise \nacademic achievement of disadvantaged students, and change failing \nschools into successes. While we have been busy talking, schools in my \nhome State have been working hard to educate our children.\n  I want to make special mention of eight schools in the Portland \nPublic School District. Over the past 3 years, these remarkable \nschools--where more than half of the students come from low income \nfamilies--made greater strides in raising student test scores than all \nothers in the school district. Due to the hard work of students, \nparents, teachers, and principals, reading and math scores have \nsignificantly improved, the achievement gap between poor and minority \nstudents and white students narrowed, and parents, including those new \nto our country, became part of the fabric of the school community.\n  Today, I commend the principals and teachers of these great schools. \nThese educators represent an ideal. They are dedicated; they are \ncreative; and they transform children into scholars. They will do \nanything for their students, even work extra jobs to earn money to buy \nbooks for their students. Their hard work has helped their students \nachieve record academic improvement today and it has set the stage for \nthese children's success for years to come. I thank them for their \nefforts.\n  I also thank the parents of these children. They have made a real \ndifference in their children's education by volunteering at school, \nreading with their children, and encouraging their students to devote \ntheir best efforts to their studies.\n  Above all, I salute the students of these outstanding schools. The \ncountless hours they have spent inside and outside the classroom \npracticing their reading and writing, working math problems, and \nconducting science experiments have not been in vain. They have paid \noff in a remarkable way. Many of these students don't speak English as \ntheir first language; many come from low income families; and all are \nfrom areas of the city which had never expected to see such success. \nYet these very students have realized this extraordinary \naccomplishment.\n  The improvements in the test scores of these children are incredible. \nThe Oregonian newspaper reports the following: At Humboldt \n[Elementary], 71 percent of fifth graders in 2000 met or exceeded math \nbenchmarks. Only 31 percent of those students met math standards as \nthird graders in 1998. At Marysville Elementary in Southeast Portland, \n78 percent of fifth-graders met math benchmarks in 2000. Thirty-two \npercent of those students passed the State math test as third graders.\n  But even more important than these significant gains in test scores, \nthese dedicated students have cultivated a love of learning that will \nlast the rest of their lives. This thirst for knowledge guarantees that \nthis is just the first of many successes to come.\n  A study by the Portland Public Schools Foundation attributed the \nadvances of these schools to the same principles we have been \ndiscussing here: strong principals, high parent involvement, and \nprofessional development opportunities for teachers.\n  I share the achievement of these students with my colleagues because \nit reminds every member of the U.S. Senate that better education is \nbecoming a reality across America. Our work here is important, but the \ntrue source of academic achievement is the dedication, the dreams, and \nthe hard work of students, teachers, and principals like these in \nPortland. The best we can do is to give them the tools they need to \nsucceed.\n  In closing, allow me to commend, once again, the students, parents, \nand educators in these schools for this great accomplishment, for the \nhope they give us, and for the high standard they set for all of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/14/senate-section/article/S6314-2", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6314-S6315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING THE MIA'S OF SULTAN YAQUB\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join \nme in remembering the Israeli soldiers captured by the Syrians during \nthe 1982 Israeli war in Lebanon.\n  On June 11, 1982, an Israeli unit battled with a Syrian armored unit \nin the Bekaa Valley in northeastern Lebanon. Sergeant Zachary Baumel, \nFirst Sergeant Zvi Feldman, and Corporal Yehudah Katz were captured by \nthe Syrians that day. They were identified as an Israeli tank crew, and \nreported missing in Damascus. The Israeli tank, flying the Syrian and \nPalestinian flag, was greeted with cheers from bystanders\n  Since that terrible day in 1982, the governments of Israel and the \nUnited States have been doing their utmost by working with the office \nof the International Committee of the Red Cross, the United Nations, \nand other international bodies to obtain any possible information about \nthe fate of the missing soldiers. According to the Geneva Convention, \nSyria is responsible for the fates of the Israeli soldiers because the \narea in Lebanon where the solders disappeared was continually \ncontrolled by Syria. To this day, despite promises made by the \ngovernment of Syria and by the Palestinians, very little information \nhas been released about the condition of Zachary Baumel, Zvi Feldman, \nand Yehudah Katz.\n  Monday marked the anniversary of the day that these solders were \nreported missing in action. Nineteen pain-filled years have passed \nsince their families have seen their sons, and still Syria has not \nrevealed their whereabouts nor provided any information as to their \ncondition.\n  One of these missing soldiers, Zachary Baumel is an American citizen, \nfrom my home of Brooklyn, NY. An ardent basketball fan, Zachary began \nhis studies at the Hebrew School in Boro Park. In 1979, he moved to \nIsrael with other family members and continued his education at \nYeshivat Hesder, where religious studies are integrated with army \nservice. When the war with Lebanon began, Zachary was completing his \nmilitary service and was looking forward to attending Hebrew \nUniversity, where he had been accepted to study psychology. But fate \ndecreed otherwise and on June 11, 1982, he disappeared with Zvi Feldman \nand Yehudah Katz.\n  Zachary's parents Yonah and Miriam Baumel have been relentless in \ntheir pursuit of information about Zachary and his compatriots. I have \nworked closely with the Baumels, as well as the Union of Orthodox \nJewish Congregations of America, the American Coalition for Missing \nIsraeli Soldiers, and the MIA Task Force of the Conference of \nPresidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. These groups have \nbeen at the forefront of this pursuit of justice. I want to recognize \ntheir good work and ask my colleagues to join me in supporting their \nefforts. For nineteen years, these families have been without their \nchildren. Answers are long overdue.\n  I am not only saddened by the plight of Zachary Baumel, Zvi Feldman, \nand Yehudah Katz, but I am disheartened and angered by the fact that \neven as we continue to search for answers about their welfare, we must \nadd more names to the list of those for who we have no knowledge of \ntheir location, health, or safety.\n  In a clear-cut violation of international law, three Israeli soldiers \nwere abducted by Hezbollah on October 7, 2000 while on operational duty \nalong the border fence in the Dov Mountain range along Israel's border \nwith Lebanon. The soldiers--Sergeant Adi Avitan of Tiberias, Staff \nSergeant Binyamin Avraham of Bnei Brak, and Staff Sergeant Omar Souad \nof Salma--are believed to have been wounded during the incident.\n  According to an investigation by the IDF Northern Command, Hezbollah \nterrorists set two roadside bombs, then\n\n[[Page S6315]]\n\ncrossed through a gate near the fence, pulled the three soldiers out of \ntheir jeep and fired anti-armor missiles at the empty vehicle. The \nsolders were then taken by the terrorists to the Lebanese side of the \nborder. Although the United States has called on Syria to assist in the \ntimely release of these three soldiers, no information has been given \nas to their conditions or whereabouts. The International Red Cross has \nalso been requested to intervene by attempting to arrange for a visit \nwith the three kidnapped IDF soldiers in order to ascertain their \nstatus.\n  The agony of the families of these kidnapped Israeli solders is \nextreme. They have not heard a word regarding the fate of their sons \nwho are being held captive for political ransom. We must pledge to do \nour utmost to bring these soldiers home, for the sake of peace, decency \nand humanity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/14/senate-section/article/S6315-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy last month. The \nLocal law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to current \nhate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society.\n  I want to describe a terrible crime that occurred June 20, 1993 in \nEverett, Washington. A gay man was stabbed to death by a hitchhiker who \nallegedly told friends he committed the crime because he hated \nhomosexuals. Isaiah Clarence Enault, 24, was charged with murder and is \na suspect in a stabbing assault of another gay man.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/14/senate-section/article/S6315-2", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           HONORING CLAY COUNTY LEGACY MEMORIAL AND FOUNTAIN\n\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity \nto honor the residents of Clay County, MO for their vision, harmony, \nand unity. At a time when some communities are engaged in divisive \ndebates regarding our Nation's past, Clay County residents have chosen \nto dedicate a monument and water fountain on the county courthouse lawn \nhonoring the unsung black heroes and heroines who survived slavery and \nhelped make Clay County a successful and thriving community in the \nheartland.\n  Tomorrow, Friday, June 15, the Clay County Commission and the Clay \nCounty African-American Legacy Consortium will dedicate the Legacy \nMemorial and Fountain honoring Clay County African-American pioneers \nand their contributions to this county, first in slavery, and then in \nfreedom. The location of the memorial and fountain is especially \nsignificant since slaves were once sold from the courthouse steps and \nAfrican-Americans were required to drink from separate water fountains \nin that very building.\n  The monument will list over 150 Clay County African-Americans and \ntheir contributions to this community dating back to 1800. Included in \nthe monument's listing are Vennie and Lulu Fielder. Mr. and Mrs. \nFielder both became entrepreneurs, opening Fielder Hardware and Box \nCompany in Kansas City, Missouri, and Lulu Fielder's Sandwich Shoppe. \nMrs. Lulu Fielder is now the oldest living African-American native \nresident of Clay County at the young age of 102. Mrs. Fielder will take \nthe first ceremonial drink from the water fountain at tomorrow's \ncelebration. And with that drink, Lulu Fielder will epitomize the words \ninscribed on the monument, ``come, drink, all who thirst for freedom; \nthe water fountain will no longer separate us as a people.''\n  Congratulations to the Clay County Commission, the Clay County \nAfrican-American Legacy Consortium, and all Clay County residents. \nThank you for making me proud to be a Missourian.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/14/senate-section/article/S6315-3", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              NATIONAL ASSESSMENT OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS\n\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, in education everyone claims to be for \nhigh standards. That's the good news. But a lot of folks only want to \nbe measured by their own standards, and they don't have a very good way \nof knowing whether their standards are high or, more importantly, \nwhether they are high enough.\n  That is why I am for measuring educational progress in America by \nhaving each State use its own standards and tests and then confirming \nprogress by using a high-quality back-up examination. The National \nAssessment of Educational Progress is just such an instrument. It will \nhelp us get more information about achievement in our States and \nprovide an independent second opinion that our student achievement \nprogress is reaching all of our students and that we are not raising \nour scores just by getting a few more of our better students to do \nbetter.\n  In the past ten years 49 States have used the National Assessment in \none form or another. This has not led to a national curriculum and it \nis not going to. On average, more than 40 States have participated in \nany one year. Last year the State school superintendent or commissioner \nin 48 States signed up to participate.\n  In the National Assessment's 30 years, never has a State or district \nexpressed concern that it was being coerced to teach to the National \nAssessment tests. In fact, each test is developed through a national \nconsensus process in which State standards and assessments are \nconsidered. Before deciding to participate, each State reviews the \nNational Assessment content. State participation in the test \ndevelopment process ensures that the National Assessment is a fair \nrepresentation of the material in math, reading and other subjects that \nstates already believe is important to test.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/14/senate-section/article/S6315-4", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6315-S6316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MISSOURI BOYS STATE\n\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, Saturday, June 16 starts the 62nd \nsession of Missouri Boys State. Founded in 1938 by the Missouri \nAmerican Legion, Missouri Boys State has educated over 33,000 young men \non the basic principles of democracy. For more than 60 years, Missouri \nBoys State has lived up to its motto and has made an ``investment in \nour State's greatest resource--the youth of Missouri.''\n  Boys State was started in 1934 in Illinois by Dr. Hays Kennedy and \nHarold Card, and was designed to teach democratic ideals to America's \nyouth. The four founding members of Missouri Boys State, Jerry F. \nDuggan, Harry M. Gambrel, Dr. Truman L. Ingle, and A.B. Weyer, did not \nrealize that Missouri's program would develop into one of the most \nsuccessful and prestigious programs in the country for youth \ninvolvement. The Missouri Boys State program has become one of the most \nrevered honors bestowed upon high school boys in Missouri.\n  The first session occurred in Fulton, MO in 1938 with 129 young men. \nThis year's session is expected to draw over 1,000 participants \nincluding over 100 counselors. From that very first session in 1938 to \ntoday, the same message rings true--``Democracy depends on me!'' Boys \nState continues to stress the important aspects of serving the public \nand one's community.\n  The success of Missouri Boys State continues today. In July of 1999, \na high school student from Columbia, Missouri, Ryan Rippel, was elected \nPresident of Boys Nation. Boys Nation, sponsored annually by the \nAmerican Legion, is a program by which select students from across the \nnation gain first-hand experience in how our federal government works \nthrough mock Senate activities.\n  Missouri Boys State has had wide community and public support. Over \n500 civic organizations and individuals contribute to the success of \nthis program. A memorial trust was established in 1982 to ensure the \ncontinuation of Missouri Boys State. The Missouri Boys State \nScholarship fund was established in 1993 to provide a renewable, 4-year \ncollege scholarship for the participant that earns the ``Citizen of the \nWeek'' honor. And the Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholarship program was \nestablished in 1989 to ensure the continued participation of minority \nstudents.\n  Missouri Boys State plays an integral role in developing our youth in \nMissouri. Therefore, I ask that my colleagues recognize all that Boys \nState\n\n[[Page S6316]]\n\ndoes for our young men and wish them well as they open their 2001 \nsession.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/14/senate-section/article/S6316-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, today I would like to recognize an \noutstanding Floridian, Mr. Herbert Saffir. Herb Saffir graduated from \nthe Georgia Institute of Technology in 1940 with a bachelor's degree in \ncivil engineering. He served in the Army during World War II and worked \nas an engineer with federal agencies and private-sector firms in New \nYork, Ohio, Tennessee, and Virginia before moving to South Florida in \n1947. For the next 12 years he was an assistant county engineer for \nMiami-Dade County. In 1959, he started his own structural engineering \nfirm, Herbert Saffir Consulting Engineers, in Coral Gables, FL.\n  Herb Saffir is considered one of the foremost experts on engineering \nbuildings to resist damage by high winds. His expertise was so integral \nin the formulating of the building codes in South Florida that he is \nknown as the ``father of the Miami building code.'' Although this is a \ngreat achievement, Herb Saffir's accolades go even further.\n  In 1972, Robert Simpson, former Director of the National Hurricane \nCenter had difficulty describing to emergency management and disaster \nofficials what kind of damage to expect from approaching hurricanes. It \nwas determined that a scale was needed to give disaster officials an \nidea of what to expect from a storm. Herb Saffir was enlisted to work \nwith Simpson on this project. Together they created the Saffir-Simpson \nDamage Potential Scale, which established the five categories of \nhurricane severity. The Saffir-Simpson Scale is still used today and is \na vital tool to assess the possible destruction associated with an \napproaching hurricane.\n  When Hurricane Andrew tore through Florida in August 1992, weather \nforecasters relayed information on the powerful storm to concerned \ncitizens using the ratings system. But, Herb Saffir was not satisfied \nto just lend his name to the efforts to mitigate damage from Hurricane \nAndrew. He also lent a hand. Using his vast engineering knowledge and \nexperience, Mr. Saffir was integral in the rebuilding of South Florida. \nHe was recognized for his efforts with the Florida Engineering \nSociety's Engineer of the Year Award in 1994.\n  Mr. Saffir work continues to be recognized today. The American \nSociety of Civil Engineers recently recognized Mr. Saffir for his \nresearch and development of wind-damage analysis on structures, and for \nthe creation of the Saffir-Simpson Scale now used extensively by \nemergency management organizations as far away as Australia. In fact, \nthe National Hurricane Center described Mr. Saffir as ``a national \ntreasure.''\n  Herb Saffir is a remarkable American and a credit to the State of \nFlorida. It brings me great joy to recognize his accomplishments \ntoday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/14/senate-section/article/S6316-3", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE ROBERT B. PIRIE, JR.\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an \noutstanding public servant, Robert B. Pirie, Jr., as he completes more \nthan 7 years of continuous service within the civilian leadership of \nthe Department of the Navy, first as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, \nInstallations and Environment, then as the Under Secretary of the Navy, \nand finally as Acting Secretary of the Navy. In each capacity, he \nworked tirelessly to serve America and our Navy and Marine Corps. His \ntime in the Pentagon was the pinnacle of a public service career \nspanning fifty years.\n  Secretary Pirie is a 1955 Naval Academy graduate, whose achievements \nas a midshipman propelled him to a Rhodes Scholarship. He served 20 \nyears on active duty, a military career that culminated in command-at-\nsea aboard a nuclear attack submarine. Secretary Pirie went on to \nprovide exceptional public service as a Deputy Assistant Secretary of \nDefense in the Carter Administration.\n  When he returned to the Department of the Navy seven and a-half years \nago, his confident leadership and far-reaching vision helped the Navy \nnavigate through many complex issues. Whether leading the Department's \nefforts to conduct critical training at the Atlantic Fleet Weapons \nTraining Facility at Vieques, Puerto Rico, or increasing force \nprotection for Sailors and Marines in the aftermath of the USS COLE \nterrorist attack, or addressing the encroachment issues that complicate \nour operational and training ranges, Robert Pirie's leadership has been \nvital to the readiness and success of our country's military forces.\n  Secretary Pirie provided exceptional advice, support and guidance to \nthe Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Navy, the Chief of Naval \nOperations, and the Commandant of the Marine Corps. His keen insight, \nrelentless dedication, and extraordinary talent have contributed \nsignificantly to building and maintaining the world's best-trained, \nbest-equipped, and best-prepared Navy and Marine Corps. His vision has \npositively shaped the future readiness and capabilities of the fleet in \nways that will resonate for many years.\n  It is a pleasure to recognize Secretary Pirie for his many \ncontributions in a life devoted to our nation's security as he leaves \nthe Department of the Navy. I know my colleagues join me in wishing him \nand his wife Joan much happiness and fair winds and following seas as \nthey begin a new chapter in their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/14/senate-section/article/S6316-4", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6316-S6317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN HONOR OF BARBARA L. BAILEY\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak today in memory \nof Mrs. Barbara L. Bailey, a great and gracious lady, the first lady of \nConnecticut Democratic politics, who passed away this past Monday.\n  As my colleague Senator Clinton said when she introduced Mrs. Bailey \nat the White House a few years back, Mrs. Bailey ``has been a stalwart \nof the Democratic Party in Connecticut and progressive politics . . . \nin the country.'' I first met Barbara Bailey when I was writing my \nsenior thesis at college on her husband, John Bailey, former Democratic \nNational Committee Chairman under President Kennedy and legendary \nConnecticut political leader.\n  Mrs. Bailey was an astute political advisor and partner to her \nhusband. She was known as a gracious host to politicians at all levels \nof government. Mrs. Bailey entertained such political luminaries as \nPresident John F. Kennedy and Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey and \nmany, many others.\n  After her husband died in 1975 Mrs. Bailey continued to follow \nDemocratic politics closely and actively. In fact, a few years ago four \ngenerations of Baileys gathered at the White House when Barbara spoke \nabout the importance of health care and introduced President Clinton at \nthe White House on Mother's Day.\n  Mrs. Bailey has also spent her life devoted to public service, \nespecially on issues concerning women. Just last month, the 93-year-old \nMrs. Bailey received a lifetime achievement award from the Ladies \nAuxiliary of Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center in\n\n[[Page S6317]]\n\nHartford. She also spent ten years as a trustee of the University of \nConnecticut.\n  Mrs. Bailey is known to Connecticut as the matriarch of a \ndistinguished political family. Her family has always been most \nimportant to her and I know it was a joy for her to see her children \nand grandchildren continue the tradition of civic involvement that she \nand her husband believed in so deeply. Her daughter, Barbara Bailey \nKennelly, is the former U.S. Representative from Connecticut's first \ndistrict and has run for Governor of the Nutmeg State. Her son, Jack \nBailey, is currently the chief State's attorney. And just this summer \nMrs. Bailey's grandson, Austin Perkins, represented Connecticut as a \ndelegate to the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, CA.\n  Barbara Bailey's death is a loss for me personally and for the whole \nof Connecticut. We will remember her fondly as a gracious woman of \nprinciple, a champion of good causes and a beloved mother, grandmother \nand friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/14/senate-section/article/S6317-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF MINNEAPOLIS METAL WORKERS \n                               LODGE 459\n\n Mr. DAYTON.

SPRINGER\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to honor George C. Springer, \nwho is stepping down this month after an unprecedented 11 two-year \nterms as the President of the Connecticut Federation of Educational and \nProfessional Employees, formerly the Connecticut State Federation of \nTeachers. George will remain active in the union as the recently-\nappointed director of the American Federation of Teachers' Northeast \nRegion.\n  I mentioned the change in the union's name because it highlights \nGeorge's unceasing efforts on behalf of its members. In 1979, when \nGeorge began his leadership of the union, it had about 11,000 members, \nalmost all of whom were teachers. Today, the union has 24,000 members, \nincluding teachers and other professional school-related employees, \nState and municipal employees, health care professionals, and higher \neducation faculty. Twenty-two years ago, the union had only one full-\ntime officer, two clerical employees, and a handful of field \nrepresentatives. Today, it has three full-time officers, a staff of 15, \nand numerous field representatives. George rightly is proud of the \nincreased diversity of his union.\n  George also ought to be proud of what his advocacy has brought--not \nonly benefits for union members, but also the ability for them to do \ntheir jobs better, to better serve the children and all citizens of \nConnecticut. George tirelessly has fought for greater involvement for \nthe union and its members in legislative and policy matters. I think it \nis especially appropriate, as we prepare to complete debate on \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, \nto talk about how public education in Connecticut has changed for the \nbetter during George's tenure.\n  In 1979, teacher pay was poor, the gap between the quality of schools \nfor wealthy children and those for poor children was great, and \nrelations between the union and school boards was contentious. Today, \nteacher salaries and student achievement in Connecticut are among the \nbest in the country, the State is working to provide a quality \neducation for all children, and the union frequently works hand in hand \nwith school management to improve the school system.\n  But, George's influence has not been limited to Connecticut, or even \nthe United States. As President, George has represented the union \naround the country and around the world, in such places as Brazil, \nBelgium, Hong Kong, Japan, and Sweden. He also has served as an \nelection observer in South Africa and Nigeria. I have no doubt that \nfrom New Britain, Connecticut, where he taught for 20 years, to the \nmany places he has been around the world, George has left his mark. Nor \ndo I doubt that he will continue to leave his mark, as he works hard at \nthe AFT to better connect State and local affiliates with the national \norganization and with each other.\n  Tonight, George's fellow union members, other friends, and his family \nare gathering in Hartford to celebrate his leadership of the union. I \nregret that I cannot join them in person, but certainly I join them in \nspirit.\n  It has been my privilege to know George for many years, and I offer \nmy admiration and gratitude for his work, and best wishes as he moves \non to new challenges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/14/senate-section/article/S6317-3", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/14/senate-section/article/S6317-4", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/14/senate-section/article/S6317-5", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          enrolled bill signed\n\n  At 9:19 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 1914.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to authorize \ndisability retirement to be granted posthumously for members of the \nArmed Forces who die in the line of duty while on active duty, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nInouye and Senator Hutchinson to offer legislation on a very important \nissue for those military men and women who serve our country every day. \nOur current military retirement\n\n[[Page S6320]]\n\nsystem, I have come to understand, has a serious flaw on it.\n  We often memorialize those soldiers, sailors, and airmen who died in \ncombat, but too often we forget that service men and women die \nfrequently during daily operations or while training. In the past five \nyears, 2,206 military families lost their spouse, father or mother \nwhile serving their country. In just the past year we have mourned the \nloss of the sailors on the USS Cole, Air Force pilots in Scotland, and \nsoldiers in helicopter crashes in Hawaii, and Vietnam. What is not \nfully understood is that their families do not receive their full \nretirement pensions in many cases. Because service members are not \nvested in their retirement system until the day they retire active duty \npersonnel do not qualify for a retirement pension unless the services \nmedically retire them before death. This has caused hardships to \nfamilies and necessitated extraordinary efforts by commanders and \nmedical and manpower personnel.\n  Most Americans, and even many in uniform, do not understand that this \naffects those with one year of service as well as those with thirty. If \nthese military members were in the Federal service system, or a \npoliceman in Arizona, their family would be able to receive part of \ntheir pension. This bill will correct that inequity by amending \nSections 1222 and 1448 of Title 10 U.S.C. and allowing members of the \narmed forces on active duty who die while serving in the line of duty \nto be posthumously retired. In addition, the bill would allow the \nservices to ensure the family is given the best choice of benefits \nbased on their individual situation. This is the least we can do when \nthey make the ultimate sacrifice for their country.\n  Though we have not been involved in a major conflict in more than ten \nyears, every day we deploy our military to many more places than we did \njust a decade ago. The day-to-day activities of our armed forces are \ninherently dangerous. If we are going to maintain and recruit a quality \nforce, we must reassure those who serve that we are going to provide \nfor their family. I believe that Brigadier General William Caldwell, \nAssistant Division Commander of the 25th Infantry Division, said it \nbest, ``Everything we do is complex.'' BG Caldwell made this comment \nafter the crash of two helicopters in Hawaii that killed six members of \nthe 25th Infantry Division. That sums up the situation perfectly.\n  This bill will be a step in the right direction and is a way to help \nrepay our debt to our military and their families. Not only is it the \nright thing and fair thing to do, but during these times of increased \ndeployments and personnel shortages, it is in our national interest to \ncontinue to show our dedicated service members that we appreciate their \nsacrifice and commitment.\n  I commend the Senator from Hawaii for his support on this issue and \nurge other Senators to join us in this effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1037\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to improve \naccess to tax-exempt debt for small nonprofit health care and \neducational institutions; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Health and \nHigher Education Facilities Improvement Act of 2001. This legislation \nwill help small non-profit health and educational institutions more \neffectively finance the cost of essential services, and lead to new \nfacility construction. By modifying the laws that restrict \ndeductibility or ``bank financing for small non-profit organizations \nthat need it the most: small local hospitals and colleges.\n  The Tax Reform Act of 1986 unintentionally discriminated against \nsmall non-profit educational and health care facilities that want to \nsell small amounts of tax-exempt debt to community banks. Before 1986, \nbanks and financial institutions could deduct the interest incurred to \ncarry tax-exempt bonds. This allowed banks to purchase tax-exempt bonds \nat attractive rates. The 1986 tax act repealed bank deductibility, but \nan exception was retained for small governmental issuers that issue \nbonds of $10 million or less each year.\n  This exception was designed to preserve bank deductibility for small \nlocal governments, but does not help small non-profit institutions. The \nsmall issuer exception to be of little value in many States, like \nVermont where statewide health care and higher education bond issuing \nauthorities typically issue many millions of dollars of debt each year. \nThe legislation I am introducing today will modify the small issuer \nexception by granting bond issuers the right to apply the small issuer \nexception at the level of the ultimate beneficiary of the funding. \nConsequently, a small college or health\n\n[[Page S6321]]\n\ncare facility borrowing less than $10 million in tax-exempt debt in any \none year could elect tax-exempt status for that debt, even if it is \nissued by a statewide authority. This would make the debt more \nattractive to local banks, and could result in significant savings for \nbeneficiary institutions over the life of the bond.\n  The Health and Higher Education Facilities Improvement Act of 2001 \nfocuses the benefit of the small issuer exemption on smaller non-\nprofits, without regard to whether the bond issuer is a government \nentity issuing more than $10 million in bonds per year. Small non-\nprofits are important community institutions; they stand to benefit \nfrom greater access to tax-exempt debt. Wall Street and large money \ncenter banks may have little interest in small amounts of debt from \nsmall institutions. The bank across the street from a local college or \nhealth care clinic, however, may have greater confidence and insight \ninto the community value of the institution. This bill would allow \nthose banks to carry tax-exempt debt at attractive rates and maintain \ncommitments to the people and institutions in their local communities.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SHELBY:\n  S. 1040. A bill to promote freedom, fairness, and economic \nopportunity for families by reducing the power and reach of the Federal \nestablishment; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, Congress recently passed a tax bill that \nprovides much-needed relief for all Americans. While I am pleased that \nthe tax bill included marriage penalty relief, a reduction in marginal \nrates and a phase out of the estate tax, these changes unfortunately \nincrease the tax code's complexity. Furthermore, despite the positive \nchanges made this year, the current code still retains the alternative \nminimum tax, the taxation of Social Security benefits, and marginal \nrates that increase with income.\n  I rise today to introduce legislation that takes tax reform to the \nnext level and addresses the fundamental problems of the current code. \nMy bill accomplishes this by repealing the current Internal Revenue \nCode and replacing it with a flat tax, where all taxpayers pay the same \nrate.\n  As with current law, not all wage earners will pay a Federal income \ntax under a flat tax. In order to assist lower income Americans, I have \nincluded large standard deductions. For example, a family of four would \nneed to make more than $35,200 before paying a single penny in taxes.\n  Some argue that it's fair to tax wealthier people at higher rates. I \nbelieve that nothing can be further from the truth. Not only is this \ntype of tax policy fundamentally unfair, it also prevents our economy \nfrom realizing its full potential.\n  A flat tax does not mean that a school teacher will have the same tax \nliability as Bill Gates. The principles of math dictate that people who \nmake more will still pay more in taxes with a single rate. The \ndifference is that with a flat tax those who earn more will no longer \nbe penalized by rising marginal rates.\n  My bill also increases tax fairness by eliminating itemized \ndeductions and credits. While these tax breaks benefit those who are \nlucky enough to claim them, they consequently hurt the taxpayers who \nare not. As a result, people with the same yearly salaries can pay very \ndifferent Federal income taxes depending on whether they have children, \nthey decide to own or rent a home, or decide to finance a family \nvacation through a credit card or a home equity loan.\n  Over time the tax code has evolved from a way to collect Federal \nrevenue into a way to encourage and reward behavior the government \ndeems important. I believe that the American people are intelligent \nenough that they do not need the Federal Government dangling a carrot \nin front of them when they make life decisions. Furthermore, I believe \nthat people should not be punished for deciding to make these decisions \nin ways that are contrary to what the government decides is right.\n  Simplification is yet another reason our country needs the flat tax. \nThe National Taxpayer Advocate cited complications in the tax code as \nthe number one issue taxpayers faced in 2001. As the IRS publishes more \nand more regulations, and new tax laws are enacted, the complexity of \nthe tax code will only grow.\n  The complexity of the tax code forces many Americans to seek the \nadvice of tax professionals at the cost of many millions of dollars. No \ntax code should be so puzzling that the average person has to spend his \nhard-earned money to hire a tax preparer or an accountant. Those who \ndecide to brave the tax code and file their own returns do not fare \nbetter. These people face conflicting IRS advice and many hours of \ncompleting confusing tax forms. All of these needless hassles results \nin taxpayer frustration and apathy and less time spent on more \nproductive endeavors.\n  Under the flat tax, a taxpayers would be able to be quickly and \naccurately file their returns. There would be no itemized deductions or \ncredits to calculate, no capital gains tabulations and no alternative \nminimum tax. With this new simplicity, taxpayers would be able to \ncomplete their personal income tax return in virtually no time at all \ncompared to the 13 hours the IRS estimates it takes to complete a 1040 \nform.\n  I understand that my bill is a major change from the current tax \ncode. Many people have become complacent with the status quo. Still \nothers enjoy using the tax to implement social policy. I on the other \nhand believe though that a tax code should have one purpose and that is \nto collect revenue.\n  I hope that my colleagues will begin to seriously look at \nalternatives to the current code. The legislation I have introduced \ntoday is an excellent opportunity to bring this debate to the floor of \nthe Senate. The combination of freedom, simplicity and fairness make \nthe flat tax the ultimate goal of true tax reform. I urge my colleagues \nto join me in support of meaningful and comprehensive tax reform.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 1041. A bill to establish a program for an information \nclearinghouse to increase public access to defibrillation in schools; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nMaine, Senator Collins, to introduce the Automatic Defibrillators in \nAdam's Memory Act, or the ADAM Act, which would help schools across \nAmerica implement public access defibrillation programs.\n  I am especially proud that the concept of this legislation came from \nmy home state of Wisconsin, where a similar program has saved the lives \nof a number of students.\n  Heart disease is not only a problem among adults. I recently learned \nthe story of Adam Lemel, a 17-year-old high school student and a star \nbasketball and tennis player in southeastern Wisconsin. Tragically, \nduring a timeout while playing basketball at a neighboring Milwaukee \nhigh school, Adam suffered sudden cardiac arrest, and died before the \nparamedics arrived.\n  The following November, a Milwaukee Technical High School football \nplayer died of Sudden Cardiac Arrest while playing basketball with his \nfriends. And in April 2000, two more Milwaukee-area deaths were \nattributed to sudden cardiac arrest: a Marquette University senior and \na visiting 12-year old from Illinois who was playing basketball.\n  These stories are incredibly tragic. These young people had their \nwhole lives before them, and could have been saved. In fact, we have \nseen a number of examples in Wisconsin where early CPR and access to \ndefibrillation have saved lives.\n  Seventy miles away from Milwaukee, a 14-year-old boy, collapsed while \nplaying basketball. Within three minutes, the emergency team arrived \nand began CPR. Within five minutes of his collapse, the paramedics used \nan automated external defibrillator to jump start his heart. Not only \nhas this young man survived, they have identified his father and \nbrother to have the same heart condition. To prevent cardiac deaths, \ninternal defibrillators were implanted in both men.\n  I also recently met Heather Rahn who on March 19, was at a church \nconcert in the gymnasium of Good Hope Christian Academy. She told her \nfriends that her heart was racing, and\n\n[[Page S6322]]\n\nshe felt nervous. In the middle of running across the gym, she \ncollapsed on the ground from cardiac arrest. She was down for about \nthree and a half minutes when an ambulance arrived, bringing a \ndefibrillator that would save her life. It took two shocks to bring her \nback.\n  These tragic stories help to underscore three issues. First, although \ncardiac arrest is most common among adults, it can occur at any age, \neven in apparently healthy children and adolescents. Second, early \nintervention is essential, a combination of CPR and use of AEDs can \nsave lives. Third, some individuals who are at risk for sudden cardiac \narrest, can be identified to prevent cardiac arrest.\n  After Adam Lemel tragically suffered his cardiac arrest two years \nago, his friend David Ellis joined forces with Children's Hospital of \nWisconsin to initiate Project ADAM to: bring CPR training and public \naccess defibrillation into schools, educate communities about \npreventing sudden cardiac deaths, and save lives.\n  Today, Project ADAM has introduced AEDs into several Wisconsin \nschools, and has been a model for programs in Washington, Florida, \nMichigan and elsewhere.\n  I had the chance to visit with Dave Ellis, Adam's parents, and the \ndedicated people at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, especially Karen \nBauer and Dr. Stu Berger. And let me tell you, there are no better \nadvocates for saving the lives of cardiac arrest victims. I want to \ncommend them for their service, and efforts to save the lives of sudden \ncardiac arrest victims.\n  I strongly believe that the Federal Government should support local \nefforts to equip more people in our communities, including younger \ngenerations, with the necessary skills to deal with life-threatening \nemergencies like cardiac arrest. And there is no better way to support \nlocal efforts than by following the lead of a successful local effort \nsuch as Project ADAM.\n  Over two hundred twenty thousand Americans die each year of sudden \ncardiac arrest, including between 5000 and 7000 children. About 50,000 \nof these victims lives could be saved each year if more people \nimplemented the ``Chain of Survival,'' which includes an immediate call \nto 911, early CPR and defibrillation, and early advanced life support.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control, the number of sudden \ncardiac deaths of people between the ages of 15 and 34 years old has \nincreased over 10 percent in the past 10 years. The research also shows \nthat sudden cardiac death has increased by 30 percent in young women.\n  Without any training, kids would never know what to do in the face of \nsuch an emergency.\n  As a matter of fact, many adults wouldn't know what to do either. \nThat lack of knowledge is a break in the chain of survival, but that \nbreak can be repaired through the right training. A number of \nlocalities have pushed for increased CPR training and public access to \ndefibrillation in schools.\n  The ADAM Act will help strengthen the Chain by establishing a \nnational Project ADAM resource center. The center would provide schools \nwith information to help them implement public access defibrillation \nprograms.\n  The ADAM Center would also provide support to CPR and AED training \nprograms, and help foster new community partnerships among public and \nprivate organizations to promote public access to defibrillation in \nschools.\n  Finally, the ADAM Act would create a way to track cardiac arrest \namong children and to conduct further research into this serious health \nthreat.\n  This clearinghouse responds to the growing number of schools that \nhave the desire to set up a public access defibrillation program, but \noften don't know where to start.\n  If the ADAM Act becomes law, schools across the country will have a \nplace to turn as they work to establish public access to defibrillation \nprograms in more schools across America. The Project ADAM resource \ncenter will help schools give victims of cardiac arrest a fighting \nchance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 1042. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve \nbenefits for Filipino veterans of World War II, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Filipino Veterans' \nBenefits Improvement Act of 2001.

We are on the top of the \nworld in terms of economic power and military might, and much of this \nunprecedented success is due to the tremendous sacrifices made by our \nfighting forces during World War II. We trampled tyranny in Europe and \nin the Pacific, and when we raised our flag proudly over hostile lands, \nwe were greeted enthusiastically by the millions we liberated from the \ngrasp of terrible aggression.\n  I take this opportunity today to remind everyone of an injustice that \npersists as a blemish on one of history's greatest success stories.\n  The Philippines became a United States possession in 1898, when it \nwas ceded from Spain following the Spanish-American War. In 1934, the \nCongress enacted the Philippine Independence Act, Public Law 73-127, \nwhich provided a 10-year time frame for the independence of the \nPhilippines. Between 1934 and final independence in 1946, the United \nStates retained certain powers over the Philippines, including the \nright to call all military forces organized by the newly-formed \nCommonwealth government into the service of the United States Armed \nForces.\n  On July 26, 1941, President Roosevelt issued an Executive Order \ncalling members of the Philippine Commonwealth Army into the service of \nthe United States Armed Forces of the Far East. Under this order, \nFilipinos were entitled to full veterans' benefits. More than 100,000 \nFilipinos volunteered for the Philippine Commonwealth Army and fought \nalongside the United States Armed Forces.\n  The United States Armed Forces of the Far East fought to reclaim \ncontrol of the entire Western Pacific. Filipinos, under the command of \nGeneral Douglas MacArthur, fought in the front lines of the Battle of \nCorregidor and at Bataan. They served in Okinawa, on occupied mainland \nJapan, and in Guam. They were part of what became known as the Bataan \nDeath March, and were held and tortured as prisoners of war. Through \nthese hardships, the men of the Philippine Commonwealth Army remained \nloyal to the United States during the Japanese occupation of the \nPhilippines, and the valiant guerilla war they waged against the \nJapanese helped to delay the Japanese advance across the Pacific.\n  Despite all of their sacrifices, on February 18, 1946, Congress \nbetrayed these veterans by enacting the Rescission Act of 1946 and \ndeclaring the service performed by the Philippine Commonwealth Army \nveterans as not ``active service,'' thus denying many benefits to which \nthese veterans were entitled.\n  Then, shortly after Japan's surrender, Congress enacted the Armed \nForces Voluntary Recruitment Act of 1945 for the purpose of sending \nAmerican troops to occupy enemy lands, and to oversee military \ninstallations at various overseas locations. A provision included in \nthe Recruitment Act called for the enlistment of Philippine citizens to \nconstitute a new body of Philippine Scouts. The New Scouts were \nauthorized to receive pay and allowances for services performed \nthroughout the Western Pacific. Although hostilities had ceased, \nwartime service of the New Philippine Scouts continued as a matter of \nlaw until the end of 1946.\n  On May 27, 1946, the Congress enacted the Second Supplemental Surplus \nAppropriation Rescission Act, which included a provision to limit \nveterans' benefits to Filipinos. This provision duplicated the language \nthat had eliminated veterans' benefits under the First Rescission Act, \nand placed similar restrictions on veterans of the New Philippine \nScouts. Thus, the Filipino veterans that fought in the service of the \nUnited States during World War II have been precluded from receiving \nmost veterans' benefits that had been available to them before 1946, \nand that are available to all other veterans of our armed forces \nregardless of race, national origin, or citizenship status.\n\n[[Page S6323]]\n\n  The Congress tried to rectify the wrong committed against the \nFilipino veterans of World War II by amending the Nationality Act of \n1940 to grant the veterans the privilege of becoming United States \ncitizens for having served in the United States Armed Forces of the Far \nEast.\n\n  The law expired at the end of 1946, but not before the United States \nhad withdrawn its sole naturalization examiner from the Philippines for \na nine-month period. This effectively denied Filipino veterans the \nopportunity to become citizens during this nine-month window. Forty-\nfive years later, under the Immigration Act of 1990, certain Filipino \nveterans who served during World War II became eligible for United \nStates citizenship. Between November, 1990, and February, 1995, \napproximately 24,000 veterans took advantage of this opportunity and \nbecame United States citizens.\n  For many years, Filipino veterans of World War II, who are now in \ntheir twilight years, have sought to correct the injustice caused by \nthe Rescission Acts by seeking equal treatment of their valiant \nmilitary service in our Armed Forces. They stood up to the same \naggression that American-born soldiers did, and many Filipinos \nsacrificed their lives in the war for democracy and liberty.\n  Heroes should never be forgotten or ignored, so let us not turn our \nbacks on those who sacrificed so much. Many of the Filipinos who have \nfought so hard for us have been honored with American citizenship, but \nlet us now work to repay all of these brave men for their sacrifices by \nproviding them the full veterans' benefits they have earned.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 1043. A bill to extend the deadline for commencement of \nconstruction of a hydroelectric project in the State of Nevada; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I am introducing a simple bill that \nwould extend the deadline under the Federal Power Act for the \ncommencement of construction of the Blue Diamond hydroelectric project \nin southern Nevada. The bill will allow the Federal Government to \nextend the project permit for as many as three consecutive two-year \nperiods. At this time, serious concerns remain about the environmental \nimpacts of the project and where power generated at the facility would \nbe sold. These important questions merit additional dialogue and \nintroduction of this bill provides for further examination of this \nproject.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself, Mr. Warner, Mr. Allen, and Ms. \n        Mikulski):\n  S. 1044. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nprovide assistance for nutrient removal technologies to States in the \nChesapeake Bay watershed; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Warner, and Mr. \n        Allen):\n  S. 1045. A bill to amend the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration Authorization Act of 1992 to revise and enhance \nauthorities, and to authorize appropriations, for the Chesapeake Bay \nOffice, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing two measures to \nexpand restoration and protection efforts in the Chesapeake Bay \nwatershed. Joining me in sponsoring these measures are my colleagues \nSenators Warner, Allen, and Mikulski.\n  Nearly two decades ago, the Bay area States and the Federal \nGovernment signed an historic agreement to work together to restore the \nChesapeake Bay, our Nation's largest estuary and one of the most \nproductive ecosystems in the world. In 1987, the Governors of Maryland, \nVirginia, Pennsylvania, the Chesapeake Bay Commission, the Mayor of the \nDistrict of Columbia and the Administrator of the EPA, on behalf of the \nFederal Government, reaffirmed their commitment to that compact and \nagreed to 29 specific goals and action plans including the \nunprecedented goal of a 40 percent reduction of nitrogen and \nphosphorous loads to the main stem of the Bay by the year 2000. Last \nyear, the State and the Federal Government conducted an extensive \nevaluation of cleanup progress since the 1980s and determined that, \ndespite important advances, efforts must be redoubled to restore the \nintegrity of the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem. A new Chesapeake 2000 \nagreement was signed to serve as a blueprint for the restoration effort \nover the next decade.\n  To meet the goals established in the new agreement, it is estimated \nthat the local, State and Federal Governments must invest $8.5 billion \nover the course of the next ten years. Thousands of acres of watershed \nproperty must be preserved, buffer zones to protect rivers and streams \nneed to be created, and pollution from all sources will have to be \nfurther reduced. While $8.5 billion seems like an enormous sum, we \nshould remember that the health of Chesapeake is vital not only to the \nmore than 15 million people who live in the watershed, but to the \nnation. The Chesapeake Bay watershed is one of our Nation's and the \nworld's greatest natural resources covering 64,000 square miles within \nsix States. It is a world-class fishery that still produces a \nsignificant portion of the fin fish and shellfish catch in the United \nStates. It provides vital habitat for living resources, including more \nthan 3600 species of plants, fish and animals. It is a major resting \narea for migratory waterfowls and birds along the Atlantic including \nmany endangered and threatened species. It is also a one-of-a-kind \nrecreational asset enjoyed by millions of people, a major commercial \nwaterway and shipping center for much of the eastern United States, and \nprovides jobs for thousands of people. In short, the Chesapeake Bay is \na magnificent, multifaceted resource worthy of the highest levels of \nprotection and restoration.\n  Over the years, human activities have profoundly impacted the Bay. \nUntreated sewage, deforestation, toxic chemicals, runoff and increased \ndevelopment have degraded the Bay's water quality and contributed to \nthe decline of such key species as oysters and blue crabs and the \nunderwater grasses they favor for habitat. We have lost not only \nthousands of jobs in the fishing industry but much of the wilderness \nthat defined the watershed. By the year 2020, an additional three \nmillion people are expected to settle in the watershed and this growth \ncould eclipse the nutrient reduction and habitat protection gains of \nthe past. Not meeting the investment needs of the next 10 years risks \nreversing all that has been achieved over the past two decades in \ncleaning up the Bay.\n  The first measure we are introducing would establish a grant program \nin the Environmental Protection Agency to support the installation of \nnutrient reduction technologies at major wastewater treatment \nfacilities in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Despite important water \nquality improvements over the past decade, nutrient over-enrichment \nremains the most serious pollution problem facing the Bay. The \noverabundance of the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorous continues to \nrob the Bay of life sustaining oxygen. Recent modeling of EPA's Bay \nProgram has found that total nutrient discharges must be reduced by \nmore than 35 percent from current levels to restore the Chesapeake Bay \nand its major tributaries to health. To do so, nitrogen discharges from \nall sources must be reduced drastically below current levels. Annual \nnitrogen discharges into the Bay will need to be cut by at least 110 \nmillion pounds from the current 300 million pounds to less than 190 \nmillion pounds. Municipal wastewater treatment plants, in particular, \nwill have to reduce nitrogen discharges by nearly 75 percent.\n  There are 288 major wastewater treatment plants in the Chesapeake Bay \nwatershed: Pennsylvania, 124, Maryland, 62, Virginia, 70, New York, 18, \nDelaware, 3, Washington, D.C., 2, and West Virginia, 9. These plants \ncontribute about 60 million pounds of nitrogen per year, one fifth, of \nthe total loads of nitrogen to the Bay. Upgrading these plants with \nnutrient removal technologies to achieve nitrogen reductions of 3 mg/\nliter would remove 46 million pounds of nitrogen in the Bay each year \nor 40 percent of the total nitrogen reductions needed. Nutrient removal \ntechnologies have other benefits as well, they provide significant \nsavings in energy usage, 20 to 30 percent, in chemical usage, more than \n50 percent, and in the amount of sludge produced, five to 15 percent. \nThey are one of the\n\n[[Page S6324]]\n\nmost cost-effective methods of reducing nutrients discharged to the \nBay.\n  My legislation would provide grants for 55 percent of the capital \ncost of upgrading all 288 plants with nutrient removal technologies \ncapable of achieving nitrogen reductions of 3 mg/liter. The total cost \nof these upgrades is estimated at $1.2 billion, with a federal share of \n$660 million. Any publically owned wastewater treatment plant which has \na permitted design capacity to threat an annual average of 0.5 million \ngallons per day within the Chesapeake Bay watershed portion of New \nYork, Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, Delaware, Virginia and the \nDistrict of Columbia would be eligible to receive these grants. As a \nsignatory to the Chesapeake Bay Agreement, the EPA has an important \nresponsibility to assist the states with financing these water \ninfrastructure needs.\n  The second measure would reauthorize the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric, NOAA, Chesapeake Bay Office. I first introduced a similar \nmeasure in June, 2000, but unfortunately it was not acted upon prior to \nthe adjournment of the 106th Congress.\n  The NOAA Chesapeake Bay office, NCBO, was first established in 1992 \npursuant to Public Law 102-567. It serves as the focal point for all of \nNOAA's activities within the Chesapeake Bay watershed and is a vital \npart of the effort to achieve the long-term goal of the Bay Program, \nrestoring the Bay's living resources to healthy and balanced levels. \nDuring the past nine years, the NCBO has made great strides in \nrealizing the objectives of the NOAA Authorization Act of 1992 and the \noverall Bay Program living resource goals. Working with other Bay \nProgram partners, important progress has been made in surveying and \nassessing fishery resources in the Bay, developing fishery management \nplans for selected species, undertaking habitat restoration projects, \nremoving barriers to fish passage, and undertaking important remote \nsensing and data analysis activities.\n\n  NOAA's responsibilities to the Bay restoration effort are far from \ncomplete, however. Some populations of major species of fish and \nshellfish in Chesapeake Bay such as shad and oysters, remain severely \ndepressed, while others, such as blue crab are at risk. Bay-wide, some \n16 of 25 ecologically important species are in decline or severe \ndecline, due to disease, habitat loss, over-fishing and other factors. \nThe underwater grasses that once sustained these fisheries are only at \na fraction of their historic levels. Research and monitoring must be \ncontinued and enhanced to track living resource trends, evaluate the \nresponses of the estuary's biota to changes in their environment and \nestablish clear management goals and progress indicators for restoring \nthe productivity, diversity and abundance of these species. Chesapeake \n2000, the new Bay Agreement, has identified several living resource \ngoals which will require strong NOAA involvement to achieve.\n  The legislation which we are introducing would provide NOAA with \nadditional resources and authority necessary to ensure its continued \nfull participation in the Bay's restoration and in meeting with goals \nand objectives of Chesapeake 2000. First, the legislation authorizes \nand directs NOAA to undertake a special five-year study, in cooperation \nwith the scientific community of the Chesapeake Bay and appropriate \nother federal agencies, to develop the knowledge base required for \nunderstanding multi-species interactions and developing multi-species \nmanagement plans. To date, fisheries management in Chesapeake Bay and \nother waters, has been largely based upon single-species plans that \noften ignore the critical relationships between water and habitat \nquality, ecosystem health and the food webs that support the Bay's \nliving resources. There is a growing consensus between scientific \nleaders and managers alike that we must move beyond the one-species-at-\na-time approach toward a wider, multi-species and ecosystem \nperspective. Chesapeake 2000 calls for developing multi-species \nmanagement plans for targeted species by the year 2005 and implementing \nthe plans by 2007. In order to achieve these goals, NOAA must take a \nleadership role and support a sustained research and monitoring \nprogram.\n  Second, the legislation authorizes NOAA to carry out a small-scale \nfishery and habitat restoration grant and technical assistance program \nto help citizens organizations and local governments in the Chesapeake \nBay watershed undertake habitat, fish and shellfish restoration \nprojects. Experience has shown that, with the proper tools and \ntraining, citizens' groups and local communities can play a tremendous \nrole in fisheries and habitat protection and restoration efforts. The \nChesapeake Bay Foundation's oyster gardening program, for example, has \nproven to be highly successful in training citizens to grow oysters at \ntheir docks to help restore oysters' populations in the Bay. The new \nBay Agreement has identified a critical need to not only to expand and \npromote community-based programs but to restore historic levels of \noyster production, restore living resource habitat and submerged \naquatic vegetation. The NOAA small-grants program, which this bill \nwould authorize, would complement EPA's Chesapeake Bay small watershed \nprogram, and make ``seed'' grants available on a competitive, cost-\nsharing basis to local governments and nonprofit organizations to \nimplement hands-on projects such as improvement of fish passageways, \ncreating artificial or natural reefs, restoring wetlands and seagrass \nbeds, and producing oysters for restoration projects.\n\n  Third, the legislation would establish an internet-based Coastal \nPredictions Center for the Chesapeake Bay. Resource managers and \nscientists alike agree that we must make better use of the various \nmodeling and monitoring systems and new technologies to improve \nprediction capabilities and response to physical and chemical events \nwithin the Bay and tributary rivers. There are substantial amounts of \ndata collected and compiled by Federal, state and local government \nagencies and academic institutions including information on weather, \ntides, currents, circulation, climate, land use, coastal environmental \nquality, aquatic living resources and habitat conditions. \nUnfortunately, little of this data is coordinated and organized in a \nmanner that is useful to the wide range of potential users. The Coastal \nPredictions Center would serve as a knowledge bank for assembling \nmonitoring and modeling data from relevant government agencies and \nacademic institutions, interpreting that data, and organizing it into \nproducts that are useful to resource managers, scientists and the \npublic.\n  Finally, the legislation would direct NOAA to implement an education \nprogram targeted toward the 3 million pupils in kindergarten through \n12th grade in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. One of the key goals of the \nChesapeake 2000 Agreement is to expand education and public awareness \nof the Bay and local watersheds. Among other activities, the Agreement \ncalls for providing meaningful Bay or stream outdoor experiences for \nevery school student in the watershed before graduation from high \nschool, incorporating the Chesapeake Bay watershed into school \ncurricula, and providing students and teachers alike with information \nto increase awareness of Bay living resource and other issues. Our \nlegislation would enable NOAA to enter into partnerships with non-\nprofit environmental organizations in the region experienced in \nconducting environmental education programs, the Chesapeake Bay \nFoundation and the Living Classrooms Foundation, for example, and to \nexpand opportunities for students and teachers to participate in Bay \nand other field and classroom learning experiences which support \nChesapeake Bay restoration and protection efforts.\n  The legislation increases the authorization for the NOAA Bay Program \nfrom the current level of $2.5 million to $8.5 million per year to \nenhance current activities and to carry out these new initiatives. For \nmore than a decade, funding for NOAA's Bay Program has remained static \nat an annual average of $1.9 million. If we are to achieve the \nultimate, long-term goal of the Bay Program, protecting, restoring and \nmaintaining the health of the living resources of the Bay, additional \nfinancial resources must be provided.\n  These two measures would provide an important boost to our efforts to \nsave the Chesapeake Bay. They are strongly supported by the Chesapeake \nBay Commission, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, and other organizations \nin the\n\n[[Page S6325]]\n\nwatershed. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the measures \nand supporting letters be printed in the Record. I urge my colleagues \nto join with us in supporting the two measures and continue the \nmomentum contributing to the improvement and enhancement of our \nNation's most valuable and treasured natural resource.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1044\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Paul Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: Last year, a few Members claimed \n     that the Florida Everglades was a national treasure. I know \n     you agree with me that the Chesapeake Bay, which drains six \n     states and the District, has more claim to being a national \n     treasure than the Florida Everglades.\n       I am writing to thank you for your steadfast support for \n     the Bay. I am also writing to urge you to pass new \n     legislation that will fund wastewater treatment plant \n     upgrades to reduce nutrient pollution in the Bay. Nutrient \n     pollution is the Bay's number one problem. The Bay and its \n     tributaries receive about twice as much nitrogen and \n     phosphorus as they should. Sewage plants are not the sole \n     source, but new technology makes them the low-hanging fruit \n     as we seek reductions.\n       First, let me give credit where it is due. Over 70 large \n     wastewater treatment plants have been upgraded with \n     technology that dramatically reduces the amount of nitrogen \n     and phosphorus in the treated discharge. Some plants, like \n     the Blue Plains facility in DC, have gone beyond what was \n     asked of them. Virginia and Maryland and the local \n     municipalities have shouldered that cost so far.\n       Nevertheless, to make a real dent in nutrient pollution, we \n     need to get serious about getting all the major plants to \n     remove nitrogen and phosphorus from the effluent. Another 218 \n     major plants await upgrades. These plants need to install \n     state-of-the-art technology, which would cut 85% of the \n     nitrogen and phosphorus pollution from the treated discharge. \n     That would slash nutrients in the Bay by more than 50 million \n     pounds each year. I've attached a copy of a letter from my \n     staff to yours that provides a detailed background briefing \n     on this subject.\n       The Clean Water Act promised citizens that they would have \n     clean waters by now. Sadly, the Bay is still polluted thirty \n     years later. If we fail to greatly reduce nutrient pollution \n     in the next few years, the Bay will not be the only loser. \n     Commercial fishermen and their families will suffer. \n     Waterfront property owners will not realize a gain in their \n     investment. Recreational opportunities--so important in this \n     workaholic world--will be diminished. And certainly, an \n     unhealthy Bay imperils human health.\n       The Chesapeake Bay Foundation stands ready to galvanize \n     public support behind your effort to fund these upgrades. \n     With 92,000 members, a dedicated professional staff and a \n     volunteer board, we are determined to do whatever it takes to \n     save the Bay. Thank you again for all of your hard work on \n     behalf of the Bay.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 William C. Baker,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Chesapeake Bay Commission,\n\n                                      Annapolis, MD, May 23, 2001.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: We write in support of your efforts \n     to reduce the environmental and public health impacts of one \n     of the major point sources of nutrient pollution to the \n     Chesapeake Bay--municipal wastewater treatment plants. As you \n     know, nearly 300 major sewerage treatment plants located in \n     the Chesapeake Bay watershed discharge approximately 60 \n     million pounds of nitrogen, amounting to 20 percent of the \n     total nitrogen load, into the Chesapeake Bay.\n       Nutrient pollution has been a particularly difficult and \n     persistent problem in our efforts to protect and restore the \n     Chesapeake Bay's ecosystem. In 1987, the Chesapeake Bay \n     Commission and our Bay partners committed to achieving a 40 \n     percent reduction in controllable nutrient loads to the Bay \n     by the year 2000. While measurable pollution reductions were \n     achieved despite continued population growth and development, \n     the Chesapeake Bay Program estimates that at least an \n     additional 100 million lbs. of nitrogen must be removed in \n     order to correct the Bay's nutrient-related problems by 2010.\n       Fortunately, the Bay states have led the way in the \n     application of advanced nutrient removal technologies. For \n     example, of Maryland's 66 wastewater treatment plants, \n     biological nutrient removal (BNR) technology is in operation \n     at 34 plants, under construction at 9 plants, and all but one \n     of the remaining wastewater treatment plants have signed \n     cost-share agreements for implementation of BNR. While this \n     technology is one of the most reliable and cost-effective \n     means of reducing nutrient loads to the Bay, it is \n     prohibitively expensive without the combined contribution of \n     local, state, and Federal funds. To date, the financial \n     burden for upgrading aging sewerage infrastructure has rested \n     largely upon local governments, which have a limited capacity \n     to support such expensive capital improvements. The \n     Chesapeake Bay Foundation has derived a rough estimate of \n     $1.2 billion for the application of BNR at treatment plants \n     within the Bay watershed over a 10-year period.\n       By establishing the proposed grant program under the \n     ``Chesapeake Bay Watershed Nutrient Removal Assistance Act,'' \n     state and local funds could be matched with Federal funds to \n     initiate urgently needed upgrades to eligible wastewater \n     treatment facilities. By prioritizing those facilities that \n     would produce the greatest nutrient load reductions at points \n     of discharge and the greatest environmental benefits to local \n     bodies of water, this program would ensure significant and \n     measurable improvements to the water quality and living \n     resources of the Chesapeake Bay. We commend you and your \n     colleagues for addressing this important issue and offer our \n     assistance in your endeavor.\n           Sincerely,\n     Brian E. Frosh,\n       Chairman (Senate of Maryland).\n     Robert S. Bloxom,\n       Vice-Chairman (Virginia House of Delegates).\n     Russ Fairchild,\n       Vice-Chairman (Pennsylvania House of Representatives).\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Maryland Department\n\n\n                                           of the Environment,\n\n                                     Baltimore, MD, June 12, 2001.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: The State of Maryland has been \n     pursuing an aggressive program of reducing nutrients from \n     publicly owned wastewater treatment plants through its \n     Biological Nutrient Removal (BNR) Cost-Share Program. This \n     State funded program provides 50% of the costs to upgrade \n     existing wastewater treatment plants with pollutant removal \n     technologies that go beyond regulatory requirements to help \n     meet the goal of cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay and its \n     tributaries.\n       This State funded program has benefited from your efforts \n     as well as those of Senator Mikulski through the earmarking \n     of special federal appropriations to some of the wastewater \n     treatment plants targeted for these BNR upgrades. This \n     assistance has made the needed improvements affordable to the \n     citizens served by these treatment plants and advanced the \n     goals of the Chesapeake Bay Program.\n       I am writing to you today to request your continued support \n     of the BNR Program. Maryland has accomplished much in this \n     program. Of the 66 targeted plants, 34 are in operation and 9 \n     are under construction. The remaining plants are in planning \n     and design. Maryland has provided $163 million to fund these \n     improvements, with another $73 to $100 million estimated to \n     be needed to complete the program. The local governments have \n     committed an equal share, and have the need for additional \n     funding to implement BNR. With full implementation of the BNR \n     Program, nitrogen loadings to the Bay will be reduced from 32 \n     to 15.2 million pounds per year.\n       Achieving this level of nutrient reduction is more critical \n     than ever, as the new goals being evaluated for the \n     Chesapeake 2000 Agreement are refined. It is already clear \n     that we will have to do much more to reduce both point \n     sources and non-point sources of nutrient pollution to \n     restore the Bay.\n       BNR will remain the cornerstone of the point survey \n     strategy to achieve the needed nutrient reductions. While the \n     BNR program has targeted a nitrogen concentration of 8 mg/l, \n     many of the plants designed with BNR will be able to achieve \n     even lower concentrations. The plants currently in planning \n     and design are being evaluated and designed to be able to \n     achieve lower concentrations, in anticipation of more \n     ambitious Bay goals. In some cases, this may increase project \n     costs, but is a reasonable investment to protect the Bay and \n     its tributaries.\n       In the interest of maintaining the leadership of the \n     Chesapeake Bay restoration effort by providing a nationally \n     significant demonstration effort, I am asking for your \n     continuing assistance in helping Maryland, and the other \n     jurisdictions in the Chesapeake Bay region, meet these \n     ambitious yet critical nutrient reduction goals. The creation \n     of a special grant program to help local governments upgrade \n     their wastewater treatment plants to reach the lowest \n     possible nutrient discharge levels would ensure that the \n     large publicly owned wastewater treatment plants in the \n     region are maximizing pollutant removals to the benefit of \n     the Chesapeake Bay.\n       The beneficiaries of this capital investment will be not \n     only the future residents in the Chesapeake Bay region, who \n     will be able to enjoy the environment and economic wealth of \n     the Bay and the living resources with which we share this \n     unique resource, but also the nation which will benefit from\n\n[[Page S6328]]\n\n     the knowledge gained from the Chesapeake Bay restoration \n     effort.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Jane Nishida,\n                                                        Secretary.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Breaux, \n        Mr. Conrad, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Santorum Ms. Landrieu, and Mr. \n        Hatch):\n  S. 1048.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator DeWine in \nintroducing bipartisan legislation to provide common-sense tax \nincentives to help address asbestos liability issues.\n  First, our legislation would exempt investment income in an asbestos-\nrelated designated settlement funds from Federal income tax, much as \nthe investment income in a 401(k) savings plan is exempt from Federal \nincome tax under current law. To qualify for this exemption from \nFederal taxation, the principal purpose of the asbestos-related \ndesignated settlement fund must be to pay present and future claims to \nasbestos victims and their families. This tax incentive encourages \nbusinesses to create settlement funds to meet their asbestos-related \nliabilities, just as the tax incentive for 401(k) savings plans \nencourages workers to invest for their retirement.\n  Second, our legislation recognizes the unique nature of asbestos-\nrelated diseases by providing a special ``carry-back'' rule for a \ncompany's losses from paying claims to asbestos victims and their \nfamilies. Under current law, a company may carry back these costs from \nproducts sold in the last ten years. This carry-back period, however, \nfails to match the realities of asbestos-related diseases, which are \noften latent for forty or more years. In many cases, companies are \npaying asbestos-related claims for exposure to products that were \nproduced a half-century ago.\n  Our legislation would permit companies for whom the ten-year period \nprovides no relief to carry back their current expenses from asbestos \npayments to victims and their families to the years in which the \ncompany produced the asbestos product. This extension of the carry-back \ntax rule is only fair given the long latency period of asbestos-related \ndiseases.\n  I agree with Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the Amchem \nProducts decision that Congress can provide a secure, fair and \nefficient means of compensating victims of asbestos exposure. The \nappropriate role for Congress is to provide incentives for private \nparties to reach settlements, not to take away the legal rights of \nasbestos victims and their families. Our bipartisan bill provides these \ntax incentives for private parties involved in asbestos-related \nlitigation to reach global settlements and for asbestos victims and \ntheir families to receive the full benefit of the incentives.\n  Encouraging fair settlements while still preserving the legal rights \nof all parties involved is a win-win situation for business and \nasbestos victims. For example, Rutland Fire Clay Company, a family-run, \n118-year-old small business in my home state of Vermont, recently \nreached a settlement with its insurers and the trial bar concerning the \nfirm's asbestos problems. Unlike some big businesses that are trying to \navoid any accountability for their asbestos responsibilities through \nnational ``tort reform'' legislation, the Rutland Fire Clay Company and \nits President, Tom Martin, are doing the right thing within the legal \nsystem. The tax incentives in our bipartisan bill will support the \nRutland Fire Clay Company and its employees while providing financial \nsecurity for its settlement with asbestos victims and their families.\n  I believe it is in the national interest to encourage fair and \nexpeditious settlements between companies and asbestos victims. The \nlegislation we are introducing today will encourage payments to victims \nwhile ensuring defendant firms remain solvent.\n  I thank Senator DeWine for his leadership on this issue. I urge my \ncolleagues to support our bipartisan approach to provide a secure and \nfair\n\n[[Page S6329]]\n\nmeans of compensating victims of asbestos exposure and to permit \nbusinesses with asbestos liabilities to efficiently meet their \nresponsibilities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TORRICELLI:\n  S. 1049. A bill to provide for an election to exchange research-\nrelated tax benefits for a refundable tax credit, for the recapture of \nrefunds in certain circumstances, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a vital \npiece of legislation that will encourage the growth of some of the most \ninnovative companies in the world. I refer to the small biotechnology \nfirms throughout the country which on a daily basis perform \nbreakthrough research that enhances our daily lives.\n  Indeed, biotechnology research over the years has benefitted greatly \nfrom successful initiatives such as the R tax credit. The R credit \nis of particular importance to my State of New Jersey because there are \nover 100 companies who spend $20 billion a year in R In fact, over \n50 percent of all the prescription drug research in the world is \nconducted in my State.\n  Going hand in hand with the R tax credit are the contributions of \nthe biotechnology industry. My colleagues are well aware of the \nimportance of this segment of industry and the beneficial role \nbiotechnology plays in improving our quality of life and protecting the \nenvironment. In fact, the Senate unanimously approved a resolution \nacknowledging the benefits of biotech research earlier this Congress.\n  The Senate has recognized these benefits that are seen in the drugs \nand vaccines developed over the last 20 years, which have already \nenabled over 270 million people throughout the world live healthier and \nlonger lives. Today, a breast cancer, leukemia or diabetes patient has \na fighting chance to survive their illness through treatments developed \nby biotech research.\n  The record number of biotech drug approvals by the FDA over the past \nfive years demonstrates the potential of this industry to develop new \ntherapies which may someday lead to cures and vaccines for debilitating \ndiseases such as heart disease, Alzheimer's, AIDS and cancer.\n  While the R credit has been responsible for enabling much of this \nbreakthrough research, the irony is that many small firms who are \nperforming the most advanced, cutting edge research and \nexperimentation, who desperately need the R credit are unable to \nutilize it because they have failed to turn a profit. These small \ncompanies often dedicate all of their resources to one or two major \ninitiatives to conduct long term R projects benefitting our medical, \nagricultural and industrial sectors.\n  In many instances, these projects are time consuming, expend much \ncapital, and unfortunately are unsuccessful or unmarketable. \nConsequently, the long term unprofitability of these companies make \nthem unable to take advantage of tax breaks and incentives such as the \nR credit. Therefore, many small firms are forced to abandon their \nresearch, sell their innovations to larger companies or simply go out \nof business.\n  I firmly believe that these industry failures are our failures \nbecause the firm that ends its research today, may have been the \ncompany that provides the cure for Parkinson's or Lou Gherig's disease \ntomorrow.\n  In order to address this situation, it is time for Congress to adopt \na straightforward proposal that would build on the success of the R \ncredit to provide these small research companies with the resources \nthey need to continue their vital work. Specifically, I am introducing \na proposal to allow these small firms to elect to take a refundable tax \ncredit, equal to 75 percent of the nominal value of their current-year \nresearch credits or deductions or 75 percent of the value of the \ncurrent- year net operating losses multiplied by the highest marginal \ntax rate for corporations (currently 35 percent).\n  I have also included safeguard provisions to ensure that the \ngovernment's investment in these companies is put to good use. Any \ncompany that elects to take this refundable tax credit would become \nineligible for normal R tax credits and normal corporate tax \ndeductions until they are able to payback the original amount of the \nrefundable tax credit in federal income taxes after they turn a profit. \nFurthermore, my proposal requires that the proceeds from the refundable \ntax credit must be used towards ongoing research-related activities. My \nlegislation also maintains that if it is determined that a company \nclaiming this credit is not using the proceeds for research, the IRS \ncan recapture that portion of the credit.\n  This proposal does not seek to supercede or replace the R tax \ncredit. Rather, it complements the tremendous success of the R \ncredit. It helps the struggling companies that the R credit doesn't \nreach. I am hopeful that my colleagues will recognize, as I do, the \nmagnificent potential of the biotech industry and make this investment \nin its future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM (for himself, Mr. Fitzgerald, and Mr. Voinovich):\n  S. 1050. A bill to protect infants who are born alive; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Born Alive \nInfants Protection Act.\n  When I was first elected to the Senate in 1994, I never imagined that \nthe bill I am offering today would be necessary. Simply stated, this \nmeasure gives legal status to a fully born living infant, regardless of \nthe circumstances of his or her birth. I am deeply saddened that we \nmust clarify Federal law to specify that a living newborn baby is, in \nfact, a person.\n  One could ask, ``Why do you need Federal legislation to state the \nobvious? What else could a living baby be, except a person?'' I will \nbegin my explanation with events in 1995, when the Senate began its \nattempts to outlaw a horrifying, inhumane, and barbaric abortion \nprocedure: partial birth abortion. In this particular abortion method, \na living baby is killed when he or she is only inches from being fully \nborn. Twice, the House and Senate stood united in sending a bill to \nPresident Clinton to ban this procedure. Twice, President Clinton \nvetoed the bill; and twice, the House courageously voted to override \nhis veto. Although support in the Senate grew each time the ban came to \na vote, the Senate fell a few votes shy of overriding the veto.\n  Then, on June 28, 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Nebraska's \npartial birth abortion ban. The Supreme Court's ruling in Stenberg v. \nCarhart, as well as subsequent rulings in lower courts, are disturbing \non a number of levels. First, the Supreme Court struck down Nebraska's \nattempt to ban a grotesque procedure the American Medical Association \nhas called ``bad medicine,'' and thousands of physicians who specialize \nin high risk pregnancies have called ``never medically necessary.'' \nFurther, the Court said it did not matter that the baby is killed when \nit is almost totally outside the mother's body in this abortion method. \nIn other known abortion methods, the baby is killed in utero. Finally, \nthe U.S. Supreme Court, and the Third Circuit Court have stated it does \nnot matter where the baby is positioned when it is aborted. This \nassertion, to me, is the most horrifying of all.\n  In the years of debates on partial birth abortion, I have asked \nSenators a very simple question: If a partial birth abortion were being \nperformed on a baby, and for some reason the head slipped out and the \nbaby were delivered, would it be o.k. to kill that baby? Not one \nSenator who defended the procedure has ever provided a straightforward \n``yes'' or ``no'' response. They would not answer my question. I \nbelieve it is important to define when a child is protected by the \nConstitution; so, I revised my question. I asked whether it would be \nalright to kill a baby whose foot is still inside the mother's body, or \nwhat if only a toe is inside? Again, I did not receive an answer.\n  Unfortunately, evidence uncovered last year at a hearing before the \nHouse Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution suggests my questions \nwere not so hypothetical. In fact, two nurses testified to seeing \nbabies who were born alive as a result of induced labor abortions being \nleft to die in soiled utility rooms. Furthermore, the intellectual \nframework for legalization of\n\n[[Page S6330]]\n\nkilling unwanted babies is being constructed by a prominent bioethics \nprofessor at Princeton University. Professor Peter Singer has advocated \nallowing parents a 28-day waiting period to decide whether to kill a \ndisabled or unhealthy newborn. In his widely disseminated book, \nPractical Ethics, he asserts, ``killing a disabled infant is not \nmorally equivalent to killing a person. Very often it is not wrong at \nall.''\n  In response to these events, the Born Alive Infants Protection Act \ngrants protection under Federal law to newborns who are fully outside \nof the mother. Specifically, it states that Federal laws and \nregulations referring to a ``person,'' ``human being,'' ``child,'' and \n``individual'' include ``every infant member of the species homo \nsapiens who is born alive at any stage of development.'' ``Born alive'' \nmeans ``the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of that \nmember, at any stage of development, who after such expulsion or \nextraction breathes or has a beating heart, pulsation of the umbilical \ncord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles, regardless of whether \nthe umbilical cord has been cut, and regardless of whether the \nexpulsion or extraction occurs as a result of natural or induced labor, \ncaesarean section, or induced abortion.'' The definition of ``born \nalive'' is derived from a World Health Organization definition of \n``live birth'' that has been enacted in approximately 30 states and the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  Again, all this bill says is that a living baby who is completely \noutside of its mother is a person, a human being, a child, an \nindividual. Similar legislation passed by the House of Representatives \nlast year by an overwhelming vote of 380-15. I am hopeful that Senators \non both sides of the general abortion debate can agree that once a baby \nis completely outside of its mother, it is a person, deserving the \nprotections and dignity afforded to all other Americans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Born Alive Infants \nProtection Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1050\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to expand the boundary of the Booker T. Washington \nNational Monument, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a bill which \nwill expand the borders of the Booker T. National Washington Monument \nin Virginia. This extraordinary 224 acres of rolling hills, woodlands, \nand agricultural fields preserves and protects the birth site and \nchildhood home of Booker T. Washington. It interprets both his life \nexperiences and significance in American history.\n  On April 2, 1956 the Monument was authorized by Congress to create a \n``public national memorial to Booker T. Washington, noted Negro \neducator and apostle of good will . . .''. Mr. Washington was widely \nconsidered the most powerful African American of his time. This park \nprovides a focal point for the continuing discussions on the context of \nrace in American society, a resource for public education, and the \ncontinuation of his legacy today.\n  The agricultural landscape surrounding the Monument plays a critical \nrole in the park's interpretation of Washington's life as an enslaved \nchild during the Civil War era. Many of his most significant \nexperiences center on this small tobacco farm located near the rapidly \ndeveloping recreational area of Smith Mountain Lake. It is remarkable \nthat the area immediately surrounding the national monument remains \nrelatively unchanged since the time of Booker T. Washington's birth.\n  As part of the park's strategic plan, a viewshed study was conducted \nin 1998. It's purpose was to survey the surrounding lands in the most \nhighly visited areas of the park and determine what visual effects \nurban development would have on the preservation of this historic site. \nThe study identified a 15-acre parcel of land to be the most critical \naddition for this park because of its proximity to Booker T. \nWashington's birth site.\n  Several private landowners now wish to sell some of the surrounding \nfarmland, including the 15-acre tract identified in the viewshed study. \nI believe that in order to maintain this unique historic setting, the \nPark Service should acquire this property so that visitors will be able \nto experience the same pastoral setting that was so crucial to Booker \nT. Washington's life. I urge my colleagues to join me in preserving \nthis important landmark in our nation's history for all future \ngenerations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows;\n\n                                S. 1051\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reauthorize and amend the Spark M. Matsunaga \nHydrogen Research Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the \nHydrogen Future Act of 2001, a bill to reauthorize the Department of \nEnergy's hydrogen energy programs. I am especially pleased that this \nbill has strong bipartisan support. I worked closely with my colleague \nfrom Hawaii, Senator Akaka, in developing the bill, which builds on the \ngreat work of his\n\n[[Page S6331]]\n\npredecessor, Spark Matsunaga, and I thank him for his support. Other \ncosponsors include Senators Bingaman, Murkowski, Reid, Domenici, Kyl, \nBayh, Inouye, Lieberman, and Jeffords.\n  There has been a wide-ranging and sometimes fierce debate recently \nover what should be in a national energy policy. But while there is \nsignificant disagreement over near-term strategies, there is a widely \nshared vision of where we need to end up. For the sake of both the \neconomy and the environment, we need to develop clean, domestic \nrenewable fuels, such as solar heat and power, wind turbines, \ngeothermal power, hydroelectric power, and biomass and ethanol. These \nfuels are domestic, avoiding the risks of dependence on foreign \nsources; indeed several of these fuels are widely available in the \nU.S., so that many states, such as Iowa, that now import virtually all \ntheir fuel could bring that work home. The use of multiple fuels, and \nthe local availability, should make supplies more reliable as well. And \nthese renewable fuels are truly ``green''--they cause almost no \npollution and result in almost no global warming.\n  However, the sun, the wind, and even the rivers are not always \navailable when you need them, and you can't store sunlight, wind, or \nthe electricity you make from them. If they are to be major sources of \npower, you need a way to store the energy.\n  The need to store electricity is not just a hypothetical problem for \nan energy future. The California energy crisis this year has vividly \ndemonstrated that electricity is not just another commodity. The \nterrible price spikes and rolling blackouts occur in part because \ncustomers need electricity but cannot store or stockpile it, during \nbrief shortages purchasers have paid hundreds or thousands of dollars a \nkilowatthour, or found there was no electricity to buy. Californians \nhoped to create a free and fair market in electricity, but instead find \nthemselves at the mercy of electricity providers.\n  The automobile industry has also recognized for some time that \nelectric cars could be much more efficient than any combustion engine \nvehicle, as well as quieter and non-polluting. But they have lacked an \neffective way to generate electricity on board.\n  These issues may be even more important abroad. Our world population \ncontinues to increase at an almost alarming rate. Back when I was born \nin 1939, there were three billion people on the earth. When I turned 60 \nnot long ago, there were 6 billion people. And 40 years from now, when \nby daughter turns 60, there will be 11 billion people on earth.\n  As countries like India, China and the African Nations become \nindustrialized consumer societies, billions of additional people will \nwant, and deserve to have, a better quality of life. That means heating \nin the winter and air conditioning in the summer, televisions and \nmicrowave ovens and cars. But if they develop the same way we did, we \nare all in trouble. The air pollution, water pollution, and global \nwarming could make our earth unlivable. And if China and other \ndeveloping nations import oil to fuel a billion cars, our recent $2 a \ngallon gasoline prices will look like bargains. For the sake of these \ncountries and for our own sake, we've got to help these developing \ncountries leap-frog fossil fuels and move directly to sustainable \ndevelopment based on renewable energy.\n  The Hydrogen Future Act is about the solution to the electricity \nstorage problem. Hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, non-toxic gas that \ncan be obtained from ordinary water using electricity or from plants \nsuch as switchgrass and trees. Hydrogen can be stored and transported \nmuch like natural gas. And it is an almost perfect fuel. When burned, \nthe main waste product is water. But hydrogen can more efficiently be \nused to power fuel cells, making only electricity, heat, and pure \nwater. And it's safe, escaping harmlessly into the air if there is a \nleak.\n  Because of these qualities, hydrogen has long been a technologist's \ndream. Jules Verne imagined hydrogen from water powering machinery, \ntrains, and and lights back in 1874. But in 1990, when the Hydrogen \nResearch, Development, and Demonstration Act first became law, hydrogen \nwas still used for energy more in space, by NASA, than on earth.\n  How things are changing. Hydrogen fuel cells are no longer a \nlaboratory curiosity. Today, the First National Bank of Omaha, just \noutside my home state of Iowa, uses fuel cells to power its credit card \nservice operations. They wanted fuel cells because of their \nreliability. They figure it costs them one million dollars for every \nhour their power is out, and that the $3.8 million system has already \npaid for itself. The New York Central Park Police Station relies on a \nfuel cell for off-grid electricity because it would have cost over a \nmillion dollars to run power line extensions to the building. And at \nthe Kirby Cove Campground in California, fuel cells have another \nadvantage: they're quiet.\n  We've seen public buses running on hydrogen fuel cells in Chicago and \nVancouver and Southern California. Every major car manufacturer has \nprototype fuel cell cars and vans on the roads. And there are hydrogen \nfueling stations in places such as Dearborn, Michigan; Las Vegas, \nNevada, and Sacramento, CA. Some companies are developing fuel cells to \npower cell phones and personal computers, others for full-size power \nplants. Companies have announced plans to deliver commercial fuel cell \nproducts in the next few years in cars, buses, and homes.\n  Soon hydrogen may be powering the world. It's potential is so great \nthat some people look forward to a ``hydrogen economy,'' an economy in \nwhich hydrogen is the ubiquitous energy ``carrier'' between renewable \nsources and all end uses. Larry Burns, a vice president of General \nMotors has said, ``We believe hydrogen will be the fuel of the \nfuture.'' And Don Huberts, of Shell, said ``The stone age did not end \nbecause the world ran out of stones, and the oil age will not end \nbecause we run out of oil.'' Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki \nYamani has used almost the same words. Now Iceland has embarked on a \nvisionary program to create the world's first hydrogen economy using \ntheir abundant hydroelectric and geothermal resources.\n  The Department of Energy hydrogen energy program is a critical part \nof this revolution. The program conducts research in the efficient and \ncost-effective production of hydrogen from renewable sources and from \nfossil fuels, in effective storage of hydrogen, and in potential uses \nsuch as reversible fuel cells, as well as in necessary infrastructure \nincluding hydrogen sensors. The program demonstrates technologies such \nas hydrogen fueling and remote off-grid power applications. The program \nalso conducts invaluable process and market analyses, as well as doing \nnecessary work on codes and regulations. They are working on ceramic \nmembranes, combined electricity generation and hydrogen production, and \nniche markets such as vehicles in mines. Almost all projects are funded \nin party by industry.\n  The bill we are introducing today will extend, expand, and improve \nthis DOE program. Because of the enormous promise of hydrogen energy, \nand the current rapid expansion of opportunities, the bill authorizes a \nsignificant increase in funding for the hydrogen program, to $60 \nmillion next year, with a total of $350 million over five years.\n  It also establishes a new program aimed at demonstrating hydrogen \ntechnologies and their integration with fuel cells at Federal, State, \nand local government facilities. The program would be based on a plan \nto be developed by an interagency task force. It would focus on \nhydrogen production, storage, and use in buildings and vehicles; on \nhydrogen-based infrastructure for buses and fleet transportation; and \non distributed power generation, including the generation of combined \nheat, power, and hydrogen. This new demonstration program would be \nfunded at an additional $20 million next year, with a total of $150 \nmillion over five years.\n  The bill makes other improvements, including: Modification of cost-\nsharing requirements to enable more participation in research projects \nby small companies and to exclude from cost-sharing analytical and \nservice work that will not lead to commercial products. These changes \nare intended to conform more closely to the requirements in the Energy \nPolicy Act of 1992 that govern the rest of the renewable energy \nprogram, without violating WTO rules; Language incorporating \ninternational activities where appropriate in the\n\n[[Page S6332]]\n\nDOE programs. A global perspective is necessary both to develop world \nmarkets for our products and to encourage international development on \na sustainable path; Clarification of the composition of the Hydrogen \nTechnical Advisory Panel that oversees the program for DOE; Reporting \nrequirements to further enhance inter-agency and inter-governmental \ncooperation in the hydrogen program.\n  This bill has the support of the chairman and ranking members of the \nEnergy Committee as well as the chairman and ranking member of the \nEnergy and Water Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee. I \nunderstand that a bill to reauthorize the Hydrogen Future Act will also \nbe introduced today in the House by Representatives Ken Calvert and \nSherwood Boehlert, key members of the Science Committee. And the recent \nreport of the administration's National Energy Policy Development Group \nrecommended reauthorization of the hydrogen program. I hope with this \nstrong bipartisan support we will be able to pass this bill quickly and \nto help realize hydrogen's potential in providing the clean, reliable \nenergy we so desperately need.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Harkin, \nSenator Bingaman and Senator Murkowski, Chairman and Ranking Member of \nthe Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, my colleagues \nSenators Bayh, Domenici, Jeffords, Kyl, Lieberman, Reid, and my senior \ncolleague from Hawaii, Senator Inouye, in introducing legislation that \nwill accelerate the ongoing efforts for the development of a fuel for \nthe future--hydrogen. Hydrogen is an efficient and environmentally \nfriendly energy carrier that can be obtained using conventional or \nrenewable resources.\n  In these days of soaring energy prices, oil cartels, air pollution, \nglobal climate change and greenhouse gases, hydrogen is a dazzling \nalternative. We can have a zero-pollution fuel. It can be produced \ndomestically, ending our dependence on foreign oil. The question is not \nwhether there will be a hydrogen age but when.\n  Hydrogen as a fuel can help us resolve our energy problems and \nsatisfy much of the world's energy needs. I am convinced that sometimes \nin the 21st century, hydrogen will join electricity as one of our \nNation's primary energy carriers, and hydrogen will ultimately be \nproduced from renewable sources. In the next twenty years, increasing \nconcerns about global climate change and energy security will help \nbring about penetration of hydrogen in several niche markets. The \ngrowth of fuel cell technology will allow the introduction of hydrogen \nin both the transportation and electricity sectors.\n  I have a long-term vision for hydrogen energy as a renewable \nresource. Progress is being made and challenges and barriers are being \nsurmounted at an accelerating pace on a global scale. Fuel cells for \ndistributed stationary power are being commercialized and installed in \nvarious locations in the United States and worldwide. Transit bus \ndemonstration programs are underway in both the United States and \nEurope. Major automobile companies are poised to deploy fuel cell \npassenger cars within the next few years. All these activities involve \ngovernment and private sector cooperation.\n  Industry is moving ahead with fuel cell developments at a rapid pace. \nMany companies are forming partnerships to bring new technologies to \nthe marketplace. Daimler-Chrysler, Ford, and Ballard have formed a \npartnership and pledged $1.5 billion for commercialization of \nautomotive fuel cells. Edison Development Company, General Electric, \nSoCal Gas, and Plug Power have agreements to commercialize residential \nfuel cells.\n  National governments are turning to hydrogen as the fuel of the \nfuture. Iceland is making a strong bid to become the world's first \nhydrogen-based economy. According to its plans, hydrogen-powered cars \nand buses will transport people in Reykjavik, the country's capital \nwithin ten years. If all goes well there will be no need for oil in \nIceland.\n  Closer to home, I am particularly pleased that the State of Hawaii is \ntaking the lead in ushering in the hydrogen era. Our State Legislature \nis advancing bills that would authorize the formation of a public-\nprivate sector partnership for promoting hydrogen as an energy source. \nThe partnership would involve the State, Counties, Federal Government, \nutilities, and private companies. The partnership would be charged with \ndeveloping plans to promote investment in hydrogen infrastructure, \nbegin pilot plants to produce hydrogen from geothermal and other \nsources on Oahu, study how to move hydrogen to other islands, and study \nhow wind and other methods could be used to produce hydrogen. In \nCalifornia, the state's zero emissions vehicle requirements favor early \nintroduction of hydrogen-powered vehicles.\n\n  These are very important initiatives. They may be small steps, but \nfor the hydrogen future they are important steps forward.\n  My predecessor in the Senate, Senator Spark Matsunaga was one of the \nfirst to focus attention on hydrogen by sponsoring hydrogen research \nlegislation. The Matsunaga Hydrogen Act, as the legislation became \nknown, was designed to accelerate development of domestic capability to \nproduce an economically renewable energy source in sufficient \nquantities to reduce the Nation's dependence on conventional fuels. As \na result of Senator Matsunaga's vision, the Department of Energy has \nbeen conducting research that will advance technologies for cost-\neffective production, storage, and utilization of hydrogen.\n  The Hydrogen Future Act of 1996, which followed the Matsunaga \nHydrogen Act, expanded the research, development, and demonstration \nprogram under the original Act. It authorized activities leading to \nproduction, storage, transformation, and use of hydrogen for \nindustrial, residential, transportation, and utility applications. It \nenjoyed bipartisan support in Congress.\n  Today we are introducing legislation that reauthorizes and amends the \nHydrogen Future Act of 1996. It highlights the potential of hydrogen as \nan efficient and environmentally friendly source of energy, the need \nfor a strong partnership between the Federal government, industry, and \nacademia, and the importance of continued support for hydrogen \nresearch. It fosters collaboration between Federal agencies, State and \nlocal governments, universities, and industry, and it encourages \nprivate sector investment and cost sharing in the development of \nhydrogen as an energy source. It adds provisions for the demonstration \nof hydrogen technologies at government facilities to expedite wider \napplication of these technologies.\n  The bill we are introducing today supports the recommendations of the \nPresident's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, PCAST. In \nits report issued in November 1997, PCAST proposed a substantial \nincrease in Federal spending for applied energy technology R, with \nthe largest share going to energy efficiency and renewable energy \ntechnologies. The PCAST report, ``Federal Energy Research and \nDevelopment for the Challenges of the Twenty-First Century,'' \nacknowledged and supported advances in a wide range of both hydrogen-\nproducing and hydrogen-using technologies.\n  The current Hydrogen Program, administered by the Department of \nEnergy, supports a broad range of research and development projects in \nthe areas of hydrogen production, storage, and use in a safe and cost-\neffective manner. Some of these new technologies may become available \nfor wider use in the next few years. The most promising include \nadvanced natural gas- and biomass-based hydrogen production \ntechnologies, high pressure gaseous and cryogas storage systems, and \nreversible PEM fuel cell systems. Other projects lay the groundwork for \nlong range opportunities. These activities need continued support if \nthe nation is to enjoy the benefits of a clean energy source.\n  The Hydrogen Program utilizes the talents of our national \nlaboratories and our universities. The National Renewable Energy \nLaboratory, Sandia, Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos, and Oak Ridge \nNational Laboratories, as well as Jet Propulsion Laboratory are \ninvolved in the program. The DOE Field Office at Golden, Colorado, and \nNevada Operations Office in Nevada are also involved. University-led \ncenters-of-excellence have been established at the University of Miami \nand the University of Hawaii. U.S. participation in the International \nEnergy Agency contributes to\n\n[[Page S6333]]\n\nthe advancement of DOE hydrogen research through international \ncooperation. The program has also built strong links with the industry. \nThis has resulted in strong industry participation and cost sharing. \nCooperation between government, industry, universities, and the \nnational laboratories is key to the successful development and \ncommercialization of new and environmentally friendly energy \ntechnologies.\n\n  The legislation we are introducing today authorizes $350 million over \nthe next five years for research and development for hydrogen \nproduction, storage and use. This will allow advancement of \ntechnologies such as smaller-scale production systems that are \napplicable to distributed-generation and vehicle applications, advanced \npressure vessels, photobiological and photocatalytic production of \nhydrogen, and carbon nanotubes, graphite nanofibers, and fullerenes.\n  The bill also authorizes $150 million for conducting integrated \ndemonstrations of hydrogen technologies at government facilities. This \nprovision will help secure industry participation through competitive \nsolicitations for technology development and testing. It will test the \nviability of hydrogen production, storage, and use, and lead to the \ndevelopment of hydrogen-based operating experience acceptance to meet \nsafety codes and standards.\n  By supporting this bill, we will be ushering in a new era of non-\npolluting energy. I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 1054. A bill to amend titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security \nAct to prevent abuse of recipients of long-term care services under the \nMedicare and Medicaid programs; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to re-introduce the Patient \nAbuse Prevention Act. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by \nSenator Reid, who has worked tirelessly with me on this important \nlegislation.\n  There is absolutely no excuse for abuse or neglect of the elderly and \ndisabled at the hands of those who are supposed to care for them. Our \nparents and grandparents made our country what it is today, and they \ndeserve to live with dignity and the highest quality care.\n  Unfortunately, this is not always the case. We know that the majority \nof caregivers are dedicated, professional, and do their best under \ndifficult circumstances. But we also know that too often, the elderly \nare starved, shamed, abused, neglected and exploited by the very people \ncharged with their care. And the systems that are in place today are \nnot enough to protect them.\n  It is estimated that more than 43 percent of Americans over the age \nof 65 will likely spend time in a nursing home. The number of people \nneeding long-term care services will continue to increase as the Baby \nBoom generation ages. While most long-term care workers do an excellent \njob, it only takes a few abusive staff to cast a dark shadow over what \nshould be a healing environment.\n  A disturbing number of cases have been reported where workers with \ncriminal backgrounds have been cleared to work in direct patient care, \nand have subsequently abused patients in their care. In 1997, the \nMilwaukee Journal-Sentinel ran a series of articles describing this \nproblem, which led my home State of Wisconsin to pass a criminal \nbackground check law for health care workers. The legislation I \nintroduce today follows their example and builds on their efforts.\n  Current State and National safeguards are inadequate to screen out \nabusive workers. All States are required to maintain registries of \nabusive nurse aides. But nurse aides are not the only workers involved \nin abuse, and other workers are not tracked at all. Even worse, there \nis no system to coordinate information about abusive nurse aides \nbetween States. A known abuser in Iowa would have little trouble moving \nto Wisconsin and continuing to work with patients there.\n  In addition, there is no Federal requirement that long-term care \nfacilities conduct criminal background checks on prospective employees. \nPeople with violent criminal backgrounds, people who have already been \nconvicted of murder, rape, and assault, could easily get a job in a \nnursing home or other health care setting without their past ever being \ndiscovered.\n  Our legislation will go a long way toward solving this problem. \nFirst, it will create a National Registry of abusive long-term care \nemployees. States will be required to submit information from their \ncurrent State registries to the National Registry. Facilities will be \nrequired to check the National Registry before hiring a prospective \nworker. Any worker with a substantiated finding of patient abuse will \nbe prohibited from working in long-term care.\n  Second, the bill provides a second line of defense to protect \npatients from violent criminals. If the National Registry does not \ncontain information about a prospective worker, the facility is then \nrequired to initiate an FBI background check. Any conviction for \npatient abuse or a relevant violent crime would bar that applicant from \nworking with patients.\n  There is clear evidence that this is needed. In 1998, at my request, \nthe Senate Special Committee on Aging held a hearing that focused on \nhow easy it is for known abusers to find work in long-term care and \ncontinue to prey on patients. At that hearing, the HHS Inspector \nGeneral presented a report which found that, in the two States they \nstudied, between 5-10 percent of employees currently working in nursing \nhomes had serious criminal convictions in their past. They also found \nthat among aides who had abused patients, 15-20 percent of them had at \nleast one conviction in their past.\n  But even more compelling, we heard from Richard Meyer of \nLibertyville, Illinois, whose 92-year old mother was raped by a nursing \nhome worker who had a previous conviction for child sexual abuse. A \ncriminal background check could have prevented this tragedy. But even \nmore appalling, there is nothing in current law that prevents her \nassailant from travelling 50 miles to my home town of Milwaukee and \nfinding another job in a home health agency.\n  There's no greater illustration of the need for background checks \nthan this. But for those who need more hard data, there is more \nevidence. In 1998, I offered an amendment which became law that allowed \nlong-term care providers to voluntarily use the FBI system for \nbackground checks. So far, 7 percent of those checks have come back \nwith criminal convictions, including rape and kidnapping.\n  Clearly, this is a critical tool that long-term care providers should \nhave, they don't want abusive caregivers working for them any more than \nfamilies do. The current voluntary system was a good first step, but if \nwe're serious about protecting our seniors, and I believe that every \nMember of the Senate is, then we have to do more than make it \nvoluntary. We should make it a national priority to require all long-\nterm care providers who participate in Medicare and Medicaid to conduct \nthese checks. And we should make the investment necessary to cover the \ncosts of the checks, just like we reimburse providers for other costs \nof providing care to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. This is a \ncommon-sense, inexpensive step we can take to protect patients by \nhelping long-term care providers thoroughly screen potential \ncaregivers.\n  I realize that this legislation will not solve all instances of \nabuse. We still need to do more to stop abuse from occurring in the \nfirst place. But this bill will ensure that those who have already \nabused an elderly or disabled patient, and those who have committed \nviolent crimes against people in the past, are kept away from \nvulnerable patients.\n  I want to repeat that I strongly believe that most long-term care \nproviders and their staff work hard to deliver the highest quality \ncare. However, it is imperative that Congress act immediately to get \nrid of those that don't. When a patient checks into a nursing home or \nhospice, or receives home health care, they should not have to give up \ntheir right to be free from abuse, neglect, or mistreatment.\n  This bill is the product of collaboration and input from the health \ncare industry, patient and employee advocates who all have the same \ngoal I do: protecting patients in long-term care. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with my colleagues, the Administration, and the \nhealth care industry in\n\n[[Page S6334]]\n\nthis effort.

A bill to require the consent of an individual prior to the \nsale and marketing of such individual's personally identifiable \ninformation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the \nPrivacy Act of 2001.\n  This legislation combats the growing scourge of identity theft and \nother privacy abuses by setting a national standard for privacy \nprotection.\n  The bill has a simple goal. It is designed to give back to ordinary \ncitizens control over their personal information.\n  Under the Privacy Act of 2001, if a company intends to collect and \nsell a customer's address, phone number, or other non-sensitive \ninformation, the company must give the customer notice and an \nopportunity to opt-out of the sale if they so choose.\n  For especially sensitive personal information such as financial, \nhealth, driver's licenses, and Social Security Numbers, the legislation \nestablishes more stringent privacy protections.\n  Specifically, the bill requires an individual's opt-in prior to the \nsale, licensing, or renting of their personal financial or health \ninformation.\n  In other words, opt-in means that a person must give their explicit \nand affirmative consent before an entity can use this type of personal \ninformation.\n  The bill would also close loopholes in the Driver's Privacy \nProtection Act, most recently amended last year, so that a State \nDepartment of Motor Vehicles can no longer disclose the most sensitive \ninformation on a driver's license, such as the driver's identification \nnumber or physical characteristics, without the driver's opt-in.\n  Finally, the bill would restrict the purchase, sale, and display of \nSocial Security numbers to the general public.\n  Why do we need a Federal privacy law?\n  The new economy has exponentially increased the flow of personal \ninformation, but the protections for individual privacy have not kept \npace.\n  With access to sensitive data so widely available, often just at the \ntouch of a keyboard, identity theft has become one of the country's \nfastest growing crimes.\n  Identity theft is when a thief steals your personal information and \nthen uses it to run up huge bills on your credit cards, bank accounts \nor other accounts. In some cases, identity theft has also resulted in \nstalking and murder.\n  Recent statistics on the growth of identity theft suggest we have no \ntime to waste in protecting personal privacy.\n  The Federal Bureau of Investigation estimates 350,000 cases of \nidentity theft occur each year. That's one case every two minutes.\n  Not surprisingly, members of the public have flooded our Federal \nagencies with pleas for assistance. Reports to the Social Security \nAdministration of Social Security number misuse have increased from \n7,868 in 1997 to 46,839 in 2000, an astonishing increase of over 500 \npercent.\n  The Federal Trade Commission, FTC, has experienced a similar \nexplosion of cases. If recent trends continue, reports of identity \ntheft to the Federal Trade Commission will double between 2000 and \n2001, to over 60,000 cases.\n  Fully 40 percent of all consumer fraud complaints received by the FTC \nin the first three months of 2001 involved identity theft.\n  Unfortunately, the State most affected by these complaints is \nCalifornia. Fully 17 percent of the identity theft complaints the FTC \nreceived this past winter came from my home state.\n  Let me give some real-world examples of privacy abuses:\n  Social Security Number Privacy: Amy Boyer, a 20-year-old dental \nassistant from Maine was killed in 1999 by a stalker who bought her \nSocial Security number off the Internet for $45, and then used it to \nlocate her work address.\n  Identity Theft No. 1: Michelle Brown of Los Angeles, California, had \nher Social Security number stolen in 1999, and it was used to charge \n$50,000 including a $32,000 truck, a $5,000 liposuction operation, and \na year-long residential lease.\n  While assuming the victim's name, the perpetrator also became the \nobject of an arrest warrant for drug smuggling in Texas.\n  Identity Theft No. 2: An identity theft ring in Riverside County \nallegedly bilked eight victims of $700,000. The thieves stole personal \ninformation of employees at a large phone company and drained their on-\nline stock accounts.\n  One employee reportedly had $285,000 taken from his account when \nsomeone was able to access his account by supplying the employee's name \nand Social Security number.\n  Financial Privacy: In a September 14, 1999 editorial, the Los Angeles \nTimes described how a small San Fernando Valley bank, ``sold 3.7 \nmillion credit card numbers to a felon, who then bilked cardholders out \nof millions of dollars.'' According to the article, the bank was not \nheld liable for this action.\n  It is also astonishing what some data marketers are now providing to \ntheir customers.\n\n[[Page S6338]]\n\n  According to the Los Angeles Times, some marketing companies have \nstarted selling lists of as many as 120 million households which \ninclude names, addresses, and phone numbers, estimated income, marital \nstatus, buying habits and hobbies.\n  Similarly, a medical information service has made databases available \nto its customers which contain the phone number, gender and address of: \n3.3 million people with allergies, 3.0 million people with heartburn, \n850,000 with yeast infections, 450,000 people with incontinence, and \n368,000 people who suffer clinical depression.\n  As a result, we have seen privacy become the top consumer protection \nissue.\n  The bill I am introducing today, the Privacy Act of 2001, contains \ntwo bedrock principles.\n  Privacy legislation should not discriminate against any system of \ncommunication.\n  If personal information deserves protection, it deserves protection \nhowever it is collected. It should not matter whether personal data is \ncollected in person, over the phone, or on the Internet.\n  Nevertheless, some privacy bills have exclusively targeted Internet \ntransactions. There is no justification for discriminating against high \ntechnology companies by imposing Internet-specific privacy rules.\n  Companies operating on the Internet should not have any more duties \nto protect privacy than businesses extracting information from warranty \ncards or mail catalogues.\n  Not all personal information deserves the same level of privacy \nprotection.\n  Some information like Social Security numbers, motor vehicle records, \npersonal financial information, and medical information deserve higher \nlevels of privacy protection.\n  With regard to the first principle, the Privacy Act of 2001 protects \nthe privacy of information regardless of the medium through which it is \ncollected.\n  Other privacy proposals have tried to confine privacy legislation to \nthe Internet.\n  These proposals unfairly discriminate against high technology users. \nPut simply, companies and other entities can misuse personal \ninformation from off-line sources just as easily as with on-line \nsources.\n  Why should a company extracting data from a warranty card have any \nless of a duty to protect personal privacy than a company collecting \npersonal data on-line?\n  For example, telemarketers who besiege consumers with phone calls \nduring the dinner hour get much of their personal information used from \nconsumers filling out and mailing back warranty and registration cards. \nBut these warranty cards give consumers no notice about how their \npersonal information will be used.\n  Consider the case of Anne Marie Levine, a Virginia resident, who \nentered a raffle to win a new car.\n  The sponsor of the raffle, unbeknownst to Ms. Levine, sold the \npersonal information on her raffle ticket. In the next two weeks, she \nreceived calls from a host of jeep dealers in the area.\n  While some may consider unsolicited marketing calls a mere annoyance, \nMs. Levine was outraged, as I'm sure many Americans would be, that the \nauto dealer sold her personal information without her permission.\n  Moreover, with the advent of digital scanners, digital photography, \nand data processing, the distinctions between on-line and off-line \ntransactions are already blurring.\n  With regard to the second principle, the Privacy Act of 2001 \nrecognizes that not all categories of personal information merit the \nsame level of protection.\n  The bill requires businesses intending to collect and sell \nnonsensitive personal information, eg. name, phone number, address, to \nnonaffiliated third parties to give customers notice and the \nopportunity to opt-out of the sale.\n  The opt-out standard for non-sensitive information ensures that if a \nperson fills out a warranty card, sign-up for a computer service, or \nsubmit an entry for a sweepstakes, the business must notify him before \nit sells his personal information to other businesses or marketers.\n  This framework guarantees basic privacy protections for consumers \nwithout unduly impacting commerce.\n  To eliminate unnecessary burdens on businesses, the legislation sets \nup a safe harbor for businesses which appropriately use nonsensitive \npersonal information. Industries and industry-sponsored seal programs \nwhich have already adopted Notice-and-Opt Out information policies will \nbe exempt.\n  The bill also sets a national standard for the sale or marketing of \nnonsensitive personal information.\n  Federal preemption is needed because a jumbled patchwork of State \nprivacy laws helps neither businesses nor consumers. Conflicting State \nlaws lead to consumer confusion about privacy rights.\n  For example, if one logs onto an Internet site, which State law \ngoverns: the law of the State of the computer user, the law where the \nwebsite is being operated, or the law of the State of the manufacturer \nof a product?\n  Similarly, a patchwork of 50 State privacy laws, would pose a \nlogistical nightmare for corporate America.\n  Without Federal preemption, businesses will face the unsavory choice \nof either adopting, for consistency's sake, privacy guidelines that \ncomply with the strictest state privacy law, or dealing with the costs \nand paperwork imposed by 50 different state privacy laws.\n  For especially sensitive personal data, like financial data, medical \ndata, or a driver's license, the bill pushes for an opt-in model of \nconsent.\n  I believe people should have control over how their most sensitive \ninformation is used. In the absence of a customer's express permission, \ncompany's should not market or sell sensitive personal data.\n  To create this opt-in standard, this legislation builds upon the \nexisting lattice-work of Federal privacy laws.\n  For example, the bill modifies the recently enacted Gramm-Leach-\nBliley Financial Services Modernization Act by requiring an opt-in for \nthe sale of personal financial information.\n  Presently, under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, a bank must give a \ncustomer notice and the opportunity to opt-out before the bank can \ndisclose private financial information to non-affiliated third parties.\n  This legislation would impose a stricter standard if the bank tries \nto sell the information. Any bank that sells personal financial \ninformation to non-affiliated third parties would have to get the prior \nconsent of the customer, OPT-in.\n  Similarly, this bill strengthens the privacy protections for personal \nhealth data.\n  The newly enacted Department of Health and Human Services privacy \nregulations set a basic opt-in framework for disclosure of health \ninformation. I recognize that the rules are being revised by the Bush \nadministration, so any discussion of health privacy must necessarily \ncontemplate a moving target.\n  Nevertheless, the current version of the regulation has loopholes \nthat limit patient privacy.\n  The regulations only prohibit ``covered entities, namely health \ninsurers, health providers, and health care clearinghouses, from \nselling a patient's health information without that patient's prior \nconsent, an Opt-in Model.\n  Meanwhile, non-covered entities such as business associates, health \nresearchers, schools or universities, and life insurers are not subject \nto this opt-in requirement, except through contractual arrangements.\n  My bill would preserve the privacy of health information wherever the \ninformation is sold. Any life insurer, school or non-covered entity \ntrying to sell protected health information would have to get the \npatient's consent.\n  In addition, the bill would require entities to obtain a patient's \napproval before using ``protected health information'' for marketing \npurposes.\n  This legislation builds on existing law to protect the information on \nour drivers' licenses.\n  With its recent amendments, the Driver's Privacy Protection Act, \nDPPA, offers some meaningful protections for drivers privacy.\n  For example, under the DPPA, a State Department of Motor Vehicles \nmust obtain the prior consent, Opt-in of the driver before ``highly \nrestricted personal information, defined as the driver's photograph, \nimage, Social Security number, medical or disability information, can \nbe disclosed to a third party.\n\n[[Page S6339]]\n\n  However, loopholes remain. Other sensitive information found on a \ndriver's license deserves equal protection.\n  This legislation would expand the definition of ``highly restricted \npersonal'' to include a physical copy of a driver's license, the driver \nidentification number, birth date, information on the driver's physical \ncharacteristics and any biometric identifiers like a fingerprint that \nare found on the driver's license.\n  Thus, this bill would ensure consumers have control over how their \nmotor vehicle records and driver's license data are used.\n  I would like to take a moment to highlight Title II of this \nlegislation, which reflects a compromise with Senator Gregg on the \nprivacy of Social Security numbers.\n  It is so crucial to protect Social Security Numbers because these are \nthe key to unlocking a person's identity.\n  Many identity theft cases start with the theft of a Social Security \nnumber.\n  Once a thief has access to a victim's Social Security number, it is \nonly a short step to acquiring credit cards, driver's licenses, or \nother crucial identification documents.\n  The Feinstein/Gregg compromise bars the sale or display of Social \nSecurity numbers to the public except in a very narrow set of \ncircumstances.\n  Display or sale is permitted if the Social Security Number holder \ngives consent or if there are compelling public safety needs.\n  For the first time, Federal, State, and local governments will have \nto redact Social Security numbers on government records before these \nrecords are provided to the public.\n  Thus, enterprising identity thieves no longer can scour bankruptcy \nrecords, liens, marriage certificates, or other public documents to \nsteal Social Security Numbers.\n  Moreover, State governments will no longer be permitted to use the \nSocial Security number as the default driver's license number.\n  The legislation, however, recognizes that some industries, like \nbanks, rely on Social Security Numbers to exchange information between \ndatabases and complete identification verification necessary for \ncertain transactions.\n  It permits the sale or purchase of Social Security Numbers to \nfacilitate business-to-business transactions so long as businesses put \nappropriate safeguards in place and do not permit public access to the \nnumber.\n  Some critics of privacy legislation argue it will impede commerce. I \ndisagree. A reasonable baseline of privacy laws will stimulate \ncommerce. On the Internet, for example, fear of identity theft has \nimpeded consumer transactions.\n  One study of e-commerce estimates consumer privacy fears prevented up \nto $2.8 billion in online retail sales in 1999. Another study suggests \nthat, by 2002, over $18 billion of lost sales can be attributed to \nconsumer privacy concerns.\n  This legislation codifies steps Congress can take to protect citizens \nfrom identity thieves and other predators of personal information.\n  It restores to individuals more control over their most sensitive \npersonal information such as Social Security numbers, driver's license \ninformation, health information, and financial information.\n  The legislation sets reasonable guidelines for businesses that handle \nour personal information every day, like credit card companies, \nhospitals, and banks.\n  Our Nation is rushing toward an information economy that will yield \nunprecedented economic efficiencies.\n  The commercial benefits of the new economy are unquestionable. But, \nin our rush to embrace the new, we must remember to protect the core \nDemocratic values on which our country depends.\n  Every American has a fundamental right to privacy, no matter how fast \nour technology grows or changes.\n  But our right to privacy only will remain vital, if we take strong \naction to protect it.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact the Privacy Act \nof 2001.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1055\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The inappropriate display, sale, or purchase of social \n     security numbers has contributed to a growing range of \n     illegal activities, including fraud, identity theft, and, in \n     some cases, stalking and other violent crimes.\n       (2) While financial institutions, health care providers, \n     and other entities have often used social security numbers to \n     confirm the identity of an individual, the general display to \n     the public, sale, or purchase of these numbers has been used \n     to commit crimes, and also can result in serious invasions of \n     individual privacy.\n       (3) The Federal Government requires virtually every \n     individual in the United States to obtain and maintain a \n     social security number in order to pay taxes, to qualify for\n\n[[Page S6341]]\n\n     social security benefits, or to seek employment. An \n     unintended consequence of these requirements is that social \n     security numbers have become tools that can be used to \n     facilitate crime, fraud, and invasions of the privacy of the \n     individuals to whom the numbers are assigned. Because the \n     Federal Government created and maintains this system, and \n     because the Federal Government does not permit individuals to \n     exempt themselves from those requirements, it is appropriate \n     for the Federal Government to take steps to stem the abuse of \n     this system.\n       (4) A social security number does not contain, reflect, or \n     convey any publicly significant information or concern any \n     public issue. The display, sale, or purchase of such numbers \n     in no way facilitates uninhibited, robust, and wide-open \n     public debate, and restrictions on such display, sale, or \n     purchase would not affect public debate.\n       (5) No one should seek to profit from the display, sale, or \n     purchase of social security numbers in circumstances that \n     create a substantial risk of physical, emotional, or \n     financial harm to the individuals to whom those numbers are \n     assigned.\n       (6) Consequently, this Act offers each individual that has \n     been assigned a social security number necessary protection \n     from the display, sale, and purchase of that number in any \n     circumstance that might facilitate unlawful conduct.\n\n     SEC. 202.

A bill to authorize grants for community telecommunications \ninfrastructure planning, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nhelp rural and underserved communities across the country get connected \nto the information economy.\n  Today I am introducing the Community Telecommunication Planning Act \nof 2001. I am proud to have Senators Boxer, Landrieu, Kennedy, \nCantwell, and Schumer as original cosponsors. This bill will give small \nand rural communities a new tool to attract high speed services and \neconomic development.\n  I am especially proud at how this legislation came about. Since last \nyear, I've been working with a group of community leaders in Washington \nState to find ways to help communities get connected to advanced \ntelecommunications services.\n  I want to take a moment to thank the members of my Rural \nTelecommunication Working Group for their hard work on this bill. The \nmembers include: Brent Bahrenburg, Gregg Caudell, Dee Christensen, Dave \nDanner, Louis Fox, Tami Garrow, Larry Hall, Rod Fleck, Ray King, Dale \nKing, Terry Lawhead, Dick Llarman, Jim Miller, Joe Poire, Skye \nRichendrfer, Jim\n\n[[Page S6348]]\n\nSchmit, Fred Sexton, Ted Sprague, Barbara Tilly, Terry Vann, Ron \nYenney.\n  We met as a working group, and we held forums around the State that \nattracted hundreds of people. We've tapped the ideas of experts, \nservice providers and people from across the State who are working to \nget their communities connected. The result in this legislation, which \nI am proud to say is part of Washington State's contribution to our \nnational effort to wire all parts of our country.\n  This bill addresses a real need in many communities. While urban and \nsuburban areas have strong competition between telecommunications \nproviders, many small and rural communities are far removed from the \nservices they need. We must ensure that all communities have access to \nadvanced telecommunications like high speed internet access. Just as \nyesterday's infrastructure was built of roads and bridges, today our \ninfrastructure includes advanced telecom services. Advanced \ntelecommunications can enrich our lives through activities like \ndistance-learning, and they can even save lives through efforts like \ntelemedicine. The key is access. Access to these services is already \nturning some small companies in rural communities into international \nmarketers of goods and services.\n  Unfortunately, many small and rural communities are having trouble \ngetting the access they need. Before areas can take advantage of some \nof the help and incentives that are out there, they need to work \ntogether and go through a community planning process. Community plans \nidentify the needs and level of demand, create a vision for the future, \nand show what all the players must do to meet the telecom needs of \ntheir community for today and tomorrow. These plans take resources to \ndevelop. This bill would provide those funds.\n  Providers say they're more likely to invest in an area if it has a \nplan that makes a business case for the costly infrastructure \ninvestment. Communities want to provide them with that plan, but they \nneed help developing it. Unfortunately, many communities get stuck on \nthat first step. They don't have the resources to do the studies and \nplanning required to attract service. So the members of my Working \nGroup came up with a solution: have the federal government provide \ncompetitive grants that local communities can use to develop their \nplans. I took that idea and put it into this bill.\n  When you think about it, it just makes sense. Right now the federal \ngovernment already provides money to help communities plan other \ninfrastructure improvements--everything from roads and bridges to \nwastewater facilities. The bill would provide rural and underserved \ncommunities with grant money for creating community plans, technical \nassessments and other analytical work that needs to be done.\n  With these grants, communities will be able to turn their desire for \naccess into real access that can improve their communities and \nstrengthen their economies. This bill can open the door for thousands \nof small and rural areas across our state to tap the potential of the \ninformation economy. I urge the Senate to support this bill and I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to see it passed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 1067. A bill to authorize the addition of lands to Pu`uhonua o \nHonaunau National Historical Park in the State of Hawaii, and for other \npurposes; to the committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleague \nSenator Inouye to introduce legislation that is important for the \npeople of Hawaii, for the National Park Service, and for the nation as \na whole. I am offering legislation that would allow expansion of the \nboundaries of Pu`uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park on the \nisland of Hawaii by 238 acres. These lands are adjacent to and \ncontiguous with the park's current boundaries.\n  Pu`uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park preserves a site with \ngreat significance for Native Hawaiians, students of history, \narchaeologists, and the people of Hawaii in general. It is nestled \nalong the coast of the island of Hawaii where, up until the early 19th \ncentury, Hawaiians who broke kapu or one of the ancient laws against \nthe gods could avoid certain death by fleeing to this place of refuge \nor ``pu`uhonua.'' The offender would be absolved by a priest and freed \nto leave. Defeated warriors and non-combatants could also find refuge \nhere during times of battle. The grounds just outside the wall that \nencloses the pu`uhonua were home to several generations of powerful \nchiefs. The 182-acre park was established in 1961 and includes the \npu`uhonua and a complex of archeological areas including temple \nplatforms, royal fishponds, holua (sledding tracks), and coastal \nvillage sites. The Haloe o Keawe temple and several other structures \nhave been reconstructed to provide visitors an understanding of life \nduring the early days of the royal families.\n  The park, on the famed Kona coast of the Big Island of Hawaii, is \nappreciated by Native Hawaiians and the general public as a place where \nthe story and history of native culture are interpreted for all \nAmericans. It is worth mentioning that the National Park Service \noversees 384 units across the nation, including national parks, \nbattlefields, military parks, memorials, monuments and historic trails. \nOf these nearly 400 sites, there are only a handful of national \nhistoric parks that celebrate interpretations of contemporary native \ncultures. I am pleased that two of these parks, Pu`uhonua o Honaunau \nand Kaloko-Honokohau, are in Hawaii on the Big Island. I invite you all \nto visit us for a truly remarkable immersion in Hawaiian cultural \nhistory, something very close to my heart.\n  The proposed expansion has national significance from an \narchaeological and historical perspective. The archeological resources \nare very important. They illustrate that the Ki`ilae village complex, \nwith its numerous sites and features, represents one of the most \ncomplete assemblages of the coastal component of the ancient Kona field \nsystem. This system was not just an agricultural system utilized by the \nearly Kona chiefs, it was a complex economic system that supported a \ndense population. Archaeological records have shown that this system \nallowed the Kona chiefs to become very powerful for a period of at \nleast 200 years and most likely supported the growth and development of \nKamehameha the Great's army and thereby contributed to his rise to \npower in the Hawaiian Islands. The cultural landscape here includes not \nonly residential features, but also religious, agricultural and \nceremonial sites. The unusually high number of heiau is believed to be \nan indication of the importance of this area to the Hawaiian ruling \nclass.\n  Mr. President, the expansion of the park has widespread support from \nlocal communities and county officials. There is a long history of \nstudy and analysis of expansion possibilities for the park. The 1977 \nMaster Plan for the Pu`uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park \noriginally proposed boundary expansions in four contiguous areas. \nFollowing the original master plan, in 1992 the National Park Service \nconducted a feasibility study for protecting adjacent lands through \nboundary expansions. Then in August of last year, given the \nnotification of the recent land transaction between the McCandless \nRanch and a private development corporation, the NPS prepared a special \nreport on the proposed park expansion to include the Ki`ilae village \nparcel. The Service held three well-attended community meetings on the \nBig Island, with enthusiastic support for the expansion.\n  The 238-acre expansion authorized by this bill is the preferred \noption of the NPS, although additional acres could potentially be \nacquired. The Ki`ilae village property meets the criterion of national \nsignificance for historical and archaeological areas. The Trust for \nPublic Land (TPL) is providing funds for the appraisal of the property, \nand has indicated an interest in helping facilitate the expansion of \nthe park. The TPL financial assistance is a departure from their normal \nbusiness practice, and they made the decision to commit the funds in \nrecognition of the unique conservation values that this property \npresents for the National Park Service.\n  I submit for the Record a letter from Mayor Harry Kim of the County \nof Hawaii which shows the depth of public support and appreciation for \nthe expansion, particularly from the Hawaiian\n\n[[Page S6349]]\n\ncommunity. I ask unanimous consent that the letter and the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1057\n\n  Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of Representatives of the \nUnited States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Pu`uhonau o Honaunau \n     National Historical Park Addition Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ADDITIONS TO PU`UONAU O HONAUNAU NATIONAL HISTORICAL \n                   PARK.\n\n       The first section of the Act of July 26, 1955 (69 Stat. \n     376, ch. 385; 16 U.S.C. 397) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``That when'' and inserting ``SECTION 1. \n     (s) When''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end thereof the following new \n     subsections:\n       ``(b) The boundaries of Pu`uhonua o Honaunau National \n     Historical Park are hereby modified to include approximately \n     238 acres of lands and interests therein within the area \n     identified as ``Parcel A'' on the map entitled ``Pu`uhonua o \n     Honaunau National Historical Park Proposed Boundary \n     Additions, Ki`ilae Village'', numbered PUHO-P 415/82,013 and \n     dated May, 2001.\n       ``(c) The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to \n     acquire approximately 159 acres of lands and interests \n     therein within the area identified as ``Parcel B'' on the map \n     referenced in subsection (b). Upon the acquisition of such \n     lands or interests therein, the Secretary shall modify the \n     boundaries of Pu`uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park \n     to include such lands or interests therein.''.\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There is authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                             County of Hawaii,\n\n                                           Hilo, HI, May 16, 2001.\n     Hon. Daniel Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: The purpose of this letter is to \n     request that you seek Congressional authorization to expand \n     the boundaries of Pu`u Honua O Honaunau National Park.\n       As I am sure you know, our local media have given a good \n     deal of attention to a development proposed on 800 acres \n     adjacent to Pu`u Honua O Honaunau. The community, \n     particularly the Hawaiian community, has been outspoken in \n     its desire to see this acreage preserved and the park \n     enhanced. Numerous historic sites have been identified on \n     this acreage, some or all related to the ancient Hawaiian \n     village of Ki`ilae.\n       My staff has spoken with Ms. Geri Bell, Park \n     Superintendent, and she has said that at least 238 acres (out \n     of the 800) are closely linked to the park and associated \n     with the village of Ki`ilae. Moreover, she has indicated that \n     the owner of the land would willingly sell the 238 acres to \n     the National Park. The next step is Congressional \n     authorization.\n       The acquisition could be 238 acres, 800 acres, or something \n     in between, and I would leave that determination to the \n     experts to decide. However, your support for acquisition of \n     at least the smaller portion would allow for a valuable \n     addition to the park and assure preservation of an important \n     part of our ancient Hawaiian heritage.\n       I fully support the expansion of the park by acquisition of \n     this acreage, and hope you will let me know if there is any \n     way in which I can be of assistance.\n       A similar letter has been sent to the other members of our \n     Congressional delegation.\n           Aloha,\n                                                        Harry Kim,\n     Mayor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/14/senate-section/article/S6349-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 110--RELATING TO THE RETIREMENT OF SHARON ZELASKA, \n                   ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

The remaining two nominations will \nrequire floor time and rollcall votes. We are working on those \nagreements. I simply note that because I have said from the very \nbeginning of my tenure as majority leader that I am prepared to move \nnominations forward. We would have been prepared to move virtually all \nbut two nominations.\n  As I understand it, there are objections to the four Treasury \nDepartment nominations on the Republican side, as well as an objection \nto one military promotion. Given those objections, clearly we are not \nprepared to move to them today. It is not as a result of any particular \nobjection on our side.

Madam President, today I rise to pay tribute to Sharon \nZelaska, who is retiring after serving for over 4 years in the \ndemanding position of Assistant Secretary of the Senate, and who has \ncontributed so much to the efficient operations of the Senate over \nthose years.\n  She arrived in 1997, a stranger to the Senate but not to Capitol \nHill, having worked for a dozen years previously as executive assistant \nto then Representative Jack Kemp. As Assistant Secretary she has been \nresponsible for the day-to-day operations of the office of\n\n[[Page S6357]]\n\nSecretary of the Senate, no small task given that 24 departments report \nto the Secretary. Working closely with Secretary of the Senate Gary \nSisco, she helped provide the best possible service to all one hundred \nsenators individually, and to the Senate as an institution.\n  Since the post of Assistant Secretary was historically that of Chief \nClerk, Sharon Zelaska had a chair on the rostrum specifically \ndesignated for her. She took that chair on ceremonial occasions, but on \nmost days her real work was behind-the-scenes, managing the many \ndepartments within the Secretary's office.\n  As Assistant Secretary she spent countless hours working with \nsenators and staff. Her door was open to every one to stop in for a cup \nof coffee and an opportunity to talk about important issues of the day. \nWhen department heads retired, new candidates needed to be interviewed \nand selected. Vouchers required signing, payrolls had to be adjusted, \ne-mail answered, and no end of paperwork completed. She did all that \nwith a poise and sense of fairness that all who worked with her admired \nand will miss with her retirement.\n  I want to take this opportunity to thank Sharon Zelaska for all her \ncontributions to the Senate over the past 4 years and to wish her \nGodspeed for a happy future in a well-earned retirement.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 112) honoring the United States Army \n     on its 226th birthday.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, 226 years ago, the Continental Army was \nformed with the goal of ending tyranny and winning our freedom. Since \nthe end of the Revolution, American soldiers, imbued with the spirit of \nthe original patriots, have pledged their allegiance to our nation \nthrough their sacrifices in uniform.\n  All of our Army units, Active, Guard, and Reserve share the heritage \nof the Continental Army and their soldiers represent the finest men and \nwomen our Nation has to offer. Thousands of soldiers stand guard around \nthe globe ensuring our freedom and doing the tough jobs that maintain \nour American way of life.\n  The proud tradition of the Army, dating back to 1775, has always \nstood tall. They are steeped in tradition, but ever flexible and \ncapable of responding to a dynamic world. Now, the Army is transforming \nto meet the new demands of the 21st century. This new force will ensure \nthat our national Command Authorities continue to have the ability to \nquickly and efficiently deploy land forces throughout the world.\n  Both in times of peace, and times of war, throughout more than two \ncenturies, the soldiers of the Army have been poised and ready to \nanswer the call of duty to defend this great Nation. The Army remains \nthe best fighting force in the world: unchallenged and unparalleled. \nThey are respected by their allies, feared by their opponents, and \nesteemed by the American people. Today, June 14, 2001, as the U.S. Army \ncelebrates their 226th birthday, I ask that we reflect on the great \nlegacy the Army has given this Nation and recognize our pride in our \nAmerican soldiers' courage, dedication to duty, and selfless service to \nthe Nation.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act may be the most important step we will take \nduring this Congress to affect what is surely one of the most crucial \ninterests of the country--childrens' education. I have tried to devote \nappropriate attention and effort toward improving this bill. That is \nbecause I have believed since Committee consideration that it contains \nsignificant flaws. At the same time, we have improved the bill in \nimportant ways, and we have added substantial new commitments of \nfederal funds for education. In my view, these improvements, plus the \nprospects for further improvement in Conference, outweigh my remaining \nserious reservations about policy contained in the bill at the present \ntime. Therefore, while I pledge to continue in Conference to try to \nimprove the policy and to assure funding, I have voted in favor of the \nbill today.\n  A number of weeks ago, I opposed bringing this bill to the floor in \nthe absence of some assurance that sufficient resources would be \nprovided to federal education programs. That issue remains among my \ndeepest concerns and considerations. Along with other improvements we \nhave made since that time, we have very substantially bolstered needed \nfunding for federal education--especially by including mandatory, full \nfunding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA. This \nprovision alone will mean over $3 billion for my state of Minnesota in \nIDEA funds during the coming 10 years. It will mean $153 million in \nIDEA funds for Minnesota in fiscal year 2001.\n  The improvements must be balanced against policy deficiencies--\nprimarily in the area of mandated tests and the bill's so-called \n``straight-A's,'' or ``performance agreement,'' provisions. My view is \nthat if we at the federal level are going to insist on \n``accountability'' from states, districts, schools and students, then \nwe must be accountable to the principle that every student should have \nan equal opportunity to succeed. That means we must sufficiently fund \nthe federal programs, such as Title I, IDEA and others, that attempt to \ngive all students an equal chance. We all know that not every student \narrives to school equally ready to learn. That is why it really is \nimpossible to separate our presumption of holding schools and students \naccountable on one hand, from our own accountability to an obligation \nto sufficiently fund housing, nutrition and Head Start efforts on the \nother hand. We have not held ourselves accountable on that measure. We \nhave avoided even debating this bill in that context. But if we will \nnot meet that measure, and we have not, then we must at minimum ensure \nthat federal education programs provide schools and students an equal \nchance at succeeding before we impose accountability and tests whose \nstakes can be very high.\n  My colleagues and anyone who has listened to much of the debate on \nthis bill know that I have grave reservations about its annual testing \nprovisions. Indeed, I oppose those provisions. I offered one amendment \nto remove the mandate for the tests if full Title I funding is not \nprovided. I then cosponsored an amendment to allow states not to \nimplement the tests so that they could utilize those funds instead for \nother means of boosting student achievement in the lowest performing \nschools .\n  I continue to believe that federally mandated annual testing of every \nstudent is a mistake. If it is implemented, I believe we will regret \nit. I say ``if'' because I hope the Senate will realize its mistake \nbefore the year 2005, which is when the first of these new tests would \nbe required. I still intend to attempt at least to allow states to \nutilize the newly mandated tests for ``diagnostic'' purposes, rather \nthan for the purpose of meeting adequate yearly progress targets. I \nhope that change can be made in Conference. If I do not succeed at \nthat, I believe that we in Congress, the states and the public may very \nwell reject these tests before they occur. I think they are unneeded, \nunwanted and most likely detrimental. The debate on what is becoming a \nmania for testing is just beginning.\n  We are making a significant mistake in mandating these new tests on \nevery child, in every school, in every district and in every state. In \nthe current context, it makes little sense. We have not even begun \nfully to implement the assessments we approved in 1994 with the last \nESEA reauthorization. Yet we are moving to double those requirements \nand to expand their scope to cover every child in the country. We have \nnot had a chance to look at the effect of those 1994 changes. Only 11 \nstates have brought themselves into full compliance with that law. From \nwhat we have been able to look at, the evidence seems to indicate we \nshould be very concerned about how these tests are being implemented \nand what their effect is on student learning.\n\n  I would like to cite a few reports that should send us a clear \nwarning about what we are about to do. The Independent Review Panel on \nTitle I which was mandated in the 1994 Reauthorization issued its \nreport ``Improving the Odds'' this January. The report concluded that \n``Many States use assessment results from a single test--often \ntraditional multiple choice tests. Although these tests may have an \nimportant place in state assessment systems, they rarely capture the \ndepth and breadth of knowledge reflected in state content standards.'' \nThe Panel went on to make a strong recommendation. It said, ``Better \nAssessments for instructional and accountability purposes are urgently \nneeded.''\n  I would also like to quote from the National Research Council, as \ncited in the Report ``Measuring What Matters.'' This report was \ndeveloped by the strongly pro-testing Committee for Economic \nDevelopment. The report says: ``policy and public expectations of \ntesting generally exceed the technical capacity of the tests \nthemselves.''\n  Everybody wants to find a way to address the critical challenge of \nclosing the achievement gap. In people's genuine desire to do something \nabout our schools, I believe they have created expectations from these \ntests, that far exceed what the tests can ever do. In fact, Robert \nSchwartz, the President of Achieve, Inc., the nonprofit arm of the \nstandards-based reform movement recently said: ``Tests have taken on \ntoo prominent of a role in these reforms and that's in part because of \npeople rushing to attach consequences to them before, in a lot of \nplaces, we have really gotten the tests right.''\n  In this rush for answers, the tests have ceased their useful function \nof measuring the reform and have become synonymous with it. That is \nexactly where this bill goes wrong and I believe that the consequences \nwill be destructive. I believe that in the not so distant future, we \nwill regret ever having done this. In fact, I believe that by the time \nthese new tests are to go into effect, many if not most of the Senators \nin this body will have changed their mind on this issue.\n  My concerns are many and I have been over them before, but in \nsummary, I am extremely concerned about how too much testing can \nsubvert real learning. A Stateline News article from last week reported \nthat:\n\n       A yet to be released RAND study conducted in North Carolina \n     found that between 50 and 80 percent of the improvements in \n     student performance measured by tests are temporary and fail \n     to predict any real gains in student learning.\n\n  RAND, which is one of the most respected research institutions in the\n\n[[Page S6359]]\n\ncountry, is not alone. A recent survey of Texas teachers indicates that \nonly 27 percent of teachers believe that increases in TAAS scores \nreflect an increase in the quality of learning and teaching.\n  Much of this is due to the phenomenon of teaching to the test. The \nCommittee for Economic Development, a strongly pro-testing coalition of \nbusiness leaders, warns against test based accountability systems that \n``lead to narrow test based coaching rather than rich instruction.'' \nTest preparation is not necessarily bad--but if it comes at the expense \nof real learning, it becomes a major problem. There is no question, at \nthis point, that teaching to the test has become a problem. As an \nexample, the recent Education Week/Pew Charitable Trust study, Quality \nCounts found that ``Nearly 7/10 teachers said instruction stresses \ntests `far' or `somewhat' too much. 66 percent also said that state \nassessments were forcing them to concentrate too much on what is tested \nto the detriment of other important topics.''\n  Beyond this detrimental phenomenon, which has proven to be more \nprevalent in low income communities, there is significant evidence \nthat, at the very time we are trying to bring more teachers into low \nincome schools and address a teacher shortage generally, the need to \nteach to the test and to provide education based on rote memorization \nand is driving people out of the field.\n  This is tragic at a time when we face an acute teacher shortage and \nwe know that the single most important factor in closing the \nachievement gap between students is the quality of the teacher the \nstudents have. Both Linda Darling Hammond and Jonothan Kozol have \naddressed this issue when speaking to the Democratic Caucus. As Kozol \nsaid: ``Hundreds of the most exciting and beautifully educated teachers \nare already fleeing from inner-city schools in order to escape what one \nbrilliant young teacher calls ``Examination Hell.'' I would like to \nquote from an article from today's New York Times that addresses this \nspecific issue. The article explained: ``In interviews over the last \nmonth many fourth grade teachers questioned why they should stay in a \njob that revolves around preparation for new state exams . . . \nPrincipals say that they cannot keep experienced teachers in fourth \ngrade or transfer them there.''\n  It would be remiss to talk about this issue without also addressing \nthe fact that these tests are not perfect instruments. No one put it \nbetter than the strongly pro-testing Committee for Economic \nDevelopment. These business leaders concluded that ``tests that are not \nvalid, reliable and fair will obviously be inaccurate indicators of the \nacademic achievement of students and can lead to wrong decisions being \nmade about students and schools.''\n  For example, a study by David Rogosa of California's Stanford 9 \nNational Percentile Rank Scores for individual students showed that the \nchances that a student whose true score is in the 50th percentile will \nreceive a reported score that is within 5 percentage points of his true \nscore is only 30 percent in reading and 42 percent on ninth grade math \ntests.\n  Rogosa also showed that on the Stanford 9 test ``the chances, . . . \nthat two students with identical `real achievement' will score more \nthan 10 percentile points apart on the same test'' is 57 percent for \n9th graders and 42 percent on the fourth grade reading test.\n  We have to take such error very seriously if we are attaching \nconsequences to the test results for students and schools. If we do \nnot, and we continue to over rely on a single, less than accurate test, \nour ability to fairly implement any type of accountability is in \njeopardy.\n\n  When we rush to get them done and rush to attach stakes to them, we \nare ignoring the admonition of the National Academy of Sciences that \nour expectations for tests should not exceed their technical capacity. \nOne of the most troubling quotations I have read in this regard is a \nquote from Maureen di Marco, Vice President of Houghton Mifflin company \nwhose subsidiary, Riverside Publishing, is one of the major test \npublishers. She was cited in the Washington Post as saying that the \nIndustry can only handle the Bush proposal as long as states make up \nthe difference with off the shelf, national achievement tests that are \nmostly multiple choice and can be scored electronically. This would be \ndestructive and take us in the opposite direction from where we must be \ngoing in terms of accurate, quality testing. Such tests are usually not \naligned with standards and most often do not measure the depth of \nstudent knowledge or student reasoning. In fact, the Stanford-9, the \ntest studied by Rogosa, is just this kind of test, that the companies \nare telling us we will have to rely on.\n  H. D. Hoover, one of the authors of the Iowa Test of Basic Skills and \nincoming president of the National Council on Measurement in Education \nsaid in a recent article that ``there is one heck of a capacity \nproblem'' when it comes to meeting the testing requirements in this \nbill. So again, in this context, I fail to understand why we are \nrushing ahead with these new requirements. Why can we not at least wait \nuntil states have the knowledge and the opportunity to get the tests \nthey have right before we move on to doing so many more. The Committee \nfor Economic Development report clearly states ``there is more work to \ndo in designing assessment instruments that can measure a rich array of \nknowledge and skills embedded in rigorous and substantive standards.'' \nBefore we rush ahead, let's meet that challenge.\n  But I would not be being intellectually or personally honest if I did \nnot say that even if we had the most perfect assessments, I still would \nhave significant concerns with the use of tests to compare all students \nand to punish schools because we have still done so little to ensure \nthat every student has the same opportunity to do well on those tests. \nThat concern runs as deep as any I have. It is a fairness question. \nThere are few bills we will face this year where the policy proposals \nand the funding that must back up the proposals are so inextricably \nlinked. Without giving more resources to low income schools so they can \ndevelop the capacity to help their children do well, we will only set \nup children to fail. In punishing these students and these schools for \ntheir poor performance, I am afraid that we are too blindly confusing \ntheir failure with our own. It is in fact, a failure for policy makers \nto close our eyes to the resource starved schools in our urban and \nrural areas. It is a failure to think that by testing alone we can \nreverse years of neglect and deprivation.\n  A study of the Florida accountability system proves this point \nstarkly. The study found that ``for every percent that poverty \nincreases, the school's score drops by an average of 1.6 points.'' He \nshowed that the level of poverty in a school in Florida predicted what \nthe school's achievement score would be with 80 percent accuracy! Not \none of my colleagues should be surprised by this.\n  Tests have their place, but they also have their limits. They can not \ngive a kindergartener the early childhood education that his or her \nparents could not afford to provide. They can not hire a good teacher, \nthey can not reduce class size, they cannot buy students' books and \nthey cannot fix the heater in a school in Minnesota in the winter. \nUntil we give every child these critical tools to do well, the tests \nwill measure less a child's potential and more the accident of his \nbirth.\n  My concerns with this bill are many, and they remain deep. But I also \nrecognize that there is room for improvement and that the bill as it \nstands has many strengths. I very much appreciate the work that I and \nmy colleagues have had the opportunity to do to improve this bill. I \nwould like to highlight just a few of those improvements.\n  In the area of testing, I want to thank my colleagues for their \nsupport for three amendments that I worked very hard on and that I \nthink will go far to ensure that we have high quality tests that are \nnot abused. In ensuring the proper use of tests, we move to ensure that \ntests most accurately measure how students learn, not what they have \nmemorized. We can more accurately see what it is that students have \nactually been taught. We can get a better picture of what students need \nand how they can best be helped.\n\n  The first is the amendment I introduced that would ensure that states \nshow that their assessments are in\n\n[[Page S6360]]\n\ncompliance with the National Standards on Educational and Psychological \nTesting and that their assessments are of adequate technical quality \nfor each purpose for which they are used. The amendment also would \nprovide $200 million in grants for states to improve their assessments \nso that they are of the highest quality and are state of the art in \nterms of most accurately measuring the range and depth of student \nknowledge.\n  These higher quality tests and fairer uses of tests are needed \nbecause low quality tests can lead to inaccurate assessments which do \nnot serve, but rather subvert, efforts at true accountability and high \nstandards. Further, if we want to avoid the negative outcomes that the \nwrong kind of testing can bring, such as teaching to the test and \nteachers leaving the field, we have to be sure that assessments measure \nstudents' depth and creativity. We have to measure what students have \nactually been taught and we have to measure student progress not just \nin a single point in time, but over time and in multiple dimensions. In \ndoing so, teachers will not futilely train their students but rather \nwill engage their students, and challenge them and explore with them \ntheir diverse talents. That way students will gain a deeper more \nenduring knowledge that translates to all different contexts and is \nuseful when confronting all different challenges. This amendment will \nmove us strongly in the right direction.\n  The second amendment would achieve the same effect as the first. This \namendment took the incentive bonus grants that the bill included, which \nwould have rewarded states for completing their assessments as fast as \npossible, and instead awarded the bonuses to states that develop the \nmost high quality assessments. This way we will be able to incentivize \nstates to move in the direction of developing the most effective \nassessments that lead to better teacher and learning.\n  The third was an amendment that I offered and which passed in the \nCommittee that authorized an in depth study, conducted by the National \nResearch Council, to address the impact of high stakes tests on \nindividual students. I do not think there is a greater abuse of a test \nthan to use it as the sole determinant of whether a student will be \npromoted or graduated. The Professional Standards on Educational and \nPsychological Testing, the National Research Council and virtually \nevery major education and civil rights group agrees with this, yet \nstates and districts persist in this practice. This amendment would \nlook at this practice to determine what are its affects on students, \nteachers and curriculum. This study would serve as a guide for policy \nmakers so they can understand better how tests can be used as a \npositive tool in children's education.\n  But beyond the testing provisions, other key improvements were \nincluded. None may be more important than the inclusion of the Harkin \namendment which would provide full mandatory funding for IDEA.\n  The fact that we have finally decided to live up to the commitment we \nmade too many years ago to fully fund the federal share of the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act is perhaps the greatest \nimprovement of all. For too long we have shirked this responsibility \nand for too long children with disabilities have not received the \nservices they need. We assume the responsibility to educate children \nwith disabilities because it is their constitutional right and it is \ntheir moral right. But we must never forget that we also educate these \nchildren because we know that if given the right opportunities, the \nvast majority of them can succeed. Passage of this amendment helps make \nsure that children with disabilities are not pushed aside, that they \nget the services they need and that they have the opportunities to do \nwell. With those opportunities, so many children can do well they do \nbetter than well. They excel.\n  Beyond this most important, most deeply rooted issue is that the \nprogram has created a significant, debilitating burden on states and \ndistricts when it is our responsibility, not theirs, to provide a large \nportion of the funding for these critical services to children with \ndisabilities. While states have a constitutional mandate to provide \nequivalent educations to students with special needs, they do not have \nthe financial resources to do so. It is shameful that for so long, the \nfederal government has not lived up to its promise to provide its share \nof that funding. And it is with great relief and happiness that this \nfunding, which so many of us have pushed for for years, is one step \ncloser to being realized. This amendment will bring more than $3 \nbillion in IDEA spending to Minnesota. This would make a real \ndifference for children with disabilities and all children in the \nstate. I am grateful to Senator Harkin for his leadership on this issue \nand I believe that mandatory full funding for IDEA will make a world of \ndifference for so many of our nation's children. I very much support \nthis part of the bill.\n\n  Another critical area is the area of teacher quality. I am \nparticularly pleased that the Senate has adopted an amendment that I \nintroduced with Senators Hutchison, Clinton, DeWine and Kennedy to \nestablish a national Teacher Corps program to help states and districts \nrecruit teachers into the nation's highest need schools. The teacher \nshortage we face amounts to a crisis and the problem is most acute in \nhigh need urban and rural schools. Even though research shows that the \nmost important factor in student achievement is the quality of the \nteacher, the rates of underlicensed teachers in urban schools is twice \nthat of the nation as a whole and in low income areas, 50,000 under-\nprepared teachers are hired each year. The passage of this amendment \nrepresents a national commitment to address this very severe barrier to \nlearning.\n  I want to particularly applaud the work of Senator Kennedy, who has \nfought more than anyone in the area of teacher quality. Senator Kennedy \nincluded key provisions that would ensure that within five years, only \nhighly qualified teachers are hired in high poverty schools. No one has \nworked harder on the issue of high quality teachers than Senator \nKennedy. When we think about closing the achievement gap between low \nand high income schools, this provision is essential. Several studies \nhave shown that if poor and minority students are taught by high \nquality teachers at the same rate as other students, a large part of \nthe gap between poor and minority students and their more affluent \nwhite counterparts would disappear. For example, one Alabama study \nshows that an increase of one standard deviation in teacher test scores \nleads to a two-thirds reduction in the gap between black-white test \nscores.\n  Finally, parent involvement is an area in which I believe the bill \nhas seen substantial improvement. Parent involvement is one of the most \nimportant parts of any child's education. When families are fully \nengaged in the educational process, students have: higher grades and \ntest scores; better attendance and more homework done; fewer placements \nin special education; more positive attitudes and behavior; higher \ngraduation rates; and, greater enrollment in post-secondary education. \nFor this reason, I am grateful for the inclusion of my amendment to \nestablish local, community based parent involvement centers to help the \nlowest income communities and the communities like the Hmong community \nin Minneapolis and St. Paul where parents, because of language and \ncultural barriers, are most isolated from their children's educational \nexperience. Senator Reed's leadership on parent involvement has brought \nthe issue to the forefront and his work has helped ensure that the \nbenefits brought by greater family involvement in education would \nextend to all families.\n  In conclusion, there are many important issues with which we grapple \nin the U.S. Senate. But, my colleagues, I truly feel that there is \nnothing more important than the education of America's children. The \nopportunity to improve America's public education was one of the key \nfactors that drove me to become a public servant and to run for \nelection to this body nearly a dozen years ago. I am proud of the work \nI have done with many in this body on education at all levels in this \ncountry.\n  It is that passion to improve public education that is the reason \nthat at many points during the last several months, as we moved to this \npoint on the reauthorization of ESEA, I have been deeply frustrated. \nAnd, it is the reason that I am frustrated with this bill today. For \nall the reasons that I\n\n[[Page S6361]]\n\nhave laid out earlier, I truly feel that in many ways we are missing a \ntremendous opportunity to take a significant step forward in bettering \nAmerica's education system.\n  At the time of the final vote in our committee mark-up, I voted to \nsend the bill forward to the full Senate. I was deeply conflicted about \nmy vote at that point. However, along with several of my colleagues on \nthat committee, I did so with the message that, as the process \ncontinued, the expansion of resources committed to education must come \nto match the elevation in our expectations about our schools' \nperformances. On the Senate floor we have made a huge step forward in \nachieving that goal with the mandatory funding for the IDEA program. \nThe inclusion of mandatory IDEA funding has gotten us part of the way \nthere on the commitment of resources that was vital, in my mind to \nmatch the dramatic increase in testing required by an act that confuses \neducational accountability with standardized testing.\n  But, beyond this, we still have to make sure, that along with the \npassage of the Dodd-Collins Amendment on Title I, the Kennedy Amendment \non Teacher Quality and the Boxer amendment on after school--there will \nbe an adequate appropriation to match the authorization levels so we \ncan truly help those students who are already so far behind where they \nshould be. Without that, this bill will not work.\n  While this is a vote on the final passage of this bill in the Senate, \nwe all know that much work remains to be done on this bill. Whether it \nis in testing or funding or defining adequate yearly progress, I think \nthat most people on this side of the aisle know that this bill has a \nlong way to go. I am committed to remain deeply involved in that \nimportant work that must be done in the weeks ahead. Therefore, I will \nvote ``yes'' today with perhaps the deepest ambivalence I have ever \nfelt on a vote during my years in the United States Senate and with a \nmessage similar to the one I laid out when I voted to send this bill \nout of committee.\n  In particular, in the weeks ahead, as the Conference Committee does \nits work, I will continue to fight to strengthen the fairness and \nquality of the assessments that will be a part of the final bill. \nSpecifically, I will continue to work toward an effective compromise. \nThat compromise was included in an amendment which I filed and was \nprepared to put forward today. I decided that it would be more \nproductive for me to wait until another day to offer that proposal. \nThat amendment would keep in place the assessment system used for \ndetermining whether schools are achieving adequate yearly progress that \nwas included in the 1994 reauthorization but has yet to be fully \nimplemented. And, it would allow the annual testing to move forward. \nBut, it would allow states and schools to use those additional annual \ntests only for the diagnostic purposes for which experts in the field \nof educational assessment say is their most appropriate use. That is, \nrather than being attached to sanctions for schools or individuals, \nassessments are best used to diagnose the academic strengths and \nweaknesses of individual students and to help them improve. Testing has \na role in the educational system, but it should be used primarily to \nachieve what should be our ultimate goal: Helping our students live up \nto their true intellectual potential.\n  I will also do everything I can to fight for the retention of the \nIDEA amendment in the Conference Report and for other funding increases \nfor Title I, Teacher Quality, after school and other key programs.\n  It is because of this desire to fight and because I see so much room \nfor improvement that I am choosing to stay engaged in this process and \nI am voting yes. I believe we can do much, much more.\n  After today, however, there will be one remaining vote on this bill--\non the bill that comes out of the Conference between the Senate and the \nHouse. My vote at that time will be based on the considerations I have \noutlined above. It is my sincere hope that the provisions in the bill \nrelated to the quality, fairness and appropriate use of tests will be \nstronger in the conference report than in this bill. There must also be \nan iron-clad commitment of resources to assist disadvantaged students \nin their educational opportunities. Finally, the bill must ensure full \nfunding for the federal government's commitment to its share of our \nspecial education students' education. But, today, with deep \nambivalence, I have voted ``yes'' on this bill with hope that we can \ncontinue to improve it and the education of America's students.\n  Again, I want to congratulate the Senators who supported this bill. I \nvoted for it with a considerable amount of ambivalence. Making the IDEA \nprogram mandatory is hugely important to Minnesota and other people in \nthe country. There were amendments on testing, and on recruitment of \nteachers, and dealing with parental involvement that I am proud of, \nwhich I worked on along with others who were a part of this bill.\n  When it goes to conference, I get to be in the conference committee. \nI am going to fight to make the testing diagnostic, without high-stakes \nconsequences. The money needs to be there in appropriations. If we \ndon't get the money for title I, if we are not able to make some of \nthose changes, I may well vote against the conference report when it \ncomes back to the floor. For right now, I want to keep on fighting.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/14/senate-section/article/S6361-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6361-S6362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         IN DEFENSE OF FATHERS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, recently there has been a spate of \narticles regarding the increase in the number of single parent homes, \nbased upon the latest census data. Last month, Newsweek's cover story \nwas ``The New Single Mom: Why the Traditional Family is Fading Fast, \nWhat It Means for Our Kids.'' The number of families headed by single \nmothers has increased 25 percent since 1990, to more than 7.5 million \nhouseholds. Although divorce and widowhood certainly contribute to this \nfigure, the number of out-of-wedlock births has run at about one third \nof all births for the last decade, compared to 3.8 percent of all \nbirths in 1940.\n  Let me say that again. The number of out-of-wedlock births has run at \nabout one-third of all births for the last decade, compared to 3.8 \npercent of all births in 1940.\n  Not all single parent households are headed by women. The number of \nsingle fathers has also increased, to just over 2 million families. \nNevertheless, what I found most striking about the articles I read was \nthe apparently growing trend of women who choose for whatever reason to \nput off marriage, but who still decide to go ahead and have children, \nwhether by birth or adoption. The thinking seems to be: Don't settle \nfor less than Mr. Perfect, but if the biological alarm is ringing, \ndon't put off having children, either. As Father's Day approaches, I do \nwish to say a few words in defense of men, particularly men in the role \nof father.\n  Men are not perfect. I found that out at the beginning of the human \nrace. Most will never be ``Mr. Perfect.'' I will be the first to admit \nthat. Many men squeeze toothpaste from the middle of the tube and many \nmen do not always put the cap back on the toothpast tube. Men have been \nknown to drink from the milk carton before putting it back in the \nrefrigerator. Some men cannot seem to find the dirty clothes basket for \nlove nor money, and a few miscreants leave their dirty clothes tangled \nin inside-out knots. Men commonly are assigned the once-a-week `glory' \njobs like taking out the trash and mowing the lawn, leaving the daily \nburden of cooking, cleaning, laundry, and getting kids ready for school \nto their wives. This I hear from women on my staff, and it can be \nreadily verified by asking any married woman within earshot. Fathers do \nnot do their fair share of changing diapers, getting up in the middle \nof the night, reading bedtime stories, helping with homework, driving \nkids to sports practices and games, or shopping for school clothes. \nFrom this litany, one might suppose that women who elect to have \nchildren without the burden of also caring for a\n\n[[Page S6362]]\n\nhusband are the smart ones. I do not advocate that, but in a sense they \nmay be the smart ones.\n  But in defense of fathers--and that is why I take the floor at this \ntime--we are not simply a drag on the family. Of course, it is a little \nlate for me to be referring to myself as a father, except I am one. I \nam a father and past that stage now. I am a grandfather, and beyond \nthat I am a great grandfather, great in the other sense, the true sense \nof the term. I am a ``great'' grandfather.\n  We are not as fathers simply a drag on the family, good only for \nbringing in our share of the family net worth.\n  Fathers add a different dimension to child-rearing that, historically \nat least, has proven its value. Fathers are often forced to be the \n``bad cop'' to mother's ``good cop'' routine. Mother gets to be \nunderstanding and sympathetic, leaving the tough calls to dad, as in \n``you'll have to ask your father,'' or ``just wait until your father \ncomes home.'' It is dad who must say ``no.'' It is dad who leads the \nmiscreant to the figurative woodshed. Fathers are often accused of \nbeing demanding, but they are no more demanding than one's future boss \nor coach will be. And it is dads who come to the rescue, dads who \narrive with toolboxes at the scene of the automotive failure or at the \nscene of a plumbing crisis. Dads investigate the noises in the night.\n  Some fathers are overbearing, some are obnoxious sideline coaches, to \nbe sure, but many more dads are patient teachers of baseball pitches \nand football catches. Some dads teach other skills, too, such as \ncarpentry or plumbing, or working on the family car. Tiger Woods thanks \nhis dad for encouraging him to play golf. Countless 16-year-olds have \nlearned to drive with their father in the passenger seat, calmly \nsaying, ``no, not this one but the other right turn'' while inwardly \nsuppressing the desire to grab the wheel to make the turn.\n  It was the man who reared me, that old coal miner dad. He was the \nonly father I ever knew, really, having been left without the tender \nlove of a mother at the age of barely 1-year-old. The man who then took \nme to raise was my uncle by marriage. I did not know the difference \nuntil I was 16 years old. So to me he was dad, really dad.\n  It was he who nurtured me in a love of art and music. He didn't buy \nme a cowboy suit or a cap buster. As a matter of fact, he wasn't able \nto buy me very much of anything, but he bought for me watercolors; he \nbought drawing tablets; he bought pencils; he bought books--good books. \nHe could hardly read himself, but as a coal miner he knew the worth of \nan education. He didn't want me to be a coal miner. He wanted me to \nhave a better life. So he bought me a fiddle, a violin.\n  It was my old dad. He was the best dad I ever knew. He was the best \ndad, as far as I was concerned, in the world. I never heard him use \nGod's name in vain, never, in all the years I knew him. I never heard \nhim speak ill of his neighbor. I never saw him sit down at the table \nand grumble at the fare that was on the table. Not once, never. I never \nheard him speak ill to the good woman who raised me--his wife, my aunt.\n  When he died, he didn't owe any man a penny. He was as honest as the \nday is long; Humble, hard working, one of the truly few great men, in \nmy opinion, that I ever knew.\n  It was that man who used to meet me on his walk home from the coal \nmines. In the evening I would look up the railroad tracks. We used to \nrefer to directions as up or down--up the railroad tracks. They were \nreally up because there was a little incline on the railroad track. So \nI always, late in the afternoons, looked up the railroad track as far \nas I could see to watch for him, the greatest man in my life. I watched \nfor him. I could see him coming from a long way off. I can see him now: \ntall, black hair, red mustache, slender, carrying a watch in his pocket \non a watch chain.\n  I would run to meet him. I knew that he had saved a cake for me. And \nso running along the railroad tracks, three or four crossties at a \ntime, each time I would be running fast to meet him. He would set down \nthat dinner bucket, he would lift off the lid, and then he would reach \ndown and bring out a cake that he had put into his lunch pail. Here he \nhad worked all day long in the black bowels of the Earth and the black \ndust of the coal mine heavy labor, but he had not eaten the cake; he \nkept it for me.\n  So he reached down into that pail, pulled out that cake, a real 5-\ncent cake back in those days, a 5-cent cake--usually two little cakes, \nperhaps with coconut icing, wrapped in a piece of wax paper, two little \ncakes for 5 cents.\n  How do I know? Because mother sent me to the store to purchase the \ngroceries. She would tell me: Bring home the cake. I knew that cake was \ngoing into his dinner pail, but I knew he would save it for me.\n  So he would greet me with the tired hello of a man who had spent his \nday in the mines and he would give me the cake that he had saved from \nhis lunch.\n  His work was demanding and physically draining. He probably could \nhave used those extra calories, and the extra energy from that cake, \nbut he always saved the cake for me.\n  He wanted better for me than he had had. He encouraged me in school. \nHe demanded my best work. I know he would have helped me to go to \ncollege if he could have helped me. He certainly didn't want me to go \nto work in the mines. I never heard him complain about going there day \nafter day and coming home tired with coal dust still in his eyebrows, \nperhaps in his eyelashes.\n  Dads like mine teach important values. They teach their sons to \nrespect their mothers. They teach their sons to read the Biblical \nadmonition, honor thy father and thy mother. They teach their daughters \nto expect and to demand that kind of respect from men.\n  They teach the value of work, and of giving one's best effort at \nwhatever task is at hand. Like the Bible admonishes us: ``Whatsoever \nthy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might. . . .'' They reinforce \nthe importance of family, and of teamwork. They push their children to \nachieve more than they did, and show their pride in their children's \naccomplishments. Dads like mine may not be flashy, as mine was not. \nThey may not be demonstrative. But they are the solid backbone of the \nfamily, a refuge in times of trouble. They are enduring, much more so \nthan networks of friends. They are enduring, meaning lasting, ever \nalways the pillar of strength and refuge, much more so than networks of \nfriends.\n  And, finally, fathers kill bugs, which alone is reason enough to keep \nus around, I think.\n  So, women, please, I urge you to reconsider. Most men make pretty \ngood fathers. They love their children and they add value to their \nchildren's lives. Come Sunday, this Sunday, they will be delighted with \nthe loud ties and cheap cologne--maybe cheap cologne--that are their \ndue on Father's Day.\n  Madam President, I close with a bit of poetry that always brings to \nmind the kind man who raised me, who always set a fine example for me. \nI often think, if I were the man that he was, I could really feel good \nabout myself. The bit of poetry is called, ``The Little Chap Who \nFollows Me.'' Most Senators, I am sure, have already heard it.\n\n       A careful man I ought to be;\n       A little fellow follows me;\n       I do not dare to go astray\n       For fear he'll go the self-same way.\n\n       I cannot once escape his eyes;\n       Whatever he sees me do he tries--\n       Like me, he says, he's going to be;\n       The little chap who follows me.\n\n       He thinks that I am good and fine,\n       Believes in every word of mine;\n       The base in me he must not see,\n       The little chap who follows me.\n\n       I must remember as I go,\n       Through summer's sun and winter's snow,\n       I'm preparing for that man to be,\n       A little fellow follows me.\n\n  Madam President, this former little chap salutes his old Dad, who is \nwatching from the diamond towers and the golden streets of Heaven, and \nall the other fellows who rise to the challenge of setting a good \nexample for the children who look up to them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/14/senate-section/article/S6362-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6362-S6363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SENATE HISTORICAL EDITOR WENDY WOLFF\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, this week, the attractions of retirement \nwill claim another highly valued Senate staff member. With deeply mixed \nfeelings, I note the departure of Wendy Wolff.\n  Since 1987, Wendy Wolff has served the Senate as Historical Editor in \nthe\n\n[[Page S6363]]\n\nOffice of the Secretary. Viewers on C-SPAN will not observe Wendy in \nthe Senate chamber or at committee hearings. She fulfills her \nprofessional responsibilities away from public view in the offices of \nthe Senate Historian. Yet, it would be accurate to conclude that she \nhas significantly left her mark on Senate history; she has even shaped \nSenate history.\n  I first met Wendy as she began to prepare the lengthy and complex \nindex to Volume One of my four-volume history, The Senate, 1789-1989. \nAnyone who has consulted that first volume's index is likely to agree \nthat it is most user-friendly. In 1989, Wendy assumed editorial \nresponsibilities--as well as the indexing chores--for the remaining \nthree volumes in that series. Over the next five years, she handled the \ncountless tasks--many of them deeply challenging--that fall to editors \nand publishers of encyclopedia-length reference volumes.\n  Ten years ago, in the preface to Volume Two, I offered the following \nassessment of Wendy's contributions to that project.\n\n       Her strong editorial hand has skillfully shaped this work \n     from a disparate collection of speeches to what I believe is \n     a carefully balanced and finely coordinated reference book. \n     Tirelessly dedicated to this project from its inception, \n     Wendy Wolff has maintained herein the editorial standards of \n     Volume One and has convincingly guided the author away from \n     tempting side roads. Her indexes to both volumes display a \n     rich and impressively detailed knowledge of the Senate's \n     historical structure.\n\n  Wendy's editorial hand and critical judgment have also shaped other \nSenate historical volumes. Among them are Senator Bob Dole's Historical \nAlmanac of the United States Senate (1989); United States Senate \nElection, Expulsion and Censure Cases, 1793-1990 (1995); Senator Mark \nHatfield's Vice Presidents of the United States, 1789-1993 (1997); \nMinutes of the U.S. Senate Republican Conference, 1911-1964 (1999); and \nCapitol Builder: The Shorthand Journals of Captain Montgomery C. Meigs, \n1853-1861 (2001).\n  I know that I speak for Wendy Wolff's colleagues and other admirers \nin wishing Wendy Wolff a most enjoyable retirement. We won't ever \nforget her.\n  (Mr. BAYH assumed the chair.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/14/senate-section/article/S6363-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6363-S6367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       STATE OF PUBLIC EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, not long ago, I came across a letter from \nThomas Jefferson to his nephew, Peter Carr, which discussed the \nelements of a good education. In his letter dated August 19, 1789, \nJefferson advised his nephew to divide his studies into three main \nareas: Give the principal to History, the other two, which should be \nshorter, to Philosophy and Poetry.\n  ``Begin [with] a course of ancient history,'' Jefferson wrote, \n``First read Goldsmith's history of Greece. . . . Then take up ancient \nhistory in the detail, reading the following books, in the following \norder: Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophontis Anabasis, Arrian, Quintus \nCurtius, Diodorus Siculus, Justin.'' This, Jefferson wrote, would form \nhis ``first stage of historical reading.'' Next, Jefferson wrote, he \nshould read Roman history.\n  I remind Senators, this is Thomas Jefferson speaking. He then \nrecommended reading ``Greek and Latin poetry.'' He advised reading \nVirgil, Terence, Horace, Anacreon, Theocritus, Homer, Euripides, \nSophocles, Milton's ``Paradise Lost,'' Shakespeare, Pope and Swift.\n  Regarding the subject of morality, Jefferson advised, ``read \nEpictetus, Xenophontis Memorabilia, Plato's Socratic dialogues, \nCicero's philosophies, Antoninus--I don't know whether he meant Pius \nAntoninus or Marcus Aurelius Antoninus; it could well have been both--\nand ``Seneca.''\n  I was pleased to see what Jefferson found to constitute a quality \neducation. Those of my colleagues who have heard me speak to any degree \nover the years are probably a bit amused by at least some of the \nreadings suggested by Jefferson. I suppose, to some extent, it sounds \nlike a list of books that might be in my own personal collection. But, \nlest anyone get the wrong impression, I do not consider myself to be on \npar with that master thinker, Thomas Jefferson. But I have these, and \nmore.\n  Although Jefferson did not have a degree as an educator, given his \nvast accomplishments, it seems foolhardy to argue with the merit of his \nadvice to his nephew. As a contemporary wrote of the young Thomas \nJefferson, he was ``a gentleman of 32 who could calculate an eclipse, \nsurvey an estate, tie an artery, plan an edifice, try a cause, break a \nhorse, dance a minuet, and play the violin.'' May I also add, that he \nwas the author of the Declaration of Independence and ``Notes on \nVirginia,'' the founder of the University of Virginia, an ambassador to \nFrance, a Secretary of State, a Vice President, and President of the \nUnited States.\n  In his closing lines to his nephew, Jefferson said, ``I have nothing \nfurther to add for the present, but husband well your time, cherish \nyour instructors, strive to make everybody your friend; and be assured \nthat nothing will be so pleasing as your success.''\n  Do you hear what he said? ``Cherish your instructors, strive to make \neverybody your friend.'' These simple but fundamental guidelines are as \nappropriate today as they were when Jefferson wrote them.\n  There is great wisdom in that letter. Wise council that I think we \nwould do well to follow today. Jefferson obviously knew that a good \neducation can make the difference in the life course of any individual. \nHe knew the value of good teachers.\n  I have spoken on this floor, many times before, about my early years \nas a student in a two-room schoolhouse. I imagine that to those much \nyounger than I, the pictures I paint with my remarks about my school, \nmy teachers, and what I think makes for a good, sound education must \nseem distant and archaic. Sadly my experiences are a world away from \nthe usual classroom climate of today.\n  Yet, I caution the skeptics to consider that there may be some \nadvantages to accumulated years. I believe, for example, that our \nnation's experiences and experiments with education have taught at \nleast one essential truth: the basic underpinnings of a solid education \nhave been essentially the same throughout the history of civilized men \nand women.\n  I readily concede that the environment in my old two-room schoolhouse \nwas a good deal different from the environment of the overcrowded \nschools of today. But I believe that those things which made for a good \neducation then, those things which contributed most to learning, are \nthe same today as they were when I spent my weekdays in a tin-roofed \nwooden building, overheated by the pot-bellied stove, reading Muzzy's \nhistory, in the 1920's.\n  In the school of my youth, we did not have computers, but we were \nplugged into our own imaginations. I had no television set.\n  Parenthetically, I doubt that I am better off. I probably would have \nbeen much worse off by having a television set.\n  But I had no television set with which to watch videos about distant, \nfaraway lands, but I had the vision of my own mind's eye to see life \nbeyond my own little corner of the world. Air conditioning? We opened \nthe windows. Water fountains? We had waters from a nearby spring.\n  I used to go out in the summertime and lie down in the old \nspringhouse--lie down on my belly, let the damp, cool ground touch my \nbreasts, put my face, as it were, into that spring, and drink that cool \nwater that bubbled from the white sands of the spring. And in school, I \nwas always hoping I would be one of the two boys who would be sent by \nthe schoolteacher over the hill to the spring to bring back water in a \nbucket for all of the children in the room. We drank out of one \ndipper--all of us. We didn't think anything about sanitation so much in \nthose days, although we did read ``Hygiene.'' That was one of the books \nwe read in school.\n  But I can remember in later years when my mom kept boarders in the \ncoal camp, and we got our drinking water from a pump, one pump for \nevery half dozen houses in a row of coal miners' homes. We would go out \nto the pump and bring up the water, pumping it up and down, and bring \nthe water to the house. And the boarders, those coal miners who boarded \nat my mom's house, and I all drank from the same dipper.\n  We didn't have hard drives, but we were driven hard, to work, to \nlearn, to succeed.\n\n[[Page S6364]]\n\n  We had only two rooms in the little schoolhouses that I first \nattended, beginning in 1923, but those rooms were filled with students \nrespectfully seeking to learn. We had dedicated teachers who expected \nthe best from their students and they did not tolerate mediocrity nor \ndid they tolerate bad behavior.\n  There was a category on that report card that had a designation \nspelled D-E-P-O-R-T-M-E-N-T: Deportment. I always knew that in taking \nthat grade card home to my coal miner dad, he would look it over \ncarefully, and he would look at that designation: Deportment. It had \nbetter be good.\n  In those modest two rooms, we were close to one another and we were \nclose to our dear, dear teachers who loved us, who inspired us to \nlearn, who inspired us to seek excellence. We sometimes had to share \ndesks and rub elbows and actually touch--which meant that, whether we \nliked our classmates or not, we were forced to be civil to one another \nand to recognize our human bonds.\n  Teachers got to know their students. And, my, how I swelled with \npride when my teacher would pat me on the top of the head and say: \nRobert, you did a good job. You did well on your test.\n  Teachers got to know their students, got to recognize their moods and \nindividual needs. Teachers could see in the twinkle of their charges' \neyes what motivated their charges, and they could hear in the \ncollective groans of frustration what bewildered their charges. I had \nteachers who inspired me to learn.\n  I wanted that pat on the head. I wanted that pat on the back.\n  I wanted the other students to hear the teacher compliment me on \nhaving passed a hard test in spelling, doing a good job: 100 percent. \nRobert, you got 100 percent on your spelling test, and so on. And other \nboys and girls were likewise inspired.\n  I had teachers who seemed to be truly fulfilling a calling. Teachers \nin my youth could give hugs, and did. Teachers in my youth could \nenforce the rules, and they did.\n  Today, though crowded, distance seems to be the norm. Don't touch. \nDon't get too close. Don't get too involved. Don't spend too much time \nwith one student.\n  After school, students walk out of the schoolhouse door and into an \napathetic culture where passers-by don't bother to say hello, where \nneighbors often don't bother to learn other neighbors' names. Young \npeople are growing up in our society lacking respect for their elders, \nlacking respect for their peers, and lacking respect, all to often, \neven for themselves. And, in our world of two-parent working families \nand single mothers, it is harder than ever for parents to provide the \ndiscipline, the guidance, and the moral compass that our children so \ndesperately need.\n  Teachers are being led to feel that their place in a student's life \nends at the last bell of the day. A well-meaning teacher, in our \nsociety today, can rarely take a real interest in a student's life \nbeyond the schoolyard, without fear of being reprimanded by the school, \nwithout fear of being accused of some transgression, without fear even \nof being the subject of some lawsuit. There are plenty of well-meaning, \ntalented, inspiring teachers in our schools today. But, they are up \nagainst a lot. Too often today, parents resent a teacher who \ndisciplines their child. They put pressure on teachers to pass children \nwho should fail, and they put pressure on principals to bestow honors \non students who do not earn them. As a result, achievement is \ndowngraded. Excellence is not encouraged. Expectations are lowered.\n  In my youth, we were less sheltered from the responsibilities and the \nrealities of life than are the children of today. I know that may seem \nhard to believe. But I think it is true. Particularly in the coal camps \nwhere I grew up, we saw, up close, the consequences of our actions. \nChores left undone, meant hardships for the entire family. Death was \nalways lingering around the entrance to the coal mines. Hunger was a \nregular visitor. Money was scarce and it had real value. We saw what it \nwas to work hard for a day's wages, only to have those wages eaten up \npaying for the most basic of life's necessities.\n  May I say to the youth of the country, and to the youth who sit in \nthese Chambers on each side of the Presiding Officer's chair, my first \njob was in a gas station. They were not service stations in those days, \nthey were gas stations. I remember the cold mornings of January and \nFebruary 1935--my first job in a gas station. My pay? Fifty dollars a \nmonth. That is $600 a year. I walked 4 miles to work and 4 miles home, \nif I wasn't fortunate enough to be able to catch a ride on a milk truck \nor a bread truck.\n\n  My parents demanded a lot of me. They did not accept excuses. I knew \nthat if I got a whipping at school, another was waiting for me when I \ngot home or as soon as my parents heard about the whipping at school. \nAs much as my mom and dad may have wanted me to have a better life than \nthey had known, they seemed to know that the path to a better life was \nalso a rocky one. They didn't try to pave my way. They told me the \ntruth. They taught me to cut through the brush, to work hard to push \nbarriers out of my way, and to climb over the hurdles that \ncircumstances erected.\n  This is where I think we have failed, in many instances, our young \npeople today. We shower them with material goods. We buy them a car to \ndrive just around the corner to the schoolyard. We protect their egos \nlike fine china. We encourage them to take the easy route. Books are \ndumbed down to make studies easier. Tests are abandoned or graded on a \ncurve because too many students can't pass them. Our history books, so-\ncalled history books, are bland and inaccurate because we have changed \nthe story, left out the heroes, and glossed over the ugly realities of \nour past.\n  Make no mistake about it, this country has made its fair share of \nmistakes. We have had more than a helping or two of ugliness. But to \npick up a history book today and read of the politically correct \nShangri-La portrayed within, you would hardly know it. How can we \npossibly expect our children to learn from our mistakes if we hide the \nrealities of our mistakes from them? Sugar-coated history cannot teach.\n  My experiences have led me to conclude that for the sake of our \nchildren and for the future of our Nation we must insist upon a return \nto excellence. We need to teach the value of hard work. We ought not be \nafraid of it. I never knew anyone who died from hard work, except John \nHenry, the steel-driving man.\n  We need to honor and reward real achievement. We need to temper \nreward with reality. We need to insist on civility. We could do a lot \nof that right here in this Chamber. We need to encourage understanding, \nnot deny differences. We need less high tech and more high standards. \nAbove all--we have heard it so many times, I will say it again because \nit is true--we need to get back to basics.\n  We need to ensure that our children are provided a firm foundation in \nreading, in writing, in arithmetic, in science, in history. We need to \nensure that our schools are places in which our students can learn. \nThat is much of what we have been talking about for the last 8 weeks in \nthis Chamber. That is much of what this legislation we passed today is \nabout.\n  We need to ensure that the schoolhouse is a place of study, of hard \nwork, not revelry. We need more, not less, discipline. It is time for a \nreturn to the days when traditional values like respect, loyalty, \nhonor, and integrity meant something. A lot of us could also learn \nthese things anew.\n  I truly believe that in our desire to find the cure to our \neducational problems, we have gone far afield. We have neglected \nperhaps the most important ingredient. High-tech gadgets, glossy \ntextbooks filled with pictures but little narrative, costly frills, and \nbigger buildings are not the answer. The innate desire to learn that \nresides in the human spirit is the commodity that we are wasting. It is \na precious commodity, indeed, and it will flow abundantly if given \nthe attention, the direction, the encouragement that it needs to take \nfirm root.\n\n  Challenge is the component which we seem to fear: Let's don't have \nchallenge; Let's don't have too much competition.\n  Challenge a child to learn something difficult. Challenge a child to \nbe the best in his class. I say that almost to every young person with \nwhom I stop to talk: Be the best in your class; be the best. Make that \nchild know that hard work pays off. Ask him for more,\n\n[[Page S6365]]\n\nnot less. Encourage him to find his unique talents. Then work with \nthose youngsters who have a tougher time; don't lower the standards, \nlift the sights. Encourage our children to reach as high as they can. \nDon't tolerate less. Reward them, then, for achievement.\n  Yet instead of challenging our children to do their best, I believe \nthat all too often the focus of today's education system has become \nquite different. We have all been told that new theories and creative \nmethods would bring new life to our failing public schools. We have put \nbillions into almost every trendy remedy offered. We have tried \neverything from audio language labs to personal computers to team \nteaching to new math to teacher empowerment, and still we flounder.\n  According to the testing, we still suffer from a pervasive inability \nto pass on the accumulated knowledge of civilization from one \ngeneration to the next.\n  What is the problem? Well, the problems are legion. But the major \nproblem, I suspect, is the systematic discarding of traditional \nscholarship as an agreed-upon goal. Instead many in the education \nestablishment have opted for a strange form of psychological and social \nexperiments in our schools and often with disastrous results that \nshortchange and even denigrate true academic achievement and \nexcellence.\n  The goals, the ideals, the practices, and curricula have been altered \nover the past three decades, usually without the clear awareness of \nparents. The result is inferior standards both for the teaching of \nstudents and for the training of teachers.\n  The usual answer to such complaints is ``we need more money.'' Surely \nif we pour enough money into our education coffers, something of value \nwill be produced. I used to firmly believe this golden rule of \neducational cause and effect. I am a little skeptical of it now.\n  In 1959-60, we were spending, on average, $375 per student in our \npublic elementary and secondary schools. That amounts to $2,065 per \nstudent adjusted for inflation. In 1997-98, we were spending $6,662 for \nevery child, roughly three times the amount we spent in 1959-60.\n  In inflation adjusted dollars, we are now spending three times more \nper child than in 1960, when in 1960 performance was generally higher \nthan it is today.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for \nEducation Statistics, in the fall of 1959, there were a total of 35 \nmillion students enrolled in America's public elementary and secondary \nschools.\n  In the fall of 1999, 40 years later, there were 46,800,000 students, \nan increase of 11 million students in 40 years. The pupil-to-teacher \nratio in 1959-1960 was roughly 26 students for every teacher. In 1999, \nagain, 40 years later, the student-to-teacher ratio had improved to \nroughly 16 students for every teacher. I am talking about full-time \nteachers. In other words, the data shows that there were fewer students \nfor each teacher in 1999 than there were in 1959-1960.\n  I remember in my high school graduation class, there were 28 students \nwho ended up with diplomas. That was in 1934. We had 28 students in my \nclass, not 90 or 100. But there was discipline. We paid attention. We \nhad teachers who demanded that of us, teachers who could teach, \nteachers who loved us, teachers who were dedicated, and we learned from \nthem.\n  The growth of support personnel in the education area has mushroomed. \nSuch things as reading specialists, guidance counselors, special ed \nteachers, clerical assistants, teacher's aides, have grown from 700,000 \nin 1960 to 2.5 million in 1999--almost a fourfold increase. And \nalthough America has one of the highest costs of education per student, \nit is not first in teacher salaries.\n  What do our dollars buy? We had 2,826,146 teachers in our elementary \nand secondary schools in 1998, as opposed to 1,353,372 teachers in \n1959-1960. So we have roughly doubled the number of teachers we had 40 \nyears ago. But we had 93,058 guidance counselors in 1998 compared to \n14,643 in 1959-1960, or more than 5 times the number of guidance \ncounselors.\n  We have poured money--and I have voted for it--we have poured money \ninto title I funding. Yet we skimp on funding for the gifted and the \ntalented. I got in on the ground floor when it comes to Federal \neducation programs and funding for education. I was in the House of \nRepresentatives when there was a great debate as to whether or not we \nshould spend Federal moneys on Federal programs for education. I have \nno problem with helping truly disadvantaged children gain good skills, \nbut I fear that the definition of ``disadvantaged'' has been broadened \nto cover a variety of learning problems, and a good solid education is \nbecoming less of a priority than identifying children for counseling or \nspecial help so that more title I funds will flow.\n  Our children's failure to learn is not, I suspect, the fault of \npoverty always. In some of the most poverty-stricken families I have \nseen in my lifetime, many of the best students were nurtured. So our \nchildren's failure to learn is not, I suspect, the fault of poverty \nalways, or of being emotionally damaged by their environment, as much \nas it is due, in many instances, to faddism, political correctness, and \na general failure to teach with tried and true methods.\n  I may be a bit vain--we are all vain--but I believe I could teach \nstudents. I don't know anything about the modern methods of teaching. I \ndon't care about that. As far as I am concerned, I could teach those \nchildren. I am not a teacher, nor is every Senator in this body. A few \nSenators here have been schoolteachers. But I think most, if not all, \nof the Senators on both sides of the aisle could be good teachers--\ncertainly in some subjects. I am not saying I would be a good teacher \nin chemistry or physics. But put me in a classroom with children, give \nme a good text book, and I could teach history, reading, spelling, and \nso on. So perhaps we spend too much time on methodology. I speak as a \nlayman today, but I have some perception of what is going on in this \ncountry and some opinion as to what ought to be done.\n  One of my perceptions is that many teachers would have to spend a \ngreat deal of time on methodology, the newest method of teaching this \nor that subject. Just give me Muzzy's American History, and I am vain \nenough to think that I could teach. What I am saying is we probably \nexpect too much of our teachers in many ways--teaching this new method \nand that new method--but not enough of substance, which has been here \nfrom the beginning. H2O was H2O when Adam and Eve were in the garden, \nyou see. CO2 was CO2 way back yonder. So H2O hasn't changed since Adam \nand Eve were driven from the garden. It is still plain old water, \ndrinking water; it tastes the same. It has not changed, much like human \nnature. That hasn't changed from the beginning, since Cane slew Abel. \nMen and women are still slaying one another.\n  So, in my view, we need to take an entirely new look at the way we \nfund education, at the way we train teachers, and at the curricula and \nthe methods used on our children.\n  Our public school system has become top heavy with a whole host of \npeople who are not directly involved with getting our kids to learn. We \nhave more teachers, but fewer of them have degrees in the subjects they \nteach, and fewer of them see teaching as a lifelong career. We are \nturning our kids loose on the job market with too few tools and little \nor no appreciation for what a good education means for their futures.\n  Children who fail to achieve a college education will lose some \n$20,000 a year in income as adults. The former CEO of Xerox, David \nKearns, estimates that poor schooling costs businesses some $50 billion \na year in remedial work.\n  We are failing our kids and we are failing our kids in the most \nfundamental responsibility that we have to them--the responsibility to \nprovide them with a good education.\n  Children need to know what is expected of them. Then they need to be \ngiven the tools with which to achieve their goals. They need to be told \nthat it is a tough old world out there--a tough old world--and that the \ncompetition is global--not just in Sophia, my hometown of 1,160 souls. \nThe competition is global. There will be no dumbing down of standards \nout there in that world. There will be no grade inflation out there in \nthe real world. There will be no social promotion out there in the real \nworld of global competition. It is going to be rough.\n\n[[Page S6366]]\n\n  The consequences for a poor education will be lifelong, and the \nconsequences will be harsh. And that is another thing that we should be \nteaching our children, namely, that there are consequences for one's \nactions and inactions. I do not view this bill through rose colored \nglasses as the definitive cure to what ails our educational system, but \nI think that bill that passed a little earlier today is at least a \ndeparture from the status quo. That legislation looks at education from \nnew angles, and offers the chance--the chance--to get a better handle \non the challenge before us.\n\n  The public school choice provisions offer some degree of hope, though \nlimited, to parents who are fighting failing schools and trying \ndesperately to give their children a solid education.\n  These are the most important people in the world: their children. \nThese are the parents' most priceless possession: their children. No \nwonder people are searching for some other way. No wonder. They want \ntheir children to have the best. They want their children to have good \nteachers.\n  Furthermore, this legislation we passed today puts our public schools \non notice that they must improve. So we are saying to the public school \nsystem, we are saying to the administrators in that system, we are \nsaying to the principals and the teachers in that system, we are saying \nto the teachers union they must improve.\n  The bill also creates consequences if schools do not improve. So the \ntime of reckoning is at hand. The legislation requires annual testing \nto track our children's progress in the areas of mathematics, science, \nreading, and history.\n  Moreover, the legislation insists upon a national gauge to more \naccurately measure public schools and to help compare what works and \nwhat does not work.\n  This bill also places an emphasis on teacher quality. When will we \ncome to know in this country that no pricetag can be placed upon \nteacher quality? No pricetag. An emphasis is put on recruiting \nqualified teachers. When are we going to learn that a qualified, \ndedicated, conscientious teacher is worth far more than the finest \nathlete in this country, far more than the most clever, sharpest, most \nattractive network anchor man or woman? The teacher is worth far more--\nthe teacher.\n  The teacher holds in his or her hands that most priceless resource \npossessed by this Nation. That teacher molds that child, its outlook, \nits attitude.\n\n       I took a piece of plastic clay\n       And idly fashioned it one day,\n\n       And as my fingers pressed it still\n       It moved and yielded to my will.\n\n       I came again when days were past,\n       The bit of clay was hard at last.\n\n       The form I gave it, it still bore,\n       And I could change that form no more.\n\n       I took a piece of living clay\n       And gently formed it day by day,\n\n       And molded with my power and art\n       A young child's soft and yielding heart.\n\n       I came again when years were gone,\n       He was a man I looked upon.\n\n       He still that early impress wore,\n       And I could change him nevermore.\n\n  That is the teacher. The responsibilities placed on a good teacher \nare heavy in today's world certainly.\n  How can we expect as a nation to continue to be a world leader with a \npopulation that is ignorant of the worth of a good teacher, a \npopulation that is ignorant of the basics in math, science, and \nhistory?\n  I understand that in some States history is not a required course in \nthe curricula of public schools. What a shame. What a mistake. Cicero \nsaid: To be ignorant of what occurred before you were born is to remain \nalways a child.\n  I am not talking about social studies. Social studies are all right \nin their place. I am talking about history. It has been considerably \ngarbled these days. We try to change the facts of history, but the \nfacts are there, and they ought to be taught. We ought to be plain \nabout it, upfront about it, and try to profit by our mistakes.\n  Provisions that I supported in this bill are aimed at addressing the \nlack of qualified math and science teachers in this Nation.\n  At this point, I should also say that whatever dollar figure emerges \nfrom the House-Senate conference on this bill will place a burden on \nthe appropriators to fund, given the tight budget constraints under \nwhich we will be laboring and the behemoth tax cuts which siphoned off \nmany of the dollars which could have been used to pay for this bill, \nbut if the President signs the bill that emanates from the conference, \nthen I will assume--and I think I will have a right to assume--that the \nAppropriations Committee will have the help of the White House and the \nhelp on both sides of the aisle to provide the money to fund the bill.\n  I hope some of the new approaches contained in the bill will foster \nincreased excellence among our Nation's schools, but I believe we are \ngoing to need further reform. While I can agree with the ``leave no \nchild behind'' slogan which has characterized the President's education \ninitiative and much of the debate on this legislation, I hope we also \nwill endeavor to slow no child down if that child has extraordinary \nabilities. And the child does not have to come out of an affluent home \nto have extraordinary abilities.\n  I fear that sometimes in our approach to education we concentrate so \nmuch on bringing the slower students up to speed that we fail the child \nwho can and should race ahead. And while testing for achievement is a \ngood idea, it will mean little if the focus is on manipulating scores \nin order to make parents feel good or in order to capture more \neducation dollars from the Federal Government for the school.\n  I don't believe in bumper sticker politics. I don't believe in bumper \nsticker education policy. It is time to look afresh at why we are \nfailing our kids, regardless of whose flaws that fresh look may reveal. \nMore money won't help if it is not properly used. More teachers won't \nhelp much if they are not properly trained. Our society has changed. \nThere are more single-parent families and more families where both \nparents work today. Simple changes such as a 9-to-5 schoolday might do \nmore to address some of the problems in our schools than all the \ncounselors and afterschool programs we can fund.\n  Look at the other industrial countries of this world. They don't make \nlife quite so easy as we like to do here in this country, apparently. \nWe spend gobs of money, train loads of money--and I have voted for it \nfor more than 50 years, 49 years to be exact--yet today we are not \nturning out the quality of students with quality education that many of \nour industrial competitors are turning out. They go to school longer in \nthose countries and so the work is harder.\n  School uniforms might make students focus more on their heads and \nless on their bodies. The longer schoolday might do more to address \nsome of the problems in our schools than all of the counselor and \nafterschool programs we can find. Better textbooks that utilize the \ntried and true methods of teaching could certainly go a long way toward \nshoring up basic skills. It might not be a bad idea to bring back the \nold McGuffy readers. An emphasis on classic literature and poetry could \nprovide our youngsters with a glimpse of beauty and a sense of the \nspiritual side of human nature so absent in our empty, vulgar, popular \nculture. Clearly, there is much more to do in education than can be \ndone in one single piece of legislation.\n  We cannot afford to lose another generation of children to fads. \nJames A. Garfield, a President of the United States, who was \nassassinated, said: Give me my old teacher, Mark Hopkins, on one end of \nthe log and me, myself, on the other end, and there will be a \nuniversity.\n  So, it is the teacher, the child, and the attitude that count.\n  We cannot afford to deafen our ears to all views except those in the \neducation establishment. We must strive again for excellence in \nlearning and to return to proven methods, no matter whose toes it may \nstep on. The public is outraged. The survival of the public school \nsystem is at stake, not to mention the future of our children and our \nNation. I think the education establishment--meaning the \nadministrators, the principals, the teachers, the teachers unions, and \nall--had better read the handwriting on the wall. A good public school \nsystem is what this Nation needs. It is what we want. That is what we \nhave been spending millions of dollars for. But it is time to wake up, \ntime for an accounting, time to understand that all things are not well \nin this public school system. And if we don't shape up--you talk about \nvouchers,\n\n[[Page S6367]]\n\ntalk about private schools--you better be watching the handwriting on \nthe wall.\n  Some years ago I traveled down to the old Biblical city of Babylon by \nthe side of the Euphrates River and I visited a place where it was said \nthat Belshazzar feasted with 1,000 of his lords. And as he feasted, \nblind and dying, there appeared on the wall near the candlestick, a \nhand. That hand wrote on the wall. And Belshazzar summoned all of his \nmagicians and his wise men and asked them to interpret the handwriting \nthat appeared on the wall. It seems to me the handwriting said: mene, \nmene, tekel, upharsin. I hope that is right. It has been a while since \nI read it: Mene, mene, tekel, upharsin. And the queen said, this young \nman who can interpret that writing, his name is Daniel. And so the king \nwho was trembling, his knees were shaking, summoned Daniel.\n  Daniel was asked to interpret the writing. And he interpreted the \nwriting to mean: God, thou art weighed in the balances and art found \nwanting. God hath numbered thy kingdom and finished it.\n  That night, Belshazzar was slain and his kingdom was taken over by \nthe Medes and Persians. So we should see the handwriting on the wall. \nWe better learn that the public school system needs to shape up. We \nspend billions on it. Parents need to back up their teachers and \nparticipate in the PTAs, and we should pay teachers, good teachers, \nsalaries that are commensurate with their worth.\n\n  No football player was ever equal to the worth of a good teacher. No \ntelevision anchorperson was ever worth more than a good teacher. That \nmay sound like an extremist talking, but there is something to what I \nam saying. You better believe it. And I might say this, too. There is \nno politician who is ever worth more than a good teacher.\n  When American students do so poorly in international mathematics \nassessments that they score 19th out of 21 nations, the handwriting \nshould be on the wall. It is clear that it is not vouchers that \nthreaten our public schools. It is the inadequate education that our \npublic schools offer and parental frustration that threaten to \nundermine confidence in public education. And it is high time that we \nrealize that.\n  There are many public schools that are great schools. There are a lot \nof good schools in this country, and a lot of good teachers. But we \nneed to lift the level of all the boats.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Education, nearly 1 million \nchildren have been pulled out of public schools and are being educated \nat home by their parents. That number is sure to grow.\n  Yes, parents are concerned by the violence that is occurring in the \nschools, concerned by the falling grades of their children, concerned \nby the lack of discipline in the public schools, concerned that for the \nmoney spent we are turning out worse students, generally speaking, than \nit used to be when we were spending far less money.\n  It is up to us who do believe in public schooling to see what is \nhappening and to do whatever it takes to restore confidence in public \neducation. We owe that to our kids. We owe that to their parents. And \nwe owe it to the country we all claim to love.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/14/senate-section/article/S6367-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                FLAG DAY\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

It is the birthday of our Stars and \nStripes. It was on June 14, 1777, that the Second Continental Congress \npassed the resolution authorizing the creation of a flag to symbolize \nthe new Nation, the United States of America.\n  This is not a federal holiday, but to me it is one of the most \nimportant days of the year. Flag day is our nation's way of honoring, \ncelebrating, and paying our respects to the very symbol of our nation. \nAs the poem says: ``more than the flag is passing by.''\n  Henry Ward Beecher explained that ``a thoughtful mind when it sees \nour nation's flag, sees not the flag, but the nation itself.''\n  More than this, Old Glory represents the values and principles of our \nnation. It commemorates our nation's glorious past, and it offers hope \nfor an even more glorious future.\n  Born at the beginning of the American Revolution, the Stars and \nStripes is a celebration of our independence and our freedom as well as \nour strength and our security. It was there, being raised and saluted \nduring some of the proudest moments in our nation's history as in Iwo \nJima in 1945 and on the Moon in 1969. And it has been there in every \nmajor conflict in American history as millions of young Americans have \nmarched off to battle under the flag. It was at Fort McHenry during the \nWar of 1812. It was there at Gettysburg, at San Juan Hill, and at \nNormandy.\n  But more than soldiers have been inspired and guided by our Nation's \ncolors.\n  I can't begin to explain what a thrill it is for me to visit a school \nand see young children putting their chubby hands on their hearts and \npledging allegiance to ``the flag of the United States of America and \nto the republic for which it stands.'' When I see such a sight, I feel \nconfident for the future of our great land. Whatever our current \ntroubles might be, I somehow know that everything will be all right. \nOur flag, as it has throughout our history, continues to transcend our \ndifferences, and affirm our common bond as a people and our solemn \nunity as a great Nation.\n  The United States Senate now begins each morning by pledging \nallegiance to the flag. Speaking those few, but stirring, words, while \nlooking at Old Glory, still inspires me and reminds me of how fortunate \nI am to be an American, to be a West Virginian, and to be a United \nStates Senator.\n  On Flag Day, 1917, President Woodrow Wilson noted: ``though silent it \n[our flag] speaks to us'' and indeed it does.\n  It speaks to us of great events--of our liberty; of our history; of \nour future. It speaks to us of the freedom that is the basis, and the \nenduring promise, of our Republic.\n  ``Hats off,'' Mr President, ``the colors before us fly; But more than \nthe flag is passing by.''\n  I close by citing those memorable, moving lines from the second \nstanza of our national anthem:\n\n     Tis the Star-Spangled Banner. O long may it wave\n     O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nproceedings under the quorum call be dispensed with, and that I be \nallowed to proceed in morning business for 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

Since 1986, I \nhad the privilege of having Suzy on my staff. During her tenure on my \nstaff, she was a model employee whose expertise, dedication, diligence \nand attention to detail enabled my office to respond to constituents \nefficiently and effectively.\n  Suzy played a vital role in advancing and modernizing our office's \nmail system. She arrived in the era of carbon copies and mimeograph \nmachines, but she helped implement a new mail system that responds to \nthe needs of the computer era when letters are as likely to arrive by \nemail as they are by the US Postal Service. While my constituents may \nhave never had the opportunity to personally meet Suzy, tens of \nthousands of them received constituent services, United States flags \nflown over the Capital and heard from me by mail because of her \norganization and efforts.\n  Suzy was more than a dedicated employee. She was a warm and friendly \nwoman whose infectious smile, sense of humor and love for the \nPittsburgh Steelers filled our office, and earned her friends \nthroughout the Senate. It seems as if everyone knew Suzy. She was the \none who welcomed interns and told my staffers, who are prone to working \nlong days, to remember to call their parents. When members of my staff \nwent to the Senate Printing Office or the Architect of the Capitol, \nthey were often admonished with orders to say ``Hello to Suzy.''\n  I wish that more of my constituents had the opportunity to meet Suzy \nand her husband Rick. The two of them worked together in the United \nStates Senate, and this is a better place because of them.\n  Suzy and Rick's dedication extended far beyond work. They were \ndedicated to each other, their three children, their family and their \nGod. Together, they embodied the American values of hard-work, faith \nand loyalty. Suzy and Rick, both natives of North Carolina, recently \ncelebrated another anniversary together. Their love for each other was \nevident to all. Rick works as the Facilities Supervisor under the \nOffice of the Superintendent, and Suzy would come into work with him, \nhours before our office opened so that she could ride to and from work \nwith him. After work, Suzy frequently volunteered at her church where \nshe was a regular attendee and an important contributor. She is \nsurvived by three wonderful daughters: Andrea, Candice and Dawn of whom \nshe was extremely proud and talked about frequently.\n  One never is able to prepare for the death of a friend or loved one. \nHowever, I trust that the friends, family and faith that were so \nimportant to Suzy in her life will continue to sustain her family in \nthe days, months and years ahead. I and my staff will keep Suzy Joyce \nand her family in our thoughts and prayers. I know that the Senate \nfamily joins me in offering their condolences to the family of Verna \n``Suzy'' Joyce on the occasion of their great loss.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/14/senate-section/article/S6368-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 1 P.M.
