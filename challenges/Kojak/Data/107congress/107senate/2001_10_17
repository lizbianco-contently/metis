Mr. President, I certainly do not have all the details, but \nwe do know that more than 20 people in Senator Daschle's office have \nbeen infected with anthrax. The tests have come back positive.\n  Senator Daschle had a meeting at the White House early this morning, \nand he has been meeting with his staff since he came back. I have not \nhad an opportunity to speak with him. My heart goes out to Senator \nDaschle. I have spent a great deal of time with him and know what a \ncaring person he is and how much he cares about his staff. I spend a \ngreat deal of time with his staff as a result of working with him on \nmatters relating to the activities of the Senate. He has a wonderful \nstaff. Sometimes I feel they are my staff. I am very close to Senator \nDaschle's staff.\n  I can imagine the heartbreak he is experiencing as a result of these \npeople going through this personal turmoil as a result of working for \nhim. I know I speak for the entire Senate when I say that our thoughts \nand our prayers go out to Senator Daschle personally, his lovely wife \nLinda, and his entire staff that this will be of short duration. We \nhave been told the sickness they have will be of short duration. \nCertainly, the medicine that is available will cure the problems that \nare present. We are fortunate we do have the medicine available to do \nthis.\n  My thoughts cannot contemplate the evil nature of such an act on \ninnocent people working in Senator Daschle's office opening mail, \nanswering constituent mail, doing those activities that one does \nworking for a public servant. A lot of them are very young.\n  This is a tremendously evil act. I hope these people will be brought \nto justice; that the full weight of this Government will be used to \nsearch out these people who would perpetrate this evil through this \ndiabolical scheme they engendered. I do not know what satisfaction they \nget out of doing such acts.\n  We are the greatest country in the history of the world. We are far \nfrom perfect, but certainly we are going to overcome this. It is a very \nsmall setback, and we will proceed stronger than ever.\n  Again, my heart is overwhelmed today with a feeling of anxiety and \nsadness for the majority leader of the Senate for the burden he has \nrecognizing that because he is who he is, people in his office are \nsick. I know him and know how much heartache this causes him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/17/senate-section/article/S10779-7", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10779-S10780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MEASURE PLACED ON CALENDAR--H.R. 2646\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, as I did yesterday, I think it might be \nhelpful if I report to our Senate colleagues and to the extended Senate \nfamily about circumstances now over the last 24 hours.\n  Let me say, I have been especially appreciative, again, of the \nservices provided to the Senate, especially by our extraordinary \nSergeant at Arms and our Secretary of the Senate, who have just done an \noutstanding job of responding to the many challenges that we have faced \nover the last few days, especially.\n  I thank Secretary Tommy Thompson for his great cooperation, the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, the Capitol Police for their \nwork, and, finally--and certainly it should have been at the top of the \nlist, if I was listing anybody--our distinguished Republican leader. \nSenator Lott has been there shoulder to shoulder with me on every one \nof these occasions and over the course of the last couple of days. Our \npartnership is strong, but our friendship is even stronger. And that \ncould not be in greater evidence than it has been over the last couple \nof days.\n  We will have a vote this afternoon on the Interior appropriations \nconference report. That conference report will come over to the Senate \nsometime this afternoon. As my colleagues probably know, the conference \nreport is currently being debated in the House. Obviously, I am quite \nsure it will be adopted. Once it is, and once it is sent over to us, \nthere will be a rollcall vote on the Interior appropriations conference \nreport this afternoon.\n  There will also be a vote on the conference report on the military \nconstruction appropriations bill tomorrow. We do not know the time yet. \nWe will certainly notify our colleagues. In part, we do not know the \ntime because I am not sure what the House schedule is; that also will \nbe a piece of business that we will take up.\n  It is my hope that we may be able to take up nominations as well. I \nwill be consulting with the Republican leader and with my chairs in \nregard to the degree to which Executive Calendar matters could be \nconsidered and, hopefully, voted upon either today or tomorrow.\n  So we have a good deal of business that we will be conducting. Again, \none of the reasons why is because of the outstanding job that all of \nour service personnel have provided in accommodating our schedule, as \nwe have continued to work through the immediate challenge that we have \nfaced with the anthrax experience.\n  Mr. President, I could not be more proud of my staff for the way they \nhave conducted themselves, for the attitude they have reflected at \nevery step of the way, the professionalism they demonstrated on Monday, \nand the attitude and the degree to which they have taken each one of \nthese moments in stride.\n  We have had a good number of discussions and consultations and \nmeetings with members of my staff. It is now at a point where I think \nwe can say that 31 members of my staff, and a certain number of Capitol \nPolice, were found to have tested positive as a result of the nasal \nswab that was administered to them a couple of days ago.\n  A positive result on a nasal swab simply means they were exposed to \nthe anthrax bacteria. Not one incident of infection has been recorded \nor reported. There is a huge difference between exposure--as is \nrevealed by the nasal swab, if it is positive--and the actual infection \nitself. Antibiotics were administered immediately, even though we did \nnot know the results of the nasal swabs, whether they were going to be \npositive or negative. And because of the early access to the \nantibiotics, the overwhelming advice I am now being given by all health \ncare personnel is that each of my staff members will be OK. I am \ngratified to hear that, I am gratified to repeat that, and I will \ncontinue to emphasize that fact as we go forward.\n  In part because of the limited exposure, in part because of the \nopportunity to be administered the antibiotic quickly, in part because \nof the professional response all the way through this process, we are \nvery confident about our ability to provide for the needs of each of my \nstaff, with every expectation--I would say 100-percent expectation--\nthat they will be treated successfully. So we feel very good about the \ncurrent circumstances involving treatment and involving the response to \nthe antibiotics already shown by members of the staff.\n  As many of our colleagues know, the exposure was limited, at this \npoint, to two locations: My office in the Hart Building, Room 509; and \nthe mail room in the Dirksen Building. There is no evidence currently \nthat anyone in the mail room has been exposed to the point where they \nwould receive a positive nasal swab, although we will be getting those \ntest results back in the coming days. About 1,400 people were\n\n[[Page S10781]]\n\nprovided with the nasal swab yesterday. The results of those swabs will \nnot be provided for at least 24 hours.\n  Let me also add that we have been working in close concert with the \nCenters for Disease Control. Russell 325 will be our information center \nfor the balance of the afternoon.\n  There is a meeting ongoing in SC-5 for senior members of all Senate \nstaff. Chiefs of staff and office managers are certainly welcome. I am \nquite sure most people have been made aware. We will provide ongoing \ninformation in a myriad of additional ways, both technologically as \nwell as telephonically. We will provide that information as we deem it \nimportant to share.\n  Again, let me emphasize three things: First, I believe very \nconfidently that we have, as a result of the outstanding work done by \nall of those professionals who have been on the scene, dealt with this \nincident in as successful a manner as is possible. I repeat that I am \nvery grateful I can say today that the health care professionals have \nindicated that my staff will be not only OK but perfectly healthy as a \nresult of the actions that have been taken. We will be closing the \noffices, the Senate offices: Russell, Dirksen, and Hart, for the next \ncouple of days in order to accommodate the environmental research that \nwill be required to ensure that whatever additional material there may \nbe could be found, if there is some.\n  We have no indication there is any additional information that would \nlead us to believe it is not confined to the mail room as well as to my \noffice, but we are going to do a sweep of the area. In order to \naccommodate that sweep successfully, those three buildings will be \nclosed. It is strictly precautionary. I emphasize, there is no evidence \nto suggest we are doing anything other than what we should to ensure \nthat we can open, with all the confidence that I expect we will have, \non Monday morning.\n  We will use the time we have available to us just to ensure that we \nhave checked the entire complex of office space so we can open on \nMonday without fear of any further exposure.\n  Finally, let me emphasize, we will be in constant contact with every \noffice all the way through the course of the next several days. Of \ncourse, we will be in session today and tomorrow. That, too, will \nfacilitate our ability to communicate with all Senators.\n  I thank all colleagues for their great cooperation. We had a good \nmeeting this morning, as we did yesterday, on both sides of the aisle. \nThere were excellent questions. I am proud of our Senators for the \nleadership they are providing and proud of our Senators for the \nattitude they take back to their offices and to their States. I am \nproud of our Senators for the way they have conducted themselves under \nthese unusual circumstances.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, may I say to our distinguished majority \nleader that having been a part of that meeting for well over an hour \nthis morning, which you and Senator Lott and other leaders conducted, \nwe all were given a full opportunity to express our views, but \nthroughout, we recognized the enormous pressure that you, as our \nleader, have been under because of the hit on your personal office \nstaff.\n  Throughout that meeting and indeed throughout these days, you have \nstood with enormous personal courage and have won, if it were possible, \neven greater admiration than we had, from those of us who serve in this \ninstitution.\n  This is my 23rd year to be privileged to be a Senator. I have served \nunder several majority leaders, assistant majority leaders, Republican \nleaders and Democratic leaders, all kinds and types, but you will be \nremembered in the annals of the history of this institution for the \ncourage, personal and professional, that you have exhibited.\n  I thank you also for working with Senator Lott and others in striking \nthe proper balance, the obligation we have to our staffs, those who are \nvisiting the Capitol, the infrastructure that serves us, balancing the \nneed to give them adequate protection and at the same time enabling the \nSenate to continue to function.\n  As I said this morning, our Nation is at war. We have men and women \nof the Armed Forces in harm's way at this very moment carrying out the \norders of our proud and strong Commander in Chief, the President. It is \nimportant, as they read about this chapter in the Congress, that they \nbelieve we are showing commensurate courage in facing the unknown. That \nis important. Indeed, the world will be observing us.\n  I commend my distinguished leader and the Republican leader and \nothers. In the days to come, we will face the situation, and we are \nfortunate to have an extra group of experts coming in to advise all of \nus.\n  I thank the majority leader very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I join my colleague from Virginia in \nsaluting Senator Daschle for his leadership at this moment in the \nhistory of the Senate. He and Senator Lott, on a bipartisan basis, \ncalled together the Members of the Senate for the second straight day \nto the Senate dining room to discuss the situation on Capitol Hill. I \nthink the decision that has been made for the Senate is the right \ndecision.\n  I watched some of the television press reports, and I don't think \nthey quite understand what is happening. So there is clarification, to \nthis point, we have found that some 31 people on Capitol Hill have been \nexposed to anthrax, though there is no evidence of infection. Many \nothers have been tested on a precautionary basis. I have invited my \nstaff and other Members have as well; if they think this is something \nthey would like to do, they are perfectly welcome to it, if they think \nthey might have come in contact with anthrax that was mailed to Senator \nDaschle's office. Although this is a cause of some concern, it takes \nliterally thousands of these spores to cause the kind of infection that \nwould have to be treated.\n  The precautions that are being taken are the right precautions. To \nhave the press characterize this, as some television stations have, as \nan evacuation of Capitol Hill is just plain wrong.\n  What is going to happen tomorrow in the Senate office buildings, the \nHart Building, in which Senator Daschle's office is located, and the \ntwo other buildings, Russell and Dirksen, is that we will bring in \nenvironmental survey crews which will literally test those buildings to \nfind out if there is any evidence of contamination. The equipment that \nis being used takes up some space and involves some processing. The \ndecision was made--the right decision--to ask the staff tomorrow to \nvacate those three office buildings. In the meantime, in the Capitol \nBuilding, we will be in business in the Senate. We will be debating \nissues and voting on them, as we should.\n  Some of the reports in the press really haven't come to grips with \nthe reality of what we face and how we are reacting. Some have asked, \nare you overreacting? The honest answer is: The leaders are trying to \nbe as careful as possible for the thousands of people who work here, \nfor the visitors, for the college students who come to volunteer. We \nare being as careful as possible. Secondly, it is our good fortune this \nis not a regular occurrence so we don't exactly have a protocol to \nfollow. We are going to be developing one by this experience so we will \nknow what should and should not be done and can give advice after this \nexperience to others. That is valuable. It will help in our public \nhealth effort to deal with anthrax or any other threats of \nbioterrorism.\n  I remind those who are following this occurrence--and it has been \nsaid and should be repeated every time we speak--this anthrax, again, \neven if you were exposed to it, can be successfully treated with \nantibiotics so that people should have no fear of losing their lives \nbecause of this exposure. Basic treatment by antibiotics can make \ncertain that you don't have any serious outcome because of an \ninfection.\n  This morning the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Tommy \nThompson, former Governor of Wisconsin, testified before the Committee \non Governmental Affairs. His testimony was excellent. His agency, along \nwith the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease \nControl, is trying to envision what needs to be done to protect \nAmerica. Since September 11, we have a feeling of vulnerability.\n\n[[Page S10782]]\n\n  Our leaders in Washington, the Senate and the House, and with the \nPresident and his administration, are trying to envision those needs to \nmake America's peace of mind return.\n  I am happy they are ordering the necessary immunizations, the \nnecessary antibiotics, so that if there is a public health need, we \nwill be there.\n  They are also going to invest in State and local public health \nsources so we can respond quickly to any questions that are raised. \nThis is a time of testing for America, but it is a time when we will \nrise to the occasion and pass this test. This country was hit hard on \nSeptember 11. Because of that, many of us have seen in our churches and \nsynagogues and temples more and more people looking for spiritual \nguidance. We have seen families come closer together, with a stronger \nfeeling of patriotism. All of this reaches to the spirit of this \ncountry, our values and principles.\n  We will withstand this test and survive. When it is all over, America \nwill have the peace of mind of knowing we have led a global effort to \nfight terrorism. Whether in the Middle East or homegrown here in the \nUnited States, it is all despicable and cowardly. Frankly, we should be \nthe leaders and join our coalition in the successful battle against it. \nWhat we are going through on Capitol Hill will be remembered, I am \nsure, for a long time. I hope what is also remembered is the \ndetermination of men and women in the House and Senate, Democrats and \nRepublicans, to stand up proudly and fight for this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, my colleague from Illinois and the \nmajority leader from South Dakota, Senator Daschle, have just spoken \nabout the challenges that have been presented to the Senate, our \nCapitol, and to our Nation, beginning with the heinous acts of mass \nmurder committed by sick, deranged terrorists on the date of September \n11 and continuing now to the actions of some demented people who would \nsend letters with spores of anthrax in those letters.\n  It is important, as Senator Daschle indicated a few minutes ago, \nbecause we now have a 24-hour news cycle in which things move very \nrapidly and reporting takes place at a very rapid pace, for us to sort \nout what is and what is not happening as a result of these terrorist \nattacks, specifically about what is happening on Capitol Hill with \nanthrax having been put in a letter addressed to the majority leader.\n  There is not an evacuation of the U.S. Capitol Building; there is not \nan evacuation of Senate offices. What is happening is a thoughtful, \ndeliberate approach to respond to this set of challenges. Senator \nDaschle and Senator Durbin both said--and I think it is important to \nunderscore--that those who have been identified as having been exposed \nto anthrax by the swab testing that has been done, are not at this \npoint infected by that exposure. They have simply been exposed. It is \nimportant to underscore that there are antibiotics available to deal \nwith that exposure if it becomes an infection. That is important for \npeople to understand. And the medical authorities have visited with a \njoint session of Republicans and Democrats this morning here in the \nCapitol and have gone over that information in some depth.\n\n  It is not the case that spores of anthrax have been found all over \nthis building. That is not the case at all. The reports we have at this \npoint in time are that spores of anthrax were discovered in a limited \narea, and the law enforcement authorities and leadership of the Senate \nhave taken actions that would attempt to make certain they don't spread \nbeyond that area, and that we take the precautions necessary for human \nhealth and also to make sure the environmental situation in buildings \nis assured.\n  I want to, as I describe this, say how proud I am of Senator Daschle, \nSenator Lott, and others, who in most cases have worked nearly around \nthe clock; especially, I am proud of Dr. Eisold and the Sergeant at \nArms, the Secretary of the Senate, and so many others, most of whom \nhave had very little sleep because they have been trying to respond to \nthis issue. The Centers for Disease Control team, folks from the NIH \nand Health and Human Services, are all here.\n  Also let me say how much I have appreciated for some long while the \nwork of the law enforcement authorities on Capitol Hill. These men and \nwomen have been working 12 hours a day and, in most cases, 6 days a \nweek every single day for the last month. They are the first \nresponders; they are the ones who put themselves in harm's way. We all \nshould spend some time thinking about what they do for us and the \nsacrifice they make for their country.\n  It is very important, as Senator Daschle indicated, for people not to \npanic. This is not a cause to panic. This is a letter that had some \nanthrax attached to it. All of the things we know about this anthrax, \nall that we know about the exposure, and all that we know about the \nability to treat that exposure, should it become an illness from that \nbacteria, would lead us to believe it is not at all cause to panic.\n  Is this a point of some concern? Is it worrisome that all of this \nhappened? Of course. We would be fools to deny that this is a \ntroublesome incident. Of course it is. It is probably not unexpected \nthat those terrorists who wish to cause chaos in our country and damage \nand inflict injury on innocent humans would try to do that in our \nNation's Capital and in the symbol of our Government here in the Senate \nor the House. But the response is not to be frightened. The response is \nto be thoughtful and careful and take the necessary steps to make \ncertain we protect the folks who work here and make certain we not \nallow this to happen again.\n  This is quite a remarkable country in which we live. We have faced a \nlot of challenges in many significant ways. Our country is a country \nthat has split the atom, spliced genes, learned how to clone animals, \ninvented great silicon chips, plastics, and learned how to build \nairplanes and how to fly them, built rockets, and flew to the Moon. We \ninvented the telephone. We invented the television. We invented \ncomputers. We cured polio and smallpox. We survived a civil war. We \nsurvived a great depression. We beat back the fascism of Hitler.\n  Through it all, this is the freest country on the face of the Earth, \nwith the strongest economy, providing the most opportunity for the most \ncitizens anywhere. That is not an accident. It is because through it \nall, through all of the challenges, all the tough times as well as the \ngood times, the center of the American people--the broad center that \nthinks through things in a clear way and uses inherent common sense in \ndeciding how to respond and when to respond--has largely governed our \nbehavior as a country. That broad center, I am sure, in this country \nfeels as I do as a result of the September 11 tragedies; it feels the \nrage and anger that there are sick, twisted people who would do that. \nThey believe as I do, I am sure, when I see the kinds of terrorist \nactivities such as I saw in Florida and New York and now on Capitol \nHill, with the use of anthrax as a weapon of terror--I am sure they \nfeel anger and rage.\n\n  It is also the case that there are men and women in our Armed Forces \nwho are in harm's way today because we have called on them once again \nto take action against those who would undermine the basic freedoms in \nour country.\n  So what is important today, not just with respect to this incident on \nCapitol Hill and all the wonderful young men and women--and in some \ncases older men and women--is that they are here because they are proud \nto be here; they are proud of their public service. It is important for \nall of us to understand that this country stands together. This country \nstands tall in the face of challenges.\n  I said yesterday it is interesting that changes occurred in this \nChamber. In this Chamber of the Senate, for so long we had so much \npettiness. There was so much pettiness in our politics. That is now \ngone--and good riddance, as far as I am concerned. But that pettiness \nled us to believe on every single issue, at every intersection, there \nwas an ``our side'' and a ``their side.'' We have, it seems to me, in \nmeeting these challenges, understood now that there is only one side \nand that is ``our side.'' That is the side that we all stand on \ntogether. It is not mine and yours, or us and them; it is just our side \ntogether. That is the way we will respond to the\n\n[[Page S10783]]\n\nincident that has occurred on Capitol Hill. It is the way America will \nrespond to the broader threat of terrorism that exists around the \nworld. It is the way the American people have responded for two \ncenturies--to build a beacon of hope and opportunity for the rest of \nthe world. It shall remain that way as long as we have the kind of \nleadership and capabilities that exist in this country, to say to the \nrest of the world it is worth the fight to preserve our freedom; it is \nworth that fight.\n  So let me end as I began, by thanking my colleague, Senator Daschle, \nfor his leadership. Our thoughts have been with his staff as they have \nworked through this challenging period, and our thoughts are also with \nthe literally thousands of men and women who come to this Capitol to \nserve with us in the House and in the Senate who do that because they \nwant to be involved in public service and are proud of it. We say to \nthem, don't be unnerved by this; we are proud you are here and that you \nhave stayed through this period. We thank you for your public service.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I rise, too, to applaud the leadership \ngiven to us in the last several days by Senator Daschle and Senator \nLott.\n  Thirty years ago, I did not serve in this body; I served as a naval \nflight officer on the other side of the world, in a war that was not \npopular in this country. Those of us who served took our cues from \nthose who served in this body with respect to the strength and support \nfor our efforts from the American people and from our elected \nofficials. The signals we received were not always encouraging ones.\n  It is important today that those who are serving our country on the \nother side of the world in this war, flying in F-14s, helicopters, \ndropping food from C-17s, dropping munitions from B-52s and B-1s, \nspecial forces at work, the sailors and airmen and soldiers--it is \nimportant that we send to them, not just by our words but by our deeds \ntoday, a very clear message: There is a time for fear and there is a \ntime for resolve. This is a time for resolve. Our resolve is being \ntested, and it is critically important that we meet that test. And we \nwill.\n  We are endeavoring to strike a balance, whether it is in Senator \nDaschle's office, Senate office buildings, the Capitol, or the House \noffice buildings, to make sure we are being vigilant and careful and \nthat we are mindful of their health and welfare. And we are. At the \nsame time, let's remember we have a lot of work to do--not next year or \nthe year after that; we have a lot of work to do this year. We have \nappropriations bills to pass to meet the needs of our Nation. We have \ncompromises to hammer out on terrorism legislation, airport security, \nand rail security. We have legislation that is in conference on \neducation, raising the achievement level of our students, and making \nsure there is a Patients' Bill of Rights that is fair to everybody in \nthis country. We need to hammer out those compromises.\n  We need an energy policy. We haven't had one in my adult life and, \nfrankly, we need one now more than ever. We have plenty to do. The idea \nthat some might suggest it is time for us to take leave from this place \nand go back to our States for a while is just absolutely the wrong \napproach to take. We need to stay here and stay on the job.\n  There are some differences between the facts and the fiction being \nspread about what is happening on Capitol Hill. Others have spoken to \nit, and I want to mention it as well. Secretary Thompson told me this \nmorning that we received lab test results of the substance opened up in \nthe mail in Senator Daschle's office, and we got those results about 3 \no'clock this morning. The bad news is that it is anthrax.\n  The idea that somehow this is weapons grade is not correct. That is \njust not true. This is a substance that is susceptible to penicillin. \nThis is a substance that is susceptible to Ciprofloxacin, just as other \nanthrax materials are susceptible. It can be treated.\n  Let's take a worst case scenario. There have been reports that the \nventilation system of the Hart Building is somehow contaminated with \nanthrax. That is just not so. Let's assume for a moment it is. Let's \nassume for a moment that everyone who works there, including Senators, \nhas been exposed to anthrax, which is not true either. As it turns out, \nmaybe 20 or 30 people have been exposed--not infected but exposed.\n  If we had all been exposed and if, indeed, the ventilation system was \nchock full of anthrax--and it is not--what do we do about it? We simply \ntake the antibiotics that kill the bacteria. That is what we do.\n  Keep in mind, anthrax is something for which we can be vaccinated. If \nwe come down with an illness, we can take antibiotics that will cure \nit. If I contract an illness related to anthrax, it does not mean to \nsuggest Senator Dorgan or anybody else is going to become sick. It is \nnot communicable. We not only need to keep this in mind in the Senate \nand on Capitol Hill, but the American people need to know. This is \nsomething we can contain, and this is something we can control. We have \nto stay calm, we have to stay cool, we have to be collected, and we are \ngoing to do that.\n  The rest of the country is watching us to see how we respond in this \ntime of duress. Certainly our military men and women around the world \nare watching us to see how we respond in this time of duress, during \nthis threat to our Nation's Capitol. I presume whoever is sending these \nmaterials our way is watching us as well. They must be amused by the \nresponse they see from some.\n  The response we need to send to the terrorists, those who would do us \nharm, as well as to our troops, soldiers, sailors, and airmen around \nthe world, and the rest of the American people is that we will make \nsure that the people who work here are protected and are safe, but at \nthe same time we are committed to doing and completing our Nation's \nbusiness.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. CARPER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/17/senate-section/article/S10783-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10783-S10786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                        2002--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, it is a pleasure to join my colleague from \nMontana, the distinguished Ranking Member of our Interior \nappropriations subcommittee, in bringing before the Senate the \nconference report on H.R. 2217, the Fiscal Year 2002 Interior and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations Act.\n  This is the first of the thirteen annual appropriations bills to have \nreached this stage of the process. Let me say parenthetically, however, \nthat the Committee on Appropriations reported the bill on July 12--3 \nmonths and 5 days ago. So it has been a long time in ripening to this \npoint. This conference report is, in my opinion, a well-crafted bill. \nIt is never an easy task to work out the many disagreements between \nHouse and Senate versions of an appropriations bill, and this year was \nno exception. But each and every one of the 1,330 items before the \nconferees was worked out in a way that balanced the views of each \nchamber and the resources available to the conferees.\n  I will not go into great detail with respect to all the particulars \nof the conference agreement, but shall point out a few highlights. \nFirst, to those who have a special interest in natural resource \nconservation, this conference report lives up to our previous \ncommitment by fully funding the conservation spending category \nestablished in Title VIII of last year's Interior Appropriations bill. \nThrough this spending category, the managers were able to fund key \nconservation activities including $428 million for Federal land \nacquisition; $229 million for State programs such as wildlife and \nwetland conservation programs; and $184 million for Federal \ninfrastructure improvements in our national parks, forests, refuges, \nand on other public lands. In addition,\n\n[[Page S10784]]\n\nthe conference report devotes $11 million to Civil War battlefields \npreservation, an important commitment to honoring our national heritage \nand understanding the history of this great country.\n  The conference report also restores the $36 million in environmental \nclean-up work conducted through the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund \nwhich the administration had unwisely proposed to cut. These funds will \nbe used for high priority abandoned mine clean-up projects which \naddress serious health and safety concerns.\n  For our colleagues from the West, I am pleased to report that the \nconference agreement continues the Congressional commitment to protect \nthe public and our natural resources from fire danger by providing $2.2 \nbillion to the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior for \nwildland firefighting. This is an increase of $300 million above the \nPresident's request.\n  The bill also includes $2.8 billion for critically needed Indian \nhealth care and $2.2 billion for Indian education and economic \ndevelopment. Within these amounts, $86 million is targeted specifically \nfor the construction of new hospitals and health clinics, while more \nthan $290 million is to be used for school construction and repair.\n  The conference report includes over $930 million for cultural \ninstitutions and programs funded through the Interior subcommittee, \nincluding the Smithsonian Institution, the National Gallery of Art, the \nKennedy Center, and the National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities.\n  The conference committee paid special attention to the needs of the \nNational Park Service, providing an increase of $85 million over the \nfiscal year 2001 appropriation for basic operations of the national \npark system. In addition, the conference report contains $366 million \nfor Park Service construction, with the vast majority of these projects \nrepresenting backlogged maintenance and infrastructure improvements in \nthe National Parks.\n  Finally, I would like to point out that this conference report \ncontains much needed funding for the important energy research programs \noverseen by the Department of Energy, specifically in the area of \nfossil energy research and development. I am very proud of the fact \nthat the conferees provided $150 million for continuation of the Clean \nCoal Technology program, which I first started in 1985 and which has \nproven to be one of the most successful public/private partnerships \never undertaken by the Federal Government. I am pleased we were able to \nrestore the nearly $100 million in basic energy research funding that \nthe administration had proposed to cut. I told the Secretary of Energy \nthat I believed those cuts to be unwise--and I earlier urged the \nPresident not to make those cuts--and that if I had anything to do with \nit--and I did, of course--they would not stand. For the good of the \nNation and our energy security, I am glad that I was able to keep my \nword.\n\n  Before yielding the floor to my distinguished colleague from Montana \nfor any comments he may wish to make, let me say again publicly what a \npleasure it was to have Conrad Burns as the Ranking member of the \nInterior subcommittee and to work with him and his able staff \nthroughout this year. This has been a journey of hope and pleasure for \nme as we have developed this bill during the several months of working \nwith Senator Burns. The dedication to duty displayed by Senator Burns, \nthe willingness to cooperate in a bipartisan fashion, and his always \ngracious manner have made my work infinitely easier, and I thank him \nfor his support in crafting this bill.\n  I thank his staff and I thank my own staff, along with Peter \nKiefhafer, for their excellent work.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. I join my friend from West Virginia in asking the Senate \nto support the Interior and related agencies conference report. This \nhas been sort of a labor of love. It has been 3 months of putting this \npiece of legislation together and many hours of off-the-floor \nnegotiations not only between my chairman and everybody who serves on \nthis subcommittee but also in the conference with the House.\n  This conference agreement fits within the broader fiscal limitations \nwith which the Congress and the President have agreed. To remain within \nthese limits, we had to reduce many projects and programs below levels \nprovided by the Senate bill. Likewise, many priorities established in \nthe House were reduced so the conference agreement would conform to the \nsubcommittee's conference allocation.\n  The final product does not contain 100 percent of what everybody \nwanted; nor does it have 100 percent for one individual. I assure my \ncolleagues Senator Byrd has included me and my staff in all \nnegotiations and that the Senate's interests have been treated fairly.\n  There are two specific items I will address before proceeding. I am \npleased that the conference report provided a $10 million increase in \npayments in lieu of taxes, PILT. These funds are a vital source of \nfunding for schools and other basic Government services in rural \ncommunities that have large public land acreage. While I hoped we would \npreserve the entire increase provided in the Senate bill, the amount \nprovided in the conference agreement is a significant step forward and \nmoves us closer reaching the authorizing funding level of the PILT \nprogram.\n  With regard to the funds for the wildland firefighting and related \nprograms, the conference agreement contains just over $2.23 billion. \nThe year before last and last year were terrible years for fires, as \nwas this past summer, although it was not as devastating as the year \nbefore. Congress has still made a commitment to the national fire plan. \nWe were unable to fully fund all the needs of the national fire plan, \nbut nonetheless the commitment is there. We had to make extremely tough \nchoices, balancing the need for rehabilitation and restoration of lands \nalready burned and the need to prevent and suppress future fires.\n  We have also taken the opportunity to direct the Department of \nAgriculture and the Interior to work more closely together in \nimplementing the national fire plan, while giving us a better \nunderstanding of the land's long-term funding and what it needs. I \nbelieve this will move us much closer toward having a fire plan that \ncan be fully implemented.\n  Finally, I thank Senator Byrd for his courtesy shown throughout the \nprocess. There are 3 C's in committee work: cooperation, courtesy, and \nconsideration. Usually we get our work done pretty expeditiously. It \nhas been a difficult year on many fronts, but from the Senate \ntransition to the events of last month, Senator Byrd and I have worked \nwell together to produce a final bill that deserves the Senate support.\n  I thank his staff and my own. Ryan Thomas and Bruce Evans have done \nyeoman's work on this bill as it has moved its way not only through the \nSenate but also through the conference.\n  It is strange indeed to have an Interior and related agencies bill to \nbe the first appropriations bill to be sent to the President. I can \nremember when this bill was unbelievably contentious. It is the off-\nthe-floor agreements and negotiations made that help bring a product to \nthe floor. It just about has the approval of the total Senate. That is \na testament to Senator Byrd's leadership as chairman of this \nsubcommittee. Again, I urge my colleagues to support this conference \nagreement.\n  Mr. BYRD. We are told in the Scripture: A word fitly spoken is like \napples of gold in pictures of silver.\n  The words by Conrad Burns, my distinguished colleague, have been \nfitly spoken. Again, I thank him.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, on behalf of Senator Daschle and this \nSenator from Nevada, I express our appreciation to the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee not only for bringing the bill to the floor \ntoday but for your persistence, your wisdom, and your legislative \nabilities. You have worked very hard on all appropriations bills, this \none in particular. We extend our appreciation to you for that.\n  More generally, this is the first appropriations bill. There couldn't \nbe one more timely and one that should be recognized than the one these \ntwo Senators put together. Senator Burns said he can remember when the \nbill was contentious. It is still contentious. But this is what \nlegislation is all about. I was so happy to go to that conference\n\n[[Page S10785]]\n\ncommittee. We spent just a little bit of time there. It was resolved \nquickly. That is what good legislation is all about.\n  The example that was set I hope I can follow. Senator Domenici and I \nare working on energy and water and hope to have a conference that is \neven shorter than the one on the Interior bill. We hope to be able to \ndo that. We were going to do it tomorrow but the House is going out \ntoday and we will not be able to do that. Hopefully, it will be Monday \nor Tuesday.\n  I have a great feeling for this bill. The Senator from West Virginia \nwill remember when I first came here I had the honor, when you were so \nheavily involved in your duties being the Democratic leader, of \nconducting the subcommittee hearings on this bill. I learned a lot \nabout this subcommittee as a result of sitting there for those hours of \nhearings to arrive at a point where we had a bill that could be brought \nto the Senate floor. Conducting those hearing was one of the biggest \nlearning processes I ever went through. It was a great honor.\n  I will not belabor the point other than to say if someone picked up a \ndictionary and looked at the word ``wisdom,'' Senator Byrd's name would \nbe right there. And of course it would be there with ``legislator.'' \nBut in capital letters, if you flipped open the dictionary and came to \nthe word ``Senator,'' Robert Byrd of West Virginia would be right \nthere.\n\n  So it is appropriate that the first bill that we have worked so hard \nto get out of the appropriations process is one that has been \nengineered by the Senator from West Virginia.\n  I also extend my appreciation to the Senator from Montana, with whom \nit has been easy to work. He understands the legislative process and \nhas really been a pleasure to work with.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Senate now proceed to the conference \nreport accompanying H.R. 2217, the Department of the Interior \nappropriations bill; that the Senate vote immediately on adoption of \nthe conference report with no intervening action; and that upon \nadoption of the conference report, the Senate proceed to a period of \nmorning business with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes \neach.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I reserve the right to object just for the \npurpose of responding to the distinguished majority whip and his \nglowing references to my work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. May I say this. Darius the Great was once having lunch. \nSomeone presented Darius the Great with a huge pomegranate at this \nluncheon. And it was opened. There were quite a number of seeds in it. \nDarius said, ``Had I as many men like Megabazus as there are seeds in \nthis pomegranate, it would please me better than to be lord of \nGreece.''\n  So let me just say, using those words by Darius, I have been around \nthe Senate here quite a while and I have seen several whips. I have had \nthe pleasure--or perhaps the misfortune, I should say--of being whip \nmyself here for several years beginning in 1971. But I was not as good \na whip as Senator Reid. I won't say anything about the other whips, but \nI will just use myself. Senator Reid is an excellent assistant majority \nleader. He is always on the floor. That is how I gained my fame as \nwhip--I stayed on the floor, watched the floor. There is where I \nlearned the rules, where I learned the precedents.\n  This man is a man who, if I may do a little bragging, was cut in my \nown image in that he stays on the floor. He works this floor. He is \nalways to be counted upon. He is here to help every Senator. Many are \nthe time agreements that are made possible by his assiduous attention \nto his duties on the floor.\n  Majority Leader Daschle can be very grateful for the fact that he has \nbeen given this very excellent man, Harry Reid of Nevada, to work and \nto assist him, Mr. Daschle, as the whip.\n  I pay my compliments to Mr. Reid. I thank him for his great work.\n  Let me just now end my remarks by saying we hope that next week we \ncan complete the work on this floor on the energy and water \nappropriation bill, the legislative branch appropriation bill, the VA-\nHUD appropriation bill, and the Treasury appropriations bill. We are \nfinally making some headway.\n  I thank my colleagues, and of course the good Lord most of all, and \nour staff for the fact that we have been able to begin making some \nprogress on the action and passage of the Appropriations conference \nreports.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2217), ``making appropriations for the Department of the \n     Interior and related agencies for the fiscal year ending \n     September 30, 2000, and for other purposes,'' having met, \n     have agreed that the House recede from its disagreement to \n     the amendment of the Senate, and agree to the same with an \n     amendment, and the Senate agree to the same, signed by all of \n     the conferees on the part of both Houses.\n\n  (The report is printed in the House proceedings of the Record of \nOctober 11, 2001.)\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I rise to offer the Budget Committee's \nofficial scoring for the conference report for H.R. 2217, the Interior \nand Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal year 2002.\n  The conference bill provides $19.12 billion in nonemergency \ndiscretionary budget authority, which will result in new outlays in \n2002 of $11.908 billion. When outlays from prior-year budget authority \nare taken into account, discretionary outlays for the Senate bill total \n$18.017 billion in 2002. Of that total, $1.32 billion in budget \nauthority and $1.029 billion in outlays falls under the new cap for \nconservation spending. The remaining amount counts against the general \npurpose cap for discretionary spending. The conference report is within \nthe Appropriations Committee's 302(b) allocations for budget authority \nand outlays for both general purpose and conservation spending.\n  In addition, the Senate bill provides new emergency spending \nauthority of $400 million in 2002 for federal firefighting activities, \nwhich will result in new outlays of $289 million. Per section 314 of \nthe Congressional Budget Act, as amended, I have adjusted the \ncommittee's 302(a) allocation by the amount of this designated \nemergency funding. The amount of emergency funding included in the \nreport is consistent with the bipartisan agreement reached earlier this \nmonth between the President and congressional appropriators.\n  H.R. 2217 is the first conference report to reach the Senate floor. \nTwelve more remain after its adoption. It is important that the Senate \nact quickly and pass this important legislation that will provide vital \nfunding for managing our nation's natural resources, supporting better \nand more efficient use of our energy supplies, and meeting our \ncommitments to Native American tribes.\n  I ask for unanimous consent that a table displaying the budget \ncommittee scoring of this bill be inserted in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    H.R. 2217, INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2002\n   [Spending comparisons--Conference Report (in millions of dollars)]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                               General\n                               purpose  Conservation  Mandatory   Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConference report:\n  Budget Authority...........   17,800       1,320          59    19,179\n  Outlays....................   16,988       1,029          77    18,094\nSenate 302(b) allocation: \\1\\\n  Budget Authority...........   17,800       1,376          59    19,235\n  Outlays....................   16,988       1,030          77    18,095\nPresident's request:\n  Budget Authority...........   16,827       1,256          59    18,142\n  Outlays....................   16,425         832          77    17,334\nHouse-passed:\n  Budget Authority...........   17,621       1,320          59    19,000\n  Outlays....................   16,789       1,031          77    17,897\nSenate-passed:\n  Budget Authority...........   17,386       1,320          59    18,765\n  Outlays....................   16,736       1,029          77    17,842\n \nSENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED\n             TO--\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation: \\1\\\n  Budget Authority...........  .......         -56    .........      -56\n  Outlays....................  .......          -1    .........       -1\nPresident's request:\n  Budget Authority...........      973          64    .........    1,037\n  Outlays....................      563         197    .........      760\nHouse-passed:\n  Budget Authority...........      179  ............  .........      179\n  Outlays....................      199          -2    .........      197\nSenate-passed:\n  Budget Authority...........      414  ............  .........      414\n  Outlays....................      252  ............  .........      252\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ For enforcement purposes, the budget committee compares the\n  conference report to the Senate 302(b) allocation.\n \nNotes: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Prepared by SBC Majority Staff, 10-17-01.\n\n\n[[Page S10786]]\n\n  Mr. McCain. Mr. President, I thank the managers for their work in \ncompleting this important appropriations bill which funds the Federal \nagencies governing land management, energy, forestry and Native \nAmerican programs, In this time of extraordinary national, and fiscal, \nurgency to respond to domestic threats, I appreciate that their jobs \nhave not been easy and I am thankful for their work.\n  This Interior appropriations bill funds many important programs that \nhelp to protect the nation's natural resources, national parks, \nendangered animals and forest lands, as well as health and education \nprograms for Native Americans. A portion of energy conservation funding \nfor the Department of Energy is also included in this bill. I am \nsupportive of these programs and their important part to preserve the \ncharacter and quality of America's most special places.\n  What I find disturbing is that many of these programs, such as the \nNational Park Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service, still \nexperience enormous backlogs of maintenance and repair work because \nthese agencies are not able to spend important Federal funding on the \nNation's highest priorities. Instead, the appropriators have earmarked \nthis funding for their own priorities, without a fair and merit-based \nreview.\n  This year's final Interior appropriations bill includes $343 million \nin earmarks, much of which is either unrequested or unauthorized \nspending. While this amount is less than the bill passed earlier this \nyear in the Senate, it is still an extraordinarily high amount of \nFederal spending that should be directed toward the most urgent \npriorities for the agencies included in this bill. It is a critical \ntime for our nation, and we should expend Federal dollars prudently to \nallow Federal agencies to carry out their management responsibilities.\n  I will support the passage of this year's Interior bill, despite my \nobjections to the extraneous porkbarrel spending that is included. I \nbelieve, especially in this heightened time of American resolve to \nprotect our homelands, that it is our highest obligation to ensure that \nwe spend taxpayer dollars wisely. Unfortunately, as evidenced by the \n$343 million in porkbarrel spending in this bill, we are clearly \nfailing In fully upholding our obligations to protect natural resources \nand meet trust obligations to Native Americans. As we consider the \nremaining appropriations bills for this fiscal year, I hope that my \ncolleagues will exercise fiscal constraint in porkbarrel spending.\n  The list of objectionable provisions I identified in H.R. 2217 is \navailable on my Senate web site.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I would like to speak for a moment \nabout Section 128 of the Interior Appropriations conference report.\n  In its original form, Section 128 repealed language from last year's \nOmnibus Indian Advancement Act, language that circumvented the Indian \nGaming Regulatory Act's commonsense protections and regulatory \nsafeguards against the inappropriate siting of Class III, Nevada-style \ncasinos.\n  Late last year, a one-paragraph provision was attached to the Omnibus \nIndian Advancement Act granting land in trust to a single Indian tribe, \nthe Lytton band, and permitting them to move forward on plans to \nestablish a Nevada-style gaming establishment in San Pablo, CA, on a \nsite that is not part of and is not adjacent to land traditionally held \nby the Lytton band of Indians. In fact, this site is in a major urban \narea just outside of San Francisco, neither in nor near the Lytton \nband's reservation. This was done without regard to Federal laws \ncurrently in place to regulate the siting of such a casino. Now, \nlanguage that would have originally repealed that granting of land in \ntrust merely states that the Lytton band must follow the Code of \nFederal Regulations for Class III gaming, which they would have had to \nfollow anyway.\n  I have serious reservations about the expansion of Class III gaming \nin urban areas, and I am particularly against off-reservation gambling. \nThese off-reservation casinos cause counties additional costs in public \nand local services, often intrude in residential areas, and are \nincreasingly causing local concerns ranging from traffic congestion to \nadditional crime.\n  Currently, California has 109 separate and independent tribal \ngovernments, of which 46 have operational casinos. Three more casinos \nare currently under construction. Additionally, 20 tribes have compacts \nwith the state and are proposing casinos, and 10 more are in \nnegotiations with the Governor for a tribal state compact for Class III \ngaming. Finally, 54 more tribes are petitioning or involved in \ncongressional acts to be federally recognized to promote a casino.\n  Circumventing the processes for Federal recognition of tribal \ngovernments and for granting land into trust presents a variety of \nserious and critical multi-jurisdictional issues--issues which can \nnegatively affect the lives of ordinary citizens and deprive local \ngovernment of their political power to protect those whom they govern. \nThe Indian Gaming Regulatory Act has provided this Nation with a fair \nand balanced approach to Indian casinos by facilitating tribal plans \nfor economic recovery without compromising a multitude of factors that \nshould be taken into account when deciding on the siting of such a \nlarge, Nevada-style casino. IGRA works. It is a fair process that \nshould be followed.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for the notice of Members, the Senate \nJudiciary Committee had originally been scheduled to meet tomorrow for \na markup. We have about 14 or 15 nominations on the list, ranging from \nU.S. attorneys to Federal judges--actually more than that. I forget the \nexact number. The Dirksen Building in which we were scheduled to meet \nis going to be closed, as will the Russell and Hart Buildings.\n  For those Senators who may have an interest, I am arranging for a \nmeeting room off the Senate Chamber, probably in the President's room. \nWe will start the meeting about halfway through the vote, whenever we \nhave the vote, which I understand now is sometime between 12 and 12:30. \nI have talked to a number of Senators. This seems to be the most \nconvenient way because we don't know where else we will get a meeting \nroom.\n  Senators on the Judiciary Committee should plan, if they possibly \ncan, to vote here relatively early, when the rollcall starts. Come to \nthe room. We will make sure somebody is here to tell them where it is \ngoing to be. Obviously, if somebody wants to debate something, they \ncan. We will try to move those nominations out as quickly as possible.\n  Having heard the travel plans of some Senators, we may try to get \nthem moved out prior to or within the same amount of time as the \nrollcall vote. I urge Senators to get over there and make a quorum. As \nsoon as we have a quorum, we will start moving.\n  For several Senators who have inquired, mostly from the other side of \nthe aisle, who have judges up for nomination hearings tomorrow--I know \nthe Senators from Alabama and Oklahoma and others do--we are going \nforward with those hearings. Senator Schumer, the distinguished senior \nSenator from New York, will be chairing. Again, I think we may have \narranged a room right back here.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Even though all the office buildings where hearings are \nnormally held will be closed tomorrow, the committee is going to go \nahead and find someplace to hold the hearing anyway; is that what the \nSenator from Vermont is saying?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am going to do that. I am trying to do it \nin a relatively compressed amount of time, while some Senators are \nstill around. There are a lot of judges on that list. Two Senators from \neach State will want to introduce them, plus those that are on the \nagenda.\n  The distinguished majority leader has helped us in finding space in \nthe Capitol to do it. We are also going to try to finish the terrorism \nbill, if we can. We are trying to juggle all that. I ask Senators to \nplease show up on time when we start because there is going to be only \nso much of a window. If people don't show up, if we can't get a quorum, \nwe can't go forward. I picked this time when everybody has to show up \nfor a vote anyway, the best time to get a quorum, and we will go on \nwith the others so that my staff and I can get back to finishing up the \nwork of the terrorism bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/17/senate-section/article/S10787-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10787-S10788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, for the information of all colleagues, I \nknow there has been some question about when we ought to have the vote \ntomorrow. To accommodate the most number of Senators, we are going to \nset the vote for 11 o'clock. That will be the only vote for the day, \nand it will be on the military construction appropriations conference \nreport. We will accommodate Senators who wish to speak about other \nmatters in morning business both before and after that vote.\n  The Senate will come in around 10 o'clock, and we will spend at least \nan hour in discussion on the conference report, or in morning business, \nand then we will set the vote for 11 o'clock.\n  The next vote will occur at approximately 10 o'clock on Tuesday. We \nwill not be in session on Friday or Monday. I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. REID. Will the leader yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that on this side of \nthe aisle Senator Dorgan worked very hard on a policy luncheon. The \nSenator is still going to have that, is that right?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are intending to have a Democratic \npolicy luncheon at 12:30 tomorrow. Following the vote and other \nintervening morning business, Members on our side will be invited to \nthe policy committee luncheon where we will be talking about a range of \nissues dealing with the Middle East.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I also made mention earlier today about \nmaking alternative space available for public meetings. I know some \nSenators and some of our committees had hoped to be able to conduct \ntheir business, and because we are not going to be conducting business \nout of the three Senate buildings, we are acquiring other space for the \nnext 2 days. Senators are encouraged to call the Secretary of the \nSenate or the Sergeant at Arms for information about that space. There \nwill be rooms available. In fact, I can say we have already allocated a \nnumber of rooms, and they will be allocated on a first come, first \nserved basis.\n\n  We will be sure that every committee or every Senator who may seek \nadditional space for whatever purpose can be accommodated. That will \nnot be a problem. So I just encourage you to contact the Secretary of \nthe Senate or the Sergeant at Arms and we will address that as well--I \nshould also say the Rules Committee. Senator Dodd has already been \nworking on accommodating Senators and would also have space available. \nPlease contact the Rules Committee as well and we will be able to take \ncare of any needs Senators may have.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the leader will yield--so I won't leave any question--I \nhad a meeting and markup in the Judiciary at 12. If the vote is going \nto be at 11, we will start that meeting of the Judiciary Committee--I \nunderstand it will be in the President's room. It will probably start \nabout 11:05, 11:10.\n  Again, I urge Senators to show up and make a quorum because I have \ntalked to enough Republicans and Democrats and it is going to be hard \nto have a quorum much beyond the end of that vote. So, please, I urge \nSenators to be there at 11:05, 11:10. Vote in the beginning in the well \nand then come on in and we can get 12, 14, 15 nominations, ranging from \nU.S. attorneys to judges, out of there.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to tell our colleague, the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, we will make sure he has Members \navailable for a quorum because we want to get many of these nominations \nreported out of committee. I appreciate his cooperation both in having \nthe executive session to report those nominees and also in having the \nhearings tomorrow. I hope we will have many more in the remaining \nweeks. I thank him very much for his accommodation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I appreciate that. If the Senator will yield for this \ncomment, I assume the Capitol will stay open. God forbid it would not, \nbecause after that we will run out of rooms. But the distinguished \nmajority leader and the Secretary of the Senate have helped us in \ngetting rooms. Senator Schumer is delaying his departure to help move \nsome of these. We will do our best.\n  Again, I urge everybody to be on time because the pressure is going \nto be on. We want to let a lot of the staff who won't otherwise have to \nbe around have a chance to go home. I think their families need them at \nthis time.\n\n[[Page S10788]]\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/17/senate-section/article/S10788-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN AFGHANISTAN\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I decided today is the day I want to \nspeak to the Senate. Tomorrow I am going to submit a resolution, and \nthen I want to make this resolution an amendment and have a vote on it \nat the first opportunity. The focus is on the humanitarian crisis in \nAfghanistan. It will be a resolution that will be constructive, \npositive, and outline some of the steps that this administration and we \nas a nation can take to make sure hundreds of thousands, perhaps \nmillions, of people do not starve to death in Afghanistan.\n  The problem is twofold. The reports are that there are about 7.5 \nmillion people who will starve to death if we do not get food \nassistance to them. Some of the Afghan people are going to be able to \nget to refugee camps in Pakistan. The problem there is the conditions \nin the refugee camps. The conditions are deplorable, and we are going \nto have to do much more to make sure people are provided food \nassistance and some health care.\n  The second problem is the elderly, the infirm, and the poorest people \nof Afghanistan are not going to be able to leave. This needs to be \ndiscussed on the floor of the Senate, and the Senate needs to focus on \nthis issue. I am also trying to get the administration to focus much \nmore on this as well.\n  The truth of the matter is that the air drops that have been much \ndiscussed at best may help 1 percent, probably more like one-half of 1 \npercent of the people, many of whom are women and children.\n  We will not be able to get food to people unless we do it through \ntruck convoys and deliver it to them directly. If we do not get the \nfood to the people in Afghanistan--we are talking about the people who \nare the poorest of the poor of the world who had nothing to do with the \nterrorist attacks against the people in our country--if we do not get \nthe food to them in the next 4 weeks, then we are going to see in \nAfghanistan a humanitarian crisis of unthinkable proportions. We are \ngoing to see many innocent people starve to death.\n  There are two problems. The first problem is this is not what we are \nabout as a nation. It is inconsistent with our values to not make every \neffort possible to get the food to people and, second, it is a matter \nof our national interest because if, in fact, the people in the Near \nEast and South Asia associate or see a direct linkage between our \nmilitary action and then large numbers of people starving to death in \nAfghanistan, it will only create a tremendous amount of bitterness and \nill will. There is absolutely no question about it.\n  I have always said that the use of force is something we have to do. \nIt should be directed at the people who committed this act of mass \nmurder in our country. We should do everything we know how to make sure \ninnocent people do not lose their lives.\n  The truth is, I worry about that, but there are going to be a lot \nmore innocent people who lose their lives through starvation than \nprobably through this bombing campaign. We could be talking about \nhundreds of thousands, some say millions, of people.\n  The resolution contains a number of items, but one I want to focus \non--and I think we need to pay very close attention to--is what the \nNGOs, the nongovernmental organizations, organizations such as Doctors \nWithout Borders, tell us because these are the people who have been in \nthe trenches. They know what it is like to try to deliver food \nassistance. They are saying we have to figure out a way that the \nmilitary action, which some have called for an end to--that is not what \nI am calling for as a Senator. Others have argued what we have to do, \nat the very least, is coordinate the military action, the bombing, with \nthe truck convoys; otherwise, the truck convoys will not go in because \nthey could mistakenly be bombed.\n  I am not sure our Government would want them to go in because we do \nnot want them mistakenly bombed. We have to figure out some way to have \nagreed-upon safe corridors where people who are delivering the food \nthrough truck convoys will be able to get the food to many people in \nAfghanistan who are suffering, the likes of which we would never want \nanybody we know or love to suffer.\n  I talk about this today because we have not had that much focus on \nit. I will have a resolution tomorrow. I will try to write a piece. I \nwill try to talk about this as much as I can to people in the country. \nIt would be a terrible mistake for our Government, for this \nadministration--and I think we need more clarity from the \nadministration about how we are going to get the food to the people in \nAfghanistan.\n  The President has talked about how children have committed money and \nclothes to the children of Afghanistan. That is fine and good, but the \ntruth is that will not address this humanitarian crisis, nor will the \nair drops.\n  We have to make sure the people get the food. If we do not do this \nthe right way, if we do not get this job done, if we do not deliver the \nfood to people there, then there is going to be massive starvation. \nThat is unacceptable. That is unacceptable.\n  I am quite sure there is no support from the Taliban. They are not \nhelpful. It is a complicated problem, but this should be a first \npriority of our policy right now when it comes to the United States of \nAmerica and the role we play in Afghanistan, the role we play in the \nNear East, the role we play in South Asia, the role we play in the \nworld.\n  We cannot let innocent people starve to death. We must make every \neffort to make sure that does not happen, and I think to date we have \nnot made that kind of concerted effort.\n  The only other thing I want to do, because I know we are about to \nfinish, is to thank the majority leader, the minority leader, the \nPresiding Officer, and Senators for making sure we continue with our \nwork. It goes down on the record so I will just say it one time.\n  I am no big deal at all, but I am very lucky to be a Senator from \nMinnesota. I am a first-generation American. My father fled persecution \nfrom Ukraine, Russia. I do not think I can ever remember a day or a \nperiod of time when I have been more emotional when I look at the \nCapitol. I think the work of democracy should proceed. We do not always \ndo it as well as we should, but the work of democracy should proceed. I \nam glad we are in session today. I am glad we are going to be in \nsession tomorrow. I think it is important we do so.\n  My hopes and prayers go to all who have been exposed to anthrax. I \nfeel within me people will be all right, but my hopes and prayers go to \neveryone.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/17/senate-section/article/S10788-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10788-S10789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          EXEMPLARY LEADERSHIP\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before we go out, I wanted to take a minute. \nWe started the day in the Senate by my talking about Senator Daschle, \nthe majority leader, and the difficult situation in which he found \nhimself when a number of his employees tested positive for anthrax.\n  As the day draws to a close, I want on behalf of the entire Senate to \nexpress our appreciation, the Senate's appreciation, for Senator \nDaschle and how he has handled the day. It has been a remarkable period \nof leadership.\n  I have been involved in government most all my adult life, but his \nperformance--and I say that in a most positive way--has been just \nexemplary today in the briefing we held down on the first floor today, \nwith all the Senators, with Senator Daschle leading that discussion, \nwith all of the personnel of the Senate there assembled, and his \nactions in reminding us we are Senators, that we are leaders, and we \nshould act\n\n[[Page S10789]]\n\naccordingly. Senator Daschle has had a lot of fine moments. But that \nwas one of his finest. I am very proud of him. As I say, I speak for \nthe entire Senate regarding how he has handled himself through this \nvery difficult time. He has a burden when he doesn't have anthrax in \nhis office. But pile that on his shoulders and it is a difficult \nsituation.\n\n  Like the Tom Daschle we all know, he came through with flying colors. \nI say to my friend, the Presiding Officer, who is Senator Daschle's \nfellow Senator from the State of South Dakota, I am sure I speak for \nyou and every person in South Dakota, when I say how fortunate they are \nto have this fine man representing them in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/17/senate-section/article/S10789-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CHANGES TO THE 2002 APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE ALLOCATION AND BUDGETARY \n                               AGGREGATES\n\n  Mr. CONRAD.

Mr. President, I rise to offer the Budget Committee's \nofficial scoring for the conference report for H.R. 2904, the Military \nConstruction Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2002.\n  The conference bill provides $10.5 billion in discretionary budget \nauthority, all classified as defense spending, which will result in new \noutlays in 2002 of $2.678 billion. When outlays from prior-year budget \nauthority are taken into account, discretionary outlays for the Senate \nbill total $9.19 billion in 2002. The conference report is within the \nAppropriations Committee's 302(b) allocations for budget authority and \noutlays. It has met its targets without the use of any emergency \ndesignations.\n  Given the tragic events of last month, it is imperative that the \nSenate immediately clear this bill, which provides critical resources \nto our military for new construction and family housing. In addition, I \nurge my colleagues to act quickly to complete Senate action on the \nforeign operations, Agriculture, District of Columbia, and Labor and \nHealth and Human Services bills, all of which have been completed by \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee and passed by the House. Mr. \nPresident, it is time that the Senate return to the historic \nbipartisanship that it displayed in the immediate aftermath of the \nSeptember 11 attacks, stop any further delays, and complete our work on \nthe 13 regular appropriations bills for 2002.\n  I ask for unanimous consent that a table displaying the budget \ncommittee scoring of this bill be inserted in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        H.R. 2904, MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2002\n   [Spending comparisons--Conference Report (in millions of dollars)]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                            General\n                                            purpose  Mandatory    Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConference report:\n  Budget Authority.......................   10,500               10,500\n  Outlays................................    9,190                9,190\nSenate 302(b) allocation: \\1\\\n  Budget Authority.......................   10,500               10,500\n  Outlays................................    9,284                9,284\nPresident's request:\n  Budget Authority.......................    9,972                9,972\n  Outlays................................    9,165                9,165\nHouse-passed:\n  Budget Authority.......................   10,500               10,500\n  Outlays................................    9,202                9,202\nSenate-passed:\n  Budget Authority.......................   10,500               10,500\n  Outlays................................    9,253                9,253\n \n    SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO--\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation: \\1\\\n  Budget Authority.......................\n  Outlays................................

Mr. President, I would like to take a brief moment to draw \nmy colleagues' attention to the horrific situation facing women and \nchildren in Afghanistan. As we heard at a Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee\n\n[[Page S10790]]\n\nhearing last week on the Humanitarian Crisis in Afghanistan, \nAfghanistan is a country that has been in crisis for years. Indeed, \nthere was concern even as far back as 1997, when I sponsored a \nresolution that passed the Senate, but was not acted upon in the House, \nthat condemned the Taliban for its treatment of women and children and \nurged the President to be vigilant in monitoring this situation.\n  When a country faces such hardships as severe drought, military \naction, and oppresive leadership, women and children are always the \nfirst to suffer. Save the Children, the international relief \norganization headquartered in my home State of Connecticut, has been \nworking to improve conditions in Afghanistan for years, and has \nidentified several important ways in which we can help Afghanistan \nrebuild. I have said before that we need to increase mutual \nunderstanding between the Afghan and American people, and a recent Save \nthe Children op-ed seems to agree. Nilgun Ogun, the deputy director of \nSave the Children Programs in Afghanistan and Pakistan, writes that the \neducation of young girls is key to reducing anti-American sentiment in \nthe region, and I tend to agree. As we struggle to determine the best \nway to help the Afghan people rebuild, we should be mindful of the \nimportant contributions of organizations such as Save the Children, and \nwe should listen to their experienced voices. I urge my colleagues to \nread the following article, and to begin to think about the important \ntask of rebuilding civil society in war-ravaged Afghanistan. I ask \nunanimous consent that the Op-ed from Save the Children be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Hartford Courant, Oct. 14, 2001]\n\n                 To Save Afghanistan, Educate the Girls\n\n                            (By Nilgun Ogun)\n\n       I have recently returned from a four-year post as deputy \n     director in Pakistan and Afghanistan for Save the Children, \n     which has been working in the area for almost 20 years. Where \n     some people see devastation and despair, I see hope. I see it \n     in the children who, if given education and health care, may \n     restore economic and social stability to the Afghan people.\n       It will not be easy. Afghanistan is one of the world's \n     poorest countries, ranking 169th out of 175 countries on a \n     list of socioeconomic indicators reported by the United \n     Nations.\n       Here are some grim facts: One out of every four children \n     doesn't live past the age 5; more than 40 percent of children \n     die of preventable causes; school enrollment is desperately \n     low; and in addition to being at war for the past two \n     decades, the country is suffering through one of the worst \n     droughts in memory.\n       The Bush administration is to be commended for allocating \n     emergency funding and humanitarian assistance to the \n     beleaguered citizens of Afghanistan, who are in need of \n     immediate and substantial food aid and medical supplies. \n     However, the real hope for the Afghan people lies with \n     investment in long-term development to help them rebuild \n     their society.\n       Nowhere is this investment more critical than in education \n     and, in particular, the education of young Afghan girls and \n     women.\n       Why is educating girls so important? It produces the most \n     consistent and dramatic results. An educated girl is more \n     likely to postpone marriage and childbirth, which in turn \n     leads to improved child survival and well-being. She will \n     provide better health care and nutrition for herself and her \n     family. And she will encourage education for her children. \n     Educated women are also better prepared to help financially \n     support their families.\n       In 1995, when Save the Children first began its education \n     program at the refugee camps in Balochistan near the Afghan \n     border, the population was approximately 120,000, mostly \n     women and children. Only 5,000 children were enrolled in any \n     kind of schooling and, of these, barely 600 were girls.\n       Nevertheless, in cooperation with U.N. agencies and other \n     non-governmental organizations, we managed to train a staff \n     of teachers and establish several primary schools. Enrollment \n     is up now by 400 percent, and includes nearly 8,000 girls.\n       To reach older girls who had not yet received any education \n     and who, by tradition, are not permitted to travel any \n     distance alone, Save the Children initiated home-based \n     schools. There, in the homes of the children's parents or \n     teachers--which are nothing more than mud huts--we teach \n     older girls how to read and do math and how to improve health \n     and nutrition practices.\n       These children, who barely have a roof over their heads and \n     still wonder daily where their next meal will come from, now \n     have hope for the future. They want to be doctors, teachers \n     and engineers. They have role models of caring community \n     leaders. They have the incentive and the ability to take care \n     of their health needs, which will ensure that their children \n     have a better chance for survival and healthy, productive \n     lives.\n       Although these days are filled with anxiety, it is \n     important to remain focused on the future and how we can work \n     to make it more peaceful and secure. Now, more than ever, is \n     the time for the government and private citizens to increase \n     their investment in long-term development, including \n     education programs, to help rebuild a stable society in \n     Afghanistan, as well as throughout the developing world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/17/senate-section/article/S10790-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10790-S10791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO MASTER SERGEANT EVANDER ANDREWS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a wonderful \nman, Master Sergeant Evander Andrews, whose life was cut short on \nOctober 10, 2001, while in the service of his country. He was on \ndeployment and became the first casualty of Operation Enduring Freedom, \npaying the ultimate sacrifice in our Nation's war on international \nterrorism. He was an active duty Air Force member with the 366th Civil \nEngineering Squadron from Mountain Home Air Force Base, Master Sergeant \nAndrews loved the Air Force, working on heavy equipment, and riding in \nthe cab of an 18-wheeler. But, his family and faith were his true \ncompass and the most important things in his life. He will forever be \nremembered in the hearts and minds of a loving family, the Mountain \nHome Air Force Base community, the 366th Civil Engineering Squadron, \nand many loyal friends.\n  Evander, or Andy, as he was affectionately known, was a devoted \nhusband and good father, born to Odber and Mary Andrews. He grew up in \nSolonn, ME, which was little more than a country store, tack ship, old \nhotel, gas station and cemetery, but a great place to grow up. Andy's \nthree sisters, Carol, Tara and Dulci, remember that he was especially \nclose to his father, who was a farmer, but also worked as a mechanic. \nHis dad taught him to fix engines and other big equipment and how to \nride motorcycles. Andy was a strongly built young man, on the quiet \nside, and everyone thought he would become a farmer. But, after \ngraduation from Carrabec High School in 1983, he left the family farm \nto join the Air Force and experience the world. He met his wife, Judy, \nin 1987, at Fort Leonard Wood, MO, where Andy was an instructor for \nconstruction equipment operators, and she was a student at Central \nMissouri State University. After Judy's graduation from college, they \nmarried in 1990 and two years later left Missouri for Mountain Home Air \nForce Base. Andy and Judy were married for 11 years and have four \nbeautiful children. Their oldest child is Ethan, age 9, followed by \nLeah age 6, Courtney, age 4, and Mackenzie, age 2. I know they will \nmiss their father very much, and always remember him for the joy and \ncommitment that he had for the church and strong family values that he \nshared with them all. Everyone will remember his passion for working on \nvehicles, and his compassion for people. He was the kind of guy that \nwould give you the shirt back off his back, and was always there for \nyou if you needed help, especially if it involved fixing your car. He \nwas truly loved by everyone he touched.\n  In the Air Force, Master Sergeant Andrews was the Chief of the \nPavements Repair Team, operating a multitude of huge vehicles. He felt \nat home around heavy equipment, knew how to do every job in the shop, \nand was willing to teach others, just as his father had once taught \nhim. He was always volunteering, especially if a road trip was \nrequired. He loved driving those 18-wheelers, but was willing to ride \nshotgun, in order to show others what he knew best.\n  Master Sergeant Andrews truly was a great person who was moved to \ndefend a great Nation and bring peace and security to the world. Rest \nassured, this war on terrorism will be won and the United States will \ncontinue to lead the world in protecting freedom.

Mr. President, public health professionals have an \nimportant role to play in the fight against gun violence. We need \ndoctors and nurses to help educate their patients on the dangers \nassociated with owning a firearm. Toward that end, Physicians for \nSocial Responsibility has produced a booklet called ``Counseling \nPatients on Gun Violence Prevention: A Pocket Guide for Physicians and \nNurses''. The booklet provides advice to medical professionals in \ntalking to patients about risks related to keeping a gun in their \nhomes. The booklet makes an important contribution the effort to reduce \ngun violence and I urge health professionals to read the booklet, share \ncopies with their colleagues and talk about these issues with their \npatients. The booklet can be downloaded from the Physicians for Social \nResponsibility's web site or people can contact Physicians for Social \nResponsibility to request copies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/17/senate-section/article/S10791-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ANTI-TERRORISM LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to explain to my colleagues the \nreasons for my objection to a unanimous consent request for the Senate \nto take up the anti-terrorism legislation, the Anti-Terrorism Act of \n2001, H.R. 2975, passed by the House of Representatives on October 12, \n2001. My public explanation is consistent with the commitment I have \nmade to explain publicly any so-called ``holds'' that I may place on \nlegislation.\n  I regret that I must object to any Senate action on the House-passed \nmeasure at this point. I do so because the national anti-terrorism \nlegislation is in grave danger of being rendered useless. The Senate-\npassed anti-terrorism bill included an important, bipartisan provision, \nthe Professional Standards for Government Attorneys Act of 2001, \nauthored by Judiciary Chairman Leahy, Ranking Member Hatch and myself \nand supported by the Administration, the FBI and the Department of \nJustice. This provision corrected an immediate and severe impediment to \nthe undercover investigations that must be employed to shut down \nterrorism in our Nation. The House failed to include this provision, \nwhich is section 501 of the Senate's anti-terrorism bill, that will \nuntie the hands of Federal prosecutors in Oregon, allowing them to \nsupervise undercover and other covert enforcement techniques. For more \nthan a year now, the so-called McDade law has prohibited prosecuting \nattorneys working at the State and Federal levels in Oregon from \nadvising and conducting law enforcement undercover investigations on \nnarcotics, child sex abuse, prostitution, organized crime, housing \ndiscrimination and consumer fraud. Without advice of counsel, law \nenforcement operatives cannot conduct wiretaps, sting operations or \ninfiltrate dangerous criminal or terrorist operations. If the Senate \ndoes not insist on this language, it will be an engraved invitation to \nterrorists and criminals to set up shop in Oregon with little fear of \ndetection or apprehension through undercover or covert methods. This \nwould endanger not just the people of Oregon, but all Americans.\n  I do not believe the Senate should allow the security of every \nAmerican to be jeopardized. As I stated on the floor of the United \nStates Senate yesterday, I do not want to find six months from now that \nterrorists have made their homes in Oregon because this body failed in \nits resolve to shut them down in every State in our country. I regret \nhaving to take this action but I believe that leaving one State \nvulnerable makes each State in this country vulnerable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/17/senate-section/article/S10791-3", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of this \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred January 15, \n2000 in Elmwood Park, NJ. After days of anti-gay taunts and threats, a \nclassmate beat a 16-year-old gay student at Memorial High School in \nElmwood Park. The teen's face was bruised and cut from being tackled \nand repeatedly punched in the face and body.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/17/senate-section/article/S10791-4", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10791-S10792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT ON A DRAFT OF PROPOSED LEGISLATION ENTITLED ``FREEDOM TO MANAGE \n            ACT OF 2001''--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 47\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Appropriations.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit for immediate consideration and prompt \nenactment the ``Freedom to Manage Act of 2001.'' This legislative \nproposal would establish a procedure under which the Congress can act \nquickly and decisively to remove those structural barriers to efficient \nmanagement imposed by law and identified by my Administration.\n  This proposal is part of the ``Freedom to Manage'' initiative \noutlined in the ``President's Management Agenda'' issued in late \nAugust. The initiative includes additional legislative proposals, to be \ntransmitted separately, that would give Federal agencies and managers \nthe tools to more efficiently and effectively manage the Federal \nGovernment's programs by: (1) providing Federal managers with increased \nflexibility to manage personnel; (2) giving agencies the responsibility \nto fund the full Government share of the accruing cost of all \nretirement and retiree health care benefits for Federal employees; and \n(3) giving agencies greater flexibility in managing and disposing of \nproperty assets.\n  In transmitting the Freedom to Manage Act, I am asking the Congress \nto join with my Administration in making a commitment to reform the \nFederal Government by eliminating obstacles to its efficient \noperations. Specifically, the Freedom to Manage Act would establish a \nprocess for expedited congressional consideration of Presidential \nproposals to eliminate or reduce barriers to efficient Government \noperations through the repeal or amendment of laws that create \nobstacles to efficient management or the provision of new authority to \nagencies.\n  The Freedom to Manage Act would provide that if the President \ntransmits to the Congress legislative proposals relating to the \nelimination or reduction of barriers to efficient Government \noperations, either through repeal or amendment of current law or the \nprovision of new authority, special expedited congressional procedures \nwould be used to consider these proposals. If a joint resolution is \nintroduced in either House within 10 legislative days of the \ntransmittal containing the President's legislative proposals, it would \nbe held in committee for no more than 30 legislative days. It would \nthen be brought to the floor of the House very quickly after committee \naction is completed for a vote under special procedures allowing for \nlimited debate and no amendments. Finally, a bill passed in one House \ncould then be brought directly to the floor of the other House for a \nvote on final passage.\n  As barriers to more efficient management are removed, the Nation will \nrightly expect a higher level of performance from its Federal \nGovernment. Giving our Federal managers ``freedom to manage'' will \nenable the Federal Government to improve its performance and \naccountability and better serve the public. I urge the Congress to give \nthe Freedom to Manage Act 2001 prompt and favorable consideration so we \ncan work together in the\n\n[[Page S10792]]\n\ncoming months to implement needed and overdue reforms.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to amend the Ports and Waterways Safety Act to \nprovide that certain information be provided before a vessel arrives in \nUnited States waters; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Transparent \nSea Act of 2001.\n  The Coast Guard is a multi-mission agency charged with maintaining \nour national defense and the safety of our citizens. This is an \nextraordinary time in our Nation's history and we need to act now and \nprovide the Coast Guard with all of the tools and information necessary \nto protect our Nation's waterways. This bill allows the Coast Guard to \ngather vital information about incoming vessels before they reach our \nports. This allows them to be pro-active and prevent potential threats \nfrom reaching our shores. The sum total of all of our available \nresources and knowledge must be brought to bear in the defense of our \ncountry.\n  Specifically, my bill would authorize the Coast Guard to obtain the \ninformation needed to achieve a greater awareness of possible maritime \nthreats. The bill requires vessels to submit to the Coast Guard \nprearrival messages not later than 96 hours prior to entering U.S. \nwaters, or such time as deemed necessary by the Secretary of \nTransportation. This will provide the Coast Guard time to thoroughly \nexamine the information, including the name and flag-country of the \nvessel, a detailed crew and passenger list, the vessel's cargo, and the \nport the vessel last departed from. Such a database allows the Coast \nGuard to track patterns and identify potential problems. The Coast \nGuard could then deny entry to any vessel that does not meet the \nnotification or listing requirements and intercept any vessels that may \npose a threat.\n  The American people place very high expectations on the Coast Guard. \nIt is incumbent upon us to provide them with the information they need \nto fulfill those expectations. The Transparent Sea Act of 2001 has the \nsupport of the Coast Guard and I look forward to moving the bill to the \nSenate floor at the earliest opportunity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1559\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Transparent Sea Act of \n     2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PREARRIVAL MESSAGES FROM VESSELS DESTINED TO UNITED \n                   STATES PORTS.\n\n       Section 4(a)(5) of the Ports and Waterways Safety Act (33 \n     U.S.C. 1223(a)(5)) is amended by striking paragraph (5) and \n     inserting the following:\n       ``(5)(A) may require the receipt of prearrival messages \n     from any vessel destined for a port or place subject to the \n     jurisdiction of the United States, not later than 96 hours \n     before the vessel's arrival or such time as deemed necessary \n     under regulations promulgated by the Secretary to thoroughly \n     examine all information provided, which shall include with \n     respect to the vessel--\n       ``(i) the route and name of each port and each place of \n     destination in the United States;\n       ``(ii) the estimated date and time of arrival at each port \n     or place;\n       ``(iii) the name of the vessel;\n       ``(iv) the country of registry of the vessel;\n       ``(v) the call sign of the vessel;\n       ``(vi) the International Maritime Organization (IMO) \n     international number or, if the vessel does not have an \n     assigned IMO international number, the official number of the \n     vessel;\n       ``(vii) the name of the registered owner of the vessel;\n       ``(viii) the name of the operator of the vessel;\n       ``(ix) the name of the classification society of the \n     vessel;\n       ``(x) a general description of the cargo on board the \n     vessel;\n       ``(xi) in the case of certain dangerous cargo--\n       ``(I) the name and description of the dangerous cargo;\n       ``(II) the amount of the dangerous cargo carried;\n       ``(III) the stowage location of the dangerous cargo; and\n       ``(IV) the operational condition of the equipment under \n     section 164.35 of title 33 of the Code of Federal \n     Regulations;\n       ``(xii) the date of departure and name of the port from \n     which the vessel last departed;\n       ``(xiii) the name and telephone number of a 24-hour point \n     of contact for each port included in the notice of arrival;\n       ``(xiv) the location or position of the vessel at the time \n     of the report;\n       ``(xv) a list of crew members onboard the vessel including \n     with respect to each crew member--\n       ``(I) the full name;\n       ``(II) the date of birth;\n       ``(III) the nationality;\n       ``(IV) the passport number or mariners document number; and\n       ``(V) the position or duties;\n       ``(xvi) a list of persons other than crew members onboard \n     the vessel including with respect to each such person--\n       ``(I) the full name;\n       ``(II) the date of birth;\n       ``(III) the nationality; and\n       ``(IV) the passport number; and\n       ``(xvii) any other information required by the Secretary; \n     and\n       ``(B) any changes to the information required by \n     subparagraph (A), except changes in the arrival or departure \n     time of less than six hours, must be reported as soon as \n     practicable but not less than 24 hours before entering the \n     port of destination.\n\n     The Secretary may deny entry of a vessel into the territorial \n     sea of the United States if the Secretary has not received \n     notification for the vessel in accordance with paragraph \n     (5).''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 1560. A bill to strengthen United States capabilities in \nenvironmental detection and the monitoring of biological agents; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 1561. A bill to strengthen the preparedness of health care \nproviders within the Department of Veterans Affairs and community \nhospitals to respond to bioterrorism; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to introduce two separate but \nrelated bills that address the crucial issue of our national \npreparedness for acts of bioterrorism. I plan to introduce a third bill \nnext week. As we have learned firsthand over the past two weeks, \nbioterrorism preparedness is a topic where we have a considerable set \nof available resources combined with an urgent need for additional \nlegislative action. The Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on \nInternational Security, Proliferation, and Federal Services held \nhearings in July to learn what the Federal Government is doing to \nbetter prepare our communities for acts of bioterrorism.\n  This morning, the Committee and Subcommittee held a joint hearing. We \nheard from Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson on the \ngovernment's role in lateral coordination of response efforts between \nfederal agencies and vertical coordination of efforts with the local \nand State agencies that are the first to respond to acts of \nbioterrorism. All our witnesses provided excellent testimony on the \nprogress in national bioterrorism preparedness since the September 11 \nterrorist attacks on America.\n  The bills I introduce today address a set of key issues in our \nnational response to acts of terrorism. First, I am sponsoring \nlegislation to increase funding for research and development of new \ntechnologies to detect the use of biological weapons against this \nnation. Second, I am offering a bill with Senator Rockefeller to \nstrengthen cooperation between the hospital network of the Department \nof Veterans Affairs and community healthcare workers across the Nation. \nAnd, third, I will introduce a measure next week to establish stronger \nsafeguards for our Nation's agricultural system and protection of our \ncrops and livestock from agricultural terrorism.\n  The first piece of legislation, the Biological Agent Environment \nDetection Act, authorizes appropriations totaling $40 million to \nsupport research and development of technologies to detect organisms in \nthe air, water, and food\n\n[[Page S10796]]\n\nthat cause disease in humans, livestock, and crops. This mirrors the \nPresident's request of $40 million to support early detection \nsurveillance to identify potential bioterrorism agents, announced by \nSecretary Thompson at today's hearing. Funds are necessary to encourage \ncooperative research agreements between the Federal Government, \nindustry, and academic laboratories. The anthrax events of the past two \nweeks underscore the need for new detection methods and information-\ngathering systems. These funds will also support ongoing efforts to \ndevelop satellite-based remote sensing technologies to identify weather \npatterns that contribute to the spread of infectious disease and \nbiological or chemical attacks. Finally, this funding is necessary to \nsupport the rigorous testing, verification, and calibration of new \nbiological detection technologies.\n  The second piece of legislation, sponsored with my friend from West \nVirginia, Senator Rockefeller, will provide the Department of Veterans \nAffairs with additional funds to develop training programs with \ncommunity health care providers. We need to enhance the cooperation \nbetween crucial elements of our health care system included in the \nNational Medical Disaster System. These increased funds will support \nexpanded use of existing telecommunications systems to implement a \ntelemedicine training program for VA staff and their community public \nhealth counterparts. Remote regions of our Nation need the assurance \nthat local public health responders will have the training and \ninformation they need to protect and treat citizens in instances of \nbiological terrorism.\n  The third bill, the Biosecurity Agriculture Terrorism Act, will \nenhance Federal efforts to prepare for and respond to acts of \nagricultural terrorism or naturally-occurring agricultural epidemics by \nprioritizing efforts, authorizing funding and establishing new policy \nguidelines. Planning, training, and communication are three \ncornerstones of the preparedness and mitigation measures that will \nsupport the people who initially respond to any agricultural terrorism \nincident. This bill tasks the Federal Emergency Management Agency to \ncreate an emergency response function for agricultural disaster within \nthe Federal Response Plan. This would result in having response and \nrecovery plans in effect in the unfortunate event of an actual \nagricultural terrorism incident.\n  Together, these three bills will make significant and necessary \ncontributions to the urgent task of protecting our Nation from all \nforms of bioterrorism. We can discourage and detect the manufacture, \ndistribution, and use of biological weapons. We can use the existing \nemergency communication infrastructure, emergency response training \nprograms, and community partnerships within the 173 VA hospitals across \nthe Nation to train both VA staff and local health care providers for \nbioterrorism response. And, we can protect our national agriculture \nindustry from attack with biological agents. I strongly encourage my \ncolleagues' support as we move forward with this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM:\n  S. 1562. A bill to amend title 39, United States Code, with respect \nto cooperative mailings; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwill protect the right of charities, faith-based organizations, and \nother nonprofit groups to use the nonprofit mail rate for their \nfundraising activities.\n  The legislation clarifies ambiguities in the Postal Reorganization \nAct of 1970, PRA, which established a nonprofit mail rate for \ncharities. In recent years, the United States Postal Service, USPS, has \nincreasingly applied PRA regulations that disqualify nonprofits from \nentering into agreements with commercial printing and mailing \nbusinesses to produce and administer mailings. Because of this \nmisapplication, the USPS has been forcing charities to pay the full \ncommercial rate on some fundraising letters merely because they hire \nthird parties to print and prepare them. The result is a 40 percent \nincrease in postal costs for these charities.\n  My legislation would allow charities and faith-based organizations to \nshare ownership of their mailing with commercial printing and mailing \nbusinesses and still qualify for the nonprofit mailing rate. In effect, \nit would permit charities to mail at nonprofit rates whether they \nprepare the mailing themselves or hire someone else to do it for them \nsince the purpose of the mailing remains a nonprofit one. \nRepresentative Dan Burton has introduced similar bipartisan legislation \nin the House of Representatives as H.R. 1169.\n  It is important to point out that this bill maintains existing \nfederal law that prohibits unauthorized parties from using the \nnonprofit rate to sell goods or services by mail. Moreover, the \nlegislation does not limit the USPS' authority to enforce any other \nsection of federal postal law. The USPS has been consulted as a part of \nthe development of the legislation.\n  This legislation will enable charities, churches, synagogues, \neducational, advocacy, and other nonprofit organizations to negotiate \nthe best agreements they can for their fundraising programs. The net \nresult will be lower fundraising costs and more funds being available \nfor nonprofits to serve others. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to \njoin me in support of this initiative.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Miller, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 1563. A bill to establish a coordination program of science-based \ncountermeasures to address the threats of agricultural bioterrorism; to \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with \nmy colleagues Senators Cochran, Miller, and Feinstein, the Agricultural \nBioterrorism Countermeasures Act of 2001.\n  Due to the growing concerns about threats aimed at America's food \nsupply and vital agricultural economies, I am introducing this \nlegislation to identify, prepare for, and respond to such bioterrorist \nthreats to our farms, ranches, livestock, poultry, crops, and food \nprocessing, packaging, and distribution facilities and systems.\n  As we continue the fight against terrorism, it is critical that we \ndedicate sufficient resources to bioterrorism, a growing threat which \nhas the potential of putting the safety of the U.S. food supply at \nrisk. The United States currently boasts the world's safest and most \nabundant and affordable food supply, which benefits our citizens and \nhelps bolster our economy. Clearly, it would be devastating for the \npublic to lose confidence in the safety of our food. We, as a Nation, \nmust respond by developing the technology and implementing the \ncountermeasures necessary to identify and quickly control these risks.\n  The potential threat of bioterrorism to the U.S. population and to \nour food supply has been recognized over the years, from the cold war \nto the gulf war. During the cold war, it was known that the former \nSoviet Union had a bio-weapons program that included bio-agents aimed \nat agriculture, while during the gulf war our own soldiers have shown \nevidence of possible use of biological weapons. Meanwhile, in Japan, \nterrorists have already tried once to use chemical and bioagents on the \nsubways. In addition, the recent outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in \nEurope and ``mad-cow disease'' have increased public awareness and \nconcern about exotic diseases that may affect the public through \nagricultural infection.\n  The Agriculture Bioterrorism Countermeasures Act of 2001 will \nauthorize the U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, to strengthen its \ncapacities to identify, prepare for, and respond to a bioterrorist \nthreat including an attack on the United States' food supply and \nagriculture. This bill will expand the capacity of the USDA to enhance \ninspection capability, implement new information technology, and \ndevelop methods for rapid detection and identification of plant and \nanimal disease.\n  This legislation will also strengthen America's research and \ndevelopment capacity by promoting collaboration between organizations \nthat are addressing the use of agricultural bioterrorism, such as the \nfederal government, universities, and private sector. The USDA will \nestablish a Consortium for Countermeasures Against Agricultural \nBioterrorism to form long-term programs of research and development to \nenhance the biosecurity of U.S. agriculture. America's institutes of \nhigher\n\n[[Page S10797]]\n\neducation that have a demonstrated expertise in animal and plant \ndisease research, strong linkages with diagnostic laboratories, and \nstrong coordination with state cooperative extension programs will \nprovide the resources and expertise that will prove invaluable in the \nwar on agricultural bioterrorism.\n  Protecting our agriculture is critical to my home state. Food \nproduction and agriculture make up some of Texas' largest and most \ndiverse economies. Countless amounts of food products, grains, \nlivestock, and poultry travel across our 1200 mile border with Mexico \nand through our ports of the Gulf of Mexico. We--along with other major \nagriculture states included Mississippi, Georgia and California--are \nvulnerable to a bioterrorist attack. However, we will also serve as the \nfirst lines of defense for our entire country.\n  To protect our food supply, our citizens, and our economy, I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Agricultural Bioterrorism Countermeasures Act \nof 2001.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COCHRAN (for himself, Mr. Frist, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S.J. Res. 26. Providing for the appointment of Patricia Q. Stonesifer \nas a citizen regent of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian \nInstitution; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Stonesifer served \n     as an official member of the U.S. delegation to the United \n     Nations General Assembly Special Session on AIDS.\n       In addition to her responsibilities with the foundation, \n     Stonesifer is an active community volunteer, donating both \n     time and resources to a number of regional nonprofit \n     organizations, and serves on the board of directors of the \n     YWCA of King County and the Seattle Foundation.

Mr. President, this morning, October 17, the Washington \nPost reported that investigators from the Inspector General's Office of \nthe Transportation Department and of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration went to 14 airports over the past few days to test the \n``improved'' safety standards at our nation's airports.\n  What these Federal investigators found is unacceptable.\n  At Dulles International Airport--where one of the planes involved in \nthe September 11 terrorist attacks took off--seven baggage screeners \nfailed a surprise written skills test. The screeners are supposed to \npass such a test after completing the 12 hours of training that are a \ncondition of employment.\n  On a check at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport the same day, \nseven screeners were arrested by the Immigration and Naturalization \nService when they were found to be working illegally in the United \nStates.\n  The Transportation Department said an unspecified number of screeners \nat some airports were found to have criminal records that should have \ndisqualified them from their jobs. The Washington Post cited an example \nof a screener at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport who was removed \nfrom his post and lost his security badge after investigators learned \nthat he had been convicted as a felon in possession of a handgun.\n  During the check at Dulles, Federal investigators arrested a man who \nthey said was able to walk through a security checkpoint with a \nconcealed pocketknife--a felony.\n  Such a report underscores the need for tighter security at our \nairports, and the American people are no doubt looking to Congress for \nthe tougher airline security they were promised in the aftermath of the \nSeptember 11 attacks.\n  The Senate did its part. Last week, on October 11, we unanimously \npassed legislation to increase security at our airports. The Senate-\npassed bill would create a Federal force of 28,000 screeners and armed \nsecurity guards to check passengers and baggage.\n  According to media reports, however, that legislation has stalled in \nthe House of Representatives because of a partisan dispute about \nwhether airline screeners should be Federal employees or hired by \nprivate contractors.\n  We have tried that. We tried the hiring of screeners by private \ncontractors. That is what has given the American people the heebie-\njeebies. The Nation is jittery after having tried that. So what are we \narguing about? What are we waiting on now?\n  Privatizing the Federal workforce is an issue that often surfaces in \nCongress. It is part of a 200-year-old debate about the proper size of \nthe Federal Government. But that debate could not be more misplaced in \ntoday's post-September 11 environment.\n  In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center \nand the Pentagon, with air traffic at 40 to 50 percent below last \nyear's level, we should be focusing our energies on ensuring that the \nAmerican people feel as safe as we can reasonably make them when they \nfly. I think we can say with some confidence that the public has reason \nto be less than comfortable with the effectiveness of our airline \nsecurity system as it currently exists.\n  It seems petty to derail the whole airline security package over the \nissue of federalization. This is not a new idea. Federal employees \nalready perform key functions at U.S. airports, such as inspections by \nthe Customs Service, the Agriculture Department, and the Immigration \nand Naturalization Service. There has been no call to contract these \nservices to the private sector.\n  All sides on this debate realize that there has to be a larger \nFederal role in\n\n[[Page S10803]]\n\nprotecting our airlines and airports. And only by federalizing those \nscreeners can the American public be assured that ``cost-cutting'' will \nnot occur to the detriment of their safety.\n  There is more at stake here than scoring political points about \nwhether the size of the Federal Government is growing or shrinking. The \nAmerican people are looking to the Congress to reassure them about the \nsafety of their airlines. Restoring the confidence of the American \npeople in airline travel is essential to getting the U.S. economy back \non track.\n  For all of the big talk and for all of the gas that has been emitted \nfrom the larynxes of politicians, the one that would seem to help the \neconomy most is the passage of an airline security bill.\n  We have done our part.\n  I hope that the House leadership can settle what is a misplaced, \npartisan dispute, and address quickly the more pressing needs of the \nAmerican people whom we serve.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/17/senate-section/article/S10803-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
