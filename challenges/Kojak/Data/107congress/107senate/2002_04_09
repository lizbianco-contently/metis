Mr. President, I rise to introduce properly the \nPastor who just gave the wonderful invocation that opened the Senate.\n  It is my distinct pleasure to introduce our guest Chaplain and fellow \nTexan, the Rev. Kirbyjon Caldwell. Reverend Caldwell is the Senior \nPastor of the Windsor Village United Methodist Church in my hometown of \nHouston. I thank him for opening with a wonderful prayer this morning.\n  Reverend Caldwell has led his church of approximately 14,000 members \nin southwest Houston for nearly 20 years. He also delivered the \ninvocation at the President's inauguration last January.\n  Reverend Caldwell is an influential and motivational leader in the \nHouston community. He is well known for his zeal and compassion for \npeople. As an articulate and accomplished businessman, he has utilized \nhis pulpit as well as his business skills to develop successful faith-\nbased community programs throughout Houston. These initiatives provide \nhousing, job training, counseling, and other important services to \nneedy residents throughout the community, truly demonstrating Christian \ncharity and brotherly love.\n  The social programs fostered by Reverend Caldwell in Windsor Village \nhave become models for faith-based initiatives throughout the United \nStates. Reverend Caldwell came to the ministry truly from a calling and \ntruly from his heart for he earned a master's degree in business at the \nWharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, and he was a bond \ntrader with a firm in Houston and was doing well. But something else \nnudged at him while he was in the business field, and he decided that \nhe wanted to be a minister. So he went back to Southern Methodist \nUniversity to get yet another master's degree, this time in theology. \nHe serves on the boards of a range of community groups from the \nChildren's Defense Fund to the MD Anderson Cancer Center. Reverend \nCaldwell is also the author of the book\n\n[[Page S2376]]\n\n``The Gospel of Good Success: A Roadmap to Spiritual, Emotional, and \nFinancial Wholeness.''\n  I have known Reverend Caldwell for a long time. He is also a friend \nto President George W. Bush. He is such an important person in the \nHouston community, looked to by business leaders, community leaders, \nand by the people in the community who need help. He is always there \nwhen called. I am very proud to welcome him to the Senate this morning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/09/senate-section/article/S2376-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, if you picked up a paper yesterday, you \nwould have seen stories about a transportation wreck again. It was all \nover the television. It was all over the newspapers. There was a train \nwreck on Sunday in Gainsville, VA, not far from Washington. Five cars \non the train derailed, including two carrying propane, which is very \nexplosive. Route 29--I have traveled that road many times going to \nVirginia to watch my boy play soccer--was closed for several miles. \nThis is one of the main arteries bringing people to Washington from \nVirginia. The train derailment not only closed Route 29, but two nearby \nelementary schools were closed as workers tried to get the cars back on \nthe track and also put the propane back on the railcars or remove them \ncompletely.\n  An emergency worker said if the train cars had rolled in the opposite \ndirection, they would have hit an aboveground gas line, and there would \nhave been a catastrophe. This is the third train wreck on that stretch \nof tracks since 1997.\n  Over the past few weeks, several tragic accidents on highways around \nthe country have raised the question: What if? Just this weekend, a \ndust storm reduced visibility to zero on a highway in rural southern \nArizona. The result was a 26-car pileup. Another dust storm in Colorado \ncaused a 30-car pileup on Interstate 70.\n  What if a truck carrying hazardous waste had been involved in one of \nthese accidents? Less than a month ago at least five people were killed \nin a massive wreck caused by fog on Interstate 75 in northwest Georgia. \nThat accident involved more than 100 vehicles, including 20 tractor-\ntrailers.\n  In February, three accidents in 1 day claimed the lives of five \npeople in Miami-Dade County, all involving large trucks. The accidents \nwere attributed to human error.\n  We know accidents involving hazardous waste can and do occur on our \nhighways and railways. We all remember the Baltimore tunnel fire last \nyear which was caused when a train derailed. The resulting fire burned \nfor 1 week, and an extremely dangerous acid was spilled in the tunnel. \nBaltimore was closed basically for 3 days. We are very fortunate this \naccident was not worse.\n  Each year crashes kill over 5,000 people--that is, truck crashes--and \ninjure another 150,000 people. Over 50,000 people are killed in \nautomobile accidents each year. Large trucks are involved in \nmultivehicle fatal crashes at twice the rate of passenger vehicles. \nWhat if more of the trucks on our highways carried hazardous waste? How \ncould we ensure the safety of our communities? Are local emergency \nteams fully prepared to respond when hazardous chemicals are released?\n  The answer to all of those questions is obvious.\n  I can remember being in Ely, NV--I have said this before--where I was \nvisiting one of my friends who I went to high school with. He is a \npolice officer in Ely. He picked up a teletype indicating there was \ngoing to be a hazardous load coming through his town. He said: Why did \nthey send me this? I would just as soon not know. I cannot do anything \nif something happens.\n  He does not know. They do not have the equipment. He is not trained.\n  Last summer I introduced, and Congress passed, an amendment requiring \nthe Secretary of Transportation to study the hazards and the risks to \npublic health and safety, the environment, and the economy associated \nwith the transportation of hazardous chemicals and radioactive \nmaterial. This report should come soon. I am told it will be finished \nin the next couple of months. In the meantime, this is an issue about \nwhich we need to be concerned. These accidents are serious. We have a \ndeteriorating infrastructure, and we have more and more pressure being \nput on this deteriorating infrastructure.\n  Serious accidents have happened and are going to continue to happen, \nand we need to be aware of this.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/09/senate-section/article/S2376-4", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2376-S2377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NEED FOR A DOMESTIC ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we are prepared--I guess at 11--to move \nback to the issue that has been before us now for 3 weeks, and that is \nenergy policy. It is probably one of the most important issues that has \nbeen before the Congress in this session and one of the most important \nwith which we will deal.\n  Some important things have been with us for a very long time, of \ncourse, but now we find it even more important as we have national \nsecurity issues, as we have a need for economic security, as the \nsituation is changing in the Middle East that is even more pressing \nthan it was before.\n  One of the issues that has been with us all along is the fact we have \nnot had an energy policy. We have not had a policy that has directed \nthe efforts in the United States, which I think in itself is probably \none of the most important things we can do. It is hard to make \ndecisions in the interim when there is no policy that says where we \nwant to be and where we want to go. We need a policy so these interim \ndecisions can add toward reaching the goals we have in mind.\n  We have a very broad policy before us. We have worked on it some in \ncommittee. Of course, the President and Vice President Cheney have \nworked on a policy as well, the House has passed an energy policy, and \nthe Senate is the one which has not yet done the job we really need to \ndo. I am very hopeful we will come to the snubbing post and get that \ndone as soon as possible.\n  A lot of things go into it. This has been covered, but I hope we are \nkind of reenergizing ourselves--no pun intended--as we come back from \nthe recess to talk about a broad energy policy, one that modernizes and \nincreases conservation. We all want to find ways to make better use of \nthe energy we have, whether it be coal, oil, or electricity. We need to \nmodernize and expand our energy infrastructure, and as things change we \nhave to have an infrastructure, for instance in electricity, as we move \ntowards now having more of a market segment in generation.\n  If that is going to be done, then there needs to be a transmission \nsystem that moves the generation to the market. It is a new thing for \nus, and we do not have that.\n  We have to have some diversity and talk about and maintain diversity \nin our supply so we begin to use renewables. We need to find new ways \nof doing that.\n  I will always remember a meeting in Casper, WY, years ago when \nsomeone said we have never run out of a source of energy because we \ncontinue to find and refine new sources. We will continue to do that \nand indeed need to do so. We need to improve and accelerate our \nenvironmental protection, of course. Maybe most of all now, we need to \nstrengthen our energy security.\n\n[[Page S2377]]\n\n  We have found ourselves, rightly or wrongly--I think probably it is \nnot right--in a position of depending on foreign imports for almost 60 \npercent of our oil supply. Much of that oil supply has come from the \nMiddle East, and continues to come from the Middle East, and we find \nthat less secure than in the past.\n  Certainly that dependency on imported oil changes the decisions we \ncan make, and all these factors go into dealing with that. The one that \nprobably deals with it most directly is the opportunity to increase \ndomestic production, which has been one of the controversial areas on \nthe energy bill.\n  In fact, the energy bill was taken out of the committee. I happen to \nbe on the Energy Committee. We did not have the opportunity to put \ntogether the bill. So the bill that has come to the Senate is basically \nvery oriented toward conservation, toward renewables, toward most \neverything except an increase in domestic production. Now we have come \nto a point where we need to take a look at that. It is very clear how \nmuch more important that is right now than it was before. We see energy \nprices going up. We see much more uncertainty in the Middle East.\n  There are some good things as well. We see some new suppliers. We see \nmore imports coming from Russia, and hopefully some more stability \nthere. At the same time we now see instability in Venezuela. We have \nseen instability recently in Iraq. So it becomes much more clear that \nover time we really have to deal with this question of becoming less \nreliant on imported energy. So that affects not only our ability to \ncarry on what we are committed to do in the war on terrorism--obviously \nthat is one that requires a great deal of energy--but I think it is \nalso very important and vital to our efforts to regenerate and \nstrengthen the economy. The economy cannot function without energy.\n  I hope we can move more quickly in resolving the issues before \nCongress. The tax package has been completed by the Finance Committee. \nThere are 150 amendments pending.\n  Hopefully, we do not have to struggle through all of those. \nObviously, the question of ANWR is out there. We need to deal with \nthat. That could be perceived differently now than in the past because \nof continued pressure on the notion of imported oil.\n  We have a great deal of work to develop more clean coal technology, \nas coal is one of the most plentiful domestic resources we have. We \nhave an opportunity to become more efficient and effective in \ngenerating energy and electric energy. We dealt with that a year ago, \nparticularly in California.\n  Wyoming is the largest producer of coal. One of the real \nopportunities in coal is producing the low-sulfur clean coal, and \ntransporting that energy to other places. We can do more.\n  We have an opportunity to continue making nuclear energy important. \nFor anyone interested in clean air, which we all are, nothing is \ncleaner in producing electricity than nuclear power. We have not \nfigured out a way to deal with the waste. There is controversy on that. \nThere are things we can do. We can find storage. Looking at what is \ndone in Europe, they recycle from time to time. We can work those \nareas.\n  There is much that needs to be done; there is much that people need \nto agree to do to move forward on those goals. We find ourselves tied \nup over some of the elements. I hope we come together and decide what \nit is we need to do and get on with it.\n  I am hopeful we can move quickly, certainly to do the best we can. \nThe House has already passed a bill and is ready to go to conference. \nWe can reconcile the differences. The administration is anxious to have \nan energy policy, to have an energy bill passed, and is working with \nCongress to do something to make it work while making our economy and \nenvironment stronger. We have a lot of energy in our State.\n\n  The idea that if you produce and have access to public lands for \nmultiple use, it suddenly ruins the land, is not the case. We have seen \nover the years we can have multiple use. We can have production. We can \nhave gas production. We can have oil production. We can continue to \nhave a decent environment.\n  We completed a study on a portion of land under consideration for \nwilderness in Wyoming called Jack Morrow Hills. One study showed there \nwere operations there some time ago, and the natural evolution had \nchanged it back to a natural place. We have to be careful. We have to \nuse environmentally sound procedures and techniques. We can do that. We \nare committed to do that. I am hopeful we can move forward.\n  We have had support from veterans, from organized labor, from women's \ngroups, from the Hispanic and Jewish community, from Native Alaskans. \nAlmost everyone has been here. I had the pleasure of working with \nveterans who were here promoting energy policy. I look forward to that.\n  As we return to energy at 11 a.m., I hope our goal is to complete \nthat as soon as possible and move on to other matters.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, I want to take a moment to discuss \nwhere we are on the energy bill and how I see us moving forward. As I \nthink the record will note, prior to the recess I filed an amendment on \nsanctions against Iraq. The specific justification for that was my \nbelief that, at a time when we are seeing the situation in the Mideast \nerupt, we find ourselves in a position where we are importing over \n800,000 barrels a day from Iraq, a country where we are enforcing a no-\nfly zone, putting the lives of our men and women at risk. At the same \ntime as we are importing this oil, we put it in our aircraft and use it \nto enforce the no-fly zone. As a consequence, in Iraq, Saddam Hussein \ngenerates a cashflow that allows him to keep his Republican Guard well \npaid and obviously contributes to Iraq's capability of developing \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  The purpose of the amendment is to initiate a sanction against Iraq \nuntil such time as we can satisfy ourselves that the U.N. inspectors \nhave evaluated whether, indeed, Saddam is using his oil money to \ndevelop weapons of mass destruction. I may bring that up today. I have \npreviously received from the majority leader a commitment that he would \nallow an up-or-down vote on that particular subject at a point in time. \nI think this may be an opportune time.\n  The rationale for that is obvious. We find ourselves in a position \nnow where Iraq has indicated it probably will initiate a curtailment of \noil exports from that country for a 30-day period. We can only ponder \nthe results of that, as to what it will mean to the consumers in the \nUnited States as we see ourselves continuing to be dependent on foreign \nsources of oil.\n\n  I want to take a moment here to discuss where we are in the energy \nbill and my commitment to see us move forward on it. As you know, we \nhave had a number of successful amendments. I think we have developed a \nstronger bill. I think it is appropriate to give a rundown on the \ncurrent situation in the Mideast before I discuss that, and how that \nhas increased the importance of moving an energy bill off the floor.\n  There is virtually no way to explain the situation in the Mideast. I \nwill not go into the details, other than to highlight the effects it \nwill have on the United States.\n  While we were on our Easter recess, clearly the tinderbox in the \nMideast exploded. In 2 weeks, we have seen 5 suicide bombers; we have \nseen some 29 Israelis killed, 100 wounded. The same is true on the \nother side, the Palestinians. Israelis rolled into Yasser Arafat's \nheadquarters in the Palestine settlement when Prime Minister Sharon \ndeclared, ``Israel is at war.''\n  What did that do to the price of oil? It jumped, first $3 a barrel on \nMonday, March 25, closed at $24.53; trading at $28, and it is going up \nover $30. The Iraqis are calling on the Arab States to use oil as a \nweapon--oil as a weapon,\n\n[[Page S2378]]\n\nMr. President. Quoting from a statement issued by the ruling Iraqi \nBaath Party:\n\n       If the oil weapon is not used in the battle to defend our \n     nations and safeguard our lives and dignity against American \n     and Zionist aggression, it is meaningless.\n\n  Now Saddam announces a 30-day embargo against U.S. consumption--\nbasically a 30-day reduction of his output.\n  New reports emerge that Saddam Hussein had planned to ram a suicide \ntanker into a U.S. warship in the Persian Gulf. That came out of a \nChristian Science Monitor story, which I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Christian Science Monitor]\n\n        Ex-Smuggler Describes Iraqi Plot To Blow Up U.S. Warship\n\n                          (By Scott Peterson)\n\n       Iraq planned clandestine attacks against American warships \n     in the Persian Gulf in early 2001, according to an operative \n     of Iranian nationality who says he was given the assignment \n     by ranking members of Saddam Hussein's inner circle.\n       The alleged plan involved loading at least one trade ship \n     with half a ton of explosives, and sailing under an Iranian \n     flag to disguise Iraq's role, using a crew of suicide bombers \n     to blow up a U.S. ship in the Gulf.\n       The operative, who says he smuggled weapons for Iraq \n     through Iran for Al Qaeda during the late 1990s, says he was \n     told that $16 million had already been set aside for the \n     assignment--the first of ``nine new operations'' he says the \n     Iraqis wanted him to carry out, which were to include \n     missions in Kuwait.\n       The first plot, remarkably similar to the attack on the USS \n     Cole on Oct. 12, 2000, was never carried out. The status of \n     the other nine operations remains unclear.\n       The smuggler, Mohamed Mansour Shahab, now in the custody of \n     Kurdish opponents of Mr. Hussein in northern Iraq, says he \n     was first told of the role he was to play in the plan in \n     February 2000--one month after an apparently unrelated \n     attempt in Yemen to target a U.S. destroyer, the USS The \n     Sullivans, failed when the bombers' boat, overloaded with \n     explosives, sank. Suicide bombers later succeeded in striking \n     the USS Cole in Yemen, leaving 17 U.S. sailors dead and a \n     gaping 40-by-40 foot hole in the side of the warship.\n\n\n                          terror's footprints\n\n       If this Iranian smuggler is telling the truth, it would \n     represent the first information in nearly a decade directly \n     linking Baghdad to terrorist plans. No evidence has surfaced \n     to date that Iraq was involved in the Sept. 11 attacks or the \n     bombing of the Cole. But President George W. Bush has \n     declared Iraq part of an ``axis of evil,'' and makes no \n     secret of his determination to end the rule of Saddam Hussein \n     as part of his ``war on terrorism.''\n       The last publicly known terrorism involvement by Baghdad \n     was a failed assassination plot against Bush's father, former \n     President George H. W. Bush, during a visit to Kuwait in \n     1993. The elder Bush orchestrated the 1991 Gulf War against \n     Iraq.\n       ``The Iraqis may have been waging war against the U.S. for \n     10 years without us even knowing about it,'' says Magnus \n     Ranstorp, at the Center for the Study of Terrorism and \n     Political Violence at St. Andrews University in Scotland. \n     ``Iraq may have fought, using terrorism as the ultimate fifth \n     column, to counter U.S. sanctions and bombing. Plausible \n     deniability is something Iraq . . . would want to ensure, \n     putting layer upon layer to hide their role.''\n       Part of the justification for any future U.S. strike \n     against Iraq may be the kind of information provided by the \n     young-faced, nervous Iranian smuggler, now held in the U.S.-\n     protected Kurdish ``safe haven'' of northern Iraq.\n       Mr. Shahab spoke last weekend in an intelligence complex \n     run by the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), one of two \n     rival armed Kurdish factions that control northern Iraq. He \n     did not appear coerced to speak, and bore no physical signs \n     that he had been mistreated since his arrest on May 16, 2000.\n       Still, shaking nervously and swallowing repeatedly, he at \n     first refused to answer questions, saying that he was \n     concerned about his family's safety in Iran. Two days later--\n     after learning that part of his smuggling history and role in \n     several killings had already been made public in the New \n     Yorker magazine--he agreed to describe information that he \n     had previously withheld, about Iraq's plan to target U.S. \n     warships.\n       ``If this information is true, it would be in the interest \n     of the U.S., and of all the world, for the U.S. to be here to \n     find out,'' says a senior Kurdish security officer involved \n     in the case. Kurdish investigators were initially skeptical \n     of some parts of Shahab's story. But the investigators say \n     they later independently confirmed precise descriptions of \n     the senior Iraqi officials Shahab says he met, by cross-\n     examining a veteran Iraqi intelligence officer in their \n     custody, and checking other sources.\n       Wearing a pale-green military jacket, dark-blue sweat pants \n     and worn plastic sandals, Shahab softly recounts how he \n     smuggled arms and explosives for Al Qaeda and the Iraqis. He \n     at times flashes a boyish smile--the same disarming grin he \n     uses in images on a roll of film he was carrying when \n     arrested. Shahab also claims to be an assassin. The photos--\n     shown to the Monitor--show Shahab killing an unidentified man \n     with a knife. He grins at the camera as he holds up the \n     victim's severed ear.\n       During a two-and-a-half-hour interview, Shahab describes \n     the origin of the plot to blow up U.S. warships, while his \n     hands work nervously. He received an urgent phone call early \n     in 2000, from a longtime Afghan contact named Othman, who \n     told him to go to a meeting in Iraq. In February 2000, Shahab \n     says he was taken to the village of Ouija, the birthplace of \n     Saddam Hussein near Hussein's clan base at Tikrit, in north \n     central Iraq.\n       At the meeting, he says, were two influential Iraqis, \n     fellow clansmen of Saddam Hussein: Ali Hassan al-Majid--Mr. \n     Hussein's powerful cousin and former defense minister--and \n     Luai Khairallah, a cousin and friend of Hussein's notoriously \n     brutal son Uday. Mr. al-Majid is known among Iraqi Kurds as \n     ``Chemical Ali,'' for his key role in the genocidal gassing \n     and destruction of villages in northern Iraq that killed more \n     than 100,000 Kurds in 1987 and 1988.\n       The Iraqis said they considered Shahab to be Arab, and not \n     Persian, and could trust him because he was from Ahvaz, a \n     river city in southwest Iran rich with smugglers and close to \n     the Persian Gulf, Iraq, and Kuwait. It is known as \n     ``Arabistan'' because of the number of Arabs living there.\n\n\n                             nine missions\n\n       Al-Majid and Mr. Khairallah spoke of the nine operations: \n     We've allocated $16 million already for you,'' Shahab \n     remembers them telling him. ``We start with the first one: We \n     need you to buy boats, pack them with 500 kilograms of \n     explosives each, and explode U.S. ships in Kuwait and the \n     Gulf.''\n       The plan was ``long term,'' Shahab says, and meant to be \n     carried out a year or so later, in early 2001, after he had \n     carried out another mission to take refrigerator motors to \n     the Taliban. Each motor had a container attached holding an \n     apparently important liquid unknown to Shahab. He says he \n     doesn't know if all nine operations mentioned were similar to \n     the boat plan, or completely different. Some were to take \n     place in Kuwait.\n       The attack against a U.S. vessel, Shahab recounts al-Majid \n     and Khairallah explaining, was to be ``a kind of revenge \n     because [the Americans] were killing Iraqis, and women and \n     children were dying ``because of stringent UN sanctions, \n     which the U.S. backed most strongly. ``They said: `This is \n     the Arab Gulf, not the American Gulf,' '' Shahab recalls, \n     referring to the large U.S. naval presence in the area.\n       The Iraqis knew that Shahab, with his legitimate Iranian \n     passport and wealth of smuggler contacts, would have little \n     trouble purchasing the common 400-ton wooden trading boats. \n     He would have raised few eyebrows sailing under an Iranian \n     flag--the only ships in the area, since UN sanctions prohibit \n     such Iraqi trade.\n       Shahab was to rent or buy a date farm along the water at \n     Qasba, on the marshy Shatt al-Arab waterway that narrowly \n     divides Iraq and Iran, just a few hundred yards from the \n     Iraqi port city of Fao. Using a powerful small smuggling \n     boat, he says he would have been able to reach Kuwaiti waters \n     from Qasba in just 10 minutes.\n       Iraqi agents were to provide the explosives and suicides \n     squad; Shahab was to handle the boats and the regular crew. \n     ``The group that worked with me would sail the ship, and not \n     know about the explosives,'' Shahab says. ``When we crossed \n     out of Iranian waters, we were to kill the crew, hand over \n     the ship to the suicide bombers, and then leave by a \n     smuggler's way.''\n       The job, Shahab said, ``was easy for me, I could start at \n     any time.'' Shahab said the Iraqis told him they ``had a lot \n     of suicide bombers in Baghdad'' ready to take part in such an \n     operation.\n       But the plans were never finalized for Shahab, and after \n     delivering the refrigerator motors to the Taliban, he was \n     arrested in northern Iraq in May 2000, with his roll of film, \n     as he tried to avoid Iranian military exercises going on \n     along the border to the south. Though carrying a false \n     Kurdish identy card, his accent gave him away at the last PUK \n     checkpoint.\n       Iraqi experts say that such a plot is plausible, since \n     Saddam Hussein's multiple intelligence services are \n     sophisticated and smart.\n       ``Anything is possible,'' says Sean Boyne, an Ireland-based \n     Iraq specialist, who writes regularly for Jane's Intelligence \n     Review in London. ``Certainly Saddam has gone to great \n     trouble to shoot down [U.S. and British] aircraft'' \n     patrolling no-fly zones in northern and south Iraq, Mr. Boyne \n     says. ``He has invested heavily in his antiaircraft system. \n     He is eager to have a crack at the Americans.''\n       That impulse may also help explain the presence of a \n     training camp at Salman Pak, a former biological-weapons \n     facility south of Baghdad. It includes a mock-up Boeing 707 \n     fuselage, which Western intelligence agencies believe has \n     been used for several years to train Islamic militants from \n     across the region in the art of hijacking. A senior Iraqi \n     officer who defected told The New York Times last November \n     that the regime was increasingly getting into the terrorism \n     business. ``We were training these people to attack \n     installations important to the United States,'' an unnamed \n     lieutenant general said. ``The Gulf War never ended for \n     Saddam\n\n[[Page S2379]]\n\n     Hussein. He is at war with the United States. We were \n     repeatedly told this.''\n       Still, the political situation Saddam Hussein finds himself \n     in today--in light of the example of decisive U.S. military \n     action in Afghanistan--may not be as conducive to a strike at \n     the U.S. as it was when Shahab says he first heard of the \n     plan to blow up a U.S. warship. In recent months, Boyne \n     notes,\n       Iraq has engaged in a region-wide charm offensive to \n     portray itself as a victim, and to build Arab and European \n     support against any U.S. attack. Baghdad is even pursuing \n     warmer ties with Kuwait (at the Arab League summit last week) \n     and with Iran, in an attempt to gain mileage from Iran's \n     anger at being listed as part of Washington's ``axis of \n     evil.''\n       While the Bush administration focuses on Iraq's apparent \n     pursuit of weapons of mass destruction--in the absence of UN \n     weapons inspectors, who were kicked out in 1998--clues to \n     Iraq's true role may lie in the credibility of the 29-year-\n     old smuggler from Ahvaz.\n       Why is he talking now? ``Afghanistan is finished, so now I \n     feel free to speak,'' says Shahab, who was given the name \n     Mohamed Jawad by accomplices in Afghanistan. Asked if he \n     fears the wrath of senior members of the regime in Baghdad, \n     who still hold power, Shahab replies: ``I lost everything. \n     For many years I worked with assassinations and killing--it \n     doesn't make a difference to me.''\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, yesterday major oil producers in \nVenezuela went on strike. Between Venezuela and Iraq, nearly 30 percent \nof our oil imports are at risk. And that is nearly 12 million barrels \ntoday.\n  We also learned that Saddam Hussein has indicated a payment to the \nfamilies of the Palestinian suicide bombers of roughly $25,000. \nPreviously it was around $10,000. That is a terrible incentive for \nterrorism. One has to wonder where he gets the cash. But you don't have \nto wonder very long because of the $4-plus billion that the United \nStates paid Saddam Hussein last year for oil.\n  The Senate needs to remember that Saddam is much more than just a \nmember of the axis of evil. He is an energy partner of the United \nStates.\n  We now understand that Iraq, Libya, and Iran have called for an OPEC \noil embargo--an event that could cripple the world economy.\n  With each passing hour, the Mideast grows more unstable, and the \nfuture grows more uncertain. With each passing day, the United States \ngrows more dependent on foreign sources of energy.\n  What does tomorrow hold? More chaos and more bloodshed. The United \nStates has a role and an obligation to help lead the region to peace. I \napplaud the President for sending Secretary Powell to personally \nsupervise these efforts. But now more than ever we should turn our \nattention to here at home. We need to look at the realities of how we \nare going to meet our energy needs with or without the Mideast.\n  Given the choice, will we choose to keep us dependent on foreign oil \nor will we choose solutions found here at home to lessen our dependence \non imported oil, solutions within our borders free from the chaos and \nuncertainty in the Mideast?\n  I go back to 1995. If the Senate passed an amendment in the omnibus \nbill that would have allowed the opening of ANWR, where would we be \ntoday? We would be in production. We would be generating at least a \nmillion barrels more from domestic sources, eliminating at least a \nmillion barrels from imports. Unfortunately, our former President \nvetoed that bill.\n  The energy bill before us is one on which we spent nearly 3 weeks. \nThere is some criticism for the delay, but I remind my colleagues that \nwe are taking on an extremely difficult and divisive issue and dealing \nwith it on the floor of the Senate as opposed to the committee process. \nSince the debate started on this issue, we have disposed of 49 \namendments--21 offered by Republicans and 28 by Democrats. Working with \nmy good friend, Senator Bingaman, I think we have moved in a \nresponsible manner.\n  That total, I might add, does not include the two amendments dealing \nwith judicial nominees, or several amendments that have been dealt with \noff the floor. We have dealt with extremely difficult amendments, \nincluding CAFE, and specifically whether Congress should decide on new \nvehicle standards or leave that decision to experts; whether Congress \nshould impose a renewable portfolio standard on some electric producers \nor leave the decision on appropriate standards to the States; whether \nthe Federal Government should continue the liability protection on \nnuclear powerplants--that is the Price-Anderson amendment--the issue of \nreliability, and how best to ensure reliability on our electricity \ngrid; ethanol; and whether to create a reasonable fuel requirement.\n  But there are still significant issues left to decide. We need to \nclose out the issues dealing with electricity. We need to reach some \nagreement on the climate change provision in the bill. Of course, we \nmust address the tax provisions for renewable conservation, alternative \nfuel efficiency and production. We must decide how best to increase our \ndomestic production of energy sources since there are no real \nproduction provisions in the Daschle substitute.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, although we have some significant \nissues left to decide, we need to close out electricity, climate \nchange, tax provisions, and increasing our domestic production.\n  As I stated in my opening statement, because of the manner in which \nthis legislation has come before the Senate, we have been forced to \nconsider the measure without the benefit of the committee deliberation \nand action that ordinarily would accompany a bill of this nature. We \nhave had difficult and divisive issues that should and could have been \nworked out in committee. It is debated here in this Chamber. It is not \na question of laying blame on one or the other. The point is, we have \nto move on from where we are. This bill can only be resolved by the \namendment process.\n  Recently, we have seen statements that the Republicans were stalling \nthis bill because we had not offered an ANWR amendment. It is my \nintention to offer an ANWR amendment this week. I regret that some on \nthe other side believe there have been delays. But I believe the \nFeinstein amendment is pending today. Of course, I anticipate that we \nwill proceed and there will be an objection to moving off of it for any \nother reason. I have always believed the best way to move important \nlegislation is to work through the less controversial issues first and \nthen address the more difficult.\n  I remind my colleagues that it was the majority leader, not the \nSenator from Alaska, who decided to spend the entire first day of the \ndebate on various amendment provisions. We saw those amendments which \nwould not necessarily have been resolved with any significant advancing \nof the process. But, nevertheless, I will not belabor the manner in \nwhich this bill has moved forward. We have seen an extremely difficult \nprocess on both sides of the aisle in trying to balance a comprehensive \nand bipartisan bill that balances production, efficiencies, alternative \nfuels, and conservation.\n  The problems associated again with the movement of the bill probably \nneed a little identification as we work through the process.\n  There were no committee reports or committee-approved texts for \nanyone to work from. The substitute that was brought about by the \nmajority leader was kind of a moving target, and continued to be \nmodified even after introduction. Even with that, we still deal with \nmoving targets.\n  The renewable portfolio amendment offered by the manager on the other \nside changed so many times before introduction that the majority whip \ndidn't really know--and I didn't know--whether we were talking about a \nstandard of 8 or 10 percent or whatever. That does not form a basis for \nany kind of debate, and seriously complicates the ability of Members to \ndraft amendments or know what they are voting on.\n\n[[Page S2380]]\n\n  But I don't want to belabor this because what we are attempting to do \nis move this process along and bring up the other amendments. We are \ncertainly not looking to extend the debate on the issue or filibuster \nthis bill through unlimited amendments.\n  Currently, as I have indicated, there are roughly 150 known potential \namendments remaining--roughly 100 on the Democratic side and 50 on the \nRepublican side. Virtually all of them could and would have been dealt \nwith within the committee process. But the staff for both the majority \nand the minority are working to eliminate this list.\n  I pledge my support to improve the legislation before us and get a \nbill to the President as soon as possible. I urge my colleagues to \nrecognize the weight of this task before us as we push through the \nagenda and do what is right for the Nation.\n  I hope that as we start afresh after our Easter recess we can come \ntogether and recognize the reality that this country is in peril over \nenergy, that the continued escalation of prices is going to hit the \nconsumer and hit our recovery, the prospects associated with the \ncurtailment of imports from Venezuela and Iraq, which constitute 30 \npercent of our oil imports, and the results of nearly 2 million barrels \ncoming to a halt which we have depended on is going to severely affect \nour economic recovery.\n  It has been estimated for every million barrels of oil taken off the \nworld market, crude oil prices rise roughly $3 per barrel. Today's \nprice is roughly $27. Obviously, we are looking at somewhere between \n$30 and $33 if, indeed, this curtailment continues.\n  It is time to recognize that indeed we have some recourse. The \nrecourse is to reduce our dependence, and one way to do that is \nobviously to look favorably upon the ANWR amendment.\n  I thank the Chair and my colleagues for the time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/09/senate-section/article/S2380-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CHERRY BLOSSOM QUEEN ELIZABETH O'CONNOR\n\n  Mr. DODD.

She is a wonderful young woman \nwho is very accomplished in many ways. A summa cum laude graduate of \nNotre Dame University from Farmington, CT, she went to Farmington High \nSchool.

We are very proud of her. I \nknow she will represent the State and the country very admirably. In \nthe last few years we had another queen, Shannon Kula of my office, \nalso chosen the Cherry Blossom Queen.

Mr. President, I rise today, along with my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Lieberman, to offer a Senate resolution commending \nthe Connecticut women's basketball team. We have had a phenomenal \nseason from start to finish, with the crowning victory at the Alamodome \nin Texas, defeating the University of Oklahoma just a few weeks ago. \nTheir 82-to-70 victory in the national championship game on March 31 \ncapped one of the most dominant seasons enjoyed by any sports team in \nrecent memory.\n  The Huskie Women's Basketball Team finished the season undefeated, 39 \nand 0, becoming only the fourth women's NCAA basketball team in history \nto do so and one of a few teams that have had multiple national \nchampionships. There are only a handful that have had undefeated \nseasons and national championships.\n  The margin of victory of the UConn team over the season was \nastounding. A historical 35 points was the average margin of victory in \nthe 39 victories they had during the regular season. In all my years--I \nknow the Presiding Officer is a fan as well of sports and basketball--I \nnever have seen anything quite like this. Each game was not a question \nof whether or not they would win but by how much. A phenomenal group of \nyoung women, a phenomenal coaching staff, they just did a terrific job \nduring the entire season.\n  The accomplishments of this team go far beyond their dominance on the \nhard court. The Huskies have helped contribute to the greater cause of \nincreasing the visibility of women athletes. Nearly 3.5 million people \nwatched the final game on ESPN, which represented the largest audience \nfor a college basketball game, men's or women's, in network history. \nImagine, a few years ago, you would have been lucky to have a handful \nof people that might show up for a women's basketball game.\n  Not only did they have 3.5 million people watching on television, \n30,000 people were packed into the Alamodome to watch the final game. \nMany people would have predicted that could never have happened only a \nfew years ago. Why shouldn't it be so? Anyone who watched this \nremarkable team from Connecticut as well as the other top teams across \nthe Nation--Tennessee, Duke, Oklahoma; there are a lot of great women's \nteams, the number growing each and every year--would certainly be \nimpressed with the quality of the play they have brought to the game.\n  Theirs is a wonderful, pure style of basketball combining accurate \nshooting and flashy passing, as we have all seen, and sound all-around \nplay. For the women's team, one of the strengths was the senior \nleadership. NCAA Player of the Year Sue Bird, along with her senior \nteammates Asjha Jones, Tamika Williams, and Swin Cash, have played \ntogether for 4 years--four remarkable women.\n  This last victory caps an incredible collegiate career for these four \nwomen, including an unbelievable 136-and-9 record and two national \nchampionships--rather phenomenal. Throughout the season, their \nfamiliarity with each other made it seem as though they could read each \nother's minds as they played on the court.\n\n  All of us in Connecticut are deeply proud. Last Saturday, there was a \nparade in Hartford, CT. Literally thousands of people on a bitterly \ncold day showed up to express their admiration and pride in these \nwonderful players and their coaches.\n  Coach Geno Auriemma is truly a special individual and deserves some \nvery special recognition. He has led this team to victory after victory \nand does so with a great deal of style, emotion, and feeling for these \nyoung women. He arrived on the Storrs campus in 1985, at which time the \nHuskie team had experienced only one winning season. He quickly turned \nthe program into one of the leading powerhouses in the Nation, and the \npride of the people of Connecticut has been swelling ever since.\n  Coach Auriemma has compiled over 400 career wins at UConn including \nan unbelievable 272-and-17 record over the last 8 seasons. This \nrepresents a run of dominance possibly unmatched in the history of team \nsports competition. Under Coach Auriemma's leadership, the Huskies have \nwon 3 national titles, 12 Big East regular season titles, and 11 Big \nEast tournament titles. This year, Coach Auriemma was named National \nCoach of the Year for the fourth time in his career and the Big East \nCoach of the Year for the fifth time in his career.\n  Perhaps the most important example of Coach Auriemma's philosophy is \nthe way he has led these women to be winners on the court and off as \nwell. I know the Presiding Officer will be impressed by this statistic. \nCoach Auriemma has overseen a program that\n\n[[Page S2381]]\n\nboasts a 100-percent graduation rate for the young women of his team. \nThat is something to be emulated across the country. The entire sports \nworld could learn a great deal from Coach Auriemma and his staff and \nthe generation of UConn women's players who have played for him. \nAthletes do not need to sacrifice an education or other valuable things \nin life for the sake of winning. If you set your sights on excellence, \nthere is no telling how much you can achieve in life and where \nexcellence will come in every endeavor in which you engage.\n  Although some Huskies have gone on to excel in the WNBA, many others \nhave gone on to careers as physicians, lawyers, and educators. I know \nCoach Auriemma is extremely proud of the alumni association that has \ncome from the teams he has coached over the years.\n  Let me also congratulate everyone involved in this incredible season. \nI mentioned the four seniors on the team: Sue Bird; Swin Cash; Diana \nTaurasi, a young woman, not a senior. She was the most junior in age of \nthe starting five. I mentioned Asjha Jones and Tamika Williams. The \nstarting five is the only team in NCAA history where all five starting \nplayers are All-Americans. Sue Bird was on the first team, two were on \nthe second team, one on the third team, and one honorable mention. That \nhas never been done before by a starting five on a basketball team. And \nthe other players on the team could easily have been a starting team \nalmost anywhere else, and they contributed successfully to the success \nand overall efforts. They include: Jessica Moore, Ashley Battle, Maria \nConlon, Morgan Valley, Ashley Valley, and Stacey Marron. Thanks go to \nGeno Auriemma and his associate head coach, Chris Dailey, and Tonya \nCardoza and Jamelle Elliott.\n\n  Senator Lieberman and I are very proud of this wonderful group of \npeople, these young players. They receive a lot of support around \nConnecticut. We have always had to export our sports allegiance, on a \nprofessional level, and in Connecticut you are either a Boston Red Sox \nfan or a Yankee fan. Some are now Mets fans. In football, you either \nsupport the Giants or the Patriots. In hockey, it is Boston, New York, \nor New Jersey. At the collegiate level, the UConn men's team, under Jim \nCalhoun, had a wonderful season, getting to the final eight, losing to \nMaryland, and the UConn women's team going on to the third national \ntitle in the last few years.\n  While we don't have a professional sports team in our State, we have \nwonderful college athletics, and you can understand the great sense of \npride we all feel over this unique and special accomplishment achieved \nby the UConn women's basketball team. I know my colleague is here being \nsupportive.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/09/senate-section/article/S2381-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2381-S2382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONGRATULATING THE UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT'S WOMEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM \n                   ON WINNING THE NCAA NATIONAL TITLE\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send to the desk a resolution, S. Res. \n232, and ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 232) congratulating the Huskies of \n     the University of Connecticut for winning the 2002 NCAA \n     Division I women's basketball championship.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). Without objection, the Senate \nwill proceed to consider the resolution.\n  The junior Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, it is with profound pride--and I \nsuppose I should add provincial pleasure--that I join Senator Dodd and \nall of our colleagues from Connecticut in the House of Representatives \nin introducing this resolution, which is the legislative equivalent of \nwagging our tails and howling like huskies at the Capitol dome.\n  We are very proud to salute the 2002 national champion University of \nConnecticut women's Huskies basketball team, who, on March 31, capped a \n39-to-0 season--a perfect season--the ninth undefeated run in the whole \nhistory of college basketball, with a victory over Oklahoma in the \ntitle game. I suppose we should pay some respect and give some sense of \ncongratulations, even in defeat, to our former colleague, David Boren, \nwho is now the president of the University of Oklahoma.\n  This fantastic season leads me to repeat a pressing question that \nopponents of the UConn women's basketball team must have been asking \nall year, which is: Who let the Huskies out? I think the answer might \nbe the great Coach Geno Auriemma and his superb staff, who not only \ncoached but led, inspired, and mentored this extraordinary group of \nwomen to this extraordinary season. This marks the third time that \nUConn women have leapt above the rim of college basketball and the \nfirst time in NCAA history that any school has gone unbeaten on two \nseparate occasions.\n\n  Mr. President, you may remember--and I certainly do--a similar swell \nof pride when Rebecca Lobo and Jenn Rizzotti and company ran the table \non the way to the national championship in 1995. For years to come, \nstudent athletes around the Nation will be striving to approach the \nperfection of this program, and we in Connecticut are so proud of it.\n  As Senator Dodd indicated, five of these great basketball players won \nAll-American notice. They poured in more points than any other team in \nthe Nation and racked up an NCAA record average margin of victory of \nmore than 35 points a game--a remarkable achievement.\n  But the true measure of the team, as Senator Dodd indicated, can't be \ndistilled in numbers or records. You have to look at the humans \ninvolved. The legendary Geno Auriemma, one of the winningest coaches in \ncollege basketball history, once again brought together a great group \nof talented and hard-working young women and imbued that team not just \nwith the skills but with the team spirit and the togetherness that we \nsaw on the court perfectly and gracefully executed time and time again.\n  Senator Dodd referred to the four seniors who are legendary and will \nremain legendary in Connecticut for a long time to come: Sue Bird, \nAsjha Jones, Tamika Williams, and Swin Cash; and a great sophomore \nsensation, Diana Taurasi. They became an unstoppable combination. I \nwill say with pride that the surge of success is starting to feel \nhappily familiar to us, and we are very grateful for that. Over the \nlast 4 years, the UConn women's team has gone 136 and 9, made three \nFinal Four appearances, and claimed four Big East tournament titles in \n4 years, along with the Huskies men's basketball team, which this year \nearned its 15th consecutive trip to national post-season play on the \nway to the Elite Eight. The two make a truly triumphant tandem, that \nHuskies men or women have now won the national college basketball \nchampionship in 1995, 1999, 2000, and 2002.\n  This is a great program, and we owe a particular thanks and \nexpression of pride to the athletic director of the University of \nConnecticut, Lou Perkins, to coaches Geno Auriemma and Jim Calhoun, and \nto all their staffs.\n  Mr. President, this may give you some small sense of why Connecticut \nresidents are as loyal to our Huskies as huskies are to their owners. \nWe love the way this team came to play. We love the way they brought \nout the best in our State. If I may say so, as Americans, every day we \npledge allegiance to the red, white, and blue; but during basketball \nseason in Connecticut, we have a special place in our hearts for the \nwhite and blue alone. We are proud that the rest of the Nation is \ncatching on. A record crowd of nearly 30,000 fans turned out at the \nAlamodome in San Antonio to watch the Huskies win the national title. \nThat growing popularity is helping women's college basketball ascend to \ntruly new heights.\n  I am proud to join with Senator Dodd and our colleagues in the House \nin introducing this resolution and in congratulating the UConn players \nand coaches on their singular accomplishment and asking the Senate to \ndo the same. We are filled with pride over the honor the Huskies have \nbrought to Connecticut.\n  Two years ago, when Senator Dodd and I were here and I was honored to \ngive a similar speech saluting the UConn men's Huskies, I closed with \nthe\n\n[[Page S2382]]\n\nUConn cheer. I believe if I don't do it today, there will be objections \nraised under various Federal statutes. So here it is: U-C-O-N-N, UConn, \nUConn, UConn.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the resolution and the \npreamble are agreed to.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 232) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 232\n\n       Whereas the University of Connecticut women's basketball \n     team won its second national championship in 3 years by \n     defeating the University of Oklahoma by the score of 82-70;\n       Whereas NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Coach of the \n     Year Geno Auriemma's team finished the 2002 season with a \n     perfect 39-0 record, becoming only the fourth NCAA Division I \n     women's basketball team to go undefeated;\n       Whereas Sue Bird was chosen as the national women's player \n     of the year;\n       Whereas Swin Cash was named the Final Four Most Outstanding \n     Player;\n       Whereas Sue Bird, Swin Cash, Diana Taurasi, Asjha Jones, \n     and Tamika Williams were selected as All-Americans;\n       Whereas the Huskies' 35-point average margin of victory \n     during the regular season was the largest in NCAA Division I \n     women's basketball history;\n       Whereas the Huskies dominated this year's NCAA Division I \n     women's basketball tournament, averaging 83.3 points and a \n     27-point margin of victory en route to the championship;\n       Whereas the high caliber of the Huskies in both athletics \n     and academics has significantly advanced the sport of women's \n     basketball and provided inspiration for future generations of \n     young men and women alike; and\n       Whereas the Huskies' season of unparalleled accomplishment \n     rallied Connecticut residents of all ages, from New London to \n     New Haven, from Hartford to Hamden, behind a common purpose, \n     and triggered a wave of euphoria across the State: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate commends the Huskies of the \n     University of Connecticut for--\n       (1) completing the 2001-2002 women's basketball season with \n     a 39-0 record; and\n       (2) winning the 2002 NCAA Division I Women's Basketball \n     Championship.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the need \nfor an energy policy for our country. I have tried ever since I have \nbeen in the Senate to get us to plan ahead, to lead our country to be \nself-sufficient in our energy needs. Unfortunately, the disagreements \nhave been too great and Congress has not been able to come up with a \nplan that could be signed by the President.\n  Today we are not only talking about economic security, we are talking \nabout something bigger, and that is national security. We must have an \nenergy policy that begins to make our country self-sufficient because \nwe can no longer allow 60 percent of our energy needs to be imported, \nespecially from countries that may or may not be there for us.\n  I do not know what it takes for the American people to get it. Iraq \nhas just said they are not going to export oil for 30 days. The United \nStates uses 1 million barrels a day from Iraq and the world market. \nEvery time a country says they are not going to produce, it takes that \noil out of the world market and increases the price of gasoline at the \npump and the cost to every factory to stay in business.\n  We are in a war. There is no question we are in a war on terrorism. \nWe are in a war for the very freedoms on which our country was built. \nReligious diversity in our country has been the beacon in the world for \ntolerance and respect of people with different views. That has been \nattacked.\n  We are in a war, and when we are in a war, it means we must make sure \nour underlying strength is everything we can make it. Part of our \nunderlying strength is a ready supply of energy. We must have a stable \nprice for the energy we consume in our homes, in our cars, and in our \nfactories to keep the jobs in our country.\n  We should have done this 6 years ago. We should have done it 4 years \nago. We should have done it 2 years ago. But if we do not do it now, we \nare remiss in our responsibility as leaders of this country. The \nPresident has called on Congress to send him an energy package. We are \ndebating an energy package that has been passed by the House. It is a \nbalanced package. It increases production of oil and gas in our \ncountry. It has renewable incentives so that we will have wind energy \nand research into ethanol, soy fuel, and other products we can renew. \nIt encourages the building of more nuclear powerplants which is a clean \nand safe energy. We will have more clean-burning coal.\n  There are so many opportunities for us to become self-sufficient, but \nuntil we have an energy policy, we will not be self-sufficient and we \nwill be beholden to countries, such as Iraq, that are already cutting \nus off as I speak. We cannot allow any country, even a supposed friend, \nto have a veto over our economic stability which, in turn, is a veto \nover our national security. We cannot allow it, Mr. President. If we \ndo, we are not the leaders of our country that we should be.\n  I am calling on the Senate to pass an energy bill. Even if it is not \na perfect bill, we need to pass an energy bill. I do not like the bill \nthe Senate is considering. It has some big problems. We are trying to \nstraighten out those problems, and we have made some headway. Some of \nthe amendments that have been adopted have improved the bill.\n  When the price of gas at the pump goes up 14 cents in the last 14 \ndays, we cannot sit here and twiddle our thumbs. We cannot do it in \ngood conscience. It is time for the Senate to get to work.\n  There will be an amendment pending in the next 15 to 30 minutes. We \nneed to complete that amendment and go to the next one. It is very \nimportant. Part of the bill will give tax incentives for the small \ndrillers, the 15-barrel-a-day drillers, to stay in business so we will \nhave stability if the price goes below $15 a barrel. These are small \nbusiness people. They are not going to reopen a well if they do not \nhave some floor to help them stay in business and avoid the cost of \nclosing that well. That is the reason many of the wells, that were \nclosed when prices were $11 a barrel, have not been reopened.\n  If we can get all of the marginal wells pumping in this country, we \nwill equal the amount we import from Saudi Arabia every day. If we \ndrill in a very small part of ANWR, we can equal the amount we import \nfrom Iraq every day. That would be a significant step toward our \nstability.\n  ANWR is an area the size of the State of South Carolina. Part of it \nhas vegetation and is a wildlife preserve. The part we are talking \nabout drilling is 2,000 acres, about the size of Dulles Airport. We are \ntalking about the size of Dulles Airport and the State of South \nCarolina. I think sometimes when I hear the environmentalists debate \nthis issue, they do not know about the new techniques for drilling. We \ndo not drill all over an area anymore. We used to have an oil well \nabout every 50 feet. We do not do that anymore because we have \ntechnology that allows us to go down lower and spread out to get the \noil without damaging the surface at all.\n  We are talking about a very small area that can be drilled, and it \nhappens to be an area that does not have vegetation. Two- thirds of the \nyear it is ice, and the road will not ever hit the dirt because it is \nan ice road. We will not harm the caribou. There was a study that came \nout from the Department of the Interior that indicated there would be \nharm to the caribou, but they were not talking about the bill we are \ngoing to address. The assumptions the Department made in the report are \nnot in the bill that the House passed. It is a totally different issue. \nThey assume we will be drilling in other parts of the refuge which we \nwill not.\n  We will be sensitive to the environment. We should also protect the \nnational security of our country. We can do both. Do we want to protect \njobs and security in America, or do we want to be beholden to foreign \ncountries for\n\n[[Page S2383]]\n\nour energy needs which could shut down factories, lay off workers, \ncause lines at the gas pumps, and cause economic hardship in this \ncountry? That is our choice, and the choice is before us today: Are we \ngoing to choose to be self-reliant, like the greatest country on Earth \nat war, or are we going to rely on imports from countries that have \nalready said they are going to cut us off? It is a no-brainer, Mr. \nPresident. It is a no-brainer. We must look out for the interests of \nAmerica. If we are going to be the beacon of freedom in the world, this \nis part of our ability to protect that freedom.\n  We can do no less than pass an energy bill, go to conference, and \nwork out with the White House the differences we have. Let us put the \npartisan differences aside and let us make sure America has a balanced \nenergy policy. This includes conservation, renewable energy, \nelectricity deregulation, more production in our own country of oil and \ngas, and lessening the liability for nuclear powerplants, so we will \nonce again be able to build nuclear powerplants for clean energy.\n  The United States is not going to walk backward on protection of the \nenvironment. We will never do that. We are going to protect the \nenvironment, and at the same time we are going to protect the national \nsecurity of our country, if we do the right thing.\n  I hope my colleagues, who have come back from 2 weeks at home, have \nseen the prices rise at the pump, have seen the moms in SUVs who are \ntaking their children to school in carpools saying: My gosh, I cannot \nafford to fill up my tank and pay $150; I cannot do it.\n  No one says: Well, do not have an SUV. If they have five or six \nchildren and they are car-pooling, they are saving a lot of money \nbecause they are doing something that would take two cars to do. They \nare also looking out for the safety of their children by having heavier \nvehicles.\n  The time is now. We have the opportunity to pass an energy bill and \nput one more piece of our homeland security in place. It is our \nresponsibility, and I hope the Senate will step up to the plate and do \nthe right thing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nGeorgia is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/09/senate-section/article/S2383-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2383-S2384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   PRESCRIPTION DRUG LEGISLATION IS NEEDED TO HELP AMERICA'S ELDERLY\n\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, there is a little family restaurant in my \nhometown of Young Harris, GA, that is called Mary Ann's. It is where \nthe locals gather, and often some tourists, to enjoy the north Georgia \nmountains. It is a good cross-section of folks: Blue-collar laborers \nwho build houses and cut timber; teachers from the little junior \ncollege up the street where I once taught, and may do so again; young \nfolks determined to eke out a living without having to move to Atlanta; \nretired folks who did go to the city to find work and then came back \nhome as soon as they could.\n  There is also a percentage of people from States such as New York and \nMichigan who dreamed of retiring to the sunshine of Florida, and did. \nSome found it a little crowded and then came on up to our area in north \nGeorgia. We call them halfbacks. They retired to Florida, then moved \nhalfway back home. Nothing wrong with Florida, mind you. They just \nenjoy the beauty of our mountains.\n  The point I am making is this is a great cross-section of folks, \nusually equally divided between Republicans, Democrats, and \nIndependents. It is where I do my focus groups, for free--or not \nexactly for free: sausage, a biscuit, and a cup of coffee.\n  I suggest to both parties in Washington who pay those enormous sums \nof money for focus groups and polling that there is a much cheaper way \nto do it, and I swear I believe it is just about as accurate.\n  Anyway, the point I want to make is over the recess I was in Mary \nAnn's a lot, and I processed a lot of information on the cross-tabs of \nmy brain, you might say.\n\n  One day, an old timer, so thin he was mostly breath and britches, \nfollowed me out into the parking lot. That is where you can have real \nprivate conversations, usually with one leg propped up on the bumper of \na pickup. We have known each other all of our lives. He stared deep \ninto my eyes and he said: Zell, I am worried about Hoyle.\n  Hoyle Bryson is my uncle, kind of like a father since my dad died \nwhen I was a baby. Hoyle has always lived next door. When I was a \nlittle boy, he played professional baseball in the minor leagues at \nfar-away and exciting places such as Tallahassee, FL; Tarboro, NC; \nPortsmouth, VA. Most of his life he was a hunter and a trapper and \nworked as a lineman for the Rural Electric Association. He is 88 years \nold now, has lived alone for over 20 years since his wife died. Once, a \nstrong mountain man, he now has diabetes, prostate cancer, recently had \nangioplasty, and this week was bothered with a kidney infection. That \nonce strong body is gradually growing weaker.\n  So I am worried about Hoyle. I am worried about Hoyle, even though he \nstill makes his own garden and keeps a passel of hound dogs, as he \nalways has.\n  I took him to the doctor a few weeks ago and stopped back with him at \nthe drugstore to fill his prescriptions. They came to well over $100 \nand will only last him a couple of weeks.\n  Hoyle, as do most of our elderly, lives below what statistically is \nknown as the lower poverty level threshold. This is the group that is \nhurt most by taxes and especially by rising health care costs. They are \na valuable human resource that we must be, as my mountain friend said, \nworried about. It is not always pleasant and uplifting to see this \nsegment of our society. They make us sad. Many of us--too many--even \nrefuse to see them. We refuse to see them because we fear we may see \nourselves to be the lonely elderly waiting, waiting for someone, \nanyone, to knock on their screen door and, as John Prine sings, say, \n``Hello in there.''\n  The elderly are waiting for something else, too. They are waiting for \nus to do something about their needs. So far, they have waited in vain, \neach day growing older and weaker and many dying.\n  Do you know who we in Washington are like? We are like those people \nin the biblical story of the Good Samaritan who passed by the man in \nthe ditch and refused to help him. We are no better than they are.\n  Our elderly have always been the backbone of our society, and if we \ndo not give them some help soon, this Nation is going to get a \npermanent curvature of the spine.\n  Twenty-five centuries ago, Plato said it best: States are as men are. \nThey grow out of the character of man--and woman, I might add.\n  If we in the Senate are to be called civilized, decent, God-fearing \nand God-obeying, we who are so richly blessed must meet this stark \nquestion of human need. We must have a meaningful prescription drug \nbenefit, and we must have it soon.\n  I say to my fellow Senators, let us get our priorities in order. \nSure, it was important to pass campaign finance reform, to try to take \nbig money out of the political process. But is there anyone who would \nargue it is more important than a prescription drug benefit?\n  Election reform, we are going to get back on that. I am for it, too. \nWe need to make the process easier, and we need to make it \nfairer. Fast-track trade, let's debate it. It is important.\n\n  These important time-consuming, well-meaning pieces of legislation \nthat will tie this body in knots and run out the clock, are any of them \nclose to dealing with the clear human need of a prescription drug \nbenefit for our elderly?\n  If someone tuned in to the debates in this Senate since Christmas, \nthey would conclude we care more about the welfare reform of the \ncaribou than we do about the welfare reform of our elderly. This is a \nlife-and-death issue about our fellow human beings, for goodness' sake. \nIt is not about the fragility of the tundra in some far away isolated \nplace only a very few people will ever see. It is about the fragility \nof a human being's last days on Earth.\n  There is absolutely no reason, no reason except cheap political \ngamesmanship, that we can't have a prescription drug benefit before \nelection day--no good reason, no acceptable reason at all.\n  There are 11 prescription drug bills pending in this Senate today, \nall of\n\n[[Page S2384]]\n\nwhich would be better than what we have. With 54 different Senators \nlisted as cosponsors, that says to me a majority of this Senate wants \nto do something and do it now. All of the budget proposals floating \naround out there include money for a prescription drug benefit.\n  Both parties made this promise to our elderly in the 2000 election. \nSo why are we waiting? How much longer must we wait? How long are we \ngoing to continue to play this nonproductive, partisan, never ending \nping-pong game of retribution and payback that takes up so much \nvaluable time and, frankly, makes us all look silly and petty? How long \nwill we keep using the antiquated rules that slow down everything to a \ncrippled snail's pace, that on a regular basis thwarts the clear will \nof the majority of this body and instead substitutes the tyranny of a \nminority? We should stop this dilatory dillydallying and put up a sign \naround here that says ``No Loitering.''\n  We should cut down on some of this Presidential candidate posturing. \nI know you cannot do away with all of it, of course. But you want to be \na contender? Quit preaching and preening and produce. You want the well \noff to show you the money? Show the not so well off a prescription drug \nbenefit.\n  To do that, you will have to say no to some of those high-priced \npolitical strategists, those consultants who couldn't get elected \ndogcatcher themselves, whose advice is always the same: Have an issue, \nnot a result. Never compromise, never accept a half of loaf of \nanything.\n  Remember FDR once said:\n\n       Try something. If it doesn't work, try something else. But \n     for God's sake, try something.\n\n  That is what I am trying to say. I want Hoyle and all those millions \nlike him in the land of plenty who have played by the rules and worked \nhard all of their lives to have some peace and hope in the twilight \ndays of their last years.\n  If this so-called center of democracy keeps piddling and \nprocrastinating and postponing this issue, I hope the American people \nwill rise up as did those fans at that football game in Cleveland and \nrun both teams off the field.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in the coming weeks the Senate will \nconsider legislation to prohibit human cloning. In advance of that \nimportant debate, which will center upon this intersection of values, \nof ethics as it crosses with science, many have begun studying in a \nvery careful way this complex issue.\n  A number of colleagues have come forward and asked me, personally, \nabout this issue, in part because of my medical background, but also in \nlarge part because they know I am a strong advocate for and a strong \nsupporter of stem cell research, as long as that stem cell research is \nconducted within a framework of a comprehensive, ethical, and moral \noversight system.\n  The question I hear most is the following: Can one truly be an \nadvocate for stem cell research and, at the same time, oppose human \ncloning experimentation? After an in-depth study of this issue from a \npolicy standpoint, from the standpoint of being a Senator and looking \nat that legislation as a science, from a medical standpoint, I believe \nthe answer to this question is yes.\n  Until now, the overall human cloning debate has been presented almost \nas an absolute choice between, on the one hand, medical science and the \nhope for cures and, on the other, ethical restraint.\n  This is an oversimplification that does not do justice to the \nclinical, scientific, philosophical, moral, ethical, and spiritual \ncomplexities underlying this discussion. I am glad to see that a number \nof my colleagues and people around the country have not locked into \nthis false choice, but rather have stayed back to examine these in our \ndeliberations.\n  After carefully considering all of the evidence brought forward in \nhearings and on the floor in support of human embryo research cloning \nexperimentation, after considering the medical progress being made and \nthat will be made through stem cell research, and after considering the \noverwhelming ethical concerns about human embryo cloning \nexperimentation, I conclude that a comprehensive ban on all human \ncloning is the right policy at this time. I intend to support \nlegislation consistent with this policy, and I will encourage my \ncolleagues to do likewise.\n  As we move forward, one must understand the fundamental fact that I \nhope plays out over the next several days and weeks in the discussion. \nIt is important; that is, embryonic stem cell research and human embryo \ncloning research are not the same thing. Human embryo research \ncloning--called therapeutic or research embryo cloning--is an \nexperimental technique often confused with but distinct from stem cell \nresearch. The promise of stem cell research, for Parkinson's disease, \nAlzheimer's disease, diabetes, spinal cord injuries, autoimmune \ndisorders, cardiovascular disease--the promise of stem cell research \nand the science can and will progress with a ban on human cloning \nembryo experimentation.\n  Most serious observers--I don't want do say all--agree that human \nreproductive cloning should be banned, must be banned. Indeed the \nlegislation that will come to this floor will ban reproductive \ncloning. It is dangerous and it is unethical.\n\n  The question this body will be debating is whether or not this ban on \nhuman reproductive cloning should extend to all human embryo cloning. \nThe issue is not cloning of DNA, that is going to continue no matter \nwhat; not cloning of molecules, that is going to continue; not cloning \nof cells other than cells that become or are an embryo, that is going \nto continue. That is not yet fully understood and, in truth, we have \nnot debated the legislation on this floor. But that will become \napparent.\n  The House of Representatives has already overwhelmingly passed strong \nbipartisan legislation comprehensively banning human embryo research \ncloning experimentation and reproductive cloning. Now is the time for \nthe Senate to do so.\n  Those who favor human research cloning experiments often point to its \npotential to develop tissues that will not be rejected. In fact, on the \nnext chart--which I will not deal with today, but will come back to--\nare the arguments, the overall claims that human research cloning, or \nhuman cloning research is necessary to prevent immune rejection and is \nnecessary for other reasons.\n  As a heart transplant surgeon, one who spent many years of my life \ntransplanting hearts, this immune phenomenon is something I will come \nback to the floor and talk about because it is very important for us to \naddress. Advocates for human embryo research cloning and so-called \ntherapeutic embryonic cloning experiments say it will increase the \nnumber of embryonic stem cells. We will talk about that. They say it \nwill further basic biological knowledge. Again, we will come back and \ntalk about that as the debate proceeds.\n  There are facts that will need to be presented. But moving away from \nthe scientific standpoint, if you look at the overall ethical and moral \nconcern, it is this: Regardless of our religious background, most of \nus--maybe I should say many, but I believe most of us--are extremely \nuncomfortable today with the idea of creating cloned human embryos, \ndoing an experiment on them, and destroying the human embryo. That is \nthe state of the science. That is the state of the art.\n  If one supports human research or therapeutic cloning, given where we \nare today--our understanding of science--you are in support of \npurposefully creating an embryo, of removing\n\n[[Page S2385]]\n\nthe cells, and thereby destroying that embryo.\n  The other concerns which people will talk about--although I think \nthis is the concern that most people will start with--will be concerns \nabout women's health. Human cloning clearly will create a market for \nwomen's eggs. That is going to create powerful incentives for women to \nundergo an intense regimen of superovulation drugs and surgery, with \npotentially devastating side effects.\n  As a physician and a policymaker who struggles, especially since I \nhave come to Washington, with this inherent tension between scientific \nprogress and ethical concerns, I think there are two fundamental \nquestions that this body needs to answer, and the American people need \nto answer: No. 1, does the scientific potential of human embryo cloning \nexperimentation justify this purposeful creation of human embryos which \nmust, by definition, be destroyed in the experiments? The second \nquestion is: Does the promise of human embryonic stem cell research--\nand, again, this is separate from cloning--in any way depend on the \nexperimental research cloning, the human cloning research technique or \ntool? To both of those questions I answer no.\n  At this point in the evolution of this new science, I believe there \nis no justification for the purposeful creation and destruction of \nhuman embryos in order to experiment with them, especially when the \npromise and success of stem cell research does not--does not--depend on \nthe experimental research cloning technique. As my colleagues know, I \nam a strong supporter of stem cell--including embryonic stem cells--\nresearch, as long as that stem cell research is conducted within an \nethical and moral framework.\n\n  Last August, President Bush outlined a scientific and ethically \nbalanced policy that allows Federal funding, through the National \nInstitutes of Health, for embryonic stem cell research, using nearly 80 \nstem cell lines. This has, indeed, opened the door to a significant \nexpansion of embryonic stem cell research within this ethical and moral \nframework.\n  A lot of people do not realize today that there are no restrictions--\nwhether there should be or should not be is not the subject of the \nlegislation that will come to the floor--but it is important to realize \nthere are no restrictions on private research using embryonic stem \ncells from embryos left over after in vitro fertilization procedures. \nThus, when you come to that argument of just having a technique which \nproduces more embryos, I would argue that there is simply no compelling \nneed for any other source of embryonic stem cells today.\n  The state of the science and the state of the research we will be \naddressing again on the floor as we go forward. But given the serious \nethical concerns on human embryonic cloning research, given the fact \nthat there is a lack of significant research in animal models--and \nagain most people do not realize that we are talking about human \ncloning experimentation creating human embryos. This research has not \neven been conducted in animal models at this juncture. Thus, I find no \ncompelling justification for allowing human cloning, reproductive or \nresearch, today.\n  It is important also--and I will very quickly go through this--to be \nclear that we are talking about a ban on reproductive cloning along \nwith a ban on what is called research or therapeutic cloning, but it is \nall human embryo cloning. But the bill allows other types of cloning \nresearch to continue--many people do not realize that--whether it is \ncloning to produce animals, cloning to produce plants, cloning any cell \nother than a human embryo, cloning of DNA and RNA, proteins or any \nother molecule. In fact, I will not go through the entire list now.\n  The point is, the cloning science continues. The ban is on the \ncloning of the human embryo: the purposeful creation of an embryo for \nhuman reproduction or for experimentation and its ultimate destruction, \nwhich is what we are banning today.\n  I would indeed argue that any potential benefit of cloning should be \ncarried out--should be demonstrated in animal models before going to \nthe human model.\n  I wanted to make the statement today based on my assessment of where \nwe are. There will be plenty of time to debate this later. With that I \nwill close.\n  I want to say, once again, I will support legislation to ban all \nforms of human embryo cloning, reproductive, research and therapeutic, \nwhen the issue comes before the Senate. I, indeed, will urge my \ncolleagues to do likewise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 6 years ago last month I gave my first \nspeech in the Senate Chamber. It dealt with an especially important \nforestry issue. I continue to have significant interests in these \nmatters as chairman of the Subcommittee on Forests and Public Land \nManagement.\n  In particular, as chairman of this key subcommittee, I am committed \nto ending the tradition of suspicion and disagreement that has \ncharacterized so much of forest management over the decades. I am \npleased to be able to announce this morning a development that takes a \nsignificant step in that direction.\n  In March of 1996, what brought me to this floor was my opposition to \nthe so-called salvage rider, an approach that allowed timber sales to \njeopardize the health of the forests in my home State of Oregon and \nelsewhere. I believed then, as I do now, that salvage sales that \neliminate public input, prohibit legal appeal, and limit environmental \nanalysis, are anathema to responsible and effective forest management. \nNow, 6 years later, I rise in this Senate to announce the cancellation \nof a particularly important salvage rider timber sale and to emphasize \nthat, in my view, salvage riders are no way to do business in the \nnatural resources field.\n  I am pleased to be able to announce this morning the cancellation of \nthe Eagle Creek timber sale in my home State of Oregon. From its \ninception, I believed the Eagle Creek salvage sale was not subject to \nadequate review and that the planned logging would result in excessive \nenvironmental damage. For more than 3 years, I have worked to prevent \nthat damage. In July of 2000, I called on the Department of Agriculture \nto convene an independent review team to analyze the threat. The team \nfound that, indeed, the sale did pose a greater risk than anticipated \nto the well-being of the Eagle Creek forest.\n  Today, I offer my thanks to Agriculture Secretary, Ann Veneman, who \nfollowed through on her commitment to review the team's findings, for \nchoosing to implement them, and for effectively stopping the timber \nsale that would have done significant environmental damage.\n  The Eagle Creek sale is an example of a sale that should never have \nmoved forward in the first place. At the core, section 318 salvage \nsales are inherently flawed because they take the American people, the \npublic that we represent, out of the process of managing public land. \nAs I thank the Secretary of Agriculture for stopping this flawed sale \nthis morning, I call on the administration to oppose further salvage \nriders. Those who would follow the failed Eagle Creek effort are no \nmore likely to respect the health of the Nation's forests or the wishes \nand needs of the Nation's forest communities and stakeholders.\n  When the Government pursues natural resources issues with no \nopportunity for public comment, discussion, or appeal, the only result \nis distrust and dissention. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Forests \nand Public Lands Management, on my watch I am going to do everything to \nwork with my colleagues on a bipartisan basis to avoid that kind of \napproach.\n  I am especially pleased the county payments laws that I authored with \nour colleague from Idaho, Senator Larry Craig, are an example of how \nthe logjam over forest policy can be broken. That is an approach that \nprovides for the ecological health of forests and also helps to ensure \nthe economic survival for scores of rural communities. Our county \npayments legislation helps widen the way for a real discussion of \nforest management policy and an open discussion that must continue.\n  I come to the floor this morning to reaffirm my commitment to new and\n\n[[Page S2386]]\n\ninclusive approaches to addressing the issues of forest management.\n  The administration has now made the right decision on Eagle Creek. It \nis time to halt the destructive practice of salvage sales around this \ncountry.\n  I look forward to working on a bipartisan basis with our colleagues \nand with the Secretary of Agriculture to promote a balanced forest \npolicy that protects the remaining old growth in our national forests.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton).

Madam President, it has become very clear to me and \nto others that the linchpin of stabilizing the Middle East and also to \ndeveloping an allied coalition of Arab nations in the war on terrorism \nis the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Unfortunately, \nin the past 2 weeks, while Congress has been on recess, we have seen an \nescalation of violence. I strongly believe that Yasser Arafat must shut \ndown the suicide bombers or there will be no opportunity for peace in \nthe Middle East.\n  The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia expressed a vision for a peace plan. \nSecretary Powell is in the area to see if he can capitalize on this \nvision and restore peace and stability, at least to get a cease-fire. \nHis job is, indeed, a difficult one.\n  The suicide bombings are a potent weapon and they have been precisely \ncalculated to destroy any chance for peace. Again, why? If these \nsuicide bombers cannot be stopped, the situation can only deteriorate \nand the result will only be full scale military conflagration.\n  Israel cannot be expected to place a limit on her own self-defense or \nend her effort to capture terrorists so long as fanatics on the \nPalestinian side continue to plot and carry out these attacks.\n  Indeed, some 30 years ago, I recall hearing former Israeli Prime \nMinister Golda Meir say:\n\n       We are not going to die so the world will think well of us.\n\n  An overwhelming majority of the Israeli people still feel the same \nand believe as I do that Israel has a legitimate right to self-defense.\n  Forces under the control of Yasser Arafat have been directly involved \nin perpetrating the recent wave of deadly terrorist attacks against \nIsraeli civilians. Many of these attacks have been carried out by \nArafat-affiliated groups such as the Al Aqsa Brigade, recently \ndesignated by the State Department as a foreign terrorist organization, \nand the Tanzim. These are parts of his own military apparatus.\n  During the week of Passover, 46 Israelis were killed and more than \n120 wounded. In March alone, 125 Israelis were killed in the attacks \nwhich culminated in the bombing of the Passover ceremony in Netanya.\n  According to documents recently seized by the Israeli military from \nPalestinian Authority headquarters, one of Arafat's top advisers who \nworks out of his office is directly involved in financing the illegal \nweapons purchases and the terror activities of the Al Aqsa Brigade. \nThis same Palestinian Authority was directly involved in efforts to \nillegally smuggle in more than 50 tons of arms from Iran a few months \nago.\n  Arafat resumed using terror as a tactic after he walked away from \nIsrael's historic peace concessions at Camp David in 2000. The offer \nplaced on the table at Camp David may not have been perfect, although I \nhappen to believe it was excellent, giving the Palestinians 96 percent \nof what they wanted. They have not put an offer on the table. Rather, \nthey have opted for violence.\n  Since the fall of 2000, Arafat and his forces have engaged in \nhundreds of acts of terror against Israel, principally targeted at \ncivilians. Arafat and other Palestinian officials have been directly \ninvolved in inciting violence against Israel. Arafat and other \nPalestinian officials have been directly involved in failing to thwart \nterrorist operations because they know how powerful those operations \nare.\n  Arafat and other Palestinian Authority officials have been directly \ninvolved in releasing terrorist suspects rather than arresting them. \nArafat and other Palestinian Authority officials have been directly \ninvolved in failing to confiscate the weapons of terrorist suspects.\n  All of these actions are required under the terms of peace agreements \nhe signed and to which he claims to be still committed. So why is all \nof this happening? I believe there is a hidden agenda, and that hidden \nagenda is to drive out the Jewish people and create a Palestinian \nstate, which includes Israel. This has been the Palestinians' historic \nquest. Many of us hoped that through the Oslo process this quest could \nhave been changed. But I am increasingly beginning to believe it has \nnot been changed.\n  It may be unreasonable to expect that Arafat will be 100 percent \nsuccessful in bringing Hamas and the Islamic Jihad totally under his \ncontrol. But he can control Fatah and the Al Aqsa brigades and the \nTanzim. So far, it is impossible to make the argument that he has even \ntried. We must remember that Yasser Arafat has rejected all Israeli \npeace plans, and he rejected General Zinni's recent cease-fire plan, \nwhich Israel accepted.\n  General Zinni went to the Palestinians and said: What do you need? He \nthen went to the Israelis and said: What do you need? He then put them \ntogether and presented each with a cease-fire plan. The Israelis \naccepted it; the Palestinians did not. So one must believe the \nPalestinians could stop this violence if they wanted.\n  Israeli soldiers are now going door to door. If they retreat, I \nbelieve it will be back to the suicide bombing as usual. In the past 2 \nweeks, there have been no suicide bombings, since the last bombing on \nMarch 31 at the Haifa restaurant which killed 14 people. The Israeli \nDefense Forces, IDF, have arrested roughly 1,500 people and placed 500 \non the wanted list. The Israeli Defense Forces have captured more than \n2,000 weapons of various types, including thousands of guns and \nammunition, 44 combat vests and suicide belts, more than 60 pounds of \nhigh explosives, and nearly 50 rocket-propelled grenades and launchers. \nThey have captured night vision equipment and sniper rifles. The IDF \nhas also discovered 11 weapons and explosives laboratories.\n  In the final analysis, if there is to be a peaceful resolution of the \ncrisis, and if there is to be a Palestinian state alongside Israel, Mr. \nArafat must make every effort to take the measures necessary to bring \nthe suicide bombing and this kind of violence to an end. That is the \nresponsibility he bears as a leader if he wants to see his people truly \nlive in peace and freedom.\n  If Secretary Powell is unable to make concrete progress in ending the \nviolence and moving the peace process forward, I intend to move forward \nshortly on an updated version of the Middle East peace compliance \nlegislation that I introduced with Senator McConnell last fall.\n  The stakes are enormous. As an editorial last Thursday in the \nWashington Post--and I find myself strongly agreeing--stated:\n\n       It should not be hard to agree that a person who detonates \n     himself in a pizza parlor or a discotheque filled with \n     children, spraying scrap metal and nails in an effort to kill \n     and maim as many of them as possible, has\n\n[[Page S2387]]\n\n     done something evil that can only discredit and damage \n     whatever cause he hopes to advance. That Muslim governments \n     cannot agree on this is shameful evidence of their own moral \n     and political corruption.\n\n  And,\n\n       The Palestinian national cause will never recover--nor \n     should it--until its leadership is willing to break \n     definitively with the bombers. And Muslim states that \n     support such sickening carnage will risk not just stigma, \n     but their own eventual self destruction.\n\n  So either terror ends or full-scale war begins. This is the way I see \nit.\n  Hopefully, the world will respond. Despite all that has happened, the \nUnited States can and should encourage Israel to sit down at the \nnegotiating table for one final try. We should be responsible to get \nthe Israelis to that table. But if the United States is to do so, the \nArab world must also rise to the occasion and exercise this same \ncontrol over Arafat and the Palestinian terrorists. That should be the \nresponsibility of the Arab world.\n  I must say I was struck by the unhelpful nature of Ambassador Bandar \nbin Sultan's recent op-ed piece in the Washington Post. It seems to me \nif there is ever a time for responsible Arab governments to shut down \nsuicide bombing as an acceptable tactic for anything and push Yasser \nArafat into a cease-fire, real negotiations, and a peace plan, that \ntime is now. Both the Saudis and the Egyptians are well known for \nseeking and destroying terrorists or others who threaten them. But they \nfail to allow Israel the right to do the same or to destroy the \ninfrastructure that organizes and arms the suicide bomber and \nrecompenses the bomber's family. Suddenly, those who kill and maim \nIsraeli citizens are heroes, as long as it is only Israelis they kill.\n  Some believe that the Saudis want to have it both ways--support \nAmericans in our war against terror, and support Yasser Arafat as he \nwages terror. Ambassador Bandar bin Sultan gives credibility to this \nargument. Any premature withdrawal of Israeli troops before they are \nable to seek out and destroy the members of the terrorist network must \nbe replaced by a serious commitment of the United States and all \nmoderate Arab States to stop the terrorist bombing. If it is not, then \nthis country's war against terror will be mortally wounded by \nhypocrisy.\n  I suggest that Secretary Colin Powell pick up the Saudi peace plan \nand place it squarely on the table of world opinion, with the following \ncaveats:\n  1. Withdrawal of Israel to the 1967 borders and agreement to the \ncreation of a Palestinian State, to be conditioned by: A, defensible \nborders; and, B, a division of Jerusalem along the lines of that \nproposed by President Clinton at Camp David.\n  2. A 5-year phaseout of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the \nGaza Strip. This is a difficult pill to swallow, but it is also one \nthat has to be done if there is going to be true peace and the ability \nof an Israeli State to stand side by side with the Palestinian State.\n  3. No physical Palestinian right of return but just compensation as \nprovided for in United Nations Resolution 194.\n  4. All suicide bombings stop or the agreement is invalidated.\n  5. A peacekeeping and monitoring of the agreement by the United \nNations and/or the United States over the next 5-year period.\n  If it is true that all Palestinians want is their own state and \ngovernment, then they shall have it. If it is also true that what they \nreally want is the destruction of the State of Israel, then this will \nbecome crystal clear to the world. Israel has a right to live in peace \nand security, within internationally recognized borders, and only Arab \nStates committed to peace can bring this to a peaceful end.\n  The ongoing wave of terror threatens the survival of Israel as a free \ndemocratic and civilized society, and it risks engulfing the entire \nMiddle East in chaos and war.\n  Israel must fight against this terror, just as we do, just as surely \nas the United States must fight and destroy al-Qaida and the other \nterrorist groups with global reach. And I firmly believe the United \nStates should stand by Israel's side in the quest for peace and \nsecurity.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Truth in this town often gets mixed up with \nthe excessive political partisanship that starts to raise its head when \nthe hot contest on an issue arises, and one such issue arose yesterday. \nThe President took a swipe at the majority leader of the Senate over \nthe fact that the majority leader was not bringing up legislation on \nterrorism insurance when, in fact, if my memory serves me correctly, in \nthe closing hours before the Christmas recess, it was the majority \nleader who brought up the terrorism insurance bill, and it was objected \nto by the minority leadership, specifically the senior Senator from \nKentucky.\n  Then yesterday, the Senator from Nevada offered a unanimous consent \nrequest to bring up the terrorism insurance bill, and it was objected \nto by the minority leadership of the Senate.\n  I wish we would get our facts correct about who is doing what to whom \nand who is trying to bring legislation out to the floor of the Senate. \nThe fact is that the majority leader, as a number of Senators, thinks \nthere is a legitimate problem as a result of September 11 with regard \nto being able to insure high-value structures in uncertain times of \nterrorism. Therefore, to keep the engines of commerce properly oiled \nand lubricated, the commodity that is often misunderstood, known as \ninsurance, needs to be provided.\n  If we are successful in getting the parties to come together and the \nlegislative branch and the executive branch of Government to come \ntogether on a bill--this particular legislation that is being talked \nabout has a gross omission; and that is, the consumer needs to be \nprotected from the rates being jacked up so high using terrorism as an \nexcuse. In fact, that is what we are already beginning to see. We are \nseeing the rates of a number of liability, property, and casualty \npolicies going through the roof as a result of the uncertainty of the \nclimate set about by terrorism.\n  There is an easy way to handle that, and if this body does get \ntogether on a terrorism insurance bill, then clearly it ought to have \nthe protection that, first, the premiums collected for terrorism \ninsurance not be mixed with the premiums collected for liability, fire, \ntheft, slip and fall, and other activities. Why? If an insurance \ncompany needs to charge an additional amount for terrorism, and there \nis no experience or data save for the September 11 experience, we need \nto know how much is being charged so that the insurance commissioners \nof the 50 States will be able to build some data and see clearly \nwhether or not the amount of a premium being charged is, in fact, \nactuarially sound to support the threat of future insurance losses from \nterrorism.\n  The commissioners need data and they need experience and the only \nway, from an accounting standpoint, they can accurately measure that is \nthe premiums for terrorism insurance are kept separate from all other \npremiums for the normal property and casualty insurance cost.\n  A second provision that is absolutely essential for the protection of \nthe consumer is that there be a cap on the amount the premium can be \nraised. Instead of these gargantuan rate hikes that are now occurring--\nsome double and triple the amount that businesses have paid in the \npast--there could be a much more modest rate hike. If that is not \nenough or if that is too much on the basis of the experience--in \nother words, the payout for terrorism losses in the future--the \ninsurance commissioners of the 50 States will be able to have a record \nthey can then figure out whether that is too much or too little.\n\n  Instead of taking advantage of the trauma of the climate of September \n11, we ought to put a cap in any legislation we pass on the amount the \nrates can be raised by insurance companies.\n  Mind you, even though we think this is applicable just to large \nbuildings, football stadiums, or public places that might be on a \ntarget list of terrorists, just wait. We are going to see in \nneighborhoods that happen to be near a nuclear plant the rates for \nhomeowner insurance policies and automobile insurance policies jacked \nup; thus, all the\n\n[[Page S2388]]\n\nmore reason why we need to separate the premium that applies just to \nthe terrorism risk, as well as cap it for the initial rate increase to \npay for the terrorism insurance.\n  There is a third protection of the consumer that must be included in \nany legislation the Congress passes, and that is the prevention of \nredlining or, in other words, the prevention of saying: I am going to \ngive you terrorism insurance, but I am not going to give you terrorism \ninsurance. In other words, there has to be a mandatory obligation that \nall policies be able to have the terrorism coverage.\n  Those three particular points of protection of the consumer must be \nin legislation that comes out of the Senate and was suggested by the \nWhite House yesterday but with no details: Point No. 1, separate the \nfunds from an accounting standpoint so we know how much is going in to \nthe insurance company for the terrorism risk; No. 2, cap the amount \ninitially that can be raised until some experience can be built up and \ndata is available to see if the rate being charged for the terrorism \nrisk is actuarially sound; and, No. 3, have a requirement that there be \nthe mandatory coverage of the terrorism risk so that there cannot be \ncherry-picking, saying: We will cover you, but we will not cover your \npolicy.\n  Then the public of America would be well served.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to proceed for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the current \nstate of energy in our country.\n  We desperately need an energy policy that will address the future of \nour energy use. Now is the time for Congress to get serious about \npassing a comprehensive energy bill.\n  I believe that in order to make progress on this energy bill we need \nto balance conservation and production.\n  Many of us in the Senate understand that a balanced, sensible energy \npolicy must boost production of domestic energy sources as well as \npromote conservation. The energy bill before us takes good steps toward \nstriking this balance.\n  I look forward to the tax ideas coming from the Finance Committee \nthat will further promote conservation and the use of alternative \nfuels.\n  However, I still believe that this bill remains too weak on \nproduction. More must be done to increase our domestic production if \nthe Senate is going to pass serious energy legislation. Increasing our \nproduction of energy is absolutely critical in reducing our dependence \non foreign oil.\n  Right now we depend upon foreign nations and the Middle East for \nnearly 60 percent of our country's oil supply. As most of us know, \ngasoline prices have been increasing for the past several weeks. This \ncauses me serious concern especially since the upcoming summer months \nare when so many families take to the road for their annual vacation.\n  There are many reasons that gasoline prices are rising. One reason is \nthat OPEC countries have cut their oil production since the end of 2000 \nby a total of 5 million barrels of oil per day. Another is the \nincreasing volatility in the Middle East.\n  Gasoline prices have increased more than 25 cents in just the last \nfew weeks. Higher gas prices will place a strain on the American \nfamilies' budget.\n  They raise the cost of goods and services, and place an even greater \nburden on our economy just as it is showing signs of life.\n  The need to increase our own production of energy is especially true \nafter Saddam Hussein's announcement yesterday that Iraq will cut off \noil exports for the next month to protest Israel's actions on the West \nBank. He is also calling for an OPEC embargo on all oil sales to \nAmerica.\n  Before this announcement, the United States indirectly imported \nnearly 780,000 barrels of oil a day from Iraq. Saddam's threat pushed \nthe price of oil and gas even higher. I think we need to ask ourselves \nwhether we want to continue our dependence on other countries led by \npeople as dangerous and unpredictable as Saddam Hussein.\n  Our national security has never been more important, and we must \nstrengthen our energy independence to protect ourselves from madmen \nlike Hussein and the politics of the Middle East.\n  We are at war, and we continue to face economic uncertainty. Energy \nis a key factor in both of these struggles, and this means that the \nSenate absolutely must take a cold, hard look at ANWR.\n  The issue is too important to play games with. It is too important \nfor politics. Our Nation and our security are at risk.\n  The rules have changed. We need to stop playing around on this issue \nand to have a straight up or down vote on ANWR: No bluffs, no \nposturing, whoever has the most votes wins.\n  ANWR is the most promising domestic source of energy that we have. I \nbelieve it is indispensable to helping reduce our dependence on foreign \noil.\n  Of course there are some in the Senate who are desperate to stop us \nfrom opening up ANWR. However, with more than 10 billion barrels of oil \nrecoverable from ANWR, I think we all need to take a clear-headed look \nat it.\n  ANWR has the potential to produce over 1 million barrels a day. That \nis enough oil to replace the volume we currently import from Saudi \nArabia or Iraq for more than 25 years. The oil that could be recovered \nfrom ANWR could fuel Kentucky's oil needs for the next 80 years.\n  Drilling in ANWR provisions in the energy bill would make a huge \ndifference for our domestic consumption and would amount to an \nessential step toward ensuring our national security. We have no \nchoice. We must lessen our reliance on Saddam Hussein and others in the \nMiddle East for our oil by exploring ANWR.\n  Today the United States produces less than we did in World War II. In \n1970, our oil imports constituted only 17 percent of our domestic \nconsumption. That is three-and-a-half times less than what we import \ntoday. This dangerous trend must be reversed.\n  Furthermore, recent advances in technology will enable us to extract \noil in ANWR in an environmentally sensitive way.\n  America's environmental safeguards are the toughest in the world. \nThis means that the drilling operations will be conducted under the \nmost comprehensive environmental regulations.\n  We all want to protect our environment. If we do not do a better job \ndeveloping domestic energy, we will continue to rely on foreign oil, \noil from other nations. These nations have weaker environmental rules \nthan we do. Under these weaker safeguards, the damage to the \nenvironment will be even greater than if we use ANWR.\n\n  I also think that our domestic production should be increased through \nthe use of clean coal technology. I am proud to come from a coal state. \nThe energy bill provides a good start at increasing research and \ndevelopment and encouraging the use of clean coal technology.\n  The proposed tax package will also further increase incentives for \nthe use of clean coal technology. Clean coal is\n\n[[Page S2389]]\n\nimportant to increasing our domestic energy production in an \nenvironmentally sensitive way. We have over 275 billion tons of \nrecoverable coal reserves. This is nearly 30 percent of the world's \ntotal coal supply. That is enough coal to supply us with energy for \nanother 270 years.\n  Because of research advances, we now have the know-how to better \nbalance conservation with the need for increased production. Let's use \nthis ability to come up with a good piece of energy legislation.\n  Yesterday's announcement by Saddam Hussein should remind everyone how \nvulnerable our economy and national security are to arbitrary decisions \nmade by dangerous foreign dictators.\n  For over two decades, we've hemmed and hawed about the need for \nAmerica to follow a sensible, long-term energy strategy. If the threat \nof Saddam Hussein putting a gun to our head--again--does not help us \npass a bill, I do not know what will.\n  I hope we are on our way to producing a balanced comprehensive energy \nbill that increases production and conservation and makes a difference \nfor our national security. I hope that we can move quickly to pass an \nenergy bill that will make our economy and national security stronger. \nThe time is now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, are we on the energy bill at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are not.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/09/senate-section/article/S2389-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2389-S2402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       NATIONAL LABORATORIES PARTNERSHIP IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I understand that under the regular order we \nwould be on the Reid and Feinstein amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken to the senior Senator from \nCalifornia. She is going to move to table my amendment as soon as she \ncompletes her remarks. I will, therefore, say just a few things.\n  I, first of all, commend the Senator from California for her \namendment and for her work on this extremely difficult issue dealing \nwith derivatives regulation.\n  To put this in proper perspective, I think we should look at the \npredicament in which Senator Feinstein now finds herself. She \nrepresents 35 million people, the largest State in the United States. \nThis State's gross domestic product is larger than most nations. She \nknows specifically, but I think California has the sixth or seventh \nlargest gross national product in the world.\n  Last year's energy crisis threatened California's prosperity and \nbrought home to all of us that we are in uncharted territory with \nregard to energy deregulation. The State of Nevada actually passed \nderegulation legislation. I spoke to the legislature a year ago. \nBecause of my suggestions and others, they rescinded deregulation. But \neven by that time certain things had been put in place. Nevada \nsuffered, along with California, with this energy crisis.\n  Enron was the supposed leader in energy trading and markets. It makes \nme wonder how can we have a company such as Enron in this country--a \npublicly owned company--that changes in 1 year from a high-flying, \nworldwide, mega company into a bankrupt loser. In the process, \nhundreds, if not thousands, of people's lives were ruined. We have many \ncongressional committees now looking at what happened. A prosecutor is \nalso looking into criminal activities that probably took place.\n  I think we all owe Senator Feinstein a debt of gratitude for her \ninterest in this issue and for the work in process to make changes to \nthe Commodity Exchange Act that will ensure trading and energy \nderivatives is done in the open with transparency in a way that \ninspires public confidence in the market.\n  The amendment I have offered, and which she is going to move to \ntable, would restore metal derivatives trading to exempt commodity \nstatus. Senator Feinstein's amendment inadvertently included metals \nderivatives with the derivatives that are the intended target of her \namendment. Like other metals, metals derivatives markets help companies \nmanage the risk of sudden and large price changes.\n  In recent years, derivatives and other so-called ``hedging \ntransactions'' have helped the mining industry--especially in the State \nof Nevada--cope with the steadily declining gold price by selling \nmining production forward. The last couple of years illustrate the \nfunction and the value in the marketplace of such transactions.\n  Some companies decided not to hedge, betting that the gold price \nwould rise and that hedging contracts would lock them into below-market \nprices. Most of these companies were hurt significantly because the \ngold price stayed relatively low.\n  In contrast, other companies hedged some or most of their production. \nThese companies have survived, and survived well, and some have even \nthrived. By choosing to manage their risk, they accepted the risk that \nthe gold price could rise, but they stabilized company performance, \ncontinued to provide jobs, and continued to contribute to the \ncommunities in Nevada where they are so important.\n\n  Unlike energy derivatives, which raise questions because of the \nrecent energy crisis, metal derivatives have been traded over the \ncounter for many years. The 2,000 amendments to the Commodity Exchange \nAct didn't change this; they only clarified and confirmed the legality \nof these markets. Lumping metal derivatives together with energy \nderivatives would impose regulatory burdens that never existed, even \nbefore the 2,000 amendments, without any justification.\n  The amendment I have offered would not allow metals derivatives \nmarkets and participants to trade derivatives without accountability \nand transparency.\n  I hope, first of all, that my amendment will be accepted. If there is \na motion to table, which I understand my friend is going to offer, I \nhope it will be defeated.\n  The metal derivatives market has been going on for many years. I \nrepeat that unlike energy derivatives, which raise questions because of \nthe recent energy crisis, metal derivatives have been traded over the \ncounter for many years with absolutely no problem. My amendment is \nnecessary to restore metal derivatives trading to exempt status, which \nis critical to the health of the mining industry.\n  Because of the low price of gold, the mining industry has really \nstruggled. We have seen various articles, which I know the Presiding \nOfficer is interested in, which have indicated there is agreement that \nthere needs to be a change in the 1872 mining law, which has absolutely \nnothing to do with what I am talking about. But the mining industry has \nagreed that we need to go forward with that. At a National Mining \nAssociation meeting, Jack Gerard\n\n[[Page S2390]]\n\nstated in the papers over the weekend that he agrees there should be \nchanges. That is something which we have acknowledged and recommended \nand have worked on for a number of years. The Presiding Officer worked \nwith us on this.\n  I hope with the many legislative things we have to do that we can \nmove forward on this in a way that would bring about some stability to \nthe mining industry. I look forward to working with not only the \nPresiding Officer but also with the manager of this bill, Senator \nBingaman.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3081, As Modified\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3081 to amendment No. 2989, as modified.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I very much appreciate what the \ndistinguished Senator from Nevada has done, which is essentially to \neliminate metals from the derivatives amendment that is now pending. It \nis a second-degree amendment. It would continue the exemption for \nmetals.\n  I want to go into three cases and why I believe metals should be \nincluded.\n  The first is the case called Sumitoma. It goes back to 1996. After \nnearly a year of complaints by market participants and regulated \nmarkets, Sumitoma copper trading irregularities ended up with the \ncompany losing a reported $4 billion and their main copper trader \npleading guilty to the Japanese equivalent of market manipulation. The \ncompany is paying record fines to the United States and British \nregulatory authorities.\n  Sumitoma manipulation efforts occurred in the over-the-counter and \ncash markets. Although observed by market participants and markets, the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission--the CFTC--was nearly powerless to \ndo anything about it without the consent of the British regulator.\n  In the 30 days following the May 17, 1996, collapse, the market \ndropped by nearly 60 cents per pound--from $1.30 to 70 cents by the \nmiddle of June.\n  In just the 8 months prior to the collapse, U.S. consumers were \novercharged by nearly $2.5 billion in copper purchases because of the \nSumitoma trader's manipulation.\n  Once again, had the CFTC had the authority--just modest authority--in \nour amendment, this fraud could have been detected and dealt with much \nearlier and without such a devastating economic impact.\n  We are simply including the antifraud and antimanipulation provision \nof the CFTC, and applying it also to metals as well as energy.\n  Let me cite a second one having to do with the Metalgeselschaft \ncollapse in 1993. This company was known as MG. It was once a \npreeminent metals and energy trader. It collapsed in late 1993, losing \nbillions of dollars, costing thousands of employees their jobs, and \nendangering the energy marketplace. After the collapse, analysis showed \nthat MG's derivative positions, over the counter, in combination with \nthe faulty strategy, contributed to the collapse. If the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission, the CFTC, had at that time the authority \ncontained in our amendment to monitor large trader positions and ensure \nadequate net capital, the debacle could likely have been avoided. It \ncertainly would have been detected far before the collapse occurred. \nThat is point 2. These are actual cases that have taken place.\n  Point 3: The Hunt brothers and the silver bubble. In 1979, the sons \nof patriarch H.L. Hunt, Nelson Bunker and William Herbert, together \nwith some wealthy Arabs, formed a silver pool. In a short period of \ntime they had amassed more than 200 million ounces of silver, \nequivalent to half of the world's deliverable supply. When the Hunts \nbegan accumulating silver back in 1973, the price was in the $1.95 an \nounce range. Early in 1979, the price was about $5. In late 1979, early \n1980, the price was $50, peaking at $54.\n  Once the silver market was cornered, outsiders joined the chase. But \na combination of changed trading rules on the New York Metals Market, \nCOMEX, and the intervention of the Federal Reserve put an end to the \ngame. The price began to slide. It culminated in a 50-percent 1-day \ndecline on March 27, 1980, as the price plummeted from $21.62 to \n$10.80.\n  The collapse of the silver market meant countless losses for \nspeculators. The Hunt brothers declared bankruptcy. By 1987, their \nliabilities had grown to nearly $2.5 billion against assets of $1.5 \nbillion. And in August of 1988, the Hunts were convicted of conspiring \nto manipulate the market.\n  This is the point. These things have happened. These are three big \nmetals cases. What we say is, put them within the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission antifraud and antimanipulation commission. Why give \nonline trading platforms exemptions from transparency? Why allow a \ncommodity that isn't being delivered from me to you but traded back and \nforth to have no transparency of any of these trades so that no one can \nfind an audit trail, no one can find the records, and no one can ever \nknow what really happened?\n  At the end of my remarks, I will move to table the Reid amendment.\n  I will briefly talk about the energy derivatives amendment \ncosponsored by Senators Fitzgerald, Cantwell, Wyden, Corzine, Leahy, \nand Boxer, and the Presiding Officer. I am very grateful for your \nsupport.\n  Our amendment is currently supported by the National Rural Electric \nCooperative Association, the Derivatives Study Center, the Sierra Club, \nthe American Power Association, the American Public Gas Association, \nthe Texas Independent Petroleum Royalty Owners Association, the Mid-\nAmerican Energy Holdings Company, the New York Mercantile Exchange, the \nCalifornia Municipal Utilities Association, the United States Public \nInterest Research Group, the Consumers Union, the Consumers Federation \nof America, the Apache Corporation, Calpine, Southern California \nEdison, Pacific Gas and Electric, the Silver Users Association--\ninterestingly enough, they are concerned; they want metals in this \namendment--the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's Commissioner Tom \nErickson, and all four Commissioners of the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission, including its Chairman, Pat Wood.\n\n  Because of this support, the amendment has been filibustered by \ncertain Senators who don't want to see it come to a vote. The amendment \nhas now been on the floor for more than a month. The leadership was \nforced to file cloture last night to try to bring this to a conclusion.\n\n[[Page S2392]]\n\n  Some of the opponents continue to argue that this amendment is too \ncomplicated for them to understand. I once again explain very simply \nwhat our amendment does. The amendment provides antifraud and \nantimanipulation authority to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission \nfor all energy trades and metals where there is no physical delivery.\n  If I buy energy from you, Mr. President, and you deliver that energy \ndirectly to me, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has \noversight--antifraud, antimanipulation oversight--and you must keep \nrecords; I must keep records.\n  But if there is no delivery--if I buy an energy swap, for instance, \nto lock in a set price and protect myself from risk--the CFTC does not \nhave oversight, if I use an electronic trading exchange. That is the \nrub. The electronic trading exchange is exempted. If we go through the \nChicago Mercantile, we are not exempted. If we go through New York, we \nare not exempted. But an online trading platform has no transparency \nfor a derivative not delivered.\n  In fact, the CFTC may not even be able to investigate fraud or \nmanipulation if the exchange was operated, like Enron Online, where \nEnron was both a buyer and a seller. This is what is known as a \nbilateral dealer market. If Enron Online or another company operating a \nbilateral dealer market wanted to manipulate prices and/or corner the \nmarket, regulators might very well be helpless to investigate.\n  Since more than 90 percent of energy trades do not involve delivery, \nand since other electronic exchanges are now emulating the Enron model, \nthere is a huge loophole here. I will predict that some of these go \ndown just as Enron did.\n  Our amendment closes that Enron loophole and makes sure the CFTC has \nfull antifraud, antimanipulation authority over all energy trades where \nthere is no delivery.\n  The amendment also subjects all dealer markets selling energy and \nmetals derivatives online, including Enron Online, Dynegy Direct, \nAquila, to similar requirements as other nonelectronic exchanges. This \nmeans these exchanges would have to file with the CFTC, provide some \nprice transparency and price disclosure, and maintain capital \ncommensurate with risk--all the things that Enron Online did not do and \ndid not have to do because of the 2000 Commodity Futures Modernization \nAct which provided Enron this loophole. How convenient.\n  Someone buys energy not on an exchange; let's say they pick up the \nphone and buy an energy derivative, but there is no delivery. The \ntransaction is subject only to antifraud and antimanipulation \nauthority. So if you are trading energy derivatives on an electronic \ntrading platform, that exchange is regulated just as other exchanges.\n  If you are not using an exchange, the CFTC can investigate \nallegations of fraud and manipulation. I don't think this is confusing \nat all. Either we are going to require energy trades to be transparent \nor we are going to continue to support loopholes, allowing some energy \ntrading to be done in the dark of night.\n  I want to point out that on this simple proposal, just to close \nloopholes in the energy and metals markets, we have now spent 3\\1/2\\ \nhours more of debate than this body spent considering the entire \nCommodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000--that's right, 3\\1/2\\ hours \nmore debate than was spent on the entire Commodity Futures \nModernization Act.\n  The Senate did not spend 1 minute debating the Commodity Futures \nModernization Act--one of the most sweeping regulatory revisions in \nseveral decades. And the loophole for Enron just went through. Yes, the \nSenate Agriculture Committee held hearings and completed a markup of \nthe Senate version of the CFMA on June 29, 2000; but that is where the \nprocess stopped in the Senate.\n  At the last minute, Enron lobbied the House for an exemption for \nenergy and metals trading. This is what appeared in the appropriations \nbill for the Department of Labor and Health and Human Services at the \nvery end of the 106th Congress. And this was inconsistent with what the \nSenate Agriculture Committee marked up in regard to energy and metal.\n  The amendment we are debating is consistent with the bill that \nSenator Lugar and the Agriculture Committee, which he chaired, marked \nup. What the Agriculture Committee passed was consistent with the \nrecommendations spelled out in the November 1999 President's working \ngroup, signed by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, Treasury Secretary Larry \nSummers, SEC Chairman Art Leavitt, and CFTC Chairman William Rainer. \nThat report asserted that there should be two categories of \nderivatives--financial derivatives and everything else. There was no \nreason that metal or energy or any other tangible, finite commodity \nshould be entitled to its own category.\n  So what we are doing in our amendment is entirely consistent with \nthat report. In regard to the electronic trading platforms, we simply \nreturn things to the way they were before the President's working group \naffirmed that we were doing it right. By that standard, this amendment \nhas been subjected to intense scrutiny and infinitely more debate than \nthe comprehensive regulatory legislation adopted in 2000.\n  Before the recess, at the end of the last floor debate, my colleague \nfrom Idaho asked--I think facetiously--why we did not simply try to \nprovide antifraud and antimanipulation authority for all transactions, \nnot just energy and metals. Let me point out that our bill affects \nabout 2 percent of the derivative market that deals with energy and \nmetals. We actually don't know if it is 1 percent or 3 percent because \nas a result of the Enron exemption, there is not enough transparency to \nknow.\n  Our amendment does not affect financial instruments at all. We have \ncleared that up. Financial derivatives already have a statutory \nexclusion under the Commodities Exchange Act. Our amendment only deals \nwith derivative transactions that involve energy or metal, the two \ncommodities exempted by the 2000 CFMA.\n  This lack of transparency had important ramifications for the energy \ncrisis experienced in California and the West, which ended only about \n10 months ago. This is what got me interested in this matter. As a \nresult, we still don't know why gas prices at the California border \nremained significantly higher than neighboring States for more than 5 \nmonths. Why don't we know? There is no transparency; there is no audit \ntrail; there are no records. It is impossible to prove what kind of \ntrading back and forth was done, frankly, to increase the price of gas.\n\n  Some have asserted that the CFTC already has antifraud authority for \nover-the-counter trades. If this authority is already there, then our \namendment reaffirms that the authority is there. But this is not as \neasy to determine as one might think.\n  Let me read two short paragraphs that show you what I mean. This is \nfrom the International Swaps and Derivatives Association:\n\n       Transactions involving exempt commodities, including \n     commodities such as energy products, chemicals, and metals, \n     are similarly excluded from the Commodity Exchange Act and \n     remain subject to the CFTC's antifraud and antimanipulation \n     authority.\n\n  Then they put out another publication, which is the March 11 \nopposition letter to our amendment, and they say exactly the opposite. \nThey say:\n\n       The amendment extends the application of the CFTC's \n     antifraud and antimanipulation provisions to transactions in \n     exempt commodities. The amendment would revise the Commodity \n     Exchange Act, section 2(g), to provide that otherwise exempt \n     transactions in exempt commodities would be subject to \n     antifraud and antimanipulation provisions of the Commodity \n     Exchange Act.\n\n  So maybe the authority is there and maybe it is not. If our amendment \npasses, we know for sure that it is. We take the vagary out of it, we \ntake the game playing out of it, and the same party cannot say \ndifferent things at different times. That is really why this amendment \nis necessary.\n  So that means if someone is cornering the market in energy or \nmetals--or maybe in natural gas, as many suspect Enron did--the CFTC \nwill have the necessary tools to investigate. And 99 times out of 100, \nthe CFTC will find that there is nothing improper. But isn't it good to \nknow that regulators can provide assurance that markets are functioning \nproperly? Isn't that what gives people confidence to invest, that they \nknow there is regulation and that these markets are performing \nefficiently and with transparency?\n\n[[Page S2393]]\n\n  I want to make one final point about Enron. As I said before, Enron \nOnline operated completely outside of the CFTC's antifraud and \nantimanipulation authority because it was operating an online trading \nforum to conduct trades bilaterally, one to one, where it was both a \nbuyer and a seller. In other words, Enron was buying energy and selling \nenergy, and only Enron knew the price. Enron could have been buying at \none price and selling at a much higher price. Because there was no \ntransparency and no oversight authority, we may never know.\n  Other companies now have stepped up to fill Enron's market void. Some \nof these energy trading platforms are operating the same way Enron \nOnline did.\n  Do any of my colleagues truly believe that we should be limiting \ntransparency and regulatory authority in light of all we have just \nlearned about the energy markets and Enron? I think not. So this \namendment is really on the side of the angels. It gives certainty, it \nprovides for antifraud, antimanipulation oversight; it says the CFTC \nmust set some capitalization standards based on risk, and it provides \nthat all trades are transparent, records are kept, and audit trails are \navailable.\n  I know why the banks oppose this. Because they want to do the same \nthing Enron has done. The banks have set up their own online trading \nplatform which, again, would trade in darkness, which, again, for \nnondelivered derivatives would have no transparency, have no record, \nhave no capital requirements, and no antifraud and antimanipulation \noversight. I believe there are more Enrons coming down. I believe there \nare going to be more just on this very point.\n  What I am saying to the Senate is the Senate has to protect the \npeople. The Senate has to provide for regulation. Why should there be \nregulation of the Nasdaq? Why should there be regulation on the Chicago \nMercantile and no regulation online? It is a huge loophole, and we \nought to plug it.\n  Mr. President, I move to table----\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator withhold?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the Senator withholding. I ask that the \nSenator listen to the unanimous consent request I am going to propound \nand see if she will agree with it. I think it will be in keeping with \nwhat she wants.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time until 3:45 p.m. \ntoday be for debate prior to vote in relation to the Reid second-degree \namendment No. 3081, with the time equally divided and controlled \nbetween Senators Reid and Feinstein, or their designees; that no other \namendment be in order prior to a vote in relation to the Reid \namendment.\n  The Senator could move to table now as she indicated she would, and \nthe vote will occur at 3:45 p.m.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I have no problem. I agree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I move to table the Reid amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to table is not in order until the \nexpiration of the controlled time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom California be allowed to offer her motion to table at this time. \nThat way she will not have to stay around if she does not want to. The \nvote will occur on the motion to table at 3:45 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Feinstein's \nmotion to table the Reid amendment. Let me say at the outset, when she \ncame to me with this concept, it struck me as not only fair but good \npolicy. How did we get into this mess with the seventh largest \ncorporation in the United States going bankrupt and dragging down with \nit thousands of innocent investors, pensioners at Enron, not to mention \nthe employees who lost jobs, or the employees that other companies, \nlike Andersen which is based in Chicago, who stand to lose their jobs.\n  It all came about because the folks in Houston who worked for Enron \nCorporation tried to take as many business activities as possible off \nthe books. They did not want the world to see what was going on behind \nthe corporate boardroom doors at Enron. The greatest fear they had was \ndaylight, the possibility that people would know what they were doing. \nSo they created these elaborate pyramid schemes. They created a \nmultitude of corporations. They hid debt. They managed to, in many \nways, deceive some well-meaning people into believing they were a \nprosperous and profitable corporation. One of the instruments and \nweapons they used in this battle was this whole notion of trading in \nenergy futures, energy derivatives without Government oversight.\n  I live in the State of Illinois. We are proud of the fact we have \nmany markets in the State of Illinois which average people and \nbusinesses use to trade futures, derivatives, and options that give \nthem protection in their business day world. But every step of the way \nin that process the Government keeps an eye on them, just as it does \nthe stock exchange in New York and in other places around the United \nStates. Why? So the average person who picks up that financial page in \nthe paper every morning and looks at it knows it is on the square, the \ntrade actually took place, the prices are actually moving in these \ncommodities.\n  What we saw with Enron is that they raced away from those markets \nwhere the Government was looking over the shoulders of the traders into \nthis netherworld, if you will, of trading without regulation and \nwithout oversight. That is exactly where they wanted to play. They \nwanted to get out from the public eye. They did not want people to see \nwhat they were doing. They wanted to manage their own affairs without \nscrutiny, without oversight, without the restrictions of regulations \nand laws.\n  The Senator from California has a very simple proposition: If we want \nto restore the integrity of many corporate activities, we should \nestablish standards for oversight and regulation. We now know better \nwhen it comes to Enron. Had there been appropriate oversight and \nregulation at Enron, we might have avoided the disaster that occurred \nin that company.\n  As she offers this amendment, there are special interest groups that \noppose her. There are those trading without Government oversight who do \nnot want the Government involved. So they are going to oppose her. The \nsmoothies out there, the future Enrons, that want to use the current \nsystem to avoid regulation are opposed to the amendment of the Senator \nfrom California as well. They want to have this mechanism available to \nthem.\n  That, frankly, is the reason why the Senate should take this \namendment very seriously and why we should join the Senator from \nCalifornia in tabling the amendment of the Senator from Nevada. There \nis no reason why we should exempt metals. Why in the world would we say \nwhen it comes to energy we want honest, open, transparent trading, but \nwhen it comes to metals and their derivatives, we do not? We heard the \nlitany that was read by the Senator from California when companies came \nin and tried to take control of markets. For the average person going \nto work every day, you wonder: What difference does it make? It does \nmake a difference. It makes a difference in the commodities they \npurchase. If there is some illegal activity, if there is some inflation \nof price, it is going to be felt by consumers and businesses across \nAmerica and around the world.\n\n  When Senator Feinstein comes to us and says, Table the amendment of \nthe Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, I think she is moving in the right \ndirection. We need more transparency and more oversight.\n  If you buy the premise of Senator Reid that metals should be exempt \nor you buy the premise of those who oppose Senator Feinstein's \namendment, which I am cosponsoring, who say we should not have this \nGovernment oversight, how do you rationalize the millions of dollars we \nspend every year as taxpayers for watchdogs and policemen to keep an \neye on so many other industries where there is trading? Listen, one is \nright and one is wrong.\n  If we believe there should not be Government oversight, let the Wild \nWest prevail--there may be some who take that point of view. I am not \none of them. It is tough for me as an individual; it is tough for many \nsmall businesses to judge whether there is an\n\n[[Page S2394]]\n\nhonest transaction taking place and that is why the Government steps \nin. They want to make sure that when there is a transaction reported, \nit actually took place, that there was not self-dealing, there was not \nthe kind of chicanery as we saw in Houston with Enron. That is why we \nhave these regulatory agencies.\n  The Senator from California is correct; we should apply that to \nenergy and metal derivatives. There is no reason to make exceptions. I \ncan tell you what is going on--and I know the Senator is aware of this. \nWhat she is fighting is growing in size and volume across the world. \nThese unregulated online markets are starting to appear everywhere, and \nwoe be to the consumer or those involved who go into them believing the \nGovernment is watching what is going on. In many instances, there is no \noversight; there is no review; there is no accountability.\n  I stand not only as a cosponsor of the amendment of the Senator from \nCalifornia but in strong support of the Senator from California.\n  I close by saying I sincerely hope we adopt this amendment. This \nstarted off as a debate on an energy bill. It certainly is a timely \ndebate, but as I have listened to this debate transpire, as I have \nwatched special interest groups come in and destroy every meaningful \nand credible part of this bill, I am beginning to believe this is the \nmost anemic energy bill ever considered by Congress.\n  Consider for a minute that we are about to embark on a debate as to \nwhether or not to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. \nThis wildlife refuge was not created by any liberal President; it was \ncreated by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1960. He said: There is a \npiece of Alaska we ought to protect. It is a frontier we ought to \npreserve because we may never get that chance again, and when it comes \nto the wildlife, when it comes to the resources there, we ought to make \ncertain that America takes a stand and says we are going to leave this \nfor future generations in perpetuity. This is our legacy to our \nchildren.\n  President Eisenhower was right. What President Eisenhower did not \nanticipate was that the oil companies would come into this region, \ndiscover what they consider to be substantial reserves, put their money \ninterests behind those reserves, and then come to Congress and start \ntwisting arms in every direction in order to try to beg us to allow \nthem to come and drill for oil in a wildlife refuge.\n  How much oil is involved? First, even the rosiest scenario suggests \nwe will not see the first barrel of oil from ANWR for 5 years. The one \nmore realistic scenario says 10 years. As we consider all the problems \nin the Middle East facing us today, ANWR is certainly not the answer. \nNot for 5 years at least, or 10, will we see the first barrel of oil \ncoming out of this wildlife refuge.\n  How much oil is involved? They talk in terms of millions and \nbillions. But put it in this perspective: Over a 10-year period of \ntime, if we draw from ANWR, the oil that the U.S. Geological Survey \nsays is there will account for a 6-month supply of oil for the United \nStates in that 10-year period. Put it in this perspective as well: By \nthe year 2020, if ANWR were in full production, ANWR would reduce our \nimportation of foreign oil from 62 percent of our national need to 60 \npercent, a 2-percent reduction.\n  Some have said it takes a great deal of political courage to stand up \nfor drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge on behalf of the \noil companies that own those rights for minerals to be derived. I am \nnot sure it takes a great deal of courage. Does it take a great deal of \ncourage for us to spoil the frontier of a wildlife refuge, to endanger \nspecies that currently live there and may never be replicated? That \ndoes not take a great deal of courage.\n  The courage is in standing up and protecting them. The courage is in \nsaying if you want to do something about energy security and \nindependence, if you want to try to break the chains between the \nMideast and the United States so we can make our own decisions and not \nhave to wait for a nod of approval from Saudi Arabia and the gulf \nstates, the courage is in saying to the American people we have to \nchange the way we do business and live in America.\n  We had a chance to do that several weeks ago. What we were going to \ndo--here is a radical suggestion--we were going to say to the big three \nautomakers, they have to make their cars and trucks more fuel \nefficient. Oh, no, the Senate said, by almost a margin of two-to-one, \nwe could not do anything that radical. We could not do anything that \ndemands that kind of sacrifice, no way.\n  We are going to show courage by drilling in a wildlife refuge. The \nPorcupine caribou do not vote in the Senate. They do not elect anybody. \nRun them off. We have lost 30 percent of them in the last 10 years, so \nif they disappear, we will show our kids pictures and videos. But to \nask the Big Three to come up with more fuel-efficient cars and trucks, \noh, no, no way.\n\n  The special interests swamped those of us who believe fuel efficiency \nshould be part of our debate on our energy security. We did not have a \nchance in the Senate. The special interests won, and won big. We did \nnot have the courage to say to the Big Three or to consumers across \nAmerica, we have to do business differently. We have not improved the \nfuel efficiency of vehicles in America since 1985--17 years of neglect.\n  So they talk about the Middle East and the challenge we face and how \nwe have to show courage and determination as Americans. Let us start it \nby showing some honesty in our energy policy. We need more fuel \nefficiency, and we need more renewable fuels. For goodness' sake, I \nthink 3 or 4 percent of all the electricity generated in America comes \nfrom renewable fuels. When Senator Jeffords of Vermont wanted to raise \nthis to 20 percent over a 20-year period of time, I was ready to \nsupport him and was a cosponsor, but he did not have a chance. We lost.\n  But we will show courage by drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge and we will show courage in standing behind the special interest \ngroups that want to stop Senator Feinstein from bringing transparency \nand regulation to the trading in energy derivatives.\n  I am afraid this energy bill is going in the wrong direction if we do \nnot include in it fuel efficiency, fuel economy, conservation, \nrenewable fuels, and a sensible pricing of energy. Look at what \nhappened in the State of California. I cannot imagine what life is like \nfor the Senator, going home every weekend to see families and \nbusinesses trying to cope with something totally beyond their control. \nThey responded heroically showing that they could, if challenged, \ndramatically conserve energy in the State of California. The Senator \nmust have felt like the most helpless victim in America because these \nenergy companies were running circles around her.\n  When the Senator says they ought to be held accountable, these energy \ncompanies and energy derivative markets ought to have government \nregulation, they are the first ones to scream bloody murder. They \ncannot stand that notion. The Senator is right. She ought to proceed on \nthat, and I am happy to support her in that effort.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I mentioned in my remarks what really kind of clued \nme on to this was the price of natural gas. Right after CFMA passed, we \nnoticed the price of gas at the southern California border was $50 a \ndecatherm--a decatherm is about enough for 900 homes--whereas in San \nJuan, NM, it was $8, and the transportation cost was $1. Nobody knew \nwhy it had spiked that way.\n  So I picked up the phone. I called what is called ISO, the \nindependent system operator, and said: Why is gas spiking this way? \nThey did not know.\n  Now I do not know whether Enron was doing this or not, but as soon as \nEnron went belly up, the next day the price of gas dropped \ndramatically. So it has to have been the trading that was being done \nthat did not have a delivery directly related to it.\n  Now people say the SEC will step in and look at this. The fact is \nthere are no records for the SEC to look at now because there is no \naudit trail. There are no records kept of these trades. Somehow it is \nvery difficult to get that across to our Members. It would get across \nif they were trading on the Chicago Mercantile.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is right, it would be transparent.\n\n[[Page S2395]]\n\n  I am holding in my hand the energy bill we are debating. On at least \nfour separate occasions now, we have had the chance to do something \nsensible for energy security and energy independence--to lessen our \ndependence on Mideastern oil. We had a chance to do it with the fuel \nefficiency of the trucks and cars that we want to drive in America for \nyears to come, and we failed. The special interests won. We could have \ndone it by improving and increasing the renewable fuels used across \nAmerica that are environmentally friendly, which give us a chance \ntoward independence. The special interests opposed us. We lost.\n  Now we see the battle that is being joined: Whether or not we are \ngoing to have full disclosure of these energy trades, whether we are \ngoing to have the kind of openness that Americans want. And the special \ninterests oppose it.\n  I stand in complete support of the efforts of the Senator from \nCalifornia, and I thank her for her leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend from Illinois and my friend from \nCalifornia are right in most everything they have said about the need \nfor a good energy policy. I agree with the Senator from Illinois. I \nthink it is too bad we did not pass fuel efficiency standards. The \nPresiding Officer, I hope, is going to try to rectify that and offer \nsomething in the near future to set some fuel efficiency standards.\n  The Senator from Illinois is right when he speaks about the need to \nnot drill in ANWR, but my friend from Illinois and my friend from \nCalifornia are wrong about transactions involving metal derivatives \nbecause they lack necessary information. The Commodity Exchange Act \nalready requires record keeping for transactions in metal derivatives \nmarkets.\n  The Feinstein amendment includes metal derivatives, citing fraud in \nthe metals market in the past decade. In fact, my friend from \nCalifornia uses two specific examples of high-profile cases. She talked \nabout the Hunt brothers in silver and Sumitomo in copper. Neither of \nthese fraud cases would be addressed with the Feinstein amendment. It \nhas nothing to do with the Feinstein amendment. The Feinstein amendment \ncould already be in effect, and the Hunt problem would still be there, \nand that related to copper would still be there. Why do I say that?\n  The attempt by the Hunt brothers in 1979 to corner the silver market \ninvolved manipulation of the physical silver market. They bought all \nthe silver they could, which reminds me of a Nevada resident by the \nname of Forest Mars, of the Mars empire. He owned it. He was a great \nman. He died in the last couple of years. He was a wonderful man. He \nlived above his candy store in Las Vegas. This billionaire had a little \napartment above his candy store.\n  When the Hunt brothers tried to corner the silver market, he said \nthey should have talked to him first. You cannot have a monopoly. He \ntried on two separate occasions. You cannot do it. Keep in mind, Mars \nwas one of the richest men in the world. His family is still rich, with \nUncle Ben's Rice and most of the candy in the world. He was very rich. \nHe thought in his younger days they would buy all the pepper. He wanted \nto control pepper. He spent some time going out and buying all the \nblack pepper he could find. He controlled black pepper in the world. \nBut he said: In the end, I could not control the black pepper market, \nbecause people who had white pepper dyed their pepper black, and I no \nlonger had control of the market.\n  The Hunt brothers tried to corner the silver market and went out and \nbought all the silver. Her amendment would have nothing to do with \nthat. The Hunt silver trading scandal involved trading on regulated \nexchanges, not in the over-the-counter derivatives market. The trading \nabuses involved the physical accumulation of more than 200 million \nounces of silver. It did not involve over-the-counter derivatives in \nany way.\n  The Sumitomo situation involved the manipulation of the copper market \nby a Japanese company operating through a rogue trader acting in London \nand Tokyo.\n  The abuses occurred on a fully regulated exchange, not in the over-\nthe-counter derivatives market. It involved manipulation of the price \nof copper on the London Metal Exchange, which is fully regulated by the \nUnited Kingdom's Financial Services Authority. Further, the \nmanipulation took place overseas, not in the U.S. markets.\n  I urge my colleagues to not support the motion to table that strikes \nmetal derivatives from the Feinstein amendment. Derivatives are \nessential to the health of the metals market, and today they are \nregulated, controlled. Recordkeeping is now in place. Fraud in the \nmetals market did not involve over-the-counter derivatives.\n  With all due respect to my friend from California, using the Hunt \nbrothers example and the Sumitomo example, they simply do not apply. I \nbelieve wherever that information came from, it was misguided and \nsimply wrong. I suggest we would be better off going forward with her \nlegislation, which I have indicated on a number of occasions I support. \nBut I am saying that having the metals industry involved in this does \nnot do anything except make the mining industry in America weaker than \nit is.\n  Mining as an industry exports gold. It is one of the few places we \nhave a favorable balance of trade. We should be happy about that.\n  The motion to table is ill advised, based on wrong facts. It is not \nin keeping with what I think is the direction of the underlying \nFeinstein amendment. I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion of the \nSenate to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I take a moment to respond to the \nstatement of the Senator from Nevada.\n  The point I was trying to make, to the Senator from Nevada, is that \nmanipulation does occur in metals. Clearly, it did. Obviously, there \nwas no online trading at that time. Everybody knows that. The fact is, \nthese remain three major cases of market manipulation. It doesn't only \nhappen in energy; it can happen in metals as well.\n  The key point is, if the Reid amendment is successful, metals will be \nthe only exemption. Why should metals be the only exemption? I don't \nthink they should. We know you are covered if you deliver the commodity \ndirectly to another individual. We know FERC covers that. We know you \nare not covered if you are swapping or trading against risk. We also \nknow there is great uncertainty as to whether, with energy, there is \ncoverage.\n  I purposely read the letters from the Swaps and Derivatives \nAssociation because they say two different things. In one statement \nthey say these areas do remain within the CFTC jurisdiction; they turn \naround in a March 11 opposition letter and say exactly the opposite.\n  The time has come to have certainty, to see that energy and metals \nare covered. Let me say once again, who can object to there being \nantifraud and antimanipulation oversight? No one. Who can object to \nsaying you have to keep records of trades, online trades, even if you \nare not directly delivering the product, if you are swapping to hedge \nagainst risk, for example? Why shouldn't you keep a record and have an \naudit trail on what you are doing so that people know? Why shouldn't \nthere be some provision for capitalization of these trades based on \nrisk, and the CFTC would decide a level of risk and the level of \ncapitalization?\n  This past week, I was just reading another article of a company that \nwould go down because it was swapping. There was no capitalization, \nPeter came home to pay Paul, and there was nothing there. So the \ncompany is going to go bankrupt. It was another major company.\n  It seems to me, rather than create uncertainty, our amendment creates \ncertainty. It says to the world, to everybody, energy and metals are \nnot the only two that enjoy an exemption. Energy and metals, for \nderivative online trading, are covered by the CFTC. It is a small \namendment. I have been so surprised at the amount of opposition. It \nconvinces me more that something must be going on. There has to be a \nreason that people want to do this trading in the darkness. There has \nto be a reason that they do not want to keep records. There has to be a \nreason they do not want to subject themselves to any kind of \ncapitalization requirement.\n\n[[Page S2396]]\n\n  That was the situation with Enron. Enron went bankrupt. Enron lobbied \nfor this amendment. Enron lobbied the House to be excluded, to have \nmetals and energy excluded from the bill passed in 2000. Immediately \nafter the bill passed in 2000, gas began to spike in California. That \nsays volumes to me.\n  Once again, I think we are on the side of the angels, to let \nconsumers see what is going on. If the consumers buy through the \nChicago Mercantile, there is a record. If the consumers buy through the \nNew York Mercantile, there is a record. With any other kind of \ntransaction, there is a record. Why should this huge, burgeoning new \narea of online trading have an exception and not keep these records?\n  Again, let me be specific. If the product is delivered, if I buy gas \nfrom you, and you deliver that natural gas to me, we are covered by the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission. If we are trading or swapping and \nthere is no delivery, there is no record kept.\n  Why does FERC support this amendment? Why do all of the FERC \nCommissioners support this amendment, including the Chairman? They know \nthis is a loophole. They know it should see the light of day.\n  I control time until 3:45, if I understood correctly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is equally divided.\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada controls 14\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is welcome to take some of my time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has yielded?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding the Senator from \nLouisiana wishes to speak on another amendment she hopes to offer \nsubsequently. I think that would be appropriate. I see no one here \nwishing to speak. How much time does the Senator need?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I need about 15 minutes, if I could?\n  Mr. REID. We are going to vote at quarter till, but how about 10 \nminutes?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Ten minutes is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from Nevada, and I thank the \nSenator from California for allowing me to interject a few thoughts on \na related subject but not the same as the pending amendment.\n  The subject is about energy independence. Let me put up my first \nchart to talk about this issue.\n  Before I begin with that, let me say this: There are a lot of issues \nsuch as the issue Senator Feinstein has raised, and other issues, that \nI suggest are maybe not the exact heart of our problem when it comes to \nenergy security or energy dependence. The heart of our problem is \nsimply that we consume much more than we produce. When you consume more \nthan you produce, and when you do not have an electric grid in this \nsystem that can move power from the places where it is produced to the \nplaces, such as California and Florida, that consume a lot--and also \nCalifornia does produce a great deal--you have blackouts.\n  You have power shortages. You have price hikes. It is the natural end \nresult of demand outstripping supply. It works that way every time. \nThere is no surprise about it. It works that way today. It worked that \nway yesterday. It will work that way tomorrow.\n  The core of this debate is energy security. We cannot have energy \nsecurity in this Nation unless we have energy independence. I know \npeople hear this and they say: Senator, it is not possible. We could \nnever be energy independent.\n  I want to say: Yes, we can. Maybe not tomorrow. Maybe not in 5 years. \nBut if we set our mind to it and make some very wise strategic \ndecisions in this body this week and in this Congress this year, this \ncountry most certainly could be energy independent in the next decade \nor so. Not in my grandchild's lifetime but in my children's lifetime, \nand in my lifetime, we could be energy independent. But it is going to \ntake a lot of work.\n  One of the things we are going to have to do is produce more oil and \ngas and fuel domestically. It is not just oil and gas. It is oil, gas, \nclean coal, hydro--and particularly new and exciting fuels such as \nsolar and wind. We are not doing nearly enough with that. And we are \nnot doing enough on the production side.\n  When we think oil, we think automobiles. We think oil, we think \ngasoline. While oil in the transportation sector consumes most of our \noil, let me name a few other things that we need oil for to produce \nhousehold items: toothpaste, footballs, ink, lifejackets, tents, \nsunglasses, house paints, shampoos, lipsticks--maybe we could find \nalternative sources, some other ways to produce these items. I am sure \nthere are scientists and researchers doing that at this time, but we \nneed oil in this Nation to run our automobiles the way we have the \nengines structured right now, as well as to produce all these products \nwhich Americans use every single day.\n\n  Can we reduce our consumption? Can we conserve? Absolutely. But \nshould we continue to import 67 percent of our oil from other places in \nthis world? I don't think so.\n  Let me share with you where we are, the outstripping of production by \ndemand. Oil consumption will continue to exceed production. This red \narea of this chart is our problem. It is our problem. You can see it \nvery clearly. It is the shortfall. This is basically what we produce. \nThis is what we consume. And this is what causes, in many instances, \nblackouts or shortages or high prices--this shortfall. We have to \ncorrect that. We can correct it by conserving. There are very good \nsuggestions, mostly by Senator Bingaman, about how to do that. And we \nmust increase our production.\n  Let me show you where our production is, currently, in the United \nStates. Our production is currently in the Gulf of Mexico and in Texas \nand in Alaska. Should we drill in Alaska, and more? Absolutely. Should \nwe drill in the Gulf of Mexico? Absolutely. Should we drill in Texas \nmore? Absolutely. Should we drill more in California and places in \nother States? Absolutely.\n  The reason is these States consume. They need to produce. Our whole \nNation consumes and we need to produce more. But we want, in America, \nto have a policy where we basically do not have oil wells anywhere \nexcept off the coast of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. We expect \nthis area then to supply all the needs of our Nation.\n  We need to have a stronger policy about drilling domestically, and to \nacknowledge the States that do drill and can drill in a more \nenvironmentally sensitive way, minimizing the risk to the environment, \nshould be compensated for the impacts that are associated. It is not \nalways negative environmental impacts; it is infrastructure impacts.\n  On each oil rig off the State of Louisiana, we have about 6,000 \npeople. It is almost like a city out in the gulf.\n  I know a lot of people have never been to an oil rig, but I have, \nmany times. Senator Breaux and others have visited many times. These \nmen and women consume water, they consume food, there are \ntransportation requirements, and there are roads and bridges that need \nto help this offshore development.\n  One of the things we can do--and I hope we will do, Democrats and \nRepublicans, regardless of how we may vote on many of these \namendments--is to cast favorable votes when it comes to more domestic \ndrilling. It is important for us to close the gap of conservation and \ndrilling in places where we can. We have rich reserves in Alaska, in \nthe Gulf, and in the central part of this Nation. It is misleading to \nsay otherwise.\n  Let me also give you another reason why domestic production is so \nimportant. This is from the Sierra Club's executive director, Doug \nWheeler, who said:\n\n       The exploration and development of energy resources in the \n     United States is governed by the world's most stringent \n     environmental constraints, and to force development elsewhere \n     is to accept the inevitability of less rigorous oversight.\n\n  Let me repeat this, because this is the Sierra Club.\n\n       The exploration and development of energy resources in the \n     United States is governed by the world's most stringent \n     environmental constraints, and to force development elsewhere \n     is to accept the inevitability of less rigorous oversight.\n\n  What we do by not allowing more drilling in the United States is \nexactly this: We force development elsewhere,\n\n[[Page S2397]]\n\nand we wreak environmental havoc. Why? Because in many parts of the \nworld there are no democracies, and there are big oil importers, which \nis very problematic. In other countries, they do not have rigorous \nrules. There is no transparent rule of law. There are no court systems. \nThere are no investigators to find the polluters. There are no systems \nof fines. They have no consequences for pollution. It happens day after \nday. In our country, if a company violates a local or Federal rule, \nthey are prosecuted. They are fined. They can be put out of business \nfor destroying the environment. Do you think that happens in some \nplaces in Africa, South America, or the Mideast? I don't think so.\n  Let me make a statement. People will say Senator Landrieu just gets \non the floor and talks about big oil issues. She is a supporter of big \noil.\n  Let me say for the record that big oil is maybe not that interested, \nfrankly, primarily in more domestic production. Leaders of some of the \nenvironmental organizations want to push production off of our shores \nbecause they do not want production anywhere. They are absolutely \ntotally against fossil fuels and think we can run the country and the \nworld can run on something other than fossil fuels. I hope that happens \nin the future, but it is not going to happen today or tomorrow. It is \nin their interest to push production off the shores of the United \nStates and use their self-interest to basically push development in \nplaces where regulations are less; where, if you do something wrong, \nyou can't get caught, and where it is cheaper to produce.\n  There is sort of an unholy alliance, if you will--I say this with \ngreat respect--between the industry and the environmental movement. I \nunderstand this is an unholy alliance that sometimes pushes us to a \nplace we don't want to go. I will tell you why we don't want to go \nthere. Because it is dangerous.\n  If the headlines in the newspapers don't convince people that we are \non a collision course, I don't know what is. In the paper this morning, \nwe read about the escalation of war in the Mideast. We see our foreign \npolicy compromised. Why? Because we can't really fight terrorism in a \nway that we know we should. We know that we could be effective. We have \nbeaten every foe that has stood before us. We can certainly beat the \nfoe of terrorism.\n  It would be hard. It would be expensive. But the American people are \nwilling to give their time and their treasure to do it. But we can't \nbecause we are compromised by the fact that the countries we are trying \nto negotiate with are large exporters of oil.\n  We sent Colin Powell, our Secretary of State, over to the Mideast \nwith one hand tied behind his back. He cannot negotiate as strongly as \nhe might because of our dependency on oil from other places in the \nworld.\n  I know my time has expired. I am going to stay on the floor after the \nvote and ask for some additional time.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding. If the clerk is ready to call the \nroll, I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). The question is on agreeing to \nthe motion.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I thought I would \ntake this time, as we are still debating and proceeding with \nconsideration of amendments to the energy bill, to finish the comments \nI started before the vote.\n  I hope Members on both sides can understand the importance of this \ndebate. It always has been important. But I think there has to be some \nrenewed urgency given what has happened over the last 2 weeks--the \nunfortunate escalation of violence in the Mideast, the pressure that \nhas now come to bear on our Nation in terms of the diplomacy underway \nto try to find a peaceful and certain way out of the situation in the \nMideast. All of this has a direct bearing on the discussion we are \nhaving in the Senate about energy and the underlying policy and our \ndependency on this oil that comes in large measure--not solely--from \nMiddle Eastern countries or from foreign sources. It has a direct \nimpact, I believe, on whether we are ultimately going to be successful \nin the short and long run in our negotiations for peace and in \ncombating terrorism.\n  I wish to finish my remarks along those lines and to start with a \nchart. I know people in Louisiana understand this.\n  I am hoping to share this chart with the other Members in the Senate. \nAs Americans everywhere went to the gas stations over this weekend and \nthe last few weeks, they really began to feel this. They not only \nunderstand it but they actually feel it, and it is hurting right in \ntheir pocketbooks.\n  This chart shows us clearly what happens when the price of oil, which \nis demonstrated by this blue line, goes up and what happens to our \ngross domestic product, which is represented by the red line, when that \nprice goes up. It is very easy to read this chart. It reminds me of one \nof the charts my colleague, Senator Conrad, brings to explain \ncomplicated budget issues, and it really helps to clarify it. This \nclarifies the situation to me, and I hope to people who are seeing this \nchart.\n  When oil prices are low, then the U.S. gross domestic product is \nhigh. When the price of oil begins to rise, as it has precipitously in \nthe last 2 weeks, the growth of the U.S. economy dives. When the \neconomy takes a dive like this, what this means is there are more \npeople who are out of work.\n  When this red line goes down, it means children do not go to college. \nThis red line means somebody has to walk into their house and look in \ntheir kids' eyes and tell them they lost their job. This means a guy \nwho worked his whole life--when he was 45 years old and started a \nbusiness and took his life's savings and his wife's savings and said: \nHoney, I am going to go out and start a business--has to come back and \ntell her he could not make it. Not because they did not have a good \nproduct, not because he was not a hard worker, not because his spouse \ndid not do everything she should and could do, but because we cannot \nget a handle on the price of gasoline and it drove him out of business. \nThat is what this line means when the gross domestic product in our \ncountry goes down. It means pain. It means suffering.\n\n[[Page S2398]]\n\n  We could stop the pain and stop the suffering if we could get an \nenergy policy that would stabilize this price and reduce our dependency \non oil that comes from outside of this Nation.\n  One way to do it, not the only way to do it, is to drill more in the \nUnited States of America. We have oil reserves in many of our States, \nif not most of our States. We have reserves onshore and offshore, and \nwe have technologies unlike 50 years ago, 40 years ago, or 25 years \nago, that we can produce and find those reserves at less financial risk \nand less environmental risk.\n  I am in the Senate because I promised the people of my State I would \ntry to keep this red line up as high as possible, because I have a \npromise to send as many kids to college as I can possibly help get \nthere and give them the skills they need to function. I have made a lot \nof promises to them about giving them an atmosphere where they can take \ntheir dream of starting a business and actually make it work. I have \nmade promises to my school boards and my public officials back home to \ntry to help improve the highway system, which is not very good in our \nState. I have hospitals that cannot keep their doors open, and there is \na Senate that has the resources and the opportunity to pass an energy \nbill that could produce more but for some reason will not.\n  Let me show what the Sierra Club says about domestic production \nbecause I have sometimes been accused of having an anti-environmental \nposition. I actually think this position is a pro-environmental \nposition, it is the right environmental position, and I will say why. \nThe director of the Sierra Club evidently agrees with that line of \nthinking, although I do not want to indicate he agrees with the \nexploration in ANWR or my amendment, but he agrees with the principle. \nHe says exactly what I would say:\n\n       The exploration and development of energy resources in the \n     United States is governed by the world's most stringent \n     environmental constraints, and to force development elsewhere \n     is to accept the inevitability of less rigorous oversight.\n\n  I could even go further to say: To develop elsewhere is to accept the \ninevitability of wholesale environmental destruction, because that is \nwhat happens when you do not have good laws. That is what happens when \nyou do not have good regulations. That is what happens when you do not \nhave good court systems where polluters are determined not to follow \nthe rules if they had them, or to go ahead even without the rules and \nproceed to extract those resources. That is what happens when you drive \nproduction off the shores of the United States of America. The \nenvironment is harmed more than if you could drill in a country that \nhad the strongest rules, the best courts, the highest fines, and the \nability to vigorously prosecute polluters.\n  We do not want to do that. We want to get oil from countries--and we \nuse 18 million barrels of oil every day from places such as Saudi \nArabia, Iraq; and from such stable governments in a lot of trouble now \nsuch as Colombia, Angola, Kuwait, and Yemen, just to name a few.\n  If we drilled more in Alaska, in Louisiana, off the coast, on the \ngulf coast, in other interior States, and we did it in the right ways, \nwe could make the lines in that chart I showed earlier move in a \ndifferent direction, in a direction of hope for the American people.\n  Let me also say we need to do it for the purposes of our economy. We \nalso need to drill more in the United States for the purposes of our \nsecurity and for the purposes of long-term domestic and international \nsecurity for our Nation.\n  We call the underlying bill we are debating, and on which Senator \nBingaman and Senator Murkowski have worked exceedingly hard, the Energy \nPolicy Act. It could be the energy security act, but I would really \nlike it to be named the energy independence act because only by energy \nindependence will America ever be secure.\n  Let me say that again: Only with energy independence will we ever \nreally be secure. If we and our democratic allies--not countries that \ndo not believe in democratic principles, not countries that do not \nallow women to vote, not countries that do not have high standards when \nit comes to child protection and the rights of children and families. I \nam talking about democratically elected governments. When we and our \nallies, such as in Europe and in other places of the world, can \ndiversify our portfolio of energy, then we can relieve ourselves of \nbeing dependent on countries that do not share our values, that are not \ndemocratic nations, and that do not compromise.\n  When I see statements that are in the press--and I have been reading \na lot of things about the Mideast--it is very concerning to me when I \nhear anyone say the people who have strapped dynamite and other \nexplosives to themselves, who have gone into places such as hotels \nwhere people are eating a meal or into daycare centers, or in pubs \nwhere mothers might take their daughters or sons out for an afternoon \ncup of tea or a rest, and people refer to these individuals as freedom \nfighters. These are not freedom fighters. These are terrorists. That is \nwhat terrorism is. That is what the definition and embodiment of \nterrorism is.\n\n  It is not fighting army to army or armed person to armed person. It \nis an individual, desperate, strapping explosives to their body, giving \nup their life and harming innocent men and women and children for the \npurposes of terrorizing a nation and either bringing it to its knees, \nor bringing it to a negotiating table, or forcing it to do something \nthat is against its will or its long-term best interests.\n  We are fighting terrorism here with all the strength and breath we \ncan in our Nation. We had two of our mightiest buildings collapse. We \ndon't call the people who got in the airplanes freedom fighters. We \ncall them terrorists. But we can't call some of these other people \nexactly what we need to be calling them. Why? Because we are too \ndependent on oil from that region. We are debating an energy bill and \nwe will not make the decision to produce more oil in the United States \nbecause we would rather compromise our foreign policy.\n  I will be for more drilling in the United States, when and wherever \npossible. And I don't believe we can drill everywhere. But where there \nare reserves, where our technology shows we can drill, the more oil we \ncan drill here the better.\n  In addition, what we can do, and Senator Bingaman has led this fight \nso ably and so well, is to diversify our portfolio so we are not held \nhostage by oil, period. I am from an oil-producing State. But do you \nknow what my own producers tell me? They don't want our Nation to be \nheld hostage by fossil fuels, even though we produce a lot of oil and \nproduce a lot of gas. Louisiana believes, as an oil- and gas-producing \nState, that we need to develop alternative sources. As an investor with \nyour life savings, you don't invest it in just one company, in the \nevent that company goes belly up and you lose everything you worked \nfor. With investments, investors want a diverse portfolio. Why? To \nspread the risk. Any good investor knows that spreading risk is very \nimportant for long-term security.\n  Why, then, do we have an energy policy, or the lack of an energy \npolicy, that allows all of our eggs to be in one basket. It is too much \nin oil, and in some ways too much in gas, and not enough in other \ndeveloping technologies such as wind, solar, hydropower, and other ways \nof generating energy.\n  The most promising technology we have discussed on the floor is in \nthe transportation sector, in hydrocells, for our automobiles. It is \nthe transportation sector that uses most of the oil. Our industrial \nsector and our electric generators use a lot of gas, a lot of coal, and \na lot of nuclear. The bottom line is, while we have to reduce our \ndependency on foreign oil, particularly from nondemocratic nations, \nparticularly from nations that do not have stable governments, \nparticularly from nations that do not believe in the rule of law, that \ndo not allow women the right to vote, that do not allow children, girls \nin particular, to go to school, why do we compromise our foreign policy \nbecause we need that resource when we could drill more domestically? In \naddition, not only do we have to drill more in the United States, but \nwe have to wean ourselves off of fossil fuels over time and try to come \nup with renewable resources because all of these resources are finite.\n  To broaden our pool, to diversify our portfolio of sources is good \nfor the consumer and good for business because it\n\n[[Page S2399]]\n\nwill keep prices very competitive. If gas is too high, people could \nswitch to nuclear. If nuclear is too high, producers of energy could \nswitch to hydro. If hydro is too high, they could move to coal. If coal \nis too high, we can move to biomass.\n\n  We need more diverse sources of fuel, homegrown, and limit our \nimports of fuel from nations that are not democratic nations. I am not \nspeaking about Canada. Canada is a great ally of the United States. We \nimport a lot of gas from Canada. Let's continue to do it. Canada is a \ndemocracy. It is our ally. We can rely on it. That is smart politics.\n  Relying on other countries that do not share those values, that do \nnot have democratic values, gets us dealing with places where people \ntie dynamite to themselves and blow up themselves and innocent people. \nIt confuses us whether it is a terrorist or freedom fighter. We have \nfreedom fighters in America. Martin Luther King, Jr., was a freedom \nfighter. That is the kind of freedom fighter who we believe in in this \nNation. Gandhi was a freedom fighter. That is the kind of freedom \nfighter who ultimately wins peace and security and justice and changes \nwhen things are unjust. Not suicide bombers and not terrorists. It must \nbe rejected every day, every month, every year, every time--in the \nUnited States, in Israel, and in the Middle East.\n  Our energy policy puts us in a position where that gets foggy; it \ndoes not get clear. It is dangerous. It is not going to serve us well, \nnot this week, not next week, and not in the near future. Our \ndependency on oil imports from places that are not democratic nations, \nour refusal to broaden our portfolio of sources of energy, and our \ninability to separate this from our negotiations is not good for \nAmerica.\n  Let us begin by supporting Senator Murkowski's amendment on ANWR. Let \nus go further and support drilling. Let us fight very hard with Senator \nBingaman to try to put dollars into research and technologies for new \nalternatives. Let's be careful with the tax credits we give so we build \na domestic industry, creating new jobs and keeping our environment \nclean and investing in the States and the localities so when they are \nimpacted, we can fix them. When we lose wetlands, we can restore them. \nWhen some places are disrupted, we can do our very best to fix them and \nhave the kind of infrastructure necessary so we can have a good, solid, \nand clean industry.\n  That is why, in conclusion, this is getting a lot of momentum. This \nis why the President is receiving a tremendous amount of support in \nsome areas of his policy, and why, today, there was a great meeting and \npress conference of some of the major Jewish organizations throughout \nthis Nation. B'nai B'rith, the oldest and largest Jewish organization, \nhas finally and eloquently stated why it is so important to join this \nfight, along with veterans, along with our military, particularly the \nveterans who have been there. They have been to Europe; they have been \nto Korea; they have been to Vietnam. They know the price that is paid \nwhen American foreign policy is based on anything outside of our core \nvalues of freedom and democracy.\n  When we start fighting over oil and sacrificing the lives of our \nyoung men and women, it is just not worth the fight. Let me say again, \nit is not worth the fight. Other issues are worth the fight: democracy, \nfreedom, and justice. Oil is not worth the fight, especially when we \ncould have energy security by drilling in our own country. It is too \nhigh of a price to pay. I don't think we should pay it.\n  We should continue the effort to get a good, strong bill out of the \nSenate and get it into conference so we can have a bill that produces, \nthat encourages more domestic drilling, expands our portfolio of energy \nto include other things, that invests in research and development. This \ncountry leads the world in technology. When we make up our minds to \ncreate anything, we can do it. And we hardly ever fail. I can't think \nof a time we failed. We most certainly would be successful in new \ntechnologies and getting us off, eventually, fossil fuels, a finite \nresource, and getting us to renewables, so we are truly independent and \nour people can have hope.\n  In addition, I hope we can then balance this bill in conference. I \nurge the President to take as balanced an approach as possible in \nhelping shape a bill that works for our economy, that works for our \nforeign policy, and, most importantly, a bill that is true to values \nthat America has stood for now for 225 years. It does not cause us to \nhave to be hypocritical or to turn our eye or to be foggy in our \noutlook. We want to see clearly, to be honest with ourselves, about \nthis issue.\n  It is very serious. It is a very serious issue. Now it is affecting \nour national security. People at home would like to see strong steps \ntaken in that regard.\n  I am going to be offering an amendment for energy independence in the \nmorning. I have a series of amendments that I will be offering over the \ncourse of this debate. I will lay that out to my colleagues for their \nconsideration and I hope we will be strong enough to take the actions \nnecessary to set our Nation on the course for independence.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in morning \nbusiness for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Carnahan are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, for the last several days--since we \nhave been following the Mideast crisis--clearly I think we are all \naware that what was a tinderbox has now ignited into a firestorm.\n  This chart gives us an update of what happened while we were out for \nour Easter recess. It is a memorandum to the American people.\n  Let me identify the urgency because over the last few days Saddam \nHussein of Iraq has imposed a 30-day oil embargo on the United States. \nWe have seen the price of oil jump about $3 a barrel. We have seen \nSaddam Hussein offer to pay the families of the Palestinian suicide \nbombers up to $25,000. If that isn't an incentive to stimulate those \nwho are inclined to give up their life for the cause of Saddam Hussein, \nI don't know what is.\n  Further, Iraq and Iran call on countries to use oil as a weapon \nagainst the United States and Israel. And Libya agrees.\n  Think of that--using oil as a weapon.\n  When was the last time we talked about a weapon around here? It was \non September 11th when we were confronted with the first reality that \nan airplane would be used as a weapon. Obviously, we saw that at the \nPentagon and the two towers of the World Trade Center. This goes beyond \nour previous comprehension of what weapons are. But Iraq and Iran are \ncalling on countries to use oil as a weapon.\n  What do they mean? They mean, obviously, that with the money and the \ncashflow of oil, they can motivate people to give up their lives as \nsuicide bombers if their families can generate $25,000, or thereabouts. \nWhere does their money come from? It comes from the cashflow of oil. \nMake no mistake about it.\n  Further, a Christian Science Monitor article indicates that there is \ninformation relative to Iraq carrying out a plot to blow up a U.S. \nwarship. That was exposed by the article. The theory was a little more \nsignificant because what they proposed to do was target a tanker, \nprobably in the Straits of Hormuz, and then go after a U.S. warship.\n  We are also seeing here at home a skyrocketing increase in gasoline.\n  Who is responsible for that? It is our good friend, Saddam Hussein.\n  Iraq is the fast-growing source of U.S. oil imports--1.1 million \nbarrels; the Persian Gulf, almost 3 million barrels; and, OPEC \ncountries, 5.5 million barrels.\n  When Saddam Hussein indicates he was going to terminate production \nfor 30 days, that means somebody else is\n\n[[Page S2400]]\n\ngoing to have to pick up their oil. Maybe OPEC will do it. They have \nindicated that Saudi Arabia has the capacity. But will they? Clearly, \nwhen 1 million barrels are taken off the world market, prices are going \nto increase, and shortages are going to increase. That is reality.\n  Make no mistake about it. Saddam Hussein is not doing any favors for \nthe United States.\n  In announcing an oil embargo, he has effectively caused the spiraling \nin prices and an indicated shortage in production.\n  We have some other charts that I think show you the vulnerability of \nthe United States. This is, again, while we were away on our Easter \nrecess.\n  As the Mideast crisis worsens, the price of oil rises. This is the \nstatement by Iraq's ruling party.\n\n       If the oil weapon is not used in the battle to \n     defend American and Zionist [Israel] aggression, it is \n     meaningless.\n\n  That is a statement by Iraq's ruling party.\n  This is the timeframe from March 25 until our return.\n\n       If the oil weapon is not used in the battle to defend our \n     nations and safeguard our lives and dignity against American \n     and Zionist aggression, it is meaningless.\n\n  That is a pretty strong message. They are saying: We are going to use \noil as a weapon.\n  Make no mistake about it. What does that translate to? Our economy, \nand perhaps increased prices.\n  I do not know how many times we have to go to the well around here \nbefore we understand that some of these folks mean business. We are \nalready well aware of bin Laden. We are well aware of the aftermath of \nal-Qaida.\n  We wish we would have taken steps to avoid those actions. But where \nare we today as we look at Saddam Hussein? We have every reason to \nbelieve that he is developing weapons of mass destruction. We haven't \nhad the U.N. inspections in several years.\n  Are we putting off the inevitable? What is the inevitable? Is it some \nkind of an action that is perpetrated as a consequence of Saddam \nHussein's weapons that he has developed over a period of time? What are \nthose weapons? We don't know because we haven't had inspectors in there \nin over 2 years.\n  What we know is that we have been taking his oil. We know that we \nhave been enforcing a no-fly zone over Iraq since 1992. We do know that \nwe have bombed him three times this year. We do know that we put our \nyoung men and women's lives at risk as we enforce the no-fly zone. We \nalso know as he takes our money, he develops weapons capability and \nweapons of mass destruction--biological weapons--aimed at our ally, \nIsrael. We know those things.\n  Where is the logic? How do we close the loop? What is the message? \nHow are we going to respond?\n  I do not know how many times we have to reflect on weapons. We saw an \naircraft used as a weapon three times on September 11. It could have \nbeen much worse but for that heroic event in Pennsylvania.\n  Here is an article from Reuters of April 1.\n\n       Iraq urges use of oil as a weapon against Israel and U.S.\n\n  It states:\n\n       Use oil as a weapon in the battle with the enemy, Israel.\n\n  Iraq's ruling Baath Party said in a statement published by the \nBaghdad media:\n\n       If the oil weapon is not used in the battle to defend our \n     nations and safeguard our lives and dignity against American \n     and Zionist aggression, it is meaningless.\n\n  That is the ruling party of Iraq.\n\n       ``If Arabs want to put an end to Zionism, they are able to \n     do so in 24 hours,'' Saddam told a group of Iraq's religious \n     dignitaries Sunday night.\n\n  Another quote:\n\n       The world understands the language of economy, so why do \n     not Arabs use this language? He asked.\n       Saddam said if only two Arab states threatened to use \n     economic measures against western countries if Israel did not \n     withdraw from the Palestinian-ruled territory, ``you will see \n     they (Israelis) will pull out the next day.''\n\n  Madam President, do we believe that? Saddam Hussein is one of two \nArab States that has already used its economic measure against the \nWestern countries by terminating its oil production for 30 days.\n  What else happened today that deserves consideration? In our own \nhemisphere, South America certainly, Venezuela, PDVSA, one of the \nlargest conglomerates in the world, went on strike. What does that mean \nto the United States? It means that roughly 30 percent of our imports \nare no longer available. Saddam Hussein stopped his production, and \nVenezuela, PDVSA, is on strike. We don't know the ramifications of \nthat.\n  The threat is clearly here. I have been coming to the Chamber for a \nlong time talking about the blatant inconsistency of our foreign energy \npolicy. We have other charts here. I will stay on this subject a little \nmore because I think many Members assume this is oil that is coming in \nfrom overseas. So it is Iraqi oil. So what? We probably don't get it.\n  Here is a chart that shows where it goes. What we did was, we went to \nthe importers and asked where this oil went. And we got some idea of \nwhere it is refined: Washington State, California, Texas, Oklahoma, \nArkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, \nKentucky, Minnesota, New Jersey. This constitutes roughly Iraqi oil \nimports from January to December of the year 2001, a total of 287.3 \nmillion barrels consumed in these States. It is pretty well spread \naround the geography of the United States.\n  We have another chart that shows very vividly crude oil imports from \nIraq to the United States in the year 2001--283 million barrels. This \nis by month. June was an all-time high. Then down in July. In September \nit bounced up again, in October, November, December. So here we are, \nclearly identifying where the oil comes from and where it goes.\n  We could show another chart that shows you what is happening in the \nUnited States today. That is the increase in retail gasoline prices per \ngallon. This is $1, $1.05, $1.15, up to $1.40. Here we are, April 1: \n$1.34. Make no mistake about it. These are factual realities associated \nwith what is happening. The American public is modestly inconvenienced, \nbut there is no consensus on what kind of relief.\n  I suggest there is an energy plan out there that has been proposed by \nsome. This is kind of it. Unless the crisis is too bad, we just stick \nour head in the sand. Is this an energy plan? I don't think so. We have \nan energy bill before us. It is absolutely necessary that we proceed \nwith this bill. As a consequence of the extended discussion about how \nwe are going to reduce our dependence, one of the issues that comes up \nis obviously to produce more oil in the United States. How can we do \nthat?\n  One of the more contentious amendments that will be debated on the \nfloor is the ANWR amendment. What is so significant about ANWR? The \nsignificance is that it is the most likely area in North America for a \nmajor oil discovery. We had ANWR passed in the omnibus bill back in \n1995. In December, it passed out of the Senate. It was vetoed by \nPresident Clinton. We would know today and have production from the \narea and we wouldn't be beholden to Saddam Hussein, who suddenly \ndecides he is going to cut 1 million barrels of production, his \nproduction, away from the market. We anticipate that ANWR would exceed \n1 million barrels a day.\n\n  We have been paying Saddam Hussein roughly $25 million a day for \nIraqi oil for the last year. That is a lot of money, $25 million a day. \nThis is the same dictator who actively fired on our pilots, who is \ndeveloping weapons of mass destruction, funding terrorism against \nIsrael, yet is our fastest growing source of imported oil.\n  Saddam Hussein is paying bounties of $25,000 to each suicide bomber \nwho murders Israeli citizens. The suicide bombers terrorizing Israel \nare the proxy soldiers of Saddam Hussein. Think about that. They are \nproxy soldiers. Yet we rely on Saddam Hussein for our energy needs each \nday.\n  Every time we go to the gas pump, a portion of what we pay funds \nSaddam Hussein in his war on the United States and Israel; on his war, \nif you will, to encourage individuals to sacrifice their lives as \nsuicide bombers and commit funds to the relatives of some $25,000.\n  Enough is enough. We need to end this inconsistency once and for all.\n\n[[Page S2401]]\n\n  Among the considerations that come to mind to end this would be the \nPresident's certification that Iraq is complying with U.N. Security \nCouncil Resolution 687 which demands that the Iraqi weapons program be \ndestroyed, destroyed and certified by inspectors, that we have the \nsatisfaction of knowing that Saddam Hussein is no longer smuggling oil \nin circumvention of the Oil for Food Program. We have already lost \nlives. We lost the lives of two American Navy men when they intercepted \none of Saddam Hussein's smuggling ships. In the process of boarding the \nship, the ship sank and these two American sailors lost their lives. \nLittle was said about it, but Saddam Hussein is still taking American \nlives.\n  Further, one could consider a stipulation that Saddam Hussein would \nnot subsidize the action of the suicide bombers.\n  As I indicated earlier, some people don't have a second thought about \nwhere we get our oil. Some think that drilling in Alaska is too risky. \nThat is poppycock. We have drilled in Alaska for 30 years in the Arctic \nand developed the largest field in North America, Prudhoe Bay. You \nmight not like oilfields. That is your own business. But Prudhoe Bay is \nthe best oilfield not only in the United States but in the world. It \nhas more environmental oversight by Federal and State officials, laws, \nand regulations.\n  So it is interesting to reflect, if you don't get the oil from here, \nwhere are you going to get it? Do you want to go to Colombia where they \nare blowing up Colombian pipelines and kidnapping American oil workers? \nSome of the oilfields of Russia are an absolute disgrace from the \nstandpoint of environmental oversight.\n  Nobody seems to care where it comes from. Why can't it come from an \narea where we have the oversight, where we have the safety, and we can \ndo it right?\n  We have a situation today where Israeli and Palestinian citizens are \ndying in the streets. They are certainly at risk. Yet they say it is \ntoo risky to open up the Arctic. I wonder if channeling funds to Saddam \nHussein to allow him to carry out his vicious campaigns is not risky. \nOur men and women in uniform are in harm's way today. Yet many Members \nin this body live in some fantasyland, a world of ivory towers, an \nimage of pristine wilderness.\n  Well, I have been there, Madam President. It is a harsh reality. The \naboriginal residents of the area of Kaktovic support the development. I \nhave felt like a voice in the wilderness on this issue for some time. \nWe have a lot of wilderness--about 56 million acres, which is the size \nof the State of California.\n  It is time for some of us to face the facts. It is time to stop \ncontributing to Saddam Hussein's campaign of terror. How bad do things \nhave to get before we have the fortitude to recognize that we can \nreduce our dependence and send Saddam Hussein a very strong signal--and \nthe rest of the Mideast, such as Iran, Libya, and the other countries, \nincluding Saudi Arabia--a message that we mean business?\n  Remember what Saddam Hussein says at the end of every speech. His \nlast words are--think about this--``death to Israel. Death to \nAmerica.'' From what I have seen in Israel in the last 2 months, with \nall the suicide bombers, we ought to know what he means. How long does \nthis have to go on before we come to grips with reality and make a \ncommitment that we can open up this area safely, that it will \nsignificantly recuse our dependence on imported oil? I think that time \nhas come, and I urge my colleagues to make commitments to America's \nenvironmental community to recognize that you are going to have to be \ncounted here and do what is right for America, not necessarily what is \nright to placate some of the extreme environmental groups that have \nused this as a cash cow; they have milked it for all it is worth.\n  It is kind of interesting to hear the mischaracterizations of a \nrecent study by the Department of the Interior, the USGS. They \nindicated in the first study the supposition that the entire area was \nat risk. What is the entire area? It is 1.5 million acres that was \nsomehow at risk. It was the assumption that the entire area would be \nput up for lease. Of course, the House bill, and what is in the \namendment that we intend to offer, is that the footprint will be \nlimited to 2,000 acres. There will not be international airports, or \nairports of any significance. There will not be any activity during the \ncaribou calving season when the Porcupine herd is in the area. Drilling \nand exploration will be limited to wintertime activities. There will be \nno roads built. There will just be ice roads.\n  This is the technology we have now. Make no mistake about it, from \nthe standpoint of conservation, we have learned how to take care of the \ncaribou. There are two major actions we have done to protect them. We \nallow no hunting. You can't run them down in a snow machine. The herd, \nknown as the western Arctic herd, in the Prudhoe Bay area was about \n3,000 in the early 1970s. It is over 26,000 today. You can't hunt in \nthe area; you can't take those animals.\n  The Porcupine herd is something else. The aboriginal people depend \nupon them, and the herd is quite healthy. Remember where that herd \ngoes. It crosses the Dempster Highway in Canada. That is probably where \nit receives the most intense pressure from human predators, who take \nthe caribou for subsistence and sport purposes. That doesn't happen in \nAlaska; it happens in Canada.\n  So I hope my colleagues will be ready to recognize the significance \nof their votes. Not only is this a major issue for the veterans of this \ncountry who have said time and time again that we want to reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil. We don't want to send our men and women \noverseas to fight another war on foreign soil.\n  I am reminded of Mark Hatfield's statement; he is a former Senator \nfrom the State of Oregon. He said:\n\n       I will vote for ANWR any day rather than send our young men \n     or women overseas to fight a war over oil on foreign soil.\n\n  Well, we did it in 1992 and we lost 147 lives. Let's get on with the \nissue at hand and let's reflect on the issues. American labor is on \nboard because they see it as a jobs issue--somewhere in the area of \n250,000 new jobs. People talk about stimulus. That is the largest \nsingle stimulus that anybody has been able to identify in this entire \nyear of debate on the floor of the Senate. What does it mean? It means \n250,000 jobs. But these are private sector, well-paying jobs, union \njobs that will not cost the taxpayer one red cent. This is win-win-win-\nwin. It is win for America, win for jobs, win for reducing our \ndependence on imported oil, and win for our scientific community and \nour environmental community--to ensure that we have the technology to \ndo this right.\n  I look forward to the debate in the coming days, but I think it is \nappropriate to highlight what has happened in just the last 2 days. \nSaddam Hussein has determined he is going to stop oil production for 30 \ndays. Venezuela is on strike. We have, overnight, lost nearly 30 \npercent of our imports, and each day you are going to hear more bad \nnews: higher prices at the gas station and higher prices to fill your \nheating oil tanks. You are going to see it represented in the economy--\non the stock market as it affects our growth and, God knows what we can \nexpect from the Mideast crisis that is underway in that area today, as \nour vulnerability becomes more intense.\n  I will have more to say about this topic each day. I wanted to bring \nto my colleagues' attention the highlights of the pending crisis. When \nwe left here on our recess, we had a threat. Today we have a crisis. \nHere it is: a 30-day oil embargo, $3-a-barrel increase, and Saddam pays \nsuicide bombers $25,000. Iraq and Iran call on countries to use oil as \na weapon. If that isn't a threat against the United States and Israel, \nI don't know what is. Iraq plots to blow up U.S. warships, and the \nprice of gasoline is skyrocketing.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, it is 5:45 in the afternoon. We had one \nvote today. Obviously, there will be no\n\n[[Page S2402]]\n\nmore rollcall votes today. I say ``obviously''; I should probably say \n``unfortunately.'' This is the fourth week now we have been on this \nbill. This is the 15th day we have been on this bill. We have scores, \nif not hundreds, of amendments that ought to be offered and ought to be \ndebated. We listened to countless speeches all last year from many of \nour Republican colleagues about how critical it was we bring up this \nbill. I think Senator Murkowski on several occasions said: Let's let \nthe chips fall where they may; let's offer amendments; let's take up \nANWR; let's get this legislation done.\n  The Senator from Alaska talked today about this being another crisis, \ngiven the Iraqi situation. Here it is, 5:45 this afternoon, and we are \nfacing a Republican filibuster on the Feinstein amendment, the so-\ncalled derivatives amendment. We are hopeful we can at long last reach \na cloture vote tomorrow. They have been filibustering the derivative \namendment now for some time. I don't understand why we have yet to take \nup the ANWR amendment. As I said, after 15 long days of debate, we have \nyet to debate one of the central issues involving energy policy from \nthe Republicans' perspective, and that is the debate on ANWR.\n  It is critical we have that debate sooner rather than later. And if \nneed be, I know some of my colleagues have actually suggested maybe \nthey will raise the issue, that they take it up, that they offer the \namendment. We would probably offer the House language.\n  We want to accomplish as much as possible during this work period. I \nhave laid out, on several occasions now, our hope and expectation with \nregard to the legislative agenda for this work period. It is ambitious. \nBut our Republican friends in the administration, and Republican \nfriends in the Senate, talk about how they are unable to take up other \nvery important pieces of legislation, including trade promotion \nauthority and terrorist insurance.\n  But we find ourselves here with a Republican filibuster on the energy \nbill, a Republican reluctance to take up the ANWR amendment, and, at \n5:45 in the afternoon, no one to offer amendments in spite of the fact \nthat we have been on this bill now for 15 days and over 200 amendments \nare still pending.\n  So, I must say, it is a situation that has to be rectified sooner or \nlater. There is no way we can take up all of the other important bills \nduring this very critical work period if we do not have more \ncooperation and ability to address the remaining issues in this bill \nthan what has been demonstrated so far.\n  It is unfortunate. It is frustrating to be at a point, after this \nlong on the energy bill, that in my view is so far from closure on a \nbill that both sides have acknowledged must be completed.\n  I want to complete it. I know Senator Reid has been working very hard \nto try to work on both sides to see if we can come up with a list of \namendments. But, as I say, a Republican filibuster on the derivative \namendment has to end. The ANWR amendment has to be debated. We have to \nfind some way to resolve whatever other outstanding questions there are \nand bring this bill to a close so we can move on to other important \npieces of legislation, including border security, which, as I \nunderstand it, is supported by the administration; Republicans and \nDemocrats support it.\n  We also have the election reform bill. We have nominations we would \nlike to take up--judicial nominations. We have heard a lot about that \nin recent days. So there is no lack of work required of this body. Yet \nthere are such limits on our ability to deal with all of those and \nother priorities, simply because we have been unable to move this bill \nany further along than we are this afternoon.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I ask my friend from South Dakota, the majority leader, if \nhe is aware that we have had speeches here in the past several weeks--\nwe had one earlier this afternoon--of Senators saying, Why don't we \nvote on ANWR? Why don't we have an up-or-down vote on ANWR?\n  Is the Senator aware these speeches are being made by the other side \noften but no amendment is offered? Have you ever seen a procedure such \nas that where they complain about not having a vote but they have not \noffered the amendment?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. It is mystifying to me. We have been told for months, if \nnot years, how critical ANWR is to some of our colleagues on the other \nside. Yet after 15 days we are told we still have to wait for an ANWR \namendment on this energy bill.\n  So something doesn't connect here. Either ANWR is not important or \nthere is a slow-walking of the bill--inexplicably. There is an \nemergency, as some of our colleagues have indicated today, but there is \nan inability here to connect the dots. It seems to me we have to \nrectify that situation.\n  The Senator is right. You cannot give speeches and say it is \nimportant for us to finish the bill and take up ANWR and we need a vote \nbut then fail to offer the amendment to get the vote.\n  I ask my colleagues to recognize how precious our time is. This is \nTuesday. I have already had two or three requests for early evenings \nand early departure this weekend. I suspect we will get more of those \nthroughout the week. We have to make the most of the days we are here. \nLet's make the most of Wednesday, the most of Thursday. Let's resolve \nthese outstanding issues, let's end the filibuster, and let's get this \njob done.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 9:15 on \nWednesday, April 10, the Senate resume consideration of S. 517; that \nthe time until 9:45 a.m. be for debate prior to the cloture vote with \nrespect to the Feinstein amendment numbered 2989, with the time equally \ndivided and controlled in the usual form; that at 9:45 tomorrow morning \nthe Senate proceed to vote on the motion to invoke cloture; and that \nSenators have until 9:30 a.m. for filing second-degree amendments to \nthe Feinstein amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, last week, as people of many faiths \ncelebrated holy days of peace, our television screens were filled with \nvisions of horror. Young Palestinian men and women, strapping \nexplosives to their bodies and detonating themselves in crowds of \nIsraeli civilians, destroyed dozens of lives and with them exploded the \nhopes and dreams for a peaceful resolution of the Middle East crisis.\n  The words used to acclaim these acts are deeply troubling. The \nmurderous bomber who killed celebrants at the Passover meal was deemed \n``a glorious martyr.'' Such a proclamation is a cruel hoax, perpetrated \nby those dedicated to the destruction of the Jewish state. It comes \nfrom those who have never admitted in their hearts--and will never \nadmit that Israel has the right to exist within secure and peaceful \nborders.\n  They unleash their hate under the banner of such groups as Hamas, and \nHezbollah, the Fatah and the Al Asqa Mosque Martyrs' Brigade.\n  Unfortunately, the leader of the Palestinian Authority, Yasser \nArafat, is unwilling or unable to prevent the wave of assaults against \nIsraeli civilians. For far too many years he has talked the talk of \npeace; but he has never walked the walk for peace.\n  When it has served his interest to speak of reconciliation, of \ncompromise, of security for Israel--he has done so. But days, or even \nhours, later when speaking to his people, or the Arab world, he uses \nlanguage that urges armed struggle, a war of liberation, and a return \nto conquered lands.\n\n[[Page S2403]]\n\n  He has not prepared his people for peace. He has not explained the \nneed for compromise. In fact, maps in school books do not even show the \nState of Israel.\n  On the White House lawn, President Clinton urged both sides to take a \nchance for peace. Israel was willing to do just that. Israel traded \nland in the hope for peace. Israel promised even more land, and a \nPalestinian state.\n  What did the Palestinians do? They did not create a government to \nserve the best interests of their people. Yasser Arafat created a gulag \non Israel's back doorstep--one riddled by corruption and bent on \ncrushing dissent. The Palestinian leader built an infrastructure for \nterror and then incited his people telling them that Palestine would \nrun from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea.\n  When the parties met at Camp David, Israel did what it had never done \nbefore. It put the issue of Jerusalem on the table. But the most \ngenerous offer Israel could possibly make, was not only rejected, it \nwas brutalized by violence. That violence has intensified for 18 \nmonths, mutating into waves of suicidal terror.\n  In the minds of most Israelis, this cruel response has undermined \nYasser Arafat as a genuine partner in search of peace, for Israel now \nhas to question whether land for peace is actually an equation for more \nviolence.\n  Israel has an obligation to its citizens to respond. When al Qaeda \nattacked America, we sent our military across the globe to seek out the \nterrorists in training camp by camp, cave by cave. Israel has \nterrorist's cells just a couple miles from its largest cities. It had \nno choice but to take them out--root and branch.\n  America is conducting her own war on global terrorism in the wake of \nattacks on our country and to address the threat of Saddam Hussein \nacquiring weapons of mass destruction. But the United States must at \nthe same time devote its full resources to resolving the Israeli-\nPalestinian conflict. We must do so in a way, however, that does not \nundermine the core principle of our war against terrorism. There must \nbe zero tolerance for terrorism. Such deeds cannot have, or be \nperceived to have, any political benefit.\n  Those who seek a political solution to conflict must first rebuild \ntrust by rejecting terror. Unfortunately, both the Arab League and \nIslamic Conference have failed to do so. Nonetheless, Secretary \nPowell's mission takes place against the backdrop of a new Arab \ninitiative.\n  This initiative has many flaws, but it is significant. Arab \ngovernments have now demonstrated a desire to play a constructive role \nin resolving the conflict. Since the Palestinian leadership has been \ntotally discredited as peace partners, the path to peace goes through \nAmman, Cairo, and Riyadh.\n  If these governments are serious peace-seekers, other steps must \nfollow. They must denounce terror against Israel with the same strength \nand passion as they denounce actions taken against Palestinians. They \nmust halt their financial backing for terrorist groups dedicated to the \ndestruction of Israel. They must put an end to the anti-semetic, anti-\nIsrael, and anti-American rhetoric in their state sponsored media. \nFinally, they must convince Yasser Arafat, and more importantly the \nPalestinian people, to abandon their self-destructive behavior.\n  Had the Passover ceremony in Netanya not been violated by a murderous \nbomber, those present, together with Jews around the world, would have \nended the ceremony by saying: ``next year in Jerusalem.''\n  The Jerusalem to which they aspire, however, is not the city we see \ntoday--a city stricken with fear; a city of shattered windows and \nshattered lives where calls to worship have been replaced by sirens and \nambulances.\n  No, the Jerusalem to which they aspire, is a Jerusalem of tolerance, \nof faith, and of peace.\n  While that vision seems remote at the moment, we are reminded of the \nwords of Louis Pasteur, who said:\n\n       Never let yourselves be discouraged by the sadness of \n     certain hours which pass over nations.\n\n  For those who earnestly seek peace, even dark days can be the \nharbingers of brighter tomorrows.\n  Our prayers today are for a brighter tomorrow for all in the Mideast, \nfor all people of goodwork.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/09/senate-section/article/S2403-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NEVADA VETO OF YUCCA MOUNTAIN SITE\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I advise my colleagues that yesterday \nanother significant step was taken in the process to address relief for \nnuclear energy by the approval of the Yucca Mountain process--and I \nemphasize process because it is a step-by-step effort.\n  The Governor of Nevada came to Washington to deliver his veto over \nthe President's recommendation to site this Nation's high-level waste \nrepository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada.\n  Further, Chairman Bingaman, chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, today took yet another step in introducing a \nresolution, S.J. Res. 34, to override the Nevada veto. Senator \nBingaman's action sets in motion the congressional fast-track procedure \nin both the House and Senate to approve this resolution, which is done \nby a simple majority. We finally may approve a safe, remote, central \nfacility for our Nation's nuclear waste. Without this repository, our \nnuclear plants would have to shut down, and I do not think we can \naddress that risk, recognizing nearly 20 percent of our Nation's energy \nis generated by nuclear power.\n  Without Yucca Mountain, the cold-war legacy sites throughout the U.S. \nwill not get cleaned up because we will have no place to put the waste. \nThe Federal Government has an obligation for the spent fuel and the DOE \nwaste, and to meet this obligation we must open that repository, and we \nmust do it soon.\n  To date, we have spent over 20 years and over $4 billion to \ninvestigate and characterize the site. The science tells us this is the \nplace.\n  I join Senator Bingaman in urging my colleagues to vote for this \nresolution when it comes before the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/09/senate-section/article/S2403-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2403-S2404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO THE GIRL SCOUTS OF AMERICA\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity \nto recognize the 90th Anniversary of the Girl Scouts of the United \nStates of America. In March, this vital organization celebrated an \nimportant milestone in its efforts to encourage girls and young women \nfrom communities across our nation to enjoy scouting activities that \nnurture their mental, physical, and spiritual well-being. \nCongratulations to the 3.8 million members throughout the United \nStates.\n  I am pleased to tell you that more than 9,000 girls across the State \nof South Dakota actively participate in Girl Scouts. In particular, I \nwant to commend the Girl Scouts of Nyoda Council for their outstanding \naccomplishments in the areas of leadership, community service and \npersonal development in our state. For over 35 years, this chapter has \noffered a spiritually motivated, values-based program that encourages \nevery girl to reach her highest potential. The Girl Scouts of Nyoda \nCouncil adhere to the vision statement of the Girl Scout movement: ``to \ninspire girls with the highest ideals of character, conduct, \npatriotism, and service, that they may become happy and resourceful \ncitizens.''\n  On April 13, the Nyoda Council will hold their Girl Scout Gold Award \nceremony in honor of those who have achieved the highest honor a Senior \nGirl Scout can attain. They deserve recognition for their outstanding \nwork, perseverence, leadership, and community involvement. I applaud \ntheir ``can-do'' spirit, determination, and dedication to the \nbetterment of their community.\n  Congratulations to the Girl Scouts of Nyoda Council on this very \nspecial occasion. May they enjoy this celebration of their efforts, and \nkeep up the great work.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the \nGirl Scouts. In honor of their 90th anniversary, I would like to \ncongratulate this extraordinary group for their many years of \nexcellence and service to this Nation. This organization has provided \ngreat opportunities for many girls and young women, helping them to \ndevelop to their full potential and to become good citizens and great \nleaders. The Girl Scout Law states that each girl will strive to \npossess honesty,\n\n[[Page S2404]]\n\ncourage, responsibility, and respect both for themselves and others. \nThese ideals demonstrate the high standards this organization sets in \nencouraging the development of young girls.\n  Currently in New Mexico, approximately 8,000 girls and 3,000 women \nparticipate in Girl Scouts. Chapparal Council, one of the three New \nMexican Girl Scout councils, covers counties in northwestern New Mexico \nand parts of Southwestern Colorado. The 6,000 members of that council \ncontribute their time and effort to better their communities. These \ngirls, along with countless other women who once pledged the Girl \nScouts' promise have and will receive the many benefits from this \norganization.\n  The Girl Scouts' new initiative ``For Every Girl, Everywhere'' \nhighlights the diversity of this fine group, attempting to reach out to \nevery girl in every community, regardless of race, ethnicity, or \ngeographic boundaries. The Girl Scouts have given girls from every \nsocioeconomic background an equal opportunity to become successful \nadults through the exploratory and intellectual activities in which \nthey participate. This has especially played an important role in New \nMexico.\n  Throughout New Mexico, girls have been changing their lives in a \npositive way that will no doubt benefit them in their future endeavors. \nBy focusing on health and fitness, appreciating diversity, and \ncommunity service, the Girl Scouts have inspired girls with high ideas \nof character, conduct, and patriotism. Girls participate in many events \nthroughout their community such as providing help to those in need and \nworking to improve the environment. They organize donation drives for \nneedy families, plan activities for senior citizens, hold flag \nceremonies throughout the State, plant trees and clean up local parks.\n  Although the Girl Scouts are primarily community based, the ideals of \ncaring and helping others are also demonstrated on a national level. \nAfter the tragedy of September 11th, Girl Scouts from the Zia Council \nin New Mexico made dream catchers, a Native American work of art \nsymbolizing peaceful sleep, and had them blessed and sent to New York \nin memory of the victims and their families as a way of reaching out to \nthose in need of inspiration.\n  Through this organization, girls learn to set high standards and \ndevelop qualities that will benefit them throughout their lives. They \nare able to learn self-confidence, responsibility, and leadership \nskills, and are encouraged to think creatively. Through the hard work \nof this organization over 50 million women have been touched by the \npositive impact of Girl Scouts. As the world's largest girls' \norganization with currently 2.7 million girl members and just under 1 \nmillion adult members, I would like to once again commend past, current \nand future Girl Scouts for their valuable contributions and dedication \nover the last 90 years.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, I rise today to show my \nsupport for the 90th anniversary of the Girl Scouts. Through the Girl \nScouts, girls acquire self-confidence, a sense of responsibility, life \nskills and integrity. In each level of the Scouts, young girls learn \nskills that will assist them as they enter adulthood, including science \nand technology education, money management, sports training, engaging \nin community services, art education, and much more. The Girl Scouts \nencourage their members to engage in a wide variety of activities such \nas field trips, sports camps, and cultural exchanges. I am proud to \nnote that members of my staff were Girl Scouts when they were younger.\n  The mission of the Girl Scouts is to help all girls grow strong and \nprepare for adulthood by empowering them to develop their full \npotential, get along well with others, and to work together to \ncontribute to their communities. Today, the organization boasts a \nmembership of 3.8 million members, 2.7 million girls and over 900,000 \nadults.\n  I would like to take just a moment to commend the activities that the \nGirl Scouts are involved with in my State of New Hampshire. I would \nlike to specifically thank the Girl Scouts of Swift Water Council for \ntheir numerous contributions toward the development of young women in \nour state. For a single organization to reach over 15,000 girls in New \nHampshire alone is extraordinary. There are three programs that fall \nunder the Swift Water Council that I want to commend. The Cool \nConnections program at Sanders Cottage in Manchester, and the Antrim \nGirls Shelter both help young girls in crisis by teaching them how to \nmake positive decisions and boosting their self-esteem. The Swift Water \nCouncil also established an activity center for young refugee girls at \nthe International Institute in Manchester. This Institute helps \nrefugees from wartorn nations seek asylum in the United States. These \nactivities provide young girls with socialization, group cooperation \nskills, and the tools they need to acclimate successfully into the \ncommunity. I am grateful for the contributions that the Girl Scouts \nhave made in my state.\n  In closing, I want to commend the Girl Scouts for 90 years of \npositive influence on the lives of young girls all across this nation. \nI especially want to thank the Girl Scouts of New Hampshire and the \nadult volunteers who support them. Keep up the good work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/09/senate-section/article/S2404-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2404-S2406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REVISION IN ENERGY TAX INCENTIVES REPORT\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, on March 1, 2002, I filed Report 107-140 \nto accompany S. 1979, the Energy Tax Incentives Act of 2002. Since that \ntime, the Congressional Budget Office has revised its estimate to \nreflect changes resulting from enactment of Public Law 107-147, the Job \nCreation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002, plus direct spending \neffects that were not in the previous estimate. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the revised CBO estimate, dated April 1, 2002, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 1, 2002.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the enclosed revised cost estimate for S. 1979, the \n     Energy Tax Incentives Act of 2002. The estimate includes \n     direct spending effects on the Tennessee Valley Authority, \n     loans issued by the Rural Utilities Service, and crop \n     subsidies provided by the Department of Agriculture that were \n     not in the previous estimate. Review estimates reflect \n     changes in current law resulting from enactment of Public Law \n     107-147, the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002, \n     which was signed on March 9, 2002. This estimate supersedes \n     the estimate that CBO provided for this bill on February 27, \n     2002.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contacts are Erin \n     Whitaker (for revenues), who can be reached at 226-2720, and \n     Lisa Cash Driskill (for direct spending), who can be reached \n     at 226-2860.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Barry B.

Crippen, Director).\n       Enclosure.\n\n    Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate, Revised April 1, 2002\n\n[S. 1979: Energy Tax Incentives Act of 2002, as ordered reported by the \n           Senate Committee on Finance on February 13, 2002]\n\n\n                                summary\n\n       S. 1979, the Energy Tax Incentives Act, would amend \n     numerous provisions of tax law relating to energy. The bill \n     would enhance and create credits for the use and development \n     of energy-efficient technologies, amend tax rules to provide \n     deductions for certain devices and credits for businesses \n     that provide energy, and enhance and create credits and \n     deductions for the production of oil, gas, and other types of \n     fuel. Certain tax credits would be available to the Tennessee \n     valley Authority (TVA) and rural electric cooperatives in the \n     form of credits that could be used to pay sums owed to the \n     Treasury. The bill also would provide tax credits for the \n     production of biodiesel fuels. which would result in a \n     reduction in the subsidies provided by the Department of \n     Agriculture (USDA) for certain crops. Most provisions of S. \n     1979 would take effect in 2003, but some would take effect in \n     2002.\n       The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Joint \n     Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimate that enacting the bill \n     would decrease governmental receipts by $80 million in 2002, \n     by $8.3 billion over the 2002-2007 period, and by $14.4 \n     billion over the 2002-2012 period. CBO estimates that \n     provisions in the bill affecting TVA, rural electric \n     cooperatives, and USDA would result in an increase in direct \n     spending of $20 million in 2002, a decrease of about $75 \n     million over the 2002-2007 period, and a decrease of about \n     $200 million over the 2002-2012 period. CBO also estimates \n     that certain provisions requiring studies and reports would \n     have an insignificant impact on spending subject to \n     appropriation. Since S. 1979 would affect direct spending and \n     receipts, pay-as-you-go procedures would apply.\n\n[[Page S2405]]\n\n       CBO has determined that provisions of the bill requiring \n     the Secretary of the Treasury and the General Accounting \n     Office to report the results of certain studies contain no \n     intergovernmental mandates as defined in the Unfunded \n     Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) and would not affect the budgets \n     of state, local, or tribal governments. JCT has determined \n     that the remaining provisions of the bill contain no \n     intergovernmental mandates as defined in UMRA. The bill \n     contains no new private-sector mandates as defined in \n     UMRA.\n\n\n                ESTIMATED COST TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\n\n       The estimated budgetary impact of the bill is shown in the \n     following table.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                       By Fiscal Year, in Millions of Dollars\n                                   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        2002         2003         2004         2005         2006         2007\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                               CHANGES IN REVENUES\n \nEstimated Revenues................          -80         -312       -1,237       -2,259       -2,583       -1,869\n \n                                           CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING\n \nCredits for Clean Coal and\n Renewable Technologies Used by\n TVA:\n    Estimated budget Authority....  ...........  ...........           10           10           10           10\n    Estimated Outlays.............  ...........  ...........           10           10           10           10\nCredits for Clean Coal and\n Renewable Technologies Used by\n Rural Electric Cooperatives:\n    Estimated Budget Authority....           20            0  ...........  ...........  ...........  ...........\n    Estimated Outlays.............           20            0  ...........  ...........  ...........  ...........\nEffect of Biodiesel Tax Credits on\n Spending for Farm Programs:\n    Estimated Budget Authority....  ...........          -13          -22          -28          -33          -38\n    Estimated Outlays.............  ...........          -13          -22          -28          -33          -38\nTotal Changes in Direct Spending:\n    Estimated Budget Authority....           20          -13          -12          -18          -23          -28\n    Estimated Outlays.............           20          -13          -12          -18          -23          -28\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                           BASIS OF ESTIMATE\n\n                                Revenues\n\n       All revenue estimates were provided by JCT except for one \n     provision. For the years 2006-2012, CBO estimated the revenue \n     effects of the provision providing a tax credit and excise \n     tax rate reduction for biodiesel fuel mixtures.\n       Five provisions would compose a significant portion of the \n     effect on revenues if enacted. Those provisions would extend \n     the credit for producing energy from certain sources, extend \n     the credit for purchase of alternative motor vehicles, and \n     modify the credit for purchase of electric vehicles. They \n     also would establish a statutory 15-year recovery period for \n     natural gas distribution lines, expand the credit for certain \n     qualifying fuels produced from coal to fuels produced in \n     facilities placed in service after the date of enactment, and \n     modify the rules governing certain requirements for \n     contributions to, and transfers of, qualified nuclear \n     decommissioning funds. These provisions would, if enacted, \n     reduce revenues by $57 million in 2002, $3.3 billion over the \n     2002-2007 period, and $6.8 billion over the 2002-2012 period.\n       Section 209 of the bill would provide for an income tax \n     credit and a reduction in the excise tax rate on purchases of \n     biodiesel fuel mixtures (a combination of diesel fuel and \n     vegetable oil). These provisions would expire on December 31, \n     2005. The JCT assumes that they would expire at that time and \n     estimates that they would reduce revenue by $74 million \n     through fiscal year 2006. CBO extends those revenue losses \n     beyond 2006, however, based on the rules governing CBO's \n     revenue baseline. Those rules require CBO to treat excise \n     taxes dedicated to trust funds as permanent, even if they \n     expire during the projection period. The excise taxes on \n     motor fuels are dedicated to the Highway Trust Fund and are \n     scheduled to expire on September 30, 2005. The biodiesel \n     provision would reduce the excise tax rate on certain motor \n     fuels. Because CBO's baseline extends the excise taxes at the \n     rate existing at time of expiration, the biodiesel provision \n     would, for budgetary scoring purposes, be treated as if it \n     were extended permanently. On that basis, CBO estimates that \n     the biodiesel provision would reduce revenues by $448 million \n     from 2006 through 2012. In all, CBO and JCT estimate that the \n     provision would reduce revenues by $552 million from 2002 \n     through 2012.\n\n                            Direct Spending\n\n       Effect of Biodiesel Tax Credits on Farm Programs. Because \n     of the bill's incentives to sell and use biodiesel fuels, JCT \n     and CBO have estimated that use of these fuel mixtures would \n     increase. Because the vegetable oil in the mixtures is \n     expected to be primarily derived from soybeans and a few \n     other oilseeds, the price of these oilseeds would increase. \n     (Qualifying vegetable oils may be derived from corn, soybeans \n     and a list of other oil seeds.) Higher commodity prices \n     would result in lower costs of farm price-support and \n     income-support programs administered by the Agriculture \n     Department. CBO estimates these changes in the demand for \n     soybeans and other grains would reduce federal spending by \n     $308 million over the 2002-2002 period.\n       Use of Credits for Federal Payments by TVA and Rural \n     Electric Cooperatives. The bill would establish tax credits \n     for electric power producers using certain coal and renewable \n     technologies. Although exempt from taxation, TVA and rural \n     electric cooperatives would be eligible to take such credits \n     in the form of cash-equivalent credits that could be used to \n     repay amounts they owe to the Treasury. We estimate that the \n     provisions would cost $20 million in 2002 and $110 million \n     over the 2002-2012 period.\n       CBO expects that TVA will make significant investments in \n     pollution control and clean coal technologies over the next \n     10 years and thus would be eligible for the cash-equivalent \n     credits authorized by the bill. TVA could use such credits to \n     reduce its payments to the Treasury for past appropriations. \n     TVA could then pass such savings on to its customers by \n     lowering the price it charges for electricity. We estimate \n     that this price adjustment would reduce TVA's power revenues \n     by an average of $10 million a year beginning in 2004, when \n     we expect the agency would revise its rates. Hence, CBO \n     estimates that this provision would cost a total of about $90 \n     million over the 2002-2012 period.\n       Rural electric cooperatives would be eligible for both the \n     clean coal technology and renewable energy tax credits \n     offered under the bill. Based on information from industry \n     analysts, CBO expects that rural electric cooperatives would \n     make investments in technologies that would qualify for such \n     credits over the next several years. The bill would allow the \n     credits to be sold or traded to certain other taxable \n     entities, or used to prepay loans held by the federal \n     spending. For this estimate, we assume that around 15 percent \n     of eligible cooperatives would prepay their federal loans \n     with the Rural Utilities Service, rather than trade the \n     credits.\n       The authority provided by the bill to prepay federal loans \n     with non-cash credits would be considered a loan \n     modification. Under the Credit Reform Act, the cost of a loan \n     modification is the change in the subsidy cost of the cost of \n     this provision would be about $20 million and would be \n     recorded in 2002, when the modification would be authorized.\n\n                   Spending Subject to Appropriation\n\n       The bill would require the General Accounting Office and \n     the Department of the Treasury to provide annual reports on \n     energy tax incentives. Based on information from these \n     agencies, CBO expects that preparing the reports would cost \n     less than $500,000 per year, assuming appropriation of the \n     necessary amounts.\n\n\n                      PAY-AS-YOU-GO CONSIDERATIONS\n\n       The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act sets \n     up pay-as-you-go procedures for legislation affecting direct \n     spending or receipts. The net changes in outlays and \n     governmental receipts that are subject to pay-as-you-go \n     procedures are shown in the following table. For the purposes \n     of enforcing those procedures, only the effects through 2006 \n     are counted.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                          By Fiscal Year, in Millions of Dollars\n                                ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                    2002       2003       2004       2005       2006       2007       2008       2009       2010       2011       2012\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChanges in outlays.............         20        -13        -12        -18        -23        -28        -29        -31        -22        -26        -16\nChanges in receipts............        -80       -312     -1,237     -2,259     -2,583     -1,869     -1,234     -1,181     -1,174     -1,214     -1,289\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                      PREVIOUS CBO COST ESTIMATES\n\n       This revised cost estimate supersedes the CBO cost estimate \n     for this bill prepared on February 27, 2002. Revenue \n     estimates have changed because Public Law 107-147, the Job \n     Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002, signed on March \n     9, 2002 extends certain tax credits that would also be \n     extended by S. 1979. In addition, CBO has increased the \n     estimate of revenue losses by about $448 million to account \n     for the impact on baseline projections of the reduction in \n     excise tax rates for biodiesel fuels.\n       The revised estimate also includes an estimate of direct \n     spending effects on TVA, loans issued by the Rural Utilities \n     Service to\n\n[[Page S2406]]\n\n     rural electric cooperatives, and crop subsidies provided by \n     the USDA. The effect of these changes would be to increase \n     direct spending by $20 million in 2002 and decrease direct \n     spending by about $200 million over the 2002-2012 period.\n\n\n              INTERGOVERNMENTAL AND PRIVATE-SECTOR IMPACT\n\n       CBO has determined that provisions of the bill requiring \n     the Secretary of the Treasury and the General Accounting \n     Office to report the results of certain studies contain no \n     intergovernmental mandates as defined in UMRA and would not \n     affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments. \n     JCT has determined that the remaining provisions of the bill \n     contain no intergovernmental mandates as defined in UMRA. The \n     bill contains no private-sector mandates as defined by UMRA.\n       Estimate prepared by: Revenues: Erin Whitaker (226-2720); \n     Federal Costs: Lisa Cash Driskill, and Dave Hull (226-2860); \n     Impact on State, Local, and Tribal Governments: Susan Sieg \n     Tompkins (225-3220); and Impact on the Private Sector: Paige \n     Piper/Bach (226-2940).\n       Estimate approved by: G.

Madam President, nearly 2,000 years ago, a ``poll'' \nwas taken on the road between Jericho and Jerusalem. We are told that \nonly one out of three was willing to turn from their personal pursuits \nto help someone who had been physically assaulted and left without \ncare. This story of the Good Samaritan is an ancient and familiar \nteaching. We must be the people today who will pause in our own \npursuits to help heal the wounds in our society.\n  April is Child Abuse Prevention Month. Today I want to challenge all \nof us to face this horrific national tragedy head on. We should never \nlose sight of the pressing needs of our most precious resource, our \nchildren. Across the nation, neglect and abuse figures reach 2.5 \nmillion. Not only has the reported number of abused and neglected \nchildren increased, but their problems are more severe and difficult to \ntreat. Abuse is not new, nor is it likely to go away, but I believe we \nare lowering the tolerance for this kind of behavior. Policy makers, \ncommunity leaders, educators and parents came together on April 1st in \nKansas City to demonstrate their commitment to the issue. These are the \ntypes of actions we need to help build strong families and eliminate \nthe circumstances leading to abuse.\n  As legislators, we are making significant strides in our crusade \nagainst abuse. I supported $82.6 million in continued funding of the \nChild Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act during the appropriations \nprocess. President Bush signed the appropriations bill into law on \nJanuary 10, 2002.\n  I was pleased to support the Promoting Safe and Stable Families \nAmendments Act that the President also recently signed into law. This \nbill reauthorizes and expands several programs designed to help \nchildren and families in high-risk situations. Specifically, the bill \nestablished grants for programs for mentoring children of prisoners, \nand amends the Foster Care Independent Living program to provide for \neducational and training vouchers for youths aging out of foster care. \nIt also extends adoption assistance eligibility and prevents states \nfrom opting out of criminal background checks for foster and adoptive \nparents.\n  In addition, I have cosponsored a bill, which would restore the \nSocial Services Block Grant (SSBG) funding. Missouri uses its Social \nServices Block Grant funds to provide aid to families sand children \nwith identified problems in the areas of child abuse and neglect, and \nservices to juvenile offenders committed to the custody of the State's \nDivision of Youth Services as well as other services to our most \nvulnerable citizens.

Madam President, as the Chairman of the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I am committed to focusing a spotlight on findings \nby researchers at the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA. For too long, \nVA researchers have labored with only the recognition of their peers to \nacknowledge the excellent caliber of VA research into the treatment of \na wide range of diseases.\n  A recent finding--the discovery of a drug that might help us fight \nsmallpox, the most feared weapon in bioterrorists' arsenal--offers real \nhope for protecting our Nation against the threat of bioterrorism. This \ndiscovery demonstrates again how integral VA's efforts are not only to \npublic health and research, but to domestic security.\n  VA's Medical Research Service may not support as many projects as the \nNIH, but its work has yielded effective treatments for diseases that \ninclude schizophrenia, diabetes, cancer, depression, heart disease and \nstroke. Some of my colleagues may know that VA's expertise in \nprosthetics and spinal cord injury research is unparalleled; fewer may \nbe aware that VA researchers pioneered the concepts that allowed \ndevelopment of the CAT scan and MRI, the cardiac pacemaker, and safe \nkidney and liver transplants. VA researchers have demonstrated the best \nclinical practices for detecting high cholesterol and colon cancer, \nlaunched a large-scale study to determine the best way to treat HIV \ninfection, and started a landmark clinical trial to treat Parkinson's \ndisease.\n  In March, VA researchers announced another breakthrough finding. Two \nVA researchers, Dr. Karl Hostetler and Dr. James Beadle of the VA San \nDiego Healthcare System, worked with military and academic colleagues \nto develop a drug that could be the best tool we have yet to protect \nthe public from the threat of smallpox.\n  Until recently, only vaccination could be used to stop the spread of \na smallpox epidemic. Because doctors eradicated naturally occurring \nsmallpox in the 1960's, the smallpox vaccine has been neither \nmanufactured nor used regularly in decades, leaving the American \npopulation vulnerable to a deliberate attack by terrorists. Although \nHHS recently accelerated and expanded a plan to vaccinate the U.S. \npopulation, the vaccine doses will not be ready for some time, and are \nnot without risk of potentially serious side-effects.\n  Although researchers proved several years ago that an existing drug \ncalled cidofovir could prevent smallpox from multiplying and spreading, \nthis drug had to be administered intravenously, over the course of at \nleast an hour. In the case of an epidemic, it would simply be \nimpossible to treat every person at risk.\n  Drs. Hostetler and Beadle and their colleagues developed a powerful \nform of this drug that can be taken as a pill or a capsule. Although \nthis research is still in its early stages, VA and military scientists \nshowed that a few oral doses of this drug each day protected animals \ncompletely against a virus closely related to smallpox. In the near \nfuture, we may be able to contain any potential outbreak of smallpox \nusing this simple medication, rendering smallpox useless as a \nbiological weapon.\n  This research promises to bear fruit not only for emergency medical \npreparedness, but for those who must take cidofovir to treat more \ncommon but still devastating viral infections.\n  This work grew from a collaboration between VA, military, NIH, and \nacademic researchers. As I have said many times, we cannot in these \ntimes neglect any resource available to us when confronting potentially \ncatastrophic threats to this nation's health, whether in offering \nmedical care or developing\n\n[[Page S2407]]\n\nnew technologies and treatments to protect the public.\n  I am proud to recognize the insight that these researchers and VA \nhave shown, and continue to show, in exploring cutting-edge research. \nThis is yet another contribution that the VA health care system has \nmade, not only to the health of our nation's veterans, but to our \nnational safety and well-being.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/09/senate-section/article/S2407-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONFIRMATION OF MELANIE SABELHAUS\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I speak today to congratulate Melanie \nSabelhaus, who was confirmed by the Senate last evening as the Deputy \nAdministrator for the U.S. Small Business Administration.\n  The U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship held \na hearing on Mrs. Sabelhaus' nomination on February 27, 2002. On March \n12, 2002, the Committee voted unanimously in support of her nomination \nand recommended her favorably to the full Senate, which approved her \nnomination by unanimous consent on April 8, 2002. I would like to thank \nthe Senate floor staffs for their assistance in moving Mrs. Sabelhaus' \nnomination so quickly.\n  Mrs. Sabelhaus has had an excellent career that has provided her with \nboth the necessary management and small business experience required of \na Deputy Administrator at the SBA. Having chaired her nomination \nhearing and known her from her volunteer work with the Nantucket \nHistorical Association, I can report that President Bush has made a \nqualified choice in selecting Mrs. Sabelhaus for the critical post of \nDeputy Administrator at the U.S. Small Business Administration.\n  I believe calling this position critical in no way overemphasizes its \nimportance, for the Deputy Administrator has historically served as the \nday-to-day manager of the SBA in the Administrator's absence. In fact, \nthe Deputy Administrator position was made subject to Senate \nconfirmation a little over ten years ago, with the passage of the Small \nBusiness Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 1990, precisely because \nthe Congress recognized its importance to the management of the Agency. \nDuring the nomination process, the Committee received assurances from \nMrs. Sabelhaus and Administrator Barreto that one or both would be on \nhand to run the SBA on a daily basis, barring extraordinary \ncircumstances.\n  The SBA's role is vital to our continuing economic well-being, \nespecially now as we seek to improve our economy. Loan programs, \ntechnical assistance programs and contracting programs are just a few \nof the tools the SBA has to help small businesses--and a small sample \nof the issues Mrs. Sabelhaus will face on a daily basis as she seeks to \naid the Administrator in implementing the President's policies and \ncongressional initiatives. It is my hope that as a former small \nbusiness owner and innovative thinker Mrs. Sabelhaus will steer the \nagency toward our bipartisan goal: to cultivate the entrepreneurial \nspirit of this country and provide all--including women and minorities \nin the small business world with adequate and equal access to capital \nand opportunities and the resources and counseling that often determine \na business's success or failure.\n  I look forward to working with Mrs. Sabelhaus, the new Deputy \nAdministrator for the U.S. Small Business Administration, as we seek to \nassist the small business community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/09/senate-section/article/S2407-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     IN CELEBRATION OF THE CITY OF SANTA CLARA'S 150TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize the 150th Anniversary of the City of Santa \nClara in my home state of California.\n  As early as 4000 BC, Ohlone Indian settlements were found in the \narea. The City of Santa Clara began in 1852 as a small Spanish mission. \nAfter Santa Clara was incorporated as a city, the fertile valley became \na magnet for farmers and Santa Clara was soon filled with bountiful \norchards and farms. Today, Santa Clara is located in the heart of \nCalifornia's Silicon Valley, the technology capital of the world. From \nIndian settlement to Spanish mission, from orchard country to high tech \nmecca, Santa Clara has been part of the rich history of California.\n  Last year, the National Civic League bestowed the prestigious ``All-\nAmerica City'' award on Santa Clara. Santa Clara was one of only 10 \ncities in the U.S. to be given this award for successful community \ncollaboration. Santa Clara has also recently been given top marks as a \n``2001 Kid-Friendly City.'' I am delighted that Santa Clara is such an \noutstanding place for children and families. And Santa Clara's Code of \nEthics and Values has been getting national attention as a model for \nusing shared values to guide a city.\n  While Santa Clara receives national attention, a 2000 public opinion \nsurvey found that the residents of Santa Clara feel their city is one \nof the best places in America to live. This local pride is one of the \nthings that makes this city such a California treasure.\n  Santa Clara is home to California's first school of higher learning, \nSanta Clara University, established in 1851. At the center of campus is \nthe beautiful Mission Santa Clara de Asis, the eighth of the original \n21 California missions.\n  I am thrilled that the City of Santa Clara, its local government and \nits residents maintain such a strong community spirit while its high-\ntech companies provide new products to change the way we live. Santa \nClara's sesquicentennial slogan, ``150 years of democracy, diversity, \ndistinction,'' could not be more appropriate. I hope the people of \nSanta Clara enjoy this yearlong celebration and I wish them another 150 \nyears of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/09/senate-section/article/S2407-3", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2407-S2408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR EMPLOYER SUPPORT OF \n                         THE GUARD AND RESERVE\n\n Mr. BOND. Madam President, today I wish to congratulate the \nNational Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve, ESGR, \nits 4,200 volunteers and Department of Defense, DOD, staff, in \ncelebrating 30 years of service to this Nation.\n  The National Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve \nwas established in 1972, the year the United States ended the Selective \nService System and established an all-volunteer military force. DOD \nrealized that support from employers and communities would be \ninstrumental in maintaining Reserve component membership. ESGR was \ncreated to obtain employer and community support for the National Guard \nand Reserve and to promote the role of Reserve forces in the national \ndefense.\n  ESGR has lived up to the task and accomplished much more. Since 1972, \nwith the help of the Advertising Council, Inc., ESGR has benefitted \nfrom nearly $1 billion in pro bono advertising reaching the six million \nemployers with one or more employees in the United States.\n  Employers have, in turn, signed ESGR Statements of Support, publicly \ncommitting to support the National Guard and Reserve. The former \nChairman of the Board and CEO of General Motors, Mr. James H. Roche \nsigned the first Statement of Support in the Office of the Secretary of \nDefense on December 13, 1972. The next day, President Richard Nixon \nsigned a Statement of Support covering all Federal civilian employees. \nSince the inception of this program, Presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan, \nBush, Clinton and President George W. Bush have all signed Statements \nof Support, along with hundreds of thousands of employers, including \nDell Computer Corporation, Xerox, the Society for Human Resource \nManagement and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. To date, over 300,000 \nemployers have signed statements of support. Additionally, the \nstrategic alliance formed in 1998 between ESGR and the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce resulted in more than 1,200 chambers of commerce nationwide \nsigning a Statement of Support for the Guard and Reserve.\n  ESGR offers Ombudsman services designed to provide information to \nemployers and Reservists regarding their rights and responsibilities \nunder the law, and to resolve conflicts through informal mediation. \nThese services operate in cooperation with the Department of Labor. \nESGR volunteers in 54 U.S. States and territories contribute\n\n[[Page S2408]]\n\nthousands of hours of effort representing millions of dollars of \nvolunteer service in support of ESGR programs, its services, and the \nmen and women of our nation's Reserve forces.\n  The National Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve \nis smart government in action. The small ESGR staff in Arlington, VA \nunder the direction of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve \nAffairs provides guidance and support to a network of 4,200 volunteer \nbusiness, civic, and community leaders.\n  ESGR educates employers on their rights and obligations under the law \nand recognize employers who actively support employee participation in \nthe Guard and Reserve. ESGR also educates members of the National Guard \nand Reserve in regards to their rights and responsibilities to the \nvalue of their employers support. Committees can be found in all 50 \nStates, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and \nGuam.\n  With the end of the cold war, the Reserve components have been called \nwith increasing frequency. During the Gulf War in 1990-1991, more than \n250,000 Reserve component members were called to active duty to support \nmilitary operations in the Persian Gulf. Since the start of Operation \nNoble Eagle and Enduring Freedom, more than 80,000 National Guard and \nReserve troops have been activated and are playing a critical role.\n  Thousands of employers, local and State government officials, Active \nand Reserve component leaders, and military members from across the \nNation and around the world request ESGR's employer support expertise \non a daily basis. When Guardsmen and Reservists return home following \nmobilization, ESGR committee members are there to provide information \nand support services to those in need.\n  The U.S. Congress passed the Uniformed Services Employment and \nReemployment Rights Act, USERRA, of 1994, and updated it in 1996. This \nlaw completely revised the Veterans Reemployment Rights Act of 1940. \nUSERRA articulates the rights and responsibilities of Guard and Reserve \nmembers with regard to job protection and explains employer rights \nunder Federal law. ESGR helps employers and Reservists understand this \nlaw and helps them informally resolve any employment conflicts that may \narise.\n  Again, I want to congratulate ESGR and its 54 ESGR committees on \ntheir 30 years of service and commend this network of over 4,200 \nvolunteer patriots for their time and talent. They are serving their \ncountry and maintaining the much needed support of our employers and \ncommunities for the Guard and Reserve. Through the efforts of agencies \nlike ESGR, we can call on our Reserve forces to answer the Nation's \ncall without the fear of job loss.\n  Thank you Madam President, and thank you ESGR.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/09/senate-section/article/S2408-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       WE THE PEOPLE COMPETITION\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS.

Right now \nthe students are conducting research and preparing for the contest, \nwhich will test their knowledge of the Constitution and the Bill of \nRights against 1,200 students from across the country. They have earned \nthe trip by showing they were the best of the best in a statewide \ncontest in February.\n  Obviously, I hope my fellow South Carolinians win it all, but \nwhatever happens, we are all winners in this country.

Charbonneau has been \nnamed the Greater Hudson Chamber of Commerce Citizen of the Year for \nher outstanding devotion and positive influence to the community.\n  I commend her active role in both the local and State governments. By \nserving as Town Selectman, and as Selectmen's Representative to the \nplanning Board, Charbonneau has been able to serve her community in \nmany capacities. Aside from these positions, she currently serves as a \nmember of the Board for the Salvation Army as well as the Advisory \nBoard to the Community Council. Even more eager to serve the community \nof Hudson, she also works as a representative on the State level, \nserving on the Hillsborough County Board of Commissioners and the New \nHampshire Finance Authority.\n  Aside from serving in advisory capacities for numerous organizations \nand boards, Charbonneau has worked hard to improve the Lion's Hall. \nUnder her request, the Department of Corrections sent a community \nservice group to paint and do repairs, leaving the Lion's Hall with a \nfresh face. Because of her creative thinking, other departments came \ntogether to make considerable improvements to the facility.\n  Rhona Charbonneau has set a positive example for not only the \ncommunity of Hudson, but for the entire Granite State. By consistently \nworking to improve her community she has shown a tremendous dedication \nto the community in which she and her family have lived for more than \n50 years. She has brought high profile political figures to the town, \nwhereby she allowed a forum for candidates to share their beliefs as \nwell as bringing the spotlight to the ever growing town of Hudson. I \napplaud her commitment and congratulate her on being named this year's \nCitizen of the Year.

The Pettee Medal represents a \nrare devotion of service as was expressed by the life commitment and \nservice of Dean Pettee.\n  I applaud the contributions that Dr. Lietzel has made to the \nUniversity of New Hampshire since her appointment in 1996 as the \nPresident of the university. Since her arrival, Lietzel has worked \ntirelessly to raise the level of excellence in academic programs as \nwell as the day to day operation of the university. During her tenure, \nLietzel has successfully run the most aggressive capital campaign in \nthe history of the university, as well as implementing new financial \nand fiscal management policies. Her vision and commitment have taken \nthe university's academic standard to a higher level, as well as \nsuccessfully increasing the amount of research funding the university \nreceives.\n  Previous to her stay at UNH, Dr. Lietzel served as the Senior Vice-\nChancellor for Academic Affairs at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, \nwhere she was an accomplished educator and worked to improve the \nprogram and budget planning. Dr. Lietzel also served as a professor at \nOhio State University, in the Department of Mathematics.\n  On behalf of the citizens of New Hampshire, I would like to thank Dr. \nJoan Lietzel for her endless dedication to academic excellence. She has \nset a positive example for educators across the Granite State, as well \nas the Nation. My congratulations to Dr. Lietzel as she accepts this \nyear's Pettee Medal for her distinguished service in the State of New \nHampshire. It is truly an honor to represent her in the U.S. \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/09/senate-section/article/S2409-3", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        EULOGY FOR LORAL JOHNSON\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, while I was home in \nNebraska, a great Nebraska citizen passed away. Loral Johnson was a \nnewspaper publisher in southwestern Nebraska and a pillar of his \ncommunity.\n  He began working in the newspaper business at age 9 as a ``printer's \ndevil.'' He started at the Imperial Republican newspaper as a linotype \noperator following graduation from high school in 1952. He purchased \nthe paper with his wife, Elna, in 1968.\n  Loral Johnson was well respected and known by his colleagues as an \ninnovative newspaperman. Johnson's editorial pages were often positive \nand progressive, calling on community members to move forward and \nalways striving to make Imperial a better place for current and future \ngenerations. He was inducted into the Nebraska Journalism Hall of Fame \nand was named a master-editor publisher, the highest award of the \nNebraska Press Association. Johnson's Imperial Republican was also \namong the first weekly papers to print on an offset press and to use \ncomputers.\n  However, Loral Johnson will be remembered as far more than just a \nnewspaper publisher. He was also a key leader in his community and his \nchurch. He was a member of the school board for 28 years, a co-founder \nand board member of the local nursing home for 33 years, and secretary \nfor the Imperial Planning Commission for 21 years. His important \ncontributions to education and health care will be remembered for many \nyears to come.\n  While we will miss Loral Johnson greatly, it is comforting to know \nthat his two daughters and a son-in-law are continuing the tradition of \nexcellent journalism in Imperial. His family and the devotion to \ncommunity that he has passed on to them and so many others are his \ngreatest legacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/09/senate-section/article/S2409-4", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2409-S2410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO RAY BURKE\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I rise today to congratulate \nand thank Ray Burke of Berlin, Vermont, for over 30 years of service as \nVermont's highway dispatcher. Ray retires at the end of this month from \nthe Vermont Agency of Transportation and he will be missed heartily.\n  Humorist Kin Hubbard once said, ``Don't knock the weather; nine-\ntenths of the people couldn't start a conversation if it didn't change \nonce in a while.'' I suppose then that the art of conversation is \neasiest for Vermonters, especially during the winter months. For most \nof us, that conversation often turns into complaining futilely about \nthe weather, except, of course, when Ray was talking. And Ray, as \ndispatcher, is known for his talking.\n  For 32 years, Vermonters have relied on Ray's constant updates and \ninformation on which roads were being treated with salt and sand, which\n\n[[Page S2410]]\n\nroutes we should avoid altogether, and how serious driving conditions \nwere or were likely to become. And, of course, most importantly, Ray \nalways reminded us to drive safely. Snow and ice can be unpredictable \nand dangerous at their worst; Ray, at his best and always on the job, \nkept Vermonters' safety as his top priority.\n  Heavy snowfalls, black ice, sleet, and freezing rain made Ray's work \nimportant and difficult. More challenging than Vermont's natural \narsenal of inclement weather, however, was Ray's ability to always be \nthere when we needed him. This is extraordinary because Ray has a \ndisease that has slowly taken away his sight, although it has never \ndisrupted his sense of service to Vermonters or his spirit.\n  Ray has never stopped. His disability has never beaten him; his \ndisability has never even slowed him. Aside from dispatching trucks and \nplows to deal with winter weather, Ray plays the saxophone in his band, \nStretch and the Limits, along with drummer Conrad ``Stretch'' \nNormandeau and keyboardist Jim Thompson.\n  I would like to close with a personal message to Ray. You will be \nmissed dearly by every Vermonter who listened to you update conditions \non the news, by the plow drivers who relied on your information, and by \neveryone who has learned to live with Vermont's weather with the help \nof your advice and forecasts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/09/senate-section/article/S2410-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/09/senate-section/article/S2410-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/09/senate-section/article/S2410-3", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT DETAILING THE PROGRESS OF SPENDING BY THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH \n  DURING THE LAST TWO QUARTERS OF FISCAL YEAR 2001 IN SUPPORT OF PLAN \n                            COLOMBIA--PM 79\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to section 3204(e), of Public Law 106-246, I am providing a \nreport prepared by my Administration detailing the progress of spending \nby the executive branch during the last two quarters of Fiscal Year \n2001 in support of Plan Colombia.\n                                                         George Bush.  \nThe White House, April 9, 2002.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/09/senate-section/article/S2410-4", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT PREPARED BY THE NATIONAL SCIENCE BOARD ENTITLED ``SCIENCE AND \n                 ENGINEERING INDICATORS--2002''--PM 80\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by 42 U.S.C. 1863(j)(1), I am pleased to submit to the \nCongress a report prepared by the National Science Board entitled, \n``Science and engineering Indicators--2002.''

A bill to facilitate the availability of electromagnetic \nspectrum for the deployment of wireless based services in rural areas, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Rural \nSpectrum Access Act, RESA, of 2002. Wireless communications is \nrevolutionizing the way we communicate. It allows us to place calls \nfrom anywhere in the world to anywhere in the world. We can check our \nfavorite websites, and even stay in touch with family and friends \nthrough email, all without a phone line. It's empowering to know that \nwe can do all this and more while sitting on top of a mountain in \nMontana.\n  However, these services require spectrum, the wireless waves that \ngive us this freedom. Due to the way the FCC distributes spectrum, \nrural America is finding it more and more difficult to get quality \nwireless service. The current system distributes spectrum on very large \ngeographic areas, which in effect, inhibits certain carriers from \nparticipating in wireless auctions. Since the geographic licensing \nareas are so large and the price for the spectrum is equally as large, \nrural carriers often find it difficult bidding on the spectrum. My \nlegislation will correct this inequity.\n  RESA requires the Federal Communications Commission, in future \nauctions, to distribute spectrum on smaller geographic levels. It does \nnot favor one type of carrier over another, or pick which carrier can \nserve which areas. Rather, it simply allows carriers to bid on spectrum \nthat they find difficult under today's system.\n  It is my hope that this bill will allow more of our rural \ntelecommunication carriers to participate in future auctions. The RESA \nAct will bring more choices, better service and lower prices for those \nof us living in rural America.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN:\n  S. 2076. A bill to prohibit the cloning of humans; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, the Senate will soon start debating the \nissue of human cloning. I want to state unequivocally that I am against \nthe cloning of a human being. The cloning of a human being raises \nserious moral and ethical questions about society's perception of human \nlife.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation that prohibits the cloning of a \nhuman being. It is a simple bill, but it reflects my view and a view \nthat is held by almost everyone. My bill reflects the common ground \nthat we can all agree to in this debate. My legislation makes it \nillegal to clone a human being and imposes strict penalties against \nanyone who violates this prohibition.\n  I urge my colleagues to support a ban on the cloning of a human \nbeing, and encourage their cosponsorship of my legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS:\n  S. 2077. A bill to make grants to improve public safety in order to \nprepare for and respond to terrorist threats; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, today I am introducing the Securing Our \nStates Act. As the tragic terrorist attacks of September 11 taught us \nall too well, our Nation is not as prepared for widespread emergencies \nas it should be. The legislation I am introducing today, Securing Our \nStates Act, or SOS Act, will help make our Nation more secure by \nstrengthening our first line of defense, the first responders in our \nStates and communities.\n  As the Presiding Officer is well aware, when a terrorist attack or \nother disaster occurs, it is the State and local police, firefighters, \nand emergency medical personnel who are first on the scene. Nearly 2 \nmillion State and local police, firefighters, emergency medical \npersonnel, and others are closest to these challenges. They understand \nbest what is needed to respond effectively, and they tell me they need \nimproved training, more and better equipment, greater coordination, and \nmore exercises. They need them as soon as possible. They are the ones \nwho are always on the front lines when disaster strikes.\n  Properly trained and equipped, first responders have the greatest \npotential to save lives and limit casualties after a terrorist attack. \nCurrently, however, our capabilities for responding to a terrorist \nattack vary widely from community to community, State to State, across \nthis great country. Many areas simply have very little capacity to \nrespond to a terrorist attack. In fact, most localities could not \nrespond effectively to a terrorist attack if weapons of mass \ndestruction were used. Even the best prepared States and communities do \nnot possess adequate resources to respond to the full range of possible \nterrorist attacks.\n  This legislation I am introducing will help by providing much needed \nresources. The SOS Act, which is consistent with the first responders \nproposal in President Bush's budget, will provide $4 billion in \ncritically needed funding, an increase of more than 1,000 percent in \nFederal resources that will flow to State and local governments.\n\n[[Page S2415]]\n\n  This bill is designed to accomplish the following objectives: First, \nmore resources to States and communities to conduct important planning \nand exercises, purchase equipment, and better train their personnel.\n  Second, it would provide flexibility for States and localities to \naddress whatever the needs of their particular locality may be. States \ndiffer in their preparedness, and this would allow flexibility in the \nuse of funds.\n  Third, another important feature of this bill is its simplicity. We \nneed to speed the disbursement of Federal funds to States and \ncommunities without further delay.\n  Fourth, this legislation is designed to promote cooperation across \nthe Nation so local, State, Federal, and volunteer networks can operate \ntogether effectively.\n  To achieve these objectives, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, \nknown as FEMA, will implement a streamlined and simple procedure \ndesigned to speed the flow of resources to States and communities. The \nfunds may be used for a variety of activities, including planning to \ndevelop comprehensive plans to prepare for and respond to a terrorist \nattack; equipment to respond more effectively to terrorist attack, \nincluding personal protective equipment, chemical, and biological \ndetectors and interoperable communications gear.\n  We want to make sure our emergency personnel can communicate with one \nanother. We have learned from the lessons of September 11 that can be a \ndevastating problem.\n  The legislation would also allow funds to be used for more training \nto enable firefighters, police officers, and emergency medical \nprofessionals to respond and operate in a chemical or biological \nenvironment, even a very dangerous environment.\n  We need to have more exercises to improve response capabilities, \npractice mutual aid and assess operational improvements and \ndeficiencies.\n  The legislation I am introducing will help make our Nation safer. \nNearly 2 million first responders are always there, willing to put \ntheir lives at risk to save the lives of others and to make our country \nsafer. This bill will help these brave men and women do their jobs \nbetter and will help all of our communities be more secure. The \nbenefits of the Securing Our States Act are immediate and widespread \nand the goal is one we can all embrace, the goal of making our Nation \nsafer from terrorist attacks while also bolstering everyday response \ncapabilities.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. McCain, Mr. \n        Feingold, and Mr. Levin):\n  S. 2078. A bill to amend section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986 to eliminate notification and return requirements for State and \nlocal political committees and candidate committees and avoid duplicate \nreporting by certain State and local political committees of \ninformation required to be reported and made publicly available under \nState law, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, today I am pleased to again be \noffering legislation that will solve a significant issue for State and \nlocal legislators and candidates across the country and which I know is \nof serious concern.\n  Two years ago, Congress enacted the Full and Fair Political \nActivities Disclosure Act of 2000, Public Law 106-230, a law that \nimposed new IRS reporting requirements on political organizations \nclaiming tax-exempt status under Section 527 of the Internal Revenue \nCode. The purpose of this law was to uncover so-called ``stealth \nPACs,'' tax-exempt groups which, prior to the enactment of this law, \ndid not have to disclose any contributions or expenditures and were \nfree to influence elections in virtual anonymity. While Public Law 106-\n230 was intended to target ``stealth PACs,'' it has had the unintended \nconsequence of imposing burdensome and duplicative reporting \nrequirements on State and local candidates who are not involved in any \nfederal election activities. In many States like Texas, state and local \ncandidates already file detailed reports with their state election \nofficials.\n  To correct this problem, I have worked closely with Senator \nLieberman, among others, to develop legislation that would exempt state \nand local candidates from some of the IRS reporting requirements of \nPublic Law 106-230. We have done this in a way that solves the problem \nbut without creating new loopholes that would allow ``stealth'' \norganizations to reemerge. This legislation is the product of \nbipartisan and I would like to thank those who have supported our \nefforts, including Senator McCain, Senator Feingold, and Senator Levin \nwho join me and Senator Lieberman on this bill today. I originally \noffered legislation on this issue last year and it was included in the \ntax cut bill, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of \n2001. Unfortunately, our provision was dropped from the bill in \nconference.\n  Since then, P.L. 106-230 has created an increasingly heavy burden on \nlocal and State candidates. This is exacerbated by the fact that many \ncandidates were not aware of the notification requirements and could \nnow face severe penalties. It is time to take action and get this issue \nresolved. The bill we introduce today solves this problem while also \naddressing some issues that have been raised since we first made this \neffort last year. The deadline for the most burdensome reporting \nrequirements is fast approaching in May. Congress has delayed too long. \nI again urge my colleagues to support this bill and to solve the \nproblem that we created and to do so now.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKFELLER:\n  S. 2079. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to facilitate \nand enhance judicial review of certain matters regarding veterans' \nbenefits, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I am today introducing legislation \nwhich responds to concerns relating to judicial review of VA benefits \nexpressed by the authors of the Independent Budget for Veteran's \nPrograms for fiscal year 2003. I am doing this in order to provide a \nvehicle for further discussion on these and related matters.\n  The Independent Budget, the IB, is the collaborative effort of a \ncoalition of four veterans service organizations, AMVETS, Disabled \nAmerican Veterans, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and Veterans of \nForeign Wars, which is endorsed by dozens of other veterans' groups and \nothers. This is the sixteenth year that the these organizations have \ndrafted an independent budget to advocate for the funding that they \nfeel is necessary to properly provide care and benefits to our \nveterans.\n  This bill proposes three amendments to title 38, United States Code, \nand a free-standing provision relating to the Equal Access to Justice \nAct. Section 1 of this legislation would amend section 502 of title 38 \nto allow the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, \nthe Federal Circuit, to review and set aside VA changes to the schedule \nfor rating disabilities found to be arbitrary and capricious or in \nviolation of statute. Section 2 would amend section 7261 of title 38 to \nspecify that the United States Court of Appeals for Veteran Claims, the \nCAVC, shall apply a preponderance of the evidence standard when \nreviewing findings of fact made by the Board of Veterans Appeals. \nSection 3 would amend section 7292 of title 38 to permit the Federal \nCircuit to review CAVC decisions on questions of law. The final section \nof this legislation would allow the CAVC, when awarding attorneys fees \nunder the Equal Access to Justice Act to award compensation to \nqualified non-attorney representatives before the CAVC.\n  Current section 502 of title 38, provides for judicial review of VA \nrules and regulations in the Federal Circuit, but expressly precludes \nreview of VA actions relating to the adoption or revision of the so \ncalled ``rating schedule'' made pursuant to section 1155 of title 38. \nThis rating schedule is the system by which VA categorizes types and \nlevels of disability by percentages and, as noted by the IB authors, \nthis preclusion of review was based on the view that VA has specific \nexpertise in this area, an expertise not found in most courts. However, \nwhile the IB authors recognize the importance of VA's particularly \ninformed judgment in this\n\n[[Page S2416]]\n\narea, they are concerned that, ``without any constraints or oversight \nwhatsoever, VA is free to promulgate rules to rating disabilities that \ndo not have as their basis reduction in earning capacity.'' To remedy \nthis concern, the authors of the IB propose an amendment to section 502 \nof title 38 which would authorize Federal Circuit review of rating \nschedule decisions. This is the intent of section 1 of this bill.\n  A second concern of the authors of the IB relates to the scope of \nreview applied by the CAVC to factual determinations of the Board of \nVeterans' Appeal. Under current law, section 5107(b) of title 38, VA is \nrequired to give a claimant the benefit of the doubt when ``there is an \napproximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the \nmerits'' of an issue material to the claim. However, as noted in the IB \nfor fiscal year 2003, the CAVC, in reviewing a VA decision on a factual \nissue, is required to apply a ``clearly erroneous'' standard. Under \nthis standard, which is the same as applied by Federal appellate courts \nin their review of factual determinations of trial courts, if there is \na plausible basis for a factual finding, it can not be clearly \nerroneous. This results in the CAVC having to accord significant \ndeference to findings of fact made by the Board. As the IB authors \nnote, this approach of requiring the CAVC to uphold a Board decision \nbased on only the lower ``plausible basis'' undermines the statutory \n``benefit of the doubt'' rule. Section 2 of this legislation would \nprotect the ``benefit of the doubt'' rule by amending section 7261 of \ntitle 38 to specify that the CAVC is to apply a preponderance of the \nevidence standard when reviewing factual determinations of the Board.\n  Another concern of the IB authors is the present limit on Federal \nCircuit's authority to review CAVC precedential decisions on questions \nof law. Under section 7292 of title 38, the Federal Circuit is \nauthorized to review CAVC findings on questions of statutory or \nregulatory interpretation, but is not authorized to review such \ndecisions based on questions of law not rooted on a constitutional, \nstatutory, or regulatory interpretation. In a 1992 case, Livingston v. \nDerwinski, 959 F.2d 224, the Federal Circuit has described this \nlimitation as follows: ``The interpretation of the board's decision is \nunquestionably a matter of law, but that is not enough to bring the \nappeal within this court's statutory jurisdiction. In the absence of a \nchallenge to the validity of a statute or a regulation, or the \ninterpretation of a constitutional or statutory provision or a \nregulation, we have no authority to consider the appeal.'' The IB \nauthors express the concern that this ``unavailability of Federal \nCircuit review, has, in many instances, undesirable consequences'' and \nurge that the law be amended to give the Federal Circuit jurisdiction \nto review all CAVC decisions on questions of law. Section 3 would \nmodify section 7292 of title 38 to accomplish that result.\n  A final issue raised by the authors of the Independent Budget is not \none of procedural fairness, but rather of equality of access to the \nadministrative and judicial structures of the veterans' appeals \nprocess. Currently, veterans who enlist the aid of attorneys, and non-\nattorney practitioners supervised by attorneys, who are successful in \ntheir claims and satisfy the other requirements, can avail themselves \nof the benefits of the Equal Access to Justice Act, the EAJA. The EAJA \nshifts the burden of attorney fees from the citizen to the government \nin cases where the citizen successfully challenges an unreasonable \ngovernment action. In the case of VA claims, however, claimants often \nturn to qualified, non-attorney representatives of the many veterans \nservice organizations to represent them, up to and through the CAVC. \nBased upon the prior long standing limitation on paying attorney fees \nin veterans' benefits cases, there had not been an active veterans' \nbar. As a result, veterans service organizations developed expertise to \nenable them to effectively represent claimants before VA. VA does not \nrequire that these representatives be attorneys, only credentialed by a \nVA-recognized veterans service organization. Therefore, when the court \nwas created, certain non-attorney practitioners were allowed to \nrepresent appellants at the court. However, as currently interpreted, \nthese non-attorney practitioners are not eligible to receive \ncompensation under the EAJA, despite the fact that they are doing the \nsame work as their attorney counterparts. The authors of the \nIndependent Budget, representatives of the organizations which are \naffected by this limitation, ask that unsupervised, non-attorneys be \ngiven access to fee compensation under the EAJA. They believe that this \nchange would allow veterans organizations to represent even more \nveterans. Section 4 of the bill would provide for this change.\n  As a new generation is called to sacrifice in service of our country \nit is imperative that we ensure the fairness and accessibility of the \nbenefits that they so richly deserve and it is for this reason that I \nintroduce this bill. As I noted earlier in my statement, I am doing so \nin order to provide a vehicle for detailed discussion of these and \nother issues related to the judicial review of VA claims. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues on these matters in the months \nahead.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 2080. A bill to designate a United States courthouse to be \nconstructed in Fresno, California, as the ``Robert E. Coyle United \nStates Courthouse''; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I am pleased to introduce legislation to \nname the Federal courthouse building to be constructed at Tulare and \n``O'' Streets in downtown Fresno, CA the ``Robert E. Coyle United \nStates Courthouse.''\n  It is fitting that the Federal courthouse in Fresno be named for \nSenior U.S. District Judge Robert E. Coyle, who is greatly respected \nand admired for his work as a judge and for his foresight and \npersistence which contributed so much to the Fresno Courthouse project. \nSince prior to 1994, Judge Coyle has been a leader in the effort to \nbuild a new courthouse in Fresno. In the course of his work, Judge \nCoyle, working with the Clerk of the United States District Court for \nthe Eastern District, conceived and founded a program called ``Managing \na Capitol Construction Program'' to help others understand the process \nof having a courthouse built. This Eastern District program was so well \nreceived by national court administrators that it is now a nationwide \nprogram run by Judge Coyle. In addition to meeting the needs of the \ncourt for additional space, the courthouse project has become a key \nelement in the downtown revitalization of Fresno. Judge Coyle's \nefforts, and those in the community with whom he worked, produced a \nmajor milestone when the groundbreaking for the new courthouse took \nplace earlier this month.\n  Judge Coyle has had a distinguished career as an attorney and on the \nbench. Appointed to California's Eastern District bench by President \nRonald Reagan in 1982, Judge Coyle has served as a judge for the \nEastern District for 20 years, including 6 years as senior judge. Judge \nCoyle earned his law degree from University of California, Hastings \nCollege of the Law in 1956. He then worked for Fresno County as a \nDeputy District Attorney before going into private practice in 1958 \nwith McCormick, Barstow, Sheppard, Coyle & Wayte, where he remained \nuntil his appointment by President Reagan. He is very active in the \ncommunity and has served in many judicial leadership positions, \nincluding: Chair, Space and Security Committee; Chair, Conference of \nthe Chief District Judges of the Ninth Circuit; President of the Ninth \nCircuit District Judges Association; Member of the Board of Governors \nof the State Bar of California and President of the Fresno County Bar. \nMy hope is that, in addition to serving the people of the Eastern \nDistrict as a courthouse, this building will stand as a reminder to the \ncommunity and people of California of the dedicated work of Judge \nRobert E. Coyle.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (by request):\n  S.J. Res. 34. A joint resolution approving the site at Yucca \nMountain, Nevada, for the development of a repository for the disposal \nof high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel, pursuant to the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, yesterday, the Governor of the State \nof\n\n[[Page S2417]]\n\nNevada submitted to the Senate and to the House of Representatives a \nnotice of disapproval of the proposed nuclear waste repository at Yucca \nMountain, pursuant to section 116 of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. The \nnotice was duly referred in the Senate to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources under rule XXV of the Standing Rules of the Senate. \nUnder section 115 of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, it is my duty, as \nthe chairman of the committee to which the notice of disapproval was \nreferred, to introduce, by request, a resolution of repository siting \napproval not later than the first day of session following the day on \nwhich the Governor's notice of disapproval was submitted.\n  In accordance with the statutory requirement, I am today introducing \nthe resolution of repository siting approval. The text of the \nresolution is prescribed by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. The \nresolution will be referred to committee for a period of up to 60 days. \nUnder the terms of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, the Governor's notice \nof disapproval will stand, and the Department of Energy will be \nprohibited from applying for a license to develop a nuclear waste \nrepository at Yucca Mountain, unless both Houses of Congress pass the \nresolution of repository siting approval and it becomes law within 90 \ndays from yesterday.\n  This is an extraordinary process. The 97th Congress, which prescribed \nthis process for us to follow 20 years ago, did not do so lightly. The \nMembers of the 97th Congress only arrived at this procedure after \nconsiderable debate. Representative Morris K. Udall, who was the \nprincipal architect of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, explained the \nthinking of our predecessors. ``We are all agreed that the States ought \nto have a veto,'' Chairman Udall said. ``If you are going to put \nsomething as important, as a nuclear waste repository, in a State, then \nthe State, through its Governor or legislature, ought to be able to say \nno thanks.'' But, he continued, ``we are also agreed that once the \nState has made that veto, that there ought to be mechanism so that, in \nthe national interest, it could be overridden, as we do in war when we \nneed an air base or at other times when we need Federal eminent \ndomain.''\n  The process upon which we are embarking today was designed to serve \nthose two goals. It will afford the State of Nevada a fair hearing on \nits objections to the repository and will ensure that those objections \nstand unless the administration can persuade both Houses of Congress to \noverride them. At the same time, it will give the administration an \nopportunity to present its case and to override the State's objections \nif it can show its decision was sound and in the national interest.\n  It is my intention, once the Senate completes action on the energy \nbill, to schedule hearings before the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources to consider the President's recommendation of the Yucca \nMountain site and the objections of the State of Nevada to the use of \nthe site for the nuclear waste repository and to report the committee's \nrecommendation to the Senate within the prescribed 60-day period as the \n97th Congress envisioned.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/09/senate-section/article/S2417-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 232--CONGRATULATING THE HUSKIES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF \n  CONNECTICUT FOR WINNING THE 2002 NCAA DIVISION I WOMEN'S BASKETBALL \n                             CHAMPIONSHIP.\n\n  Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Lieberman) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate\n\n[[Page S2419]]\n\nproceed to S. Res. 233 submitted earlier today by Senators Sarbanes and \nMikulski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 233) congratulating the University of \n     Maryland Terrapins for winning the 2002 NCAA National \n     Basketball Championship.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, one of Aesops fables tells of the race \nbetween the tortoise and the hare. As the story goes, the hare took off \nat the start of the race at a very swift pace but soon tired, stopped \nand fell fast asleep. The tortoise, on the other hand, maintained a \nslow and steady pace and passed the sleeping hare en route to a \nvictory. The moral of the story is ``slow but steady wins the race.''\n  Such was the pace to the 2002 NCAA Basketball Championship for the \nUniversity of Maryland Terrapins. Following a Final Four appearance in \nlast year's NCAA Tournament, expectations were high for this year's \nteam. From the first tip-off last October during Midnight Madness to \nthe final buzzer of this year's championship game, the entire Terrapin \nteam, led by head coach and University of Maryland alumnus Gary \nWilliams, pursued a deliberate and determined course. Their journey \nculminated on the night of April 1, 2002, when the team won the NCAA \nMen's Division 1 Basketball Championship.\n  It is with a deep sense of Maryland pride and pleasure that I rise as \nthe chairman of the Maryland congressional delegation to submit a \nresolution congratulating the University of Maryland Terrapins for \nwinning the 2002 NCAA National Basketball Championship. My Maryland \ncolleague, Senator Barbara Mikulski, is joining me in this effort and \nthe Maryland House delegation, led by University of Maryland alum, \nSteny Hoyer, is also submitting a similar resolution.\n  As our resolution highlights, this has been a remarkable run for the \nmen's basketball team. The team won a school record 32 games. They went \nundefeated at home, including their impressive win over Duke University \nby a score of 97-73. This year was the last year that the team will \nplay in historic Cole Field House and the season was a fitting tribute \nto a building that has witnessed so many remarkable games over the \nyears. This year's team continued its home court dominance over non-\nconference opponents, extending its winning streak to 84 wins, the \ncurrent longest winning streak in the Nation.\n  Madam President, please join me in congratulating the Maryland \nTerrapin team members: senior guard Juan Dixon, the 2002 NCAA \nTournament's Most Outstanding Player, the ACC Player of the Year, a \nFirst-Team All-American, and a member of the ACC All-Defensive Team; \nsenior center Lonny Baxter, Most Valuable Player of the East Region, \nSecond Team All-ACC, honorable mention All-American, and a member of \nthe ACC All Defensive Team; senior forward Byron Mouton, Honorable \nMention All-ACC; senior guard Earl Badu; junior guard Steve Blake, \nnamed to the Third Team All-ACC, and Honorable Mention All-American; \njunior forward Tahj Holden; junior guard Drew Nicholas; junior center \nRyan Randle; junior guard Calvin McCall; sophomore forward Chris \nWilcox, named to the Third Team All-ACC; freshman guard Andre Collins; \nand freshman forward Mike Grinnon.\n  On behalf of the State of Maryland, the Maryland congressional \ndelegation and the University of Maryland, I ask my colleagues to join \nme in acknowledging the outstanding efforts of this amazing group of \nbasketball players, coaches and staff.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise to pay tribute to the nation's \npremier men's college basketball team, the University of Maryland \nTerrapins. I am so proud that our Terps are our national champions. \nTheir victory shows the hard work, perseverance and experience of an \namazing team--and the support of an outstanding university. This \nresolution seeks to celebrate the Terps' victory.\n  Our Terps have worked so hard to reach these heights, shaping college \nbasketball history as they got here. They are led by a Terrapin who \nlearned about much more than basketball as a student and graduate-\nassistant in five years at College Park. Coach Gary Williams is that \nTerrapin--a true leader, a true teacher, and a true Marylander at \nheart. As ACC Coach of the Year, Coach Williams led the Terps to the \nregular season ACC title, and their first national championship. But \neven more important, he has continue to shape the lives of the young \nmen he coaches.\n  He cares about his players on and off the court. That meant \nencouraging them in their studies as well as in their sport. He helped \nthem understand the importance of getting their degrees. His success is \nshown in the fact that four of his players are serious--more than any \nof their competitors.\n  These men include this year's dynamic senior class of Earl Badu, \nByron Mouton, Lonny Baxter, and Juan Dixon. I am so proud of them \nbecause they will all graduate this year, proving that Coach Williams' \nphilosophy of hard work on and off the court works here in Maryland. \nTheir experience was a key factor in their victory.\n  When Coach Williams recruits and teaches players, he doesn't always \nlook for the flashiest prospects. He works with men he can make into \nchampions. Our Terrapins show that championship spirit on and off the \ncourt. And that is what a Maryland education is all about.\n  The Terrapins' court successes have mirrored the University of \nMaryland's rise to the pinnacle of the academic world. Our university \nis a national leader in science, engineering and business.\n  The Terps had a perfect season during their last year at Cole Field \nHouse. The University of Maryland and the entire State is grateful for \neverything this basketball team has given us.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in commending the University of \nMaryland's Terrapins for being such great winners--both on and off the \ncourt.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution and preamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, and that any statements related thereto be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
