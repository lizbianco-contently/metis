Mr. President, the Senate will immediately resume \nconsideration of the bankruptcy legislation with 10 hours remaining for \npostcloture debate. This morning, Senator Wellstone is here and ready \nto go, and he will be recognized to offer any of his germane \namendments. Following the Wellstone debate, we will go to Senator Kohl \nwho will be recognized to offer his homestead amendment, with up to 90 \nminutes of debate on that issue.\n  Under the previous order, there will be two votes at 12 noon on the \nLeahy amendments, Nos. 19 and 41. A vote is possible just prior to the \nvote scheduled at noon if time is yielded back with regard to the \nhomestead amendment. Further amendments will be offered and debate will \ncontinue during today's session. Therefore, votes will occur throughout \nthe day. The Senate will complete action on this bill as early as late \nthis afternoon or tonight.\n  I, again, thank Senator Wellstone for his persistence and also his \nwillingness to cooperate as we have gone along.\n  I was very pleased and impressed with the vote on cloture. I believe \nit was 80-19. It is clear the Senate wants to vote on this issue and \nwants to pass some needed bankruptcy reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Before the leader leaves, it is my understanding--and the \nPresiding Officer can correct me if I am wrong--that in the 10 hours, \nwhich starts now, votes are counted, quorums are counted, so we will be \nhere no later than 7:30, plus whatever time it takes to complete the \nvotes. Is that right?\n\n[[Page S2324]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. That is correct. I hope that maybe it will not even be that \nlate. It is possible we could get completed with our work a little \nearlier--6 or 6:30. That would be ideal. I believe, counting the votes \nand all of the time, it would not go beyond 7:30, so Senators should be \naware of that. I might note, in terms of any other legislative action, \ncertainly we wouldn't consider anything further without close \nconsultation with the Democratic leader. We have the possibility of \nconsidering the SEC fees bill, but we want to do that in such a way it \ncan be done either by voice vote or in wrap-up, or if there had to be \nvotes, it would not occur until late on Monday afternoon. We will work \nthrough that. I put Senators on notice that we will at least consider \nhow we will bring that bill up at some point.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/15/senate-section/article/S2324-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, amendment No. 70 would fix the means \ntest so it only looks at present and future income, not an average of \nthe past 6 months. This is a really important amendment and I am \ninterested in a vote. The means test in the bill determines a debtor's \nability to pay a certain threshold amount of debt by averaging the \ndebtor's last 6 months of income. This may be a very poor snapshot of a \ndebtor's circumstances, especially if the debtor's income has gone down \nshortly before the filing due to a job loss or disability. This will \nhave the effect of inappropriately forcing some debtors into chapter 13 \nrepayment plans which they will never be able to complete.\n  This means test is unfair. It does not really look at the debtor's \ncurrent income in determining ability to repay debt. It is abusive to \nworkers who file shortly after losing well-paying jobs, particularly \ngiven the current weakness in the manufacturing sector of our economy.\n  This amendment changes the means test so it looks at an average of \nthe debtor's last 2 months of income instead of the last 6. This is a \nmore accurate picture of the debtor's circumstances and will ensure \nthat only individuals with actual ability to repay will be captured by \nthe means test.\n  Think about this for a moment. You better be thinking about it if \nthere is a downturn in this economy. I am saying if somebody loses his \nor her job, and you are looking at the average income over the past 6 \nmonths, that doesn't do that person or their family a whole lot of good \nin terms of making an accurate assessment. If you look at it just over \nthe last 2 months before they file for bankruptcy, then you are \nproviding some protection to the people who have lost their jobs.\n  I will give a perfect example from the Iron Range. We now have about \n1,300 taconite workers who have lost their jobs just with the LTV mine \nthat is shutting down. For Minnesota, these were well-paying jobs with \nwages and health care. These were $65,000 jobs. For people who lose \nthose kinds of jobs because the manufacturing sector is struggling, it \ndoes not do them a whole lot of good to look at the average income over \nthe prior months--not when you have just lost your job or not when you \nhave been in an accident and all of a sudden find yourself disabled. So \nI say again, this amendment is an amendment that tries to address the \nharshness of this legislation.\n  I cannot understand why Senators would not vote for this amendment \nand therefore this is the first amendment that I bring before the \nSenate today.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 71\n\n  Amendment No. 71 strikes the 5-year waiting period for a new chapter \n13 filing. When people file a chapter 13 case, by definition they are \npaying all they can afford. There is no disagreement about that on the \nfloor. That is supposed to be the reason this bill puts more people \ninto chapter 13. So why does this bill prevent debtors from filing \nanother chapter 13 case for 5 years, even if those debtors have \nfulfilled all their obligations in bankruptcy? This change simply adds \ninsult to injury. It is particularly harmful, I maintain, to elderly \nindividuals who might file a chapter 13 case to save their homes. Under \nthis bill, an elderly person might file a chapter 13 case because of \nmedical bills or because a spouse dies, successfully complete chapter \n13 and save the home.\n  But if they have another illness in the next 5 years or they become \ndisabled or lose their income, they will not be able to file for \nchapter 13. That is ridiculous. That is ridiculous. Again, I point to \nthe harshness of this legislation. Under this bill, chapter 13 filers \nare not supposed to be abusers. They are supposed to be the good guys.\n\n[[Page S2325]]\n\n Adopting this amendment would restore current law and allow the filing \nof new chapter 13 cases. It is very simple.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 73\n\n  Finally, I go to amendment No. 73. This is a safe harbor for folks \nwho file because of job losses that are a result of foreign trade. Mr. \nPresident, 1,400 steelworkers have lost their jobs on the Iron Range of \nMinnesota due to unfair foreign competition.\n  By the way--and this will be the broader context I want to give about \nthis legislation in a moment--does this Senate, does this Congress, \ndoes this administration offer proposals that assure a fair trade \npolicy so many of our industrial workers, such as steelworkers and auto \nworkers, do not get thrown out of work through no fault of their own? \nDo we do anything about the import surge of steel, quite often produced \nwell below the cost of production, sometimes because of unfair dumping \nof steel on our market, sometimes because our workers lose their jobs \nin relation to other developing countries, workers who do not have the \nright to organize and bargain collectively, where there is no \nenvironmental protection, where there is no support for human rights, \nwhere people get paid 13 cents an hour? Do we do anything about that? \nNo.\n  But, by golly, if you lose your job, you are not going to be able to \nfile for chapter 7. You are going to have a very difficult time making \nit in chapter 13, rebuilding your life, or be in debt for the rest of \nyour life. This amendment speaks for the 1,400 steelworkers who lost \ntheir jobs on the Iron Range due to unfair competition.\n  By the way, these steelworkers are not really interested in even \ngetting to the point where they have to declare bankruptcy. They would \nlike us to do something about an unfair trade policy. That is really \nwhat should be part of our agenda. Many more jobs in the timber \nindustry are threatened by Canadian imports.\n  It is crystal clear that too many of these families are going to need \nto file for bankruptcy. If they do, I do not think a bill aimed at \nscofflaws and deadbeats should hold these workers back from a fresh \nstart. This amendment would simply exempt from this entire bill any \ndebtor who files because of a trade-related job loss. The people are \nnot gaming the system. They have been devastated by the uncertainties \nof the global economy, by forces beyond their control. They have been \ndevastated by the failure of the Senate to be on their side and pass \nlegislation that will assure fair trade. They should not be subjected \nto this harsh bill.\n  Let me try to put the last 3 years in context. I think it has been \nabout 2\\1/2\\ or 3 years that we have been going through this debate. It \nhas been 2\\1/2\\ or 3 years that I have tried to prevent this bill from \npassing. The majority leader says he is very pleased by the vote on \ncloture. I will let history judge us. The majority leader can be very \npleased by the vote. The majority leader can be very pleased the Senate \nis about to pass this very harsh bankruptcy bill. But later on today, \nthe big guys are going to win. The big guys are going to win, and the \nlittle people are going to get smashed. There is no question about it. \nIt is embarrassing--or it should be embarrassing to the Senate--the \nnumber of articles and now media coverage that have come out over the \nlast several weeks about all of the ways in which this financial \nservices industry, broadly defined, has hijacked this political \nprocess.\n  It should be embarrassing. There is no one-to-one correlation. I have \nsaid that many times over.\n  I accept the fact that my good friend, Senator Grassley, can have an \nhonestly held but different view. I am telling you that when it comes \nto elderly people who are put under because of medical bills and now \ncannot file chapter 13 for another 13 years, or when it comes to \nfamilies, 50 percent of whom file for bankruptcy because of medical \nexpenses, who are going to be put through one provision and one hurdle \nand another hurdle and another test, which is going to make it so \ndifficult for them to file for chapter 7 or, for that matter, to be \nable to rebuild their economic lives, or when it comes to workers who \nhave lost their jobs and don't figure in really well with the 6 months \nof average income and are going to find it so difficult to rebuild \ntheir lives, or when it comes to women where there has been a divorce \nin the family--and all too often it is the woman who is the one who \nreally has to take care of the children--when it comes to a lot of low- \nand moderate-income people, there is an awful lot of harshness in this \npiece of legislation.\n  They never were able to mount the same lobbying effort. They were \nnever able to get special provisions in the bill. The auto makers or \nthe auto dealers get a special provision for them. There was an article \nabout that. It is embarrassing.\n  Investors in Lloyd's of London get a special provision for \nthemselves. It is embarrassing.\n  The homestead exemption for millionaires or multimillionaires--it is \nembarrassing.\n  I have to say it. I don't see any balance to this legislation.\n  Senator Durbin and others tried to go after the predatory lending \npractices. They were not successful.\n  Is there any significant focus in this legislation on the ways in \nwhich the credit card industry pumps these credit cards out to people \nso they are held accountable? No.\n  Was the Senate willing to vote for low-income and vulnerable people \nwho are picked on by loan sharks or take on these payday loans or take \non these lenders? No.\n  Was the Senate willing to provide an exemption for people who went \nunder because of medical bills? No.\n  Today I have an amendment that at least says do this for people who \nlost their jobs. There will probably be again another ``no'' vote.\n  We have in this legislation the following provisions:\n  Prebankruptcy credit counseling requirements at the debtor's expense.\n  So you lose your job. You are being put under because of an injury or \na disability or a medical bill based upon a major illness. How do you \ncounsel away a job loss? Why are we asking people who have lost their \njobs or are filing for bankruptcy because of medical bills to go \nthrough prebankruptcy credit counseling at their own expense? Can \nsomeone explain that?\n  No limits on prefilings, regardless of personal circumstances;\n  Revocation of automatic stay relief for failure to surrender \ncollateral;\n  You can't file a new 7 case for 8 years or a new chapter 13 case for \n5 years.\n  There is no current law under chapter 13. That is in one of my \namendments.\n  My friend--I wish I had known him well--Hubert Humphrey, a Senator \nfrom Minnesota, later Vice President of the United States of America, \nonce said--and we have all heard this quote--that the moral test of a \nsociety in that matter of government is the way we treat people in the \ndawn of their lives, the children; the way we treat people in the \ntwilight of their lives, the elderly; and the way we treat people in \nthe shadow of their lives, people who are struggling with a disability; \nand people who are poor.\n  This bankruptcy bill fails that moral test.\n  The majority leader says he is delighted with the vote. I say to the \nmajority leader I believe this piece of legislation fails that moral \ntest. I believe the Senate, when it votes for this legislation, will \nfail that moral test. I believe this will be a vote for the heavy \nhitters, the investors, the well connected, and the big players. And \nthis will be a vote against ordinary people.\n  Bankruptcy has been a safety net for them--not just for low-income \npeople but for middle-income people as well. It is being shredded with \nthis piece of legislation. I have tried, as my friend from Iowa knows, \nfor 2\\1/2\\ to 3 years to do this.\n  This bill is going to pass. When it passes, all I can say is we will \nhave to judge it.\n  Initially, the case was made that it was all about fraud--that people \nwere gaming the system. But the American Bankruptcy Institute took care \nof that argument when it said only 3 percent were gaming the system. \nOther studies got it up to 10 or 13 percent, at the most, of people who \nwere gaming the system and who were filing for chapter 7 but really \ncould pay back more. That is not widespread fraud or abuse.\n  The argument that there was a dramatic increase in filing of \nbankruptcies, although in the last year and a half it has gone down, is \nkind of chasing a problem that doesn't exist. This\n\n[[Page S2326]]\n\neconomy may very well turn down. Then there will be more people who \nlive in our States who will find themselves in difficult economic \ncircumstances through no fault of their own. They will go to try to \nfile for bankruptcy, and they will find it impossible to rebuild their \neconomic lives. And they will hold us accountable. They will say: Were \nyou on the side of the financial services industry with all of these \nbig banks and all of these big lenders and this credit card industry? \nWhy weren't you on our side?\n  I think it is only fitting--I will conclude this way and reserve the \nrest of my time--that the bankruptcy bill is considered right after we \ndid with the ergonomics rule and right before campaign finance reform \nbecause basically last week when we were dealing with repetitive stress \ninjury, we took a rule that was a result of 10 years of work--\nrepetitive stress injury, blue-collar, white-collar workers, the \nmajority of workers women, the most serious injury in the workplace, \nprovide people with some protection--and in 10 hours the Senate \noverturned it. That was not a good week for working people.\n  Then we go to bankruptcy. Now when one of our constituents is injured \nin the workplace--because we have stripped away the protection--and she \ncan't work because of a disability, when she goes to file for \nbankruptcy, she may find it impossible, given all of these provisions \nand all of these hurdles and obstacles, to rebuild her life for herself \nand her children.\n  Do we have out here for consideration legislation to raise the \nminimum wage? No.\n  Do we have any kind of legislation that talks about a living wage; \nthat is to say, an income where people can support their families and \ngive their children what they need and deserve? No.\n  Do we have legislation that focuses on affordable prescription drug \ncosts for elderly people? No.\n  Do we have legislation to expand health care coverage for people so \nthey don't have to file for bankruptcy? No.\n  Do we have legislation which would call for much more by way of \nresources to expand the amount of available low-cost housing for \npeople? This has become a huge crisis. No.\n  Do we have legislation that calls for a fair trade policy so that \nworkers on the Range and other workers in this country don't end up \nlosing their jobs\n  through no fault of their own? No.\n  The only thing we have is a bill that is a wish list for the credit \ncard industry and a nightmare for vulnerable families and vulnerable \ncitizens in Minnesota and the country.\n  (Mr. ALLEN assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. President, I guess this is a bridge to campaign finance reform \nbecause I am not going to argue that any Senator's vote or support for \nthis bill is because of contributions because there are Senators who \nhave a different viewpoint. Senator Grassley absolutely believes in \nthis, has argued for it, has been effective, and will get this bill \npassed. It is what he believes. I know that.\n  But I will say, thinking about it in institutional terms, which is \nthe only way I can do it--not in personal terms--anybody can say any \nSenator's vote or position is based on campaign finance. We do that to \neverybody. But if you look at it in broader institutional terms, I am \nsorry, this is a classic example of too few people with too much \nwealth, too much power, too much access, and too many people in the \ncountry locked out, left behind.\n  If the standard of a representative democracy is that each person \nshould count as one, and no more than one, I will tell you something: \nThis political process fails that standard. And I will tell you \nsomething else: I think the next debate we have will be the most \nfundamental debate of all when it comes to what representative \ndemocracy is about because if we fail that test, that each person \nshould count as one, and no more than one--and there is not one Senator \nin this Chamber who believes that that is true; we have strayed far \naway from that--then we are undercutting representative democracy.\n  If legislation that is passed--and what happens in the Senate; the \nmajority leader said he is so pleased about this--is the result of who \nhas power in Washington, who can march on Washington every day, who can \ndo a full court press for several years, I hand it to the financial \nservices industry; you have done that well.\n  If that is the test of a representative democracy, the pattern of \npower in the Nation's Capital, we are in really serious trouble because \na whole lot of ordinary people are left out, and they know it.\n  I will tell you what. This debate has me thinking more about this \ncampaign finance reform bill. I do not want to make an absolute \ncommitment, but I want to say a few things about it. I am absolutely \nconvinced that the McCain-Feingold bill is a step in the right \ndirection. But most of the money is hard money, not soft money. These \nproposals to raise the limit from $2,000 to 6,000 are just unbelievable \nto me.\n  Do you know it is something like four-tenths of 1 percent who \ncontribute over $200. So now what we are going to say is, for the four-\ntenths of 1 percent who can contribute over $200--who have the big \nbucks, from whom all of us ask for funding when we run for office--we \nare now going to put more importance on these citizens, the highest \nincomes and the wealthiest, who, by the way, quite often contribute \nbecause they want to support you, they do not do it, hopefully, because \nthey are corrupt or because we are corrupt. But now we are going to \nattach more importance to them and leave even more people out, and \nhaving even more people believe if you pay, you play, and if you don't \npay, you don't play. I will spend hours opposing that proposal.\n  I am absolutely convinced McCain-Feingold is a step in the right \ndirection but does not even get at one-tenth of the way in which money \nhijacks politics. We have an example--I need to say this well--of \ncorruption--not corruption as in the wrongdoing of individual \nofficeholders, the wrongdoing of individual Senators; no, not that. I \ndo not think so. I do not think so. I am trying to get everybody to \nlike me. I do not think so. I really believe not. But there is a worse \nkind of corruption, systemic corruption, where too few people have all \nthe access and the say.\n\n  This bankruptcy bill has been a perfect example of it. The vast \nmajority of the people are left out. There is a huge imbalance between \nthe big givers and investors--yes, in both parties--and the majority of \npeople.\n  I will tell you something. I am going to make sure we have a vote on \na public financing bill. I have written the clean money/clean election \nbill. John Kerry has joined me on it. We should have a vote on it.\n  When my good friend Mitch McConnell comes to the floor, first of all, \nhe will say it is constitutionally legal. It is constitutional. That is \nwhat he will say, which I appreciate. Then he will say--and he will say \nit better than I can say it--this is ``food stamps'' for politicians. \nThen we will have the debate.\n  But the debate will be: But wait a minute, do the elections belong to \npoliticians? Does the Government belong to politicians or does it \nbelong to people? And if you could take the clean money/clean election \nefforts--successful in Massachusetts, and started in Maine, and then in \nArizona--I forget the other State--and Vermont; I am sorry, Vermonters, \npeople from Vermont--why not apply that to Federal elections?\n  Another amendment would be to just simply change three words in the \nFederal election code, which would allow any State that wanted to--the \nPresiding Officer might like this one--which would just say: leave it \nup to Virginia, leave it up to Iowa, leave it up to Minnesota. And if \nour States want to apply clean money/clean election to Federal \nelections, they should be able to do so.\n  There was an Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals decision on this which \nsaid: Look, Minnesota, if you want to apply some kind of public \nfinancing to elections, we might be for it, but the way the Federal \nelection law reads, you cannot. I would like to enable States to do it \nif they want to; then let the discussion bubble up from the State \nlevel.\n  But I am telling you something. What we have been going through over \nthe last couple of weeks, and the last couple of years, on a variety of \ndifferent pieces of legislation--what we have done and what we have not \ndone; what has been on the agenda and what has been off the agenda; \nwhat has been on the table and what has been off the table; who decides \nwho benefits and\n\n[[Page S2327]]\n\nwho is asked to sacrifice--those are the questions I ask.\n  As I look at this within that kind of framework, we need McCain-\nFeingold-plus. We need sweeping campaign finance reform, we need clean \nmoney, and we need clean elections. Ultimately, we have to go down the \npath of the people owning these elections, and therefore they will have \na much better chance of owning the Government and a much better chance \nof defeating a harsh bankruptcy bill.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  How much time do I have, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I reserve the remainder of my time for later today. I \nthank the Chair.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley. \n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I have had an opportunity now for 30 minutes to listen \nto the Senator from Minnesota. Besides responding to his specific \namendments, I would like to--on, hopefully, the last day of debating \nthis bill; and there have been a lot of ``last days'' over the last \nthree Congresses to finally get a bill to the President that will be \nsigned into law--take an opportunity to express some history.\n  First of all, let me suggest to the Senator from Minnesota that there \nare a lot of trade associations that are very interested in getting \nthis bill passed. I am not oblivious to that. But I think you ought to \ntake into consideration how Senator Grassley got to the point of \nconsidering legislation such as this.\n  I have town meetings around Iowa, just as I am sure you do in \nMinnesota. You go to the small towns of Minnesota to hold town \nmeetings; I go to the small towns of Iowa, in each of the 99 counties \nevery year, to hold town meetings. Maybe it is not always a town \nmeeting. It might be at a coffee break for the workers at a factory; it \nmight be at a Rotary Club, and all those things. I have a dialog with \nmy constituents. And over the period of the time I have been in the \nSenate--maybe not immediately, but in the late 1980s and early 1990s--\nwhere did I first hear about abuses of bankruptcy laws that we passed \nin 1978, which were not intended to make it easier to get into \nbankruptcy but it ended up that way, 20 years later, so we realized?\n  It was from the small business people of Main Street USA that I heard \nabout the irritating impact of people declaring bankruptcy. Maybe in \nsome of those cases those bankruptcies would have been legitimate. As \nwe all agree, some people deserve a fresh start. Even under that \ncircumstance, it is irritating to the small businessperson to have \nsomebody declare bankruptcy and then, maybe a month later, to see that \nperson driving a new car.\n  These are the impressions I have of the use of bankruptcy that \nbrought me to this point, along with the Senator from Alabama, Mr. \nHeflin, who, until he left the Senate in 1996, was either chairman of \nthis subcommittee when Democrats were in the majority, or I was the \nchairman and he was the ranking member. He and I worked together on \nbankruptcy legislation. It was nothing very major through the 1980s and \nearly 1990s, just a technical correction here or there. We were \nimpressed with the number of small businesspeople who would tell us \nabout the abuse of bankruptcy laws, people not paying their bills, and \nthen the small businessperson being stuck with it. That is one point.\n  The second point is, over the period since the 1978 law passed, we \nhave had a lot of changes in the economy of our country and also the \nglobalization of the economy. The bankruptcy law has not changed with \nthe economics and the changing conditions of the American economy. So \nearly in the 1990s--and I think it took us about 4 years to get a \ncommission set up--we decided, even though we had been working on \nbankruptcy legislation for a period of time and making some technical \ncorrections, things of that nature--nothing real major--we had been \nthinking about how to handle this proposition of some corrections, some \nfine-tuning of the bankruptcy code--we decided to set up the Bankruptcy \nCommission.\n  All during that period of time of hearing from our constituents at \nthe grassroots of America about abuse of bankruptcy laws or our seeing \nthe need for some change in bankruptcy laws because of the changing \neconomy, we never heard from these trade associations the Senator is \nreferring to that a commission ought to be set up to change the \nbankruptcy laws. We set up a commission not made up of political people \nbut experts in bankruptcy laws to bring about some suggested changes. \nThree Congresses ago, Senator Durbin and I introduced the results of \nthat commission.\n  Obviously, at that point, people started lobbying for and against \nlegislation. That is the way the process has worked for a long time. We \nare here today not because of those trade associations that are very \nmuch involved for and against this bill. Don't forget, when you talk \nabout the business interests, there is as much fighting within business \nas to who is going to be on top or who is going to be on the bottom in \nthe priorities as there is between business as creditors and the \ndebtors the Senator is protecting.\n  There is a lot of dispute among these trade associations; there is a \nlot of dispute among various segments of our business community as to \njust exactly how the laws should be changed. I suggest to the Senator \nthat there is probably as much effort in lobbying between business as \nthere is between all business on one hand and the debtors on the other \nhand.\n  I am not saying anything he said is incorrect, nothing whatsoever. I \nam just saying that, please, look at it from the perspective of the 15 \nyears that I have been involved in bankruptcy legislation and how we \ncame from point A to point B today.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will yield.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The reason I make this awkward request is that in just \na minute or two, I have to go back to the office for a conversation \nwith journalists about a mental health bill. I apologize for leaving.\n  I say to the Senator from Iowa two things: First, here is our \ndisagreement. I think there has been abuse. That is what the Senator \nfrom Iowa has focused on and heard about in his town meetings. I just \nthink, to be as honest as I can be, that we have lost our way, and we \nwent way beyond dealing with the abuse and ended up with this bill, as \nopposed to the original bill. I was the only vote against it. Frankly, \nif I had known what was going to happen, I wish I would have voted for \nit. I think we lost our way, and we went way beyond dealing with the \nabuse. We have written a bill that makes it easier for the credit card \ncompanies. That is my honest view. I have been speaking about this day \nafter day.\n  I thank my colleague for what he said. This may sound too flowery--if \nthat is the right word--but I don't think there is anything the Senator \nfrom Iowa would say on the floor of the Senate that I would not believe \ncame out of his personal and political conviction. I know that, period.\n  This is a profound and deep, honest disagreement. It is not personal. \nHe is a great Senator.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator from Minnesota for his kind remarks \nand his intellectually honest approach to this issue, even though there \nis great disagreement. One of the tests, I suggest to the Senator from \nMinnesota, that my position might be right is the fact that this bill \npassed three Congresses ago, 97-1. It passed two Congresses ago, one \ntime 84-13, another time 70-28. It would be the law of the land now \nbecause we had the votes to override a veto, except that it was pocket \nvetoed by President Clinton. It was not vetoed by President Clinton in \nthe way that we could override it.\n  I hope, for the cynical people--maybe everybody is somewhat cynical \nabout Congress, but some people are more cynical than others--they are \na little less cynical on legislation that gets broad bipartisan \nsupport. In other words, what I am saying is, there are 31 Members of \nSenator Wellstone's party who voted for cloture on this bill yesterday \nto help us get it passed. That is a test that this legislation is well \ncompromised--in my judgment, maybe too much compromised; I would rather \nhave a stronger bill--and it is a good product to send to the President \nto be the law of the land.\n  This legislation should be passed. I hope it will. I am going to \nleave to\n\n[[Page S2328]]\n\nother Republicans to speak about the merits or demerits of the \nWellstone legislation because I have to go to a committee meeting. I do \nwant to give a historical context of why we are here today.\n  I pursued this bankruptcy legislation because I have a real \nconviction that when you are right, you eventually win out. This is the \nthird Congress. It would be the law of the land now except for \nPresident Clinton's pocket veto. President Bush has said he will sign \nit. The bipartisanship shows the rightness of it. We are going to have \nan example this year of right winning out.\n  I thank the Senator from Utah for coming to the floor. The \ndistinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee has done so much to \nhelp move this legislation along, particularly when I have been so busy \nas the new chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. I thank Senator \nHatch for doing that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am here in opposition to the Wellstone \namendment to permit a debtor to repeatedly use chapter 13. The effect \nof his amendment is that it strikes the provisions of the reform act \nwhich require a debtor to wait 5 years between chapter 13 bankruptcies.\n  Present law allows the debtor to file repeated chapter 13s, one right \nafter another. The amendment is unnecessary. Senator Leahy and myself \nhave already worked out an adjustment to be included in the managers' \namendment, which permits a debtor to refile a chapter 13 within 2 years \nafter a previous bankruptcy and provides a hardship exception if the \ndebtor absolutely has to have chapter 13 relief more frequently.\n  The amendment encourages debtors to repeatedly use chapter 13 \nregardless of whether they need it. It undercuts personal \nresponsibility. Repeated use of chapter 13 should only be rarely \nnecessary. It should never be allowed, unless a judge determines the \ndebtor is really experiencing hardship. The amendment encourages \nbankruptcy mills to abuse the system by repeatedly putting their \nclients into chapter 13. This is a documented abuse that has been noted \nby many observers.\n  It is difficult for me to see what merit the distinguished Senator \nfrom Minnesota finds in this particular amendment. I oppose this \namendment that would undercut personal responsibility and encourage \nabuse of the bankruptcy system.\n  I hope our colleagues will vote this amendment down.\n  Now, with regard to the other amendments the Senator from Minnesota \nhas called up this morning, I oppose the Wellstone amendment to allow \nthe debtor to defraud the court and shield income.\n  With regard to this legislation, the legislation calculates a \ndebtor's ``current monthly income'' for purposes of the means test by \naveraging the debtor's monthly income from all sources over a 6-month \nperiod.\n  The amendment of the distinguished Senator from Minnesota would \nchange the time period to a 2-month period instead of 6 months. This \namendment would allow the debtor to defraud the system more easily. By \nlimiting the scope of current monthly income, the amendment allows the \ndebtor to hide earnings from the court more easily. For example, it may \nbe worthwhile for the debtor to quit a job for 2 months in order to \nhave no income for purposes of the means test than to take the income \ninto account and risk being converted to chapter 13.\n  The point of the legislation is to cut down on loopholes, not create \nthem. This amendment of the distinguished Senator from Minnesota \ncreates an obvious loophole, which would allow debtors to game the \nsystem prior to filing.\n  A 2-month period does not give an accurate picture of an individual's \nincome. Wealthier debtors may receive quarterly or semiannual \ninvestment distributions which may not be picked up under the Wellstone \ndefinition if the debtor is lucky, or extremely clever.\n  Supporters of the amendment may claim a 6-month period is too long, \ntaking into account income or circumstances that are no longer relevant \nat the time of filing; that is, the debtor may have recently lost his \njob. This is the exact reason the legislation includes provisions to \nallow the judge to take such ``special circumstances'' into account. It \nis more appropriate to deter fraud in all cases and allow the judge to \nallow special circumstances in some cases than to presume such \ncircumstances in all cases while making fraud easier.\n  So I hope our colleagues will oppose that Wellstone amendment as \nwell.\n  I also oppose the Wellstone amendment excepting those who lose their \njobs on account of imports from all provisions of the reform \nlegislation.\n  The effect of his amendment is, if a debtor can demonstrate ``the \nreason for filing is due to the debtor having become unemployed'' on \naccount of imports, the debtor is exempt from every provision of S. 420 \nexcept those he or she elects to cover them.\n\n  The amendment unwisely creates two classes of debtors: One class must \nuse the bankruptcy bill as 420 would amend it, and another class can \nuse bankruptcy law as it exists today, or pick and choose what \nprovisions of this new law apply. To allow some group of our citizens, \nno matter how unfortunate, to pick and choose what parts of the law \nwill apply to them is absolutely unprecedented.\n  The amendment would allow debtors to evade child support, alimony, \nand marital property settlement provisions of this bill that help women \nand children. That is one thing this bill is doing--moving women and \nchildren, or spouses and children, to the front of the line. The debtor \nwho owes child support could evade his basic responsibilities to pay \nchild support by fitting under the loophole created by the Wellstone \namendment.\n  This particular amendment would allow debtors to evade the homestead \nexemption caps imposed by this bill.\n  The amendment is unworkable. For example, creditors would not know if \nthey had to make the truth-in-lending disclosures this bill imposes on \nthem until after the debtor files for bankruptcy; yet the disclosures \nmust be given in credit card solicitations and on the monthly \nstatement.\n  The amendment would have the strange effect of apparently exempting \ncreditors from complying with consumer protections in this bill, such \nas the reaffirmation reforms, the restrictions on creditors that fail \nto credit plan payments, the privacy protections, and so forth.\n  The amendment ignores the basic reality that the bill's primary \neffect is to require debtors who have the means to repay a meaningful \nportion of their debts. In most cases, people who lose their jobs will \nlikely not be affected by the means test. For those who still have the \nability to repay a meaningful portion of their debts--because they are \nindependently wealthy, regardless of employment--the fact that the \nperson lost a job has nothing to do with whether the debtor can repay a \nmeaningful portion of his or her debt.\n  We cannot allow this loophole in this legislation. Although I am sure \nthe efforts of the distinguished Senator from Minnesota are well \nintentioned and made in good faith, the fact is these amendments would \ndo a great deal of harm rather than good and would undermine the \npurposes of this bill and what we are trying to do, which is bring \nhonesty and justice to the bankruptcy code.\n  I surely hope our colleagues will vote down all three of the \namendments of the distinguished Senator from Minnesota and that we can \ngo forward and, of course, get this bill completed today. I hope we can \nkeep all amendments from being on this bill, except perhaps the \nmanagers' package, which we hope we can work out before final passage.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the hour of 10:30 having arrived, the \nSenator from Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl, is recognized to call up No. 68, on \nwhich there shall be 90 minutes of debate, equally divided.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 68\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I send this amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n\n[[Page S2329]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 68.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment with \nSenator Feinstein to eliminate the most flagrant abuse of the \nbankruptcy system--the unlimited homestead exemption.\n  The homestead exemption allows debtors in five states to purchase \nexpensive homes and shield millions of dollars from their creditors. \nAll too often, millionaire debtors take advantage of this loophole by \nbuying mansions in states with unlimited exemptions like Florida and \nTexas, and declaring bankruptcy--yet continuing to live like kings. Our \namendment will generously cap the homestead exemption at $125,000--that \nis, it permits a debtor to keep $125,000 of equity in his home after \ndeclaring bankruptcy.\n  The Senate voted on our amendment last session 76-22 after rejecting \nan amendment that would have gutted our amendment by a vote of 69-29. \nThat was the right thing to do then, and it is the right thing to do \nnow.\n  Let me give you a few of the numerous examples of rich debtors taking \nadvantage of this loophole:\n  Abe Gosman, a health care and real estate magnate, declared \nbankruptcy last week in Florida citing debts of over $233 million. \nDespite these debts incurred from business losses in Massachusetts and \nRhode Island, he will hold onto his 64,000 square foot mansion in West \nPalm Beach on a street known as ``Billionaire's Row.''\n  This January, convicted Wall Street financier Paul Bilzerian filed \nbankruptcy for the second time while owing at least $140 million in \ndebts, but still kept his $5 million, 37,000 square foot Florida \nmansion.\n  Movie star Burt Reynolds wrote off more than $8 million in debt \nthrough bankruptcy, but still held onto his $2.5 million estate, named \nValhalla.\n  Sadly, those examples are just the tip of the iceberg. We asked the \nGeneral Accounting Office to study this problem. They estimated that \n400 homeowners in Florida and Texas--all with over $100,000 in home \nequity--profit from this unlimited exemption each year. While they \ncontinue to live in luxury, they write off an estimated $120 million \nowed to honest creditors. A Brown University study estimated that 3 \npercent of all people who move to Texas and Florida are motivated by \nbankruptcy concerns.\n  Opponents of this amendment will say that while their hearts are with \nus on this issue, there is a compromise in this bill that is \nsatisfactory. That is, they simply require someone be a resident of a \nstate for 2 years. Unfortunately, that so-called compromise is so \nwatered down that it doesn't accomplish anything. Instead, it bends \nover backwards for millionaire debtors who are trying to evade their \ncreditors.\n  There are several ways that the current provision fails. First, it is \neasily evaded. It lets anyone who has had their home for more than two \nyears to take advantage of the homestead loophole. Bankruptcy \nprofessors throughout the nation have written us to say that any decent \nbankruptcy planner will be able to stall for two years while their \nclient squirrels money away in a mansion and away from creditors. If \nyou can afford a multi-million dollar house, you can afford an attorney \ngood enough to get around this provision.\n  Second, the provision would do absolutely nothing to catch the \nwealthy debtor who already lives in Florida, Texas, or three other \nstates. Former Governor John Connally, who hid millions from his \ncreditors in Texas, and Burt Reynolds, who shielded $2.5 million in \nFlorida, do not deserve their mansions any more than people who just \nmoved to Florida from Wisconsin or California.\n  For these reasons, Mr. President, the provision in the bill is just \nnot good enough. It is a blueprint for rich debtors. It shows them how \nto dodge their creditors. Avoiding personal responsibility and using \nthe bankruptcy laws as a method of financial planning is contrary to \nthe stated purpose of this bill. A hard cap is not only the best \npolicy; it also sends the best message: bankruptcy is a tool of last \nresort, not financial planning. And it gives credibility to reform by \ntargeting the worst abusers, no matter how wealthy.\n  This is a simple idea that makes sense. There is no greater \nbankruptcy abuse than this. Last Congress, an overwhelming number of \nour colleagues agreed with us and voted to cap the homestead exemption \nby a vote of 76-22. The vote this year is exactly the same as the one \nlast Congress. If you were against rich debtors avoiding their \ncreditors last time, then you should be against rich debtors avoiding \ntheir creditors this time.\n  Mr. President. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Utah, Mr. \nHatch.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, one of the most difficult aspects of this \nbankruptcy bill we have had is trying to resolve the problems with \nregard to home ownership and homestead exemption. It has been a very \ndifficult problem and we have worked on both sides of Capitol Hill to \ntry to come up with a solution that will work. Frankly, the solution we \nhave come up with is in this bill, basically recognizing the States \nhave the right to set the homestead cap rather than the Federal \nGovernment.\n  My distinguished friend, Senator Kohl, is trying to change that with \nthis amendment. This amendment jeopardizes bankruptcy reform by \nstripping out the bipartisan compromise homestead provision that we \nhave worked out over a long period of time, over many years. This \nbipartisan compromise homestead exemption is in the bill, and the \ndistinguished Senator from Wisconsin would require home equity, \nwherever acquired, that exceeds $125,000, will be subject to collection \nunder the bankruptcy code. The bipartisan compromise homestead \nprovision now in the bill substantially improves current law by \nrequiring home equity acquired within 2 years before bankruptcy, not to \nexceed $100,000, to be subject to crediting in a bankruptcy estate.\n  What the code does is prohibits individuals from shielding more than \n$100,000 in new equity in their home--paying down the mortgage, \nbuilding an addition--if that new equity was obtained within 2 years of \nfiling.\n  Finally, the compromise would disallow any acquisition of homestead \nproperty within 7 years of filing if done to ``delay, hinder, or \ndefraud'' a creditor.\n  The amendments proposed by Senators Kohl and Feinstein would add no \nadditional antifraud protection and would, instead, threaten final \npassage of the bankruptcy bill. The Bush administration supports the \nexisting homestead language contained in the underlying bill, the \ncompromise that we have all worked out, and the Kohl-Feinstein \namendment is opposed by the National Governors' Association and the \nNational Conference of State Legislators. I think we would be very \nwrong to go against allowing the States to set their own standards in \nthis area.\n  Some States will have different standards than others, but it is up \nto the States. If they set the standards too high or too low, they are \ngoing to suffer as a result of it. They will gradually get it right. \nBut for us to arbitrarily set a homestead exemption standard here in \nthe Senate, in this bankruptcy bill, is the wrong thing to do. I prefer \nto leave it up to the States.\n  I hope our colleagues will vote against this homestead exemption \nlanguage of the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl. \n  Mr. KOHL. Just briefly, to respond to Senator Hatch, bankruptcy is a \nFederal proceeding that occurs in Federal courts, so there is every \nlogical reason to have Federal standards. Right now, there are only \nfive States with an unlimited exemption--Florida, Texas, South Dakota, \nNebraska, and Iowa--and only two States have one over $125,000, and \nthat is $200,000. Those two States are Minnesota and Massachusetts. \nEvery other State has an exemption of $125,000, which is ours, or less. \nThe argument that every State should\n\n[[Page S2330]]\n\nbe allowed to set an unlimited exemption if they so wish is not logical \nbecause it is not a States rights issue. Bankruptcy is a Federal issue.\n\n  I think that argument doesn't hold water. Again, I point out the \nexemption that has been worked out simply says that a person would have \nto have 2 years residency in any one of these five States, and then \nthey could shield an unlimited amount in a home in a bankruptcy \nproceeding. As I said in my earlier statement, it is very easy to work \na 2-year residency while you are planning to have a bankruptcy \nproceeding. Furthermore, it does nothing to address the issue of people \nwho currently live in those five States--maybe for 5 years, 10 years, \n15 years, or 20 years. They would have the opportunity to shield an \nunlimited amount in a home.\n  This is a very simple amendment. We debated it 2 years ago, and by a \n76-22 margin, the Senate accepted that amendment 2 years ago. We are \nsimply requesting that same expression of the Senate's intent be stated \nagain today.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kansas. Who yields time to the Senator?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak against the amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to yield 10 minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the chairman of the committee for yielding the \n10-minute time for me to speak on this topic.\n  Mr. President, we have an issue that has been worked on extensively. \nI appreciate my colleague from Wisconsin bringing this back to the \nfloor this year. We had spirited debate and discussion on it last year. \nWe had an aggressive effort to work this out in conference. We did--I \ndon't think to everybody's satisfaction--but there are a number of \npeople on that side of the aisle and our side of the aisle who thought \nthis was an area that should be addressed.\n  I personally think this is an area that should be left in the State's \nconstitution and away from bankruptcy law the way it has been for 132 \nyears, and I continue to believe that now. But what has come forward \nhas been a compromise that has been worked out by a number of people \nwho worked on the bankruptcy issue, people of good faith from different \nperspectives, and that compromise is in the bill.\n  The chairman of the committee spoke about what that compromise was. \nTo deviate from that will cause a number of us to then say that is \nsomething with which we will not be able to live. I personally will be \nvoting against the bill if that is in it, and I will fight this bill \ncoming back in any form from conference if it has this new language in \nit.\n  I respect the thoughts on the part of my colleague from Wisconsin. I \nknow his heart is good and clear on this.\n  But there is another matter here for me; that is, Kansas, along with \na number of other States, has put in the State constitution a homestead \nprovision that says you are entitled to be able to keep your home and \n160 contiguous acres. This dates back to the period of homesteading, \nwhich Kansas, the State of Nebraska, and the United States granted to \npeople. It said, if for 5 years you can go out there and tame 160 acres \nand build a home, you get to keep it. It is yours. That is your \nhomestead. We settled much of the Midwest in that way--not all of it. \nIt was settled that way.\n  Over succeeding years, a number of farmers would borrow against the \nland. They would say, I need to buy fertilizer, or seed, or some stock \nand cattle to put on it. They would borrow against the land. Then a bad \nmarket would hit, or bad weather would hit, and they would lose the \nland. So a number of States built not just in their laws but their \nconstitution a law to say you can protect your home and 160 contiguous \nacres so you can farm again.\n  This was very much thought through, and it has been used a lot--even \nas recently as the eighties in Kansas. This provision was used \nextensively by farmers who lost most of their land, most of their \nmachinery, and most of their livestock. But they could keep the home \nand 160 acres to be able to start farming again.\n  At that time, I did a number of foreclosures for farmers, defending \nfarmers, and bankruptcy work for farmers. A number of them lost \neverything but the home and 160 acres. Today they are still out there \nfarming--some because they were able to protect it. They were able to \ncontinue and start farming again.\n  A compromise has been carefully worked out in this legislation that \nsays we are not going to let people defraud others, or try to protect \nmore than they are entitled to, and we are going to continue to allow \nStates 2 years out--people who have lived there for more than 2 years--\nto protect what the State law would allow you to protect.\n  In my State, 160 acres is your homestead; or, in town, a home and \none-half acre. That is in our law and the constitution of the State of \nKansas. I think that is fully appropriate. It is fair. I think it is \nright, and it is what a number of States have done.\n  I point out some of the States that have worked on this either in \ntheir constitution or in their laws--Florida, Iowa, Kansas, South \nDakota, Texas, Oklahoma, Minnesota, and Massachusetts. And there are \nother States that have different provisions as well.\n  We have had a Federal bankruptcy law for 133 years that has not \naddressed this issue and has said this should be left to what an \nindividual State would decide. If California or Wisconsin or Kansas \nwant to do this differently within their State, we will let the State \ndetermine what they want to do. I think it is important we allow that \nprovision to continue. The effect of this would be that the Federal \nGovernment identifies this law and would say for the first time in 133 \nyears that we are going to take up this issue.\n  There have been a few high profile instances of abuse of the \nhomestead exemption. Debtors have moved to other States to take \nadvantage of a higher exemption in that State or have transferred \nassets of the homestead to shield them. Those are, by far, the \nexception rather than the rule.\n\n  I can tell you that during the 1980s during the bankruptcy crisis in \nKansas they weren't moving. Some were trying to shield assets but most \nwere trying to hold onto enough so they could start farming again. That \nis, by far, the typical situation, while there have been some high \nprofile cases where it has been different. In fact, a recent survey of \nbankruptcies by the Executive Office for the United States Trustees \nsaid they ``did not find a single debtor who came close to the popular \nstereotype of homestead abuse. Our conclusion is that this is a \nrelatively rare phenomenon in bankruptcy.''\n  For every Burt Reynolds-type example out there, there are hundreds of \nhonest, middle-class people who find themselves in financial trouble \nwho would be forced to move out of their homes or off their farms under \nthis particular well-meaning amendment. As well meaning as it may be, \nit is going to hit them, and it is going to harm them.\n  What is in the bill now to end homestead abuse?\n  The bill now contains compromise language on the homestead issue that \nwas adopted during the debate on the bill last year. That was approved \nby the Senate as part of the overall bill by a 70-vote margin. We \nworked a long time to get this language worked out. There were a lot of \nparties involved. We were able to get it through by a 70-vote majority. \nTaken together, the protections against homestead abuse contained in \nthe bill virtually guarantee that the few instances of true abuse will \nnever occur again.\n  They include a cap of $100,000, indexed to inflation, on any new \nequity obtained in the homestead within 2 years of filing for \nbankruptcy. Thus, a debtor would not be able to shield a $200,000 \naddition to a house built within 2 years of filing. This would, \nhowever, leave the large majority of homeowners unaffected since very \nfew homeowners can expect to acquire more than $100,000 in equity \nwithin a 2-year period.\n\n[[Page S2331]]\n\n  The bill requires that, before a debtor can use the homestead \nexemption in a particular State, he or she must have resided in that \nState for no less than 2 years. This will prevent the problem of \n``forum shopping'' by bankruptcy filers.\n  If you are trying to plan bankruptcy and looking more than 2 years \nout, that is a pretty aggressive effort. And, like I said, from the \nBankruptcy Trustees' perspective in their study, they don't find any \ncases of this abuse, and there is a relatively very rare phenomenon of \nthat.\n  The bill contains a heightened scrutiny of any transfer of assets to \nthe homestead made within 7 years of filing for bankruptcy done to \n``delay, hinder, or defraud'' creditors--for example, getting cash from \na credit card to fraudulently pay-down a mortgage before filing for \nbankruptcy.\n  The bill now makes it very hard for anyone who makes or who can make \nabove the national median income to even file chapter 7, where the \nhomestead exemption is at issue. This effectively guarantees that high-\nincome debtors will not be able to shield their assets in their home \nand discharge their debts.\n  Finally, these and other general provisions of the bill and of \nexisting law grant any bankruptcy judge in the country the power to \ndisallow the use of the homestead or any other exemption, if it is \nbeing used improperly to shield assets. The bankruptcy judge can step \nin as well and say: No. I am not going to allow this to take place.\n\n  With all of these protections against abuse or fraud, one can only \nconclude that this amendment will have the effect of forcing middle-\nclass Americans to sell their homes if they encounter financial \ndifficulty.\n  As I stated, if this gets in the bill, I will be voting against the \noverall bankruptcy bill, and I will be fighting against it coming out \nof conference. I will be fighting against it in conference and on the \nfloor by every means possible. It is in the Kansas Constitution. Their \nright of a homestead is in it. It is in the constitution of several \nStates. It is something that has been used by farmers for generations \nand will continue to be used.\n  For those reasons, I will adamantly oppose the Kohl amendment, with \nas much respect as I have for the Senator from Wisconsin and his heart \nand his desire to see that people do not fraudulently keep too many of \ntheir assets. But it is going to have a detrimental impact on my State. \nI cannot support that.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I will briefly respond to the Senator from \nKansas.\n  He argues against changing what is in the current bill and is against \naccepting my amendment and believes that farmers would undergo an \nextreme correction.\n  This bill and its amendment can be crafted for acceptance on the \nfloor today to protect a farmer's exemption. There is a recognition \nthat the intention of this amendment is not to impoverish any farmers \nor homesteaders, as Senator Brownback has referred. And if that \nlanguage is not clear enough, we would be more than happy to work out \nthe farmer exemption, which is currently in our amendment. The intent \nof our amendment is not to do anything to get at family farmers who \nhave owned their land for many years and who would be impoverished \nbeyond reasonableness in a bankruptcy proceeding.\n  I don't think it is an argument that should be used against this \namendment because the amendment includes the recognition that farmers \nneed an exemption.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there is an attempt to start some votes in \nabout half an hour, at about 11:35. We have a long list of people who \nhave germane amendments. If any of those individuals wish to offer \ntheir amendments, this would be an ideal time to do that. As the day \nwears on, there is going to be less and less time to do that. There may \ncome a time when all time has expired and they will not be able to call \nup their amendments.\n  So if those people who have germane amendments wish to come and offer \nthem, they should do so because otherwise--I have spoken to Senator \nHatch and Senator Leahy, and we could be finished early this afternoon \non everything.\n  So I think the Senator from Utah would agree, Senators should get \nover here and get moving on these amendments; otherwise, there will \ncome a time this afternoon when there will not be any time and we will \nwrap up consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I agree with the distinguished Senator. I think we should \nmove ahead. I understand there is one other person, the distinguished \nSenator from Texas, who would like to speak on the Kohl amendment. \nAfter she gets here and gives her remarks, we intend to proceed to a \nvote on the Kohl amendment. Then we will try to stack votes on the two \nLeahy amendments, I think with a minute on each side to explain them, \nif I have that right. So we are hopeful we can move this.\n  Mr. REID. If my friend will yield, the mere fact that you have a \ngermane amendment does not mean it automatically is protected. There \nare certain procedures that have to be initiated before there can be a \nvote.\n  The point is, we have had some down time already this morning. We \nwill have some during the noon hour. These amendments could be called \nup.\n  So I hope people who have these amendments--they are listed; it would \nbe easy to ascertain who they are and what the amendments are--will \ncall them up as soon as possible.\n  There are some people who have already started calling the Cloakroom. \nThey have other things they want to do this evening and tomorrow and \nare asking us when we are going to be able to complete this bill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \nKohl-Feinstein amendment now before the Senate. I do so because it is \nunwarranted and unwise--it is an intrusion upon well-established State \nconstitutions and laws--and because it throws out the window a \ncarefully crafted compromise reached last year on this issue that \nvirtually guarantees the elimination of any fraud or abuse of State \nhomestead exemptions.\n  I am pleased to be joined in my opposition to this amendment by my \ncolleagues from Kansas and Florida, as well as the managers of the \nbill, Senators Hatch, Grassley, and Sessions, as well as our leader and \nassistant leader, Senators Lott and Nickles.\n  Also on our side is the President of the United States who has \nsingled out this issue in the bankruptcy debate and who supports the \nexisting language in the bill.\n  Finally, my colleagues should know that the National Governors' \nAssociation, the National Conference of State Legislatures, and the \nNational Association of Home Builders strongly oppose this amendment.\n  As my colleagues know, this amendment would impose a one-size-fits-\nall nationwide cap of $125,000 on all State homestead exemptions in \nbankruptcy. I must confess that I don't think you could, by any stretch \nof the imagination, say that property values in Wisconsin are the same \nas those in Florida or New York the same as those in California or \nTexas the same as those in Kansas. The arbitrary limit runs roughshod \nover the constitution and laws of at least nine States that have \nhomestead protection above that amount.\n  In my home State of Texas, we don't even mention amount. We go by \nacreage. It is in the State constitution. It has been there for over \n100 years. Other\n\n[[Page S2332]]\n\nStates that have different caps are Kansas, Iowa, South Dakota, \nOklahoma, Minnesota, and Massachusetts.\n\n  It would also immediately threaten the homestead exemptions of two \nother States, Nevada and California, which are right at the $125,000 \nfigure that is in their amendment. It would threaten two States, and it \nwould, frankly, threaten all States because there is no allowance in \nthe amendment for the rate of real estate inflation which we all know \nhas been on the rise in recent years.\n  This is a States rights issue. We have, for over 130 years, allowed \nthe States to set homestead exemptions because, clearly, property \nvalues are different in different States. Bankruptcy is a Federal \nissue. Homestead exemptions have been allowed to be set by the States \nbecause we differ in our approach to homesteads and to bankruptcy \nitself. It is important that we address this issue in a way that allows \nStates to have the ability to keep their constitutions intact. There is \nno overriding interest for us to run over a State constitution.\n  It is very important that we curb fraud and abuse. That is why this \nbill contains the airtight antifraud and antiabuse provisions that it \ndoes. Under this bill, you must live in a State for at least 2 years \nbefore you can even avail yourself of that State's homestead exemption. \nMoreover, even if you have lived in a State for more than 2 years, you \ncan only protect up to $100,000 in any new equity you obtain in that \nhome within 2 years of filing for bankruptcy. This eliminates the \nscenario of someone running to a State, buying a home, putting a lot of \nequity into it, and then filing for bankruptcy.\n  It is important that we look at this issue in the bigger picture of \nbankruptcy reform. When we took this amendment up last year, it passed \noverwhelmingly in the Senate. The House was diametrically opposed. The \nHouse had a State opt-out. That would have been my position, to keep \nStates rights in the homestead exemption as it has been for 130 years. \nI would like to have had the House position. I lost on the Senate \nfloor.\n  When this bill went to conference, this amendment was hammered out in \na very hard-fought conference negotiation. What was hammered out \nbetween the two Houses and agreed to by the House and Senate is what we \nhave in the bill today.\n  Senator Sessions and Senator Grassley were two of those who fought \nhard for the Kohl amendment last year. This year they are saying: Stay \nwith the bill so we can keep the compromise that was forged last year \nand so we will have a chance to get in place the other bankruptcy \nreforms that this bill provides.\n  They are doing something that I think has great integrity because \nthey are saying, we have hammered it out now let's stick to the \nagreement we made. In fact, I urged my colleagues on the House side not \nto go back to their original position because I thought the Senate \nwould stick with the bill. I think this goes against what we hammered \nout last year, and the bill was vetoed by President Clinton, so we are \nback this year. But President Bush, who has the ability to veto the \nbill again, has specifically said he hopes the provision that is in the \nbill that would be altered by the Kohl amendment stays in the bill.\n  If we vote for the Kohl amendment, we are now putting the bill in \njeopardy once again, and if we don't prevail in conference with what is \nin the bill today, we could face another delay or, possibly, a veto of \nthe bankruptcy reform bill.\n  So if you are a Senator who favors bankruptcy reform, you should not \nvote for the Kohl-Feinstein amendment. Instead, you should stick with \nthe bill, stick with the compromise that was forged in a bipartisan way \nin Congress last year between the House and the Senate, and let's allow \nStates to have the ability to set their own homestead exemptions, \nexcept in the case of fraud and abuse and in the case of someone who \nmoves and in 2 years declares bankruptcy.\n  I think the bill provides closure of every loophole that would allow \nsomeone to come in, buy a big house, declare bankruptcy, and still have \nthe big house in which to live. The statistics show that the \ndeclarations of bankruptcy in the last couple of years have actually \ngone down. So the purpose of the bankruptcy bill has been alleviated by \nthe fact that people are not declaring as many bankruptcies.\n  What we want to do is provide a fair bill that deals with creditors \nin a fair way but also requires that people pay their debts, if they \npossibly can. That is the purpose of the bankruptcy reform bill. \nRunning roughshod over States rights is not a good addition to this \nbill. And, of course, if we do run roughshod over States rights, I \ncould not possibly support a bill that would violate my State's \nconstitution. It would be unthinkable.\n  So I am urging my colleagues to set this to rest once and for all \nwith the compromise that was hard fought, but forged, last year between \nthe two Houses of Congress, if you believe in real bankruptcy reform. \nIf you do, we should not let this amendment derail the whole bill. If \nit passes and if it prevails, it will do so. I hope that does not \nhappen.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I will just respond to the Senator from \nTexas. I think one of the major arguments, if not the major argument, \nshe makes is that this amendment is about States rights, in her \nopinion, and that we should preserve States rights.\n  I want to make the point that, in my judgment, nothing could be \nfurther from the truth because anybody who files for bankruptcy is \nchoosing to invoke Federal law in a Federal court to get a fresh start, \nwhich is uniquely a Federal benefit. So in these circumstances it is \nonly fair to impose Federal kinds of limits.\n  In fact, this bill is full of provisions that do rewrite State law. \nFor example, one of the provisions in this bill establishes a Federal \nprovision that allows creditors to come into a debtor's home, if \nnecessary, to take their stereo and then sell it. So there is no reason \nFederal law should determine if you can keep a stereo but not the \namount of equity in your house. I believe this argument about States \nrights with respect to a Federal bankruptcy bill just doesn't equate.\n  The other point she makes is that we worked out a generous compromise \nand that is the one we should keep. That is the compromise that \nrequires 2 years of residency before you can keep the equity in your \nhouse to the full extent. Bankruptcy professors and practitioners \nacross our Nation have told us, and will tell you, that the 2-year \nresidency requirement is something that any planner can deal with in \nproviding for the bankruptcy of their client. So that is not an \nadequate kind of a resolution, and that is why we are here today to \nmake our arguments in favor of this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Wisconsin that I think the fact that we have a 7-year antifraud \nlookback certainly assures that someone who is planning a bankruptcy \nand comes in and makes the 2-year move is still going to be very \nvulnerable. In fact, that was part of the hard-fought compromise.\n  That 7-year antifraud lookback means it doesn't matter what else is \nin your favor if you have fraudulently tried to come in and, within 5 \nyears or 6 years--which it would be very hard to plan for--declare a \nbankruptcy; then you can go back 7 years to make sure you catch someone \nwho would defraud the court or the debtors and lenders of another \nState.\n  Secondly, I think that to take away what has been a State right for \n130 years is against the rest of the States rights that are allowed in \nthe exemptions the Federal courts take into account. We don't put a \nlimit on the value of personal property. Someone could have a fabulous \nart collection and defraud creditors, perhaps, in one State. We haven't \ntaken on that. They could have a great car collection that would not \nhave a cap.\n  The point is, if someone does this in a fraudulent way, we have steps \nin the bill that can be taken to keep someone from defrauding their \nlender. We take care of that in the bill. But we have different \nproperty values in different States. We have different valuations in \npersonal property, different valuations\n\n[[Page S2333]]\n\nof cars, and we in this country have acknowledged that, very wisely, \nfor the last 130 years.\n  It is certainly not unusual but, in fact, oftentimes the Federal \ncourts look to the State laws to be the guiding principle. So that is \nnot an argument not to allow States rights to prevail as they have for \n130 years in this country.\n  So I hope we will look at the bigger picture and keep States rights \nintact. We have amply provided for antifraud provisions in the \ncompromise that was forged between the two Houses last year. I hope the \nSenate will stick with that compromise and keep the integrity of the \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I want to respond briefly. There is in the \nbankruptcy code today a limit on cars. I think it is $5,000. There is a \nlimit on art, along with other provisions, which I think is at $8,000. \nThe claim that you can shield an unlimited amount of art, or a fabulous \ncar collection, in a bankruptcy proceeding today is simply not true.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will respond by saying the States \nset their own limit on personal property.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I understand the distinguished Senator from \nFlorida would like to speak prior to the vote. How much time does the \nSenator desire?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. And the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin would like \nsome time to respond?\n  Mr. KOHL. I am prepared to yield my time if we want to vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent after the 10 minutes of the \ndistinguished Senator from Florida, all time be yielded back in \nrelation to the pending Kohl amendment; that further, the Senate \nproceed to a vote in relation to the amendment at that time, which \nwould be approximately 11:41, to be immediately followed by a vote in \nrelation to the Leahy amendment numbered 41.\n  Finally, I ask consent that the second vote in the series, that is, \nthe Leahy amendment, be limited to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I will not object other than to inform Senators that it \nappears, following the two votes, Senator Boxer will be over to offer \nher amendment. Then we really don't have many amendments remaining. \nSenator Feingold has two amendments and he has tentatively agreed to \ntime agreements. We have Wellstone amendments of which we have to \ndispose. I don't know if he will offer more, but we have at least three \nvotes there. Senator Leahy has a number of issues to be resolved and, \nof course, Senator Sessions. We need to work on matters he wants to \nbring up. We are getting down to the end of this bill. With a little \nbit of luck, we could be completed late this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, the Florida Constitution grants \nthe citizens of my State unlimited protection of the equity in their \nhomes. I think we can all agree that this provision was not created so \nthat wealthy, non-resident debtors could escape their obligations. The \nprovision was created because the people of my State understood the \nimportance of preserving a debtor's most essential asset, their home.\n  I do not think that a previously wealthy person should have the right \nto purchase a very expensive home in order to shield his remaining \nassets from creditors, and I do agree that we must address homestead \nabuse. But, we should not take away the homes of innocent debtors who \nhave worked hard to build equity in their homestead. The median income \nof debtors in bankruptcy is $22,000 per year. Working people in that \nincome range do not have the ability to shelter a significant amount of \nmoney in a home.\n  My State has many retirees from around the country. Many have worked \ntheir entire lives to own their own home and under the Kohl amendment \nthey may lose their residence even though they fell into hard times \nthrough no fault of their own. Forcing a bankrupt retiree out of her \nhome simply because she has more than $125,000 in equity does not meet \nany standard of fair play.\n  The $125,000 cap proposed by this amendment does not adequately \nrepresent the value of homes in Florida today and certainly will not \nreflect the value of homes five years from now. The Kohl amendment's \ncatch-all, national cap ignores the differences in property value that \nvary not only from State to State, but also from city to city. \nFurthermore, the amendment unfairly lumps long-time residents and \nretirees into the same category as abusers who move to the State one \nday and file for bankruptcy the next.\n  The current language of S. 420 avoids these problems by protecting \nhomeowners who have fallen on hard times, but who have worked and \nplayed by the rules in a State for more than 2 years. The current \nlanguage is clear, if you move to a State simply to avoid paying your \ncreditors you will not be protected and you should not be protected. \nHowever, people who play by the rules will have a real chance to start \nover without losing the equity in their homes.\n  I ask my colleagues today to protect the home equity of those debtors \nwho legitimately need a fresh start by opposing this amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Kohl-\nFeinstein amendment to cap the homestead exemption at $125,000 for all \nStates, and to eliminate from our bankruptcy laws a loophole so large \nthat you could fit a $50 million mansion right through it.\n  This amendment will correct a longstanding discrepancy between the \nStates, a discrepancy that on the one hand forces most debtors to \nstruggle to pay back every dime they owe, but on the other hand allows \nmany of the most ``wealthy'' debtors declaring bankruptcy to shield \ntheir assets in multi-million dollar homes.\n  The discrepancy I speak of occurs because in five States, Florida, \nTexas, South Dakota, Iowa and Kansas, where debtors are allowed to keep \ntheir homes no matter what they owe, or to whom they owe it, and no \nmatter how much the home is worth.\n  The ``homestead'' laws in these five States differ radically from the \nother 45:\n  Many States have virtually no homestead exemption at all. In \nMichigan, for instance, the cap is $3,500; in Pennsylvania, just $300.\n  Other States, recognizing a benefit in allowing debtors some ability \nto remain in their homes as they dig out of bankruptcy, place slightly \nhigher caps on their homestead exemptions and allow debtors to keep \n$15,000, $30,000, $60,000, or even $75,000 equity in their homes.\n  My own State of California has a sliding scale cap, ranging from \n$75,000 for most debtors to $125,000 for seniors.\n  Massachusetts and Minnesota have relatively high caps of $200,000, \nand Minnesota's cap even goes to $500,000 for farms, the highest cap of \nall the States that have at least some restriction on how much equity \ncan be protected.\n  A vast majority of the 50 States have homestead caps of under \n$125,000, and this bill would do nothing to affect those States.\n  The glaring exceptions are those five cases where a State has chosen \nto allow debtors to hide assets in luxury homesteads and essentially \navoid their obligations under Federal bankruptcy law.\n  What does this mean? This means that wealthy debtors facing \nbankruptcy can take their remaining assets, buy a home in one of those \nfive States, and tell their creditors to get lost. Their assets are \nprotected permanently.\n  Let me give an example of homestead abuse that has been highlighted \nin the press and even on ``Sixty Minutes.''\n  When this Wall Street financier and convicted felon finally declared \nbankruptcy, he listed more than $140 million in debts and only $15,805 \nin assets.\n  But one particular asset was not itemized, and the financier was not \nobligated to itemize it. That asset was his 37,000 square foot Florida \nmansion, worth an estimated five to $6 million.\n  This ``house'' has ten bedrooms, two libraries, a business center, a \ndouble gourmet kitchen, an indoor squash and\n\n[[Page S2334]]\n\nracquetball court, an indoor basketball court complete with electronic \nscoreboard, a private movie theater, full weight and exercise rooms, a \nswimming pool, a spa, an outdoor entertainment area, game rooms, a \nnine-car garage, a lakefront gazebo, an elevator, 21 bathrooms, and a \n6,000 square foot quest house.\n  The quest house alone has been described as a mansion in and of \nitself.\n  But in Florida, the entire home, 21 bathrooms and all, as well as the \nproperty on which it sits, is completely exempt from the bankruptcy \nlaws. The ``bankrupt'' financier owes millions, but through careful \nplanning he can continue to live like a king.\n  Meanwhile, his creditors can only stand outside the gates of the home \nand look with awe upon the home they paid for--$140 million in debts, \nand nothing his creditors can do.\n  And this case is not all that unique. Actors, Wall Street financiers, \nparticipants in felonious savings and loan scandals, and others, all \nhave taken advantage of the homestead exemption loophole.\n  Essentially, these five States act as heavens for the most determined \navoiders of debt, an escape of last resort for wealthy individuals who \nplay fast and loose with their money.\n  A General Accounting Office study of bankrupt debtors who take \nadvantage of the homestead loophole in Florida and Texas alone found \nthat each year more than 400 wealthy debtors are able to protect more \nthan $100,000 in equity in their home, at a cost to creditors of $120 \nmillion.\n  The bankruptcy reform bill as a whole attempts to increase personal \nresponsibility by forcing more people to repay more of their debts. \nThis goal is a good one, but the bill as drafted sends mixed signals.\n  To poor debtors struggling to climb out of bankruptcy and to simply \nput a roof over the heads of their family, the bill takes a stern view, \ndebts must be paid back, assets must be sold, and you'll face some hard \nyears ahead.\n  To more sophisticated debtors, many of whom had every advantage \nbefore making the bad, or even criminal, decisions that led to \nbankruptcy, the bill says that with a little planning, you can get away \nscot free.\n  This is just plain wrong.\n  This bankruptcy bill forces lower- and middle-class families to give \nup the family computer in many instances.\n  The bill takes your second television set and even family heirlooms.\n  The bill requires most debtors to enter strict payment plans to pay \nback even extraordinary medical or other debts incurred due to \ncircumstances beyond their control.\n  Yet the homestead exemption allows sophisticated debtors to avoid \nrepayment entirely.\n  This must be changed.\n  That is why Senator Kohl and I are proposing a cap of $125,000. For \nStates that already have a cap of or below that $125,000 level, and \nthis is almost every State in the Union, this amendment will do nothing \nto change current bankruptcy proceedings.\n  For those few States that have chosen to provide a safe haven for \ndebtors fleeing from their creditors, this amendment will create a new, \nnational cap that must be followed.\n  The last time the Senate considered a homestead cap, an even lower \n$100,000, we approved of the cap by an overwhelming margin.\n  The provision was watered down during a shadow conference so that in \nthe end, the conference report and now this bill do virtually nothing \nto prevent debtors from shielding millions of dollars in luxurious \nmansions.\n  Some will argue that the current bill does provide a ``compromise'' \nhomestead exemption cap.\n  As drafted, that cap only applies if a debtor purchases a home within \ntwo years of bankruptcy. Any good bankruptcy attorney will tell you \nthat this provision can be easily avoided. In fact, dozens of \nprofessors and attorneys have told us just that. I ask unanimous \nconsent that their letter be printed in the Record after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Under this so-called ``compromise'' language, as long \nas a debtor plans a couple of years in advance, or already lives in one \nof those five States, there is no cap. This is a very soft cap, indeed.\n  So the current language in the bill does not represent a real \ncompromise, it does little to stop wealthy debtors from protecting \ntheir assets through bankruptcy and living the rest of their lives in \nluxury, while leaving their creditors with nothing.\n  Bankruptcy is a federal matter. In fact, our Constitution explicitly \ngives Congress the right to establish ``uniform laws on the subject of \nbankruptcies throughout the United States.''\n  So this Congress is constitutionally authorized, even obligated, to \nsee that bankruptcy laws are fair and uniform throughout our Nation.\n  We must ensure that bankruptcy is a refuge of last resort for those \ntruly in need of a fresh start, not just another financial planning \ntool to help felons and deadbeats protect their assets from creditors.\n  This bill rightly encourages responsibility for those who enter \nbankruptcy, so that those who can pay their debts, do pay their debts.\n  But we must encourage responsibility across the board, not just for \nthose who cannot afford a god accountant or don't happen to live in \nTexas, Florida, Iowa, South Dakota or Kansas.\n  I urge my colleagues to support his amendment. I thank my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Kohl, for working so diligently on \nthis amendment.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                 October 30, 2000.\n     Re the Bankruptcy Reform Act Conference Report (H.R. 2415).\n\n       Dear Senators: We are professors of bankruptcy and \n     commercial law. We have been following the bankruptcy reform \n     process with keen interest. The 91 undersigned professors \n     come from every region of the country and from all major \n     political parties. We are not a partisan, organized group, \n     and we have no agenda. Our exclusive interest is to seek the \n     enactment of a fair and just bankruptcy law, with appropriate \n     regard given to the interests of debtors and creditors alike. \n     Many of us have written before to express our concerns about \n     the bankruptcy legislation, and we write again as yet another \n     version of the bill comes before you. This bill is deeply \n     flawed, and we hope the Senate will not act on it in the \n     closing minutes of this session.\n       In a letter to you dated September 7, 1999, 82 professors \n     of bankruptcy law from across the country expressed their \n     grave concerns about some of the provisions of S. 625, \n     particularly the effects of the bill on women and children. \n     We wrote again on November 2, 1999, to reiterate our \n     concerns. We write yet again to bring the same message: the \n     problems with the bankruptcy bill have not been resolved, \n     particularly those provisions that adversely affect women and \n     children.\n       Notwithstanding the unsupported claims of the bill's \n     proponents, H.R. 2415 does not help women and children. \n     Thirty-one organizations devoted exclusively to promoting the \n     best interests of women and children continue to oppose the \n     pending bankruptcy bill. The concerns expressed in our \n     earlier letters showing how S. 625 would hurt women and \n     children have not been resolved. Indeed, they have not even \n     been addressed.\n       First, one of the biggest problems the bill presents for \n     women and children was stated in the September 7, 1999, \n     letter: ``Women and children as creditors will have to \n     compete with powerful creditors to collect their claims after \n     bankruptcy.'' This increased competition for women and \n     children will come from many quarters: from powerful credit \n     card issuers, whose credit card claims increasingly will be \n     excepted from discharge and remain legal obligations of the \n     debtor after bankruptcy; from large retailers, who will have \n     an easier time obtaining reaffirmations of debt that legally \n     could be discharged; and from creditors claiming they hold \n     security, even when the alleged collateral is virtually \n     worthless. None of the changes made to S. 625 and none being \n     proposed in H.R. 2415 addresses these problems. The truth \n     remains: if H.R. 2415 is enacted in its current form, women \n     and children will face increased competition in collecting \n     their alimony and support claims after the bankruptcy case is \n     over. We have pointed out this difficulty repeatedly, but no \n     change has been made in the bill to address it.\n       Second, it is a distraction to argue--as do advocates of \n     the bill--that the bill will ``help'' women and children and \n     that it will ``make child support and alimony payments the \n     top priority--no exceptions.'' As the law professors pointed \n     out in the September 7, 1999, letter: ``Giving `first \n     priority' to domestic support obligations does not address \n     the problem.'' Granting ``first priority'' to alimony and \n     support claims is not the magic solution the consumer credit \n     industry claims because ``priority'' is relevant only for \n     distributions made to creditors in the bankruptcy case \n     itself. Such distributions are made in only a negligible \n     percentage of cases. More than 95 percent of bankruptcy cases \n     make NO distributions to any creditors because there are no \n     assets to distribute.\n\n[[Page S2335]]\n\n     Granting women and children a first priority for bankruptcy \n     distributions permits them to stand first in line to collect \n     nothing.\n       Women's hard-fought battle is over reaching the ex-\n     husband's income after bankruptcy. Under current law, child \n     support and alimony share a protected post-bankruptcy \n     position with only two other recurrent collectors of debt--\n     taxes and student loans. The credit industry asks that credit \n     card debt and other consumer credit share that position, \n     thereby elbowing aside the women trying to collect on their \n     own behalf. The credit industry carefully avoids discussing \n     the increased post-bankruptcy competition facing women if \n     H.R. 2415 becomes law. As a matter of public policy, this \n     country should not elevate credit card debt to the preferred \n     position of taxes and child support. Once again, we have \n     pointed out this problem repeatedly, and nothing has been \n     changed in the pending legislation to address it.\n       In addition to the concerns raised on behalf of the \n     thousands of women who are struggling now to collect alimony \n     and child support after their ex-husband's bankruptcies, we \n     also express our concerns on behalf of the more than half a \n     million women heads of household who will file for bankruptcy \n     this year alone. As the heads of the economically most \n     vulnerable families, they have a special stake in the pending \n     legislation. Women heads of households are now the largest \n     demographic group in bankruptcy, and according to the credit \n     industry's own data, they are the poorest. The provisions in \n     this bill, particularly the many provisions that apply \n     without regard to income, will fall hardest on them. Under \n     this bill, a single mother with dependent children who is \n     hopelessly insolvent and whose income is far below the \n     national median income would have her bankruptcy case \n     dismissed if she does not present copies of income tax \n     returns for the past three years--even if those returns are \n     in the possession of her ex-husband. A single mother who \n     hoped to work through a chapter 13 payment plan would be \n     forced to pay every penny of the entire debt owed on almost \n     worthless items of collateral, such as used furniture or \n     children's clothes, even if it meant that successful \n     completion of a repayment plan was impossible.\n       Finally, when the Senate passed S. 625, we were hopeful \n     that the final bankruptcy legislation would include a \n     meaningful homestead provision to address flagrant abuse in \n     the bankruptcy system. Instead, the conference report \n     retreats from the concept underlying the Senate-passed \n     homestead amendment. ``The homestead provision in the \n     conference report will allow wealthy debtors to hide assets \n     from their creditors.'' Current bankruptcy law yields to \n     state law to determine what property shall remain exempt \n     from creditor attachment and levy. Homestead exemptions \n     are highly variable by state, and six states (Florida, \n     Iowa, Kansas, South Dakota, Texas, Oklahoma) have \n     literally unlimited exemptions while twenty-two states \n     have exemptions of $10,000 or less. The variation among \n     states leads to two problems--basic inequality and \n     strategic bankruptcy planning. The only solution is a \n     dollar cap on the homestead exemption. Although variation \n     among states would remain, the most outrageous abuses--\n     those in the multi-million dollar category--would be \n     eliminated.\n       The homestead provision in the conference report does \n     little to address the problem. The legislation only requires \n     a debtor to wait two years after the purchase of the \n     homestead before filing a bankruptcy case. Well-counseled \n     debtors will have no problem timing their bankruptcies or \n     tying-up the courts in litigation to skirt the intent of this \n     provision. The proposed change will remind debtors to buy \n     their property early, but it will not deny anyone with \n     substantial assets a chance to protect property from their \n     creditors. Furthermore, debtors who are long-time residents \n     of states like Texas and Florida will continue to enjoy a \n     homestead exemption that can shield literally millions of \n     dollars in value.\n       These facts are unassailable: H.R. 2415 forces women to \n     compete with sophisticated creditors to collect alimony and \n     child support after bankruptcy. H.R. 2415 makes it harder for \n     women to declare bankruptcy when they are in financial \n     trouble. H.R. 2415 fails to close the glaring homestead \n     loophole and permits wealthy debtors to hide assets from \n     their creditors. We implore you to look beyond the distorted \n     ``facts'' peddled by the credit industry. Please do not pass \n     a bill that will hurt vulnerable Americans, including women \n     and children.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n       [Signed by 91 law professors.]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask for the yeas and nays on the Kohl amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, for 133 years, since Congress established \na Federal personal bankruptcy law, there has been a recognition that \nthe law is a balance of the interests of the National Government in \nuniformity and the interests of the States in terms of local values and \ncircumstances. Federal law presently allows States, for instance, to \nestablish how much of their residents' property can be protected or \nexempt from seizure during bankruptcy.\n  This delicate relationship tests our fundamental commitment to the \nconcept of federalism. Everybody is for federalism. Everyone favors \nmore local control, placing decisions closest to those who are \ninvolved, until it begins to affect a specific interest of their own. \nThen they become what I refer to as ``situational federalists.'' If the \nsituation does not result in a conclusion that is to your liking, you \ndecide that federalism becomes a lesser value.\n  We are being tested today on, do we believe, as this Congress has for \n133 years, that personal bankruptcy should be a balance of the \ninterests of uniformity at the national level, but recognize the \nlegitimate interests of the States and their citizens in protecting \ncertain important values.\n  Since most of the creditor-debtor relationships tend to be within a \nsingle State, this is an issue in which States have had to make the \nsame kinds of hard choices that we have been dealing with in \nconsideration of this bill: How to set the proper balance between the \nperson who has indebted himself and who is now unable to meet their \nresponsibilities against the person who has extended that credit.\n  Many States, including my own, have placed such an importance on \nprotecting the value of the residence in which an individual lives that \nthey have enshrined that in their State constitution.\n  I have the following commentaries on the amendment before us as it \nrelates to that Federal-State balance. The amendment makes no allowance \nfor the wide variance in property values from State to State. There are \nplaces in America where if you live in a home valued at $125,000, it is \na veritable mansion. There are other places in America where a home \nvalued at $125,000 meets minimum adequacy standards. This bill provides \nonly one standard to cover the wide range of circumstances.\n  The standard itself, even by national standards, is inadequate. The \nnational average value of existing single family homes in the United \nStates of America is $176,000, $51,000 higher than the proposed cap on \nthe amount that can be exempt from foreclosure in bankruptcy. This \namendment would threaten home ownership for millions of American \nfamilies.\n  States also have given special recognition to individual classes of \npersons as it relates to the exemption. For instance, some States have \nrecognized a different standard for seniors or disabled citizens and \nproviding additional homestead protection when they experience a \nserious illness or other financial crisis. We know, for instance, that \nseniors tend to have a higher proportion of their net worth in the \nequity of their home, typically because they have been living in the \nhome for an extended period of time and have paid down the mortgage. \nThe circumstance of older Americans will become more pronounced in the \nimmediate future because within two decades 54 million Americans will \nbe 65 years of age or older. An estimated two-thirds of these seniors \nwill own their own homes free and clear.\n\n  This amendment makes no allowance for real estate inflation. In the \nlast few years, parts of America have been experiencing a real estate \ninflation on residential housing above 10 percent per year. Fewer and \nfewer States will be able to protect home and farm ownership in the \nsame way they do now as real estate purchasing power of the $125,000 \nlimit contained in this amendment is eroded by inflation.\n  As the Senator from Texas has already stated, this bill does not \nignore, is not unmindful of this balance between the National \nGovernment's interest in uniformity and the State's interest in the \nparticular circumstances of its citizens. This bill contains \ncompromised language on the homestead issue which was adopted during \ndebate on the bill last year and has already been approved once by the \nSenate.\n  As an example, in this bill before the Senate, without the amendment \nthat has been proposed, the homestead exemption would be capped at \n$100,000, with an inflation adjustment provision for any property \npurchased within 2 years of filing for bankruptcy. So the case that is \nfrequently cited as the reason to require this amendment, the\n\n[[Page S2336]]\n\nperson who rushes into a State such as mine which has an exemption of \nthe residential property from bankruptcy in the last moments before \nthey declare, will not be the case. If you have not owned that home for \n2 years before declaring bankruptcy, your exemption is limited to \n$100,000 adjusted for inflation.\n  There is a further requirement before a debtor can use the homestead \nexemption in a particular State that he or she must have been a \nresident of that State for more than 2 years--again, an appropriate \nrecognition of the national desire for uniformity.\n  Additionally, these and other provisions of the bill and of existing \nlaw grant any bankruptcy judge in the country the power to disallow the \nuse of the homestead or any other exemption if it is being used \nimproperly to shield assets.\n  So this legislation contains effective barriers to inappropriate use \nof the homestead exemption while recognizing the 130-year theory of \nFederal relationship within the personal bankruptcy law between \nnational uniformity and State values.\n  This amendment tests our commitment to the fundamental principle of \nfederalism. The States and the Federal Government share in the \nresponsibility for developing and applying our bankruptcy code. In my \njudgment, this amendment distorts that relationship. The provisions \nthat are already in the bill honor federalism.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I move to table the Kohl amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is still time remaining. That motion is \nnot in order at the present time.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I request just 1 minute.\n  Mr. HATCH. I request the Senator have 1 minute.\n  Mr. KOHL. I will respond to some of the comments made by the \ndistinguished Senator from Florida.\n  We need to recognize there is no question in this legislation that we \nhave every right and have, in fact, asserted a Federal right in \nbankruptcy legislation. We have done it in many cases in this \nlegislation. To suggest we do not have the right or it is improper to \nassert in bankruptcy a Federal right in establishing a minimum amount \nto shield a home just is not consistent with the rest of this \nlegislation.\n  I also want to point out that the $125,000 limit we imposed is \nnegotiable in conference to $150,000 to $200,000. There are only five \nStates with unlimited exemptions. There are only two States with \nexemptions in excess of $125,000--Minnesota and Massachusetts, which \nhave $200,000. So it is not difficult to correct any of these problems \nin conference.\n  Again, by a vote of 76-22 2 years ago, we accepted this amendment. I \nam requesting and hoping the Senate will again vote to accept this \namendment today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield back his time?\n  Mr. KOHL. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

It permits a debtor to withhold the name \nof a minor child in the public record, especially as these records go \non the Internet where anybody who wants the names and addresses of \nchildren can find them. To prevent fraud, it permits the judge, or \ntrustee, or an auditor to review a child's name in a nonpublic record.\n  The amendment is modest, but it is a first step in protecting \npersonal privacy and protecting criminal activity through the \nunnecessary disclosure of personal information.

Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask my friend from Utah to change the \nunanimous consent agreement as follows: That immediately the senior \nSenator from West Virginia would be recognized and use whatever period \nof time up to an hour that he wishes. I have been told by the Senator \nhe would yield to Senator Boxer so she could offer her amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is appropriate and fine with me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if I might, I so appreciate the \nopportunity to offer the amendment. I know Senator Byrd is going to \nyield to me to do that and then he will get the floor. I just want to \nmake sure we can vote on that in the next block, which we are hoping \nwill be around the 2:30 area.\n  Mr. REID. It is in the unanimous consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I ask unanimous consent \nthat I may yield to the distinguished minority whip without losing my \nright to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID.

This is an amendment about which I care an \nawful lot. Senator Clinton cares a lot about this. We just want to take \na brief time, and speak as concisely as we can, to explain why we \nbelieve this amendment is so important.\n  I think I must call up amendment No. 42 because I have this amendment \npending at the desk, and I ask the clerk to report it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 42.\n       Strike Section 310.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very sad to say that there is great \ncontroversy surrounding this amendment because there is a \nmisunderstanding about it. I guess what I want to say is I am putting \nmy faith in a number of groups that have written to me about the \ncurrent status of this bill. I would like to put the names of those \ngroups up on the easel right now. These are groups that have very \nastute attorneys who have studied this bill. They have enlisted our \nsupport. We are about to tell you who they are:\n  The American Association of University Women, Children NOW, \nChildren's Defense Fund, Center for Law and Social Policy, Feminist \nMajority, National Association of Commissions For Women, National \nCenter for Youth Law, National Organization for Women, National \nPartnership for Women and Families, National Youth Law Center, National \nWomen's Conference, National Women's Law Center, NOW Legal Defense and \nEducation Fund, the Older Women's League, the Women Activist Fund, \nWider Opportunities for Women, Women Employed, Women Work, Women's Law \nCenter of Maryland, and the YWCA.\n  I put my faith in these groups. Their purpose is to protect women and \nchildren. I believe they are correct when they say this bill will hurt \nwomen and children. Let me explain their position, and mine.\n  Under the current bankruptcy laws--I want you to remember this \nnumber, $1,075--it is presumed that 60 days before you declare \nbankruptcy, if you have accumulated charges of $1,075 or more, then \nthose charges are presumed fraudulent and the credit card companies can \ngo after those charges. I think it is fair. This number did not come \nout of the air. It has been adjusted for inflation. It makes sense. I \nthink the credit card companies have the right to say, if you are going \nto declare bankruptcy and you have charged that much, that you should \nnot be able to discharge it.\n  Let me tell you what happens in S. 420. That number, rather than \nbeing increased for inflation, is brought down to $250 over 90 days. So \nif someone charges, in that 90-day period, more than $250, all charges \non that card in a 90-day period are presumed to be fraudulent and the \ncredit card companies can go after you.\n  Can you prove these were not luxuries? Sure. You could take time off \nfrom work, time away from your children. Can you hire a lawyer? You can \nfight the credit card companies. But it just makes me ill to think we \nare presuming that a single woman who may be plagued with all kinds of \nproblems who used her credit card to purchase food at the supermarket \nwould in fact be told that she is a fraud, that she meant to defraud \nthe poor credit card companies.\n  I have to tell you a story.\n  The member of my family who has part-time work and is going through a \ndifficult time right now just received today an application for a \ncredit card where they say: Take a trip to exotic lands and put it on \nyour credit card. It happens to be Diners Club. And, don't worry about \npaying it back for months. The poor credit card company. You would \nthink they would investigate to whom they were sending these cards. \nBut, no, they want us to protect them from some poor woman with a \nsingle child, perhaps, or two, who is struggling with a divorce, and \nlet us say is charging $250 on her credit card over 90 days. These \ncharges are fraudulent.\n\n[[Page S2338]]\n\n  Let me read for you a letter that was sent to me by a women's group, \nand then I am going to yield 5 minutes to Senator Clinton.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If the Chair would inform me when I have used another 5 \nminutes, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you.\n  This is the letter:\n\n       The undersigned women's and children's organizations write \n     to urge you to support Senator Boxer's amendment to S. 420, \n     the ``Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2001.'' This amendment is \n     necessary to protect parents and children owed child support \n     from facing increased competition from credit card companies \n     after bankruptcy.\n       Senator Boxer's amendment to the ``luxury goods'' provision \n     of S. 420 would prevent credit card debt from being routinely \n     elevated to the same protected status as child support and \n     alimony obligations after bankruptcy. Under current law, \n     child support and alimony are among the few debts that are \n     not dischargeable in bankruptcy. The bankruptcy process \n     allows debtors to get back on their feet and focus their \n     resources on paying their most important debt: their \n     obligation to support their families. Credit card debts \n     generally are discharged in bankruptcy, unless there has been \n     an abuse of the bankruptcy process; for example, by \n     purchasing ``luxury goods'' on the eve of filing for \n     bankruptcy.\n       S. 420 would apply the label ``luxury goods'' to very \n     modest levels of expenditures, allowing much more credit care \n     debt to survive bankruptcy and compete with support \n     obligations. Under S. 420, purchases on a credit card that \n     total $250 over the 90-day period prior to filing bankruptcy \n     would be presumed to be nondischargeable ``luxury goods.'' \n     For example, a debtor who charged just $25 a week at the \n     supermarket would have to prove that the purchases--because \n     they would exceed $250 over the 90-day period--were \n     necessities, not luxuries. Cash advances of any more than $75 \n     per week in the 70 days before filing for bankruptcy would be \n     presumed to be nondischargeable.\n       Senator Boxer's amendment would retain the current ``luxury \n     goods'' exception, preventing abuse of the bankruptcy process \n     by debtors without allowing its abuse by the credit card \n     industry. We urge you to support this important amendment to \n     prevent the credit card industry from making it even more \n     difficult for women and children to collect child support \n     after bankruptcy.\n\n  I already talked about how credit card companies solicit and coax \npeople into spending more than they earn.\n  I do not feel sorry for the companies. I have seen the interest \nrates. I have seen the profits. Mr. President, $250 is not an amount \nthat says it is a luxury over a 90-day period.\n  Where is the committee coming from? I don't understand it.\n  Let's take an example. A woman who grocery shops with a credit card \nfor her family of four at the local Safeway or Albertson's would be \nable to spend no more than $25 per week in the 12 weeks before \ndeclaring bankruptcy. It is true. My colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle say: No problem. They just have to prove that in a court of \nlaw as they go through the filing.\n  This is a mother who is going through probably a hellish time in her \nlife and she now has to dig out the receipts, or get a lawyer, by the \nway, or take off from work. Why are we presuming that a person is bad \nif they charge $250 over 90 days before they file bankruptcy? Can't we \ngive people a break? Don't we respect the American people? People do \nnot want to do this. Keep the current law.\n  There are many other examples I could show you, all of which they \nwould have to prove in a court of law. The burden is on them. Why not \ngive this exemption? Why not keep the current law?\n  That is the purpose of this amendment. It just says trust folks a \nlittle bit more. That is why I believe very strongly.\n  I ask Senator Clinton if she would now wish to use 5 minutes on this \namendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes remaining on her \ntime.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask the Senator to take 4 minutes and I will wrap it \nup.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 104\n\n  First, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order, considered \ngermane for the purpose of S. 420, and the following agreed to: In the \namendment on behalf of myself and Mr. Hatch, on page 80, line 25, after \nthe word ``resides)'' add the following: ``, and the holder of the \nclaim,''.\n  I ask that this be adopted because this remedies the problem that was \nalso brought to our attention with respect to this particular \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 104) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       At page 80, on line 25, after ``resides)'' insert the \n     following: ``, and the holder of the claim,''.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 42\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise to support my very good friend, \nthe Senator from California, who is one of the strongest advocates on \nbehalf of women and children in our entire country. I do so because I \nfind myself in agreement that there is some confusion about the meaning \nand application of this provision. That certainly should be clarified \nbefore we move to a vote on the underlying legislation.\n  As the Senator has so eloquently stated, we are making a dramatic \nchange in both cutting the amount and the period of time for which a \ndebtor would be held accountable with respect to any luxury goods or \nservices.\n  I respect my very good friend, the Senator from Delaware, in his \npointing out that the legislation makes clear that this is not goods \nfor services and is reasonably necessary for the support or maintenance \nof the debtor or a dependent of the debtor.\n  We have several issues with this. One which the Senator from \nCalifornia pointed out is the size and the timing. The other is to make \nclear that this presumption is absolutely sustainable with respect to \nthe meaning of support and maintenance.\n  I urge that we adopt the amendment of the Senator from California \nbecause I believe it is reasonable for existing law to have the amount \nand the time period.\n  I don't believe it is a great disservice to the credit card companies \nand other creditors to keep the status quo in this provision since we \nare so dramatically changing the law in so many other respects.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. How much time is remaining, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank Senator Clinton for her support. I know Senator \nBiden would like to have some time. I am glad he got that by unanimous \nconsent.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, since he has the floor, whether I can use up to 5 minutes of \nthe hour I have under cloture.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have no objection to such a request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will be necessarily brief.\n  First of all, with regard to the credit card companies, this isn't a \nproblem for credit card companies. If you go to the grocery store and \nuse a credit card, it lists the grocery store. You have an automatic \nreceipt. There is a presumption that you went to the grocery store and \nyou bought groceries. They are not luxury goods. That is automatic. You \ncould go in and charge $1,000 of groceries on that credit card and \nthere would be no problem.\n  Second, if you take a look at what we are talking about, in addition \nto the credit card companies, you can draw up to $750 in cash. You if \ngo above $750, you have to explain. If you go up to $749 in cash, you \ndon't have to explain anything to anybody.\n  We are talking about the mother who is in real trouble and can't pay \nher bills. I am as sympathetic to that as anyone. But that is not with \nthis is about. We are misreading.\n  First of all, it applies to only luxury goods. On page 147, line 2, a \nconsumer's debt owed to a single creditor--if you have five different \ncredit cards and go out and charge $250 on five different credit cards, \nit doesn't matter. This is a bunch of malarkey, with all due respect.\n  I understand the intention, and I think this is just a misreading of \nthe legislation.\n  Let me speak to the issue of my good friend. I happen to be on the \nopposite\n\n[[Page S2339]]\n\nside of Senator Boxer. She is literally my closest friend in the \nSenate. I don't like doing this. But here is the deal.\n  Her staff--my former staff--is telling her how this works, as well as \nthese groups are telling her how this works. This is how it works. When \nyou file for bankruptcy, you go before a bankruptcy judge or you go \nbefore a master. You have to show up. You have to pay for the cab or \nthe bus to get there. You have to be there.\n  When you get there, it is a one-stop shopping deal. You have a list, \nand you have to submit what you spent. You have to submit everything as \nto why you deserve to go into chapter 13. It is required under the law. \nFor anybody now--no matter when--it is required.\n  So you have the list and the credit card. You list the credit card. \nYou have all these groceries you bought on the credit card. They are \nlisted. The problem is the non-credit-card guys. You go into Boscov's--\nand you have credit with Boscov's--and you decide to buy a couch. It is \narguable whether that is a luxury good or not. Boscov's might want to \nfight you about that. They then have to come into court and say: Hey, \njudge, that was a couch she bought. That was not a luxury good, she \nsays. No, no. It was a crib for my baby. Well, then, file the receipt. \nWas it a crib for a baby and/or was it a brand new leather couch? What \nis the deal?\n  Look, I will do anything I can to change this to accommodate what the \nconcern is of my friends. But I do not understand the concern. It says \n``Per creditor.'' You could have five credit cards, No. 1. No. 2, you \ncan take up to $750 in cash out per credit card that you have. You can \ntake it out. No. 3, you can go in and spend $249 on a zircon ring for \nyour daughter because it has been a bad day at Boscov's. That is a \nluxury good, but you can do that. And, No. 4, you can take all your \ncredit cards and/or your checking account and/or anything and buy \n$10,000 worth of jeans for your kids--shirts for your baby, formula--\nwhatever dire example I am going to be given here.\n  Look, with all due respect, this is much ado about nothing. It is the \nsame way in which you would have to go in under $10,750 under the law \nnow. How do you do it now?\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is $1,075.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Excuse me, $1,075. You walk in now and say: Judge, here is \nmy form. You get a date to show up or you are going to be discharged \nfrom bankruptcy, whether you are going to be in chapter 7 or chapter \n13. You walk in--with or without a lawyer--and say: Your Honor, here is \nthe deal. And you list your debt. You list your obligations and you \nlist your assets. You have to do that no matter what.\n  If you list $1,075 now, and it turns out you bought $1,075 worth of \ngood wine, the creditor can come in and say: Whoa, they bought wine \nwith that--in grocery stores like when I used to stack Schaefer beer in \nNew York State when I was in law school working for the Schaefer beer \ncompany. They do not sell alcohol in those stores in my State, but in \nNew York State I think they still do. If you say you bought $1,075 \nworth of beer, then it is not dischargeable. That would not be \ndischargeable, any more than $250 or $750 would be.\n  Look, it is easy to make it sound complicated. When you take out your \ncredit card, it lists what you bought. You have a receipt. You walk in \nand file and say: Judge, I used five credit cards, and I spent $5,000 \nin the last 90 days on food and clothing. Here is the deal. That is \ndischargeable. But if you walk in with those credit cards, and you \nspend it on, say, Versace----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this is painful, to have a debate with \nyour brother. But the question of who is full of malarkey is debatable. \nI have some pretty good folks on my side. May we show them again? I \nhave never known my friend to say the American Association of \nUniversity Women is full of malarkey, or the Children's Defense Fund, \nor on and on. I really haven't. That is a debate we will have \nprivately.\n\n  But this is the point. To me, it is a question of faith and trust in \nAmericans--in particular, in this case, women, who most of all find \nthemselves caught in this problem. I would like to know where you get a \nleather couch for $250.\n  Mr. BIDEN. You don't.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If you can find one, let me know, because I need one. The \nfact is, you can't.\n  The other fact is, if we could put this chart back up, under current \nlaw this is the cash card advance. You play with that, too, I say to my \nfriend. It used to be $1,075 over 60 days. Now he rolls it back to $750 \nand says it is a great deal.\n  This reminds me of the debates on a woman's right to choose. The \npresumption is, we can't trust women to make this decision. People \nsupported a 24-hour waiting period, as if a woman never thought about \nit. They want Government to be involved and make the rules. In a way, \nit is very similar. It is treating people with distrust.\n  We have a good law here, the current law. At $1,075, it is presumed \nyou needed these things. It is fine. The other point about: Oh, you \nhave the receipts; it is not a problem, I would ask every American \ntoday to put their hands on their receipt that they got when they made \ntheir last purchase. Now maybe I am just not good at it. My husband is \ngood. He is probably the one guy I know who keeps every receipt.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for 2 seconds?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The credit card company, as you point out, will send you \nthe bill. That is your receipt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for 3 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia controls the \ntime.\n  Mrs. BOXER. May I have 30 seconds?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have never seen 3 seconds yielded in this \nChamber. Does the Senator want 1 minute or 2 minutes or 3 minutes?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would be delighted to have 1 minute.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 1 minute to the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The only reason I asked for 3 seconds is my friend asked \nfor 2 seconds. I am trying to be fair.\n  The bottom line here is, as I look at this, this is the little person \nagainst the huge credit card companies. The CEOs, who are getting paid \nmillions of dollars, look at the little people and say if they charge \n$250 cumulatively over 90 days before they declare bankruptcy, they are \npresumed to be bad people. I have more faith in people than that. I \nreally hope that Senators will support this amendment.\n  Let's go back to current law. It is fair. And let's reject this \nportion of S. 420. It is unfair.\n  I thank my friend from West Virginia very much for his generosity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is now \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from California is \nvery gracious, and she was welcome to whatever time I have been able to \nyield to her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/15/senate-section/article/S2339-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2339-S2343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE BUDGET AND TAX CUTS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on February 28, 2001, President Bush sent to \nthe Congress his fiscal year 2002 budget outline entitled, ``A \nBlueprint for New Beginnings.'' Sadly, this budget is a blueprint for \nputting tax cuts for the wealthy at the front of the line, above all of \nthe needs of the American people.\n  Now I say to my colleagues, caution, we have not yet seen the real \nbudget. The President's budget will be sent up to the Hill in the early \npart of April. We have not seen it yet. So I would suggest to all of us \nthat we go slowly until we see the fine print in the President's \nbudget.\n  What we have seen thus far is a mere blueprint entitled ``A Blueprint \nfor New Beginnings.'' But I say again, this is a blueprint for putting \ntax cuts for the wealthy at the front of the line, above all other \nneeds of the American people.\n  The President's Budget allocates 80 percent, over $2 trillion of the \n$2.5 trillion non-Social Security, non-Medicare surplus, on tax cuts.\n  Two trillion dollars. Does anyone know how long it would take to \ncount $1 trillion at the rate of $1 per second? It would take 32,000 \nyears--32,000 years--to count $1 trillion at the rate of $1 per second.\n  The President's budget allocates 80 percent, over $2 trillion--that \nwould\n\n[[Page S2340]]\n\ntake 64,000 years to count at the rate of $1 per second--of the $2.5 \ntrillion non-Social Security/non-Medicare surplus on tax cuts. I \nbelieve the President is not on the same page--I say this respectfully \nabout the President--with the American people.\n  I keep hearing this said: ``Give the money back to the people. Give \nthe people their money back.'' Well, we are going to give a few of the \nrich people in this country a lot of money back, if this tax cut is \npassed as proposed. Don't we also owe the people clean water? Don't we \nalso owe the people modern highways, safe bridges, a reliable energy \nsupply, and modern school buildings for their taxes? It is their money. \nYes. It is also their school buildings, also their highways, their \nbridges, their debt, the public debt. Isn't it true that this country's \ninfrastructure, its supply of clean water, its sewers, its \ntransportation capabilities, its energy delivery systems are vitally \nimportant to a healthy economy?\n  These things are vital to support thriving businesses. They enhance \nproductivity. They provide jobs. They are basic to the quality of life \nfor our people. A strong infrastructure is basic to a strong economy.\n  We can't continue to expect the performance of an eight-cylinder \neconomy if we refuse to clean the spark plugs and tune up the engine. \nOur Nation's infrastructure is fast becoming a Model T, riding on \nretread tires. Yet, this administration seems to believe that the old \nbuggy can continue to keep rolling with no maintenance and no repairs.\n  I submit that putting a few dollars back into the pockets of the \nrich--and I have nothing against a person being rich; I wish I could be \nrich; that was never one of my fondest dreams, never one of my goals in \nlife to become rich--is no substitute for addressing crumbling schools, \noutdated highways, and dirty drinking water, and on and on and on. Yes, \nit is the people's money, but it is also the people's dirty drinking \nwater. It is also the people's crumbling schools.\n  These things are the first responsibility of Government, and they are \nwhat we owe the people for their taxes. They are things the people \ncannot provide for themselves. I was a Member of Congress when \nPresident Eisenhower advocated legislation establishing the Interstate \nHighway System. I voted for that. I have voted for the taxes to build \nit. These are things the people cannot provide for themselves. People \ncannot provide interstate highways, a national system of highways for \nthemselves.\n  By putting tax cuts at the head of the line, the President does not \nleave enough of the surpluses--although he may say otherwise; he may be \nadvised otherwise, but it is not true--to adequately fund programs that \nmeet the needs of the Nation.\n  You people out there watching through those electronic eyes, I am \ntalking about you. You are the taxpayers of the country. It is your \nchildren in the dilapidated schools. It is your children who are in the \ncrowded classrooms.\n  The President's budget proposes to increase discretionary spending by \njust 4 percent, barely enough to adjust for inflation. Much of this \nincrease, however, is for defense programs. I don't complain about \nnational defense. I have helped to build this country's defenses with \nmy votes and with my taxes, too. While defense programs are increased \n$3.1 billion, which is 1 percent above baseline--and baseline is last \nyear's appropriation plus inflation, so the President's budget provides \nfor 1 percent above that, above last year's budget plus inflation and \nthen add another 1 percent; that is for defense--while defense programs \nare increased $3.1 billion above baseline for fiscal year 2002, \nnondefense programs are cut $5.9 billion or 1.6 percent below baseline, \nbaseline being last year's appropriation, plus inflation. The \nPresident's budget is not going to add plus inflation. He is going to \ncut below baseline for nondefense programs.\n  Senators, wait until you see this President's budget. Wait until you \ncan see the fine print. In revolutionary war terms, ``wait until you \nsee the whites of their eyes.'' I say to my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle, wait until you see the fine print in this President's \nbudget. When are we going to see it? It will be after April Fools' Day, \nsometime in early April.\n  The Senate Budget Committee has estimated that domestic programs that \nare not Presidential initiatives--get that, domestic programs that are \nnot Presidential initiatives--will be cut by 6.6 percent in fiscal year \n2002. Most of these cuts are not yet specified in the budget for \nreview. They are not in that blue outline about which I am talking. \nThis is what we have to go on up to now, ``a Blueprint for New \nBeginnings.'' I have read this thing from cover to cover, as they say, \nbut that is not it yet. That is not the fine print. This is just the \nbare skeleton. You can see through it, as Paul said, ``through a glass \ndarkly.''\n  After 2002, discretionary spending grows with inflation, not \npopulation.\n  This means we will be spending less on man, woman, and child in \nAmerica. Despite the fact that the Census Bureau is predicting that the \ncountry's population will grow by 8.9 percent by 2010--that is not far \naway--the President's budget provides no resources--none--to deal with \nthat growth.\n  I have been around a long time. I can remember that when I graduated \nfrom high school, there were 130 million people in this country. When I \nwas born, there were 100 million, in 1917. Today, there are 280 \nmillion. The population, we hear, will grow by 8.9 percent by 2010. The \nPresident's budget provides no resources--none--to deal with that \ngrowth. Nor does the budget include resources to respond to a \nrecognized long-term infrastructure deficit in this country. Over the \nnext 5 years, nondefense programs are cut $24.5 billion below baseline.\n  So, Senators, before we get on board for this colossal tax cut for \nthe wealthy, just back off a little bit, just hold on and say, whoa, \nlet's wait and see the fine print. Let's see how that affects the \npeople back home, the people who send you here.\n  The President calls the surplus ``the people's money.'' Have you \nheard that expression? You are going to keep on hearing it a lot. And \nhe is right, it is the people's money. And we are elected by the people \nto make the right choices, the disciplined choices, about the use of \ntheir money.\n  The Wall Street Journal of March 8, 2001, contained the results of a \nrecent poll that asked this question:\n\n       If taxes are cut this year, would you prefer a large tax \n     cut or a smaller tax cut and one of the following:\n\n  I will read that again:\n\n       If taxes are cut this year, would you prefer a large tax \n     cut or a smaller tax cut and one of the following:\n\n  It goes on to enunciate as ``one of the following'': A smaller tax \ncut and more education. So would you prefer a large tax cut or a \nsmaller tax cut and more education funding? Which would you rather \nhave: A large tax cut, the so-called $1.6 trillion tax cut the \nPresident is talking about; or would you prefer a smaller tax cut and \nmore education funding? Well, 64 percent of adults responded, yes, they \nprefer a smaller tax cut and more education funding; 64 percent \npreferred that against 30 percent who preferred a large tax cut.\n  Now the next bars in the graph indicate a response to this question: \nWould you prefer a large tax cut or a smaller tax cut and more Social \nSecurity funding? The chart shows that 65 percent of the respondents \nanswered they would prefer a smaller tax cut and more Social Security \nfunding. Only 29 percent preferred to have the large tax cut.\n  Then the third category: Would you prefer a large tax cut--let's say \nthe President's proposed tax cut of $1.6 trillion--although it is \ngrowing every day--or would you prefer a smaller tax cut and paying \ndown the national debt? Well, the respondents answered that question, \nand 60 percent said they prefer to pay down the national debt; 32 \npercent preferred the large tax cut.\n  So, again, I will say the President is not on the same page with the \nAmerican people.\n  We have had a series of hearings in the Senate Budget Committee that \nhave exposed a number of important, unanswered questions about the \nPresident's budget. His tax cuts are based on highly uncertain 10-year \nsurplus estimates. The Congressional Budget Office, which prepared \nthose surplus estimates, projects that there is only a 10-percent \nchance their surplus estimates for 2006 will be correct. The CBO \nwitness testified before the committee that the probability of the 10-\nyear surplus estimates coming through shrinks\n\n[[Page S2341]]\n\neven further by 2011. Yet the costs of the President's tax cut proposal \nexplode in the outyears--meaning the years 2007 through 2011. Over 72 \npercent of the revenue losses from the tax cuts occur between fiscal \nyears 2007 and 2011, and these cuts total at least $344 billion per \nyear, beginning in fiscal year 2011.\n\n  Let me say that again. If we take a microscope and look at these \nprojections concerning surpluses and put them alongside the tax cut \nproposal, we find that the probability of the 10-year surplus estimate \ncoming through shrinks. After having said there is only a 10-percent \nchance that that surplus estimate for 2006 will be correct, it goes on \nto say that the probability of the surplus estimate coming through \nshrinks even further by 2011.\n  Yet, on the other side of the coin, the costs of the President's tax \ncut proposal explode in the outyears. They are backloaded, you see--the \nyears 2007 through 2011. Over 72 percent of the revenue losses from the \ntax cuts occur between fiscal years 2007 and 2011, and these cuts total \nat least $344 billion per year beginning in fiscal year 2011.\n  Let me ask you, the public out there, as I look through these \nelectric eyes here: If we can't project 24 hours in advance that the \nstock market is going to drop 436 points--in 1 day, within 24 hours--if \nwe can't project 24 hours ahead that we are going to have this big loss \nin the stock market of 436 points, how can we project 10 years out and \nsay the surpluses will be this much, or that much, or some other \namount? We are living in a fool's paradise when we gamble on such \nestimates.\n\n  My good friend, Howard Baker, referred to the Reagan tax cut of 1981 \nas a riverboat gamble. That is what they were talking about. Apparently \ngambling is not out of style. This is another riverboat gamble.\n  This administration's plan would sap the budget of the resources \nneeded to solve the Social Security and Medicare crises that loom just \nover the horizon due to the impending retirement of the baby boom \ngeneration. The baby boom generation--it just started about the time I \ngot into politics, about 1946. That was the beginning. So the baby boom \ngeneration will really be retiring about 10 years from now.\n  Currently, 45 million people receive Social Security and that number \nis expected to grow to 60 million in the year 2015. Yet the Social \nSecurity trustees estimate that Social Security expenditures will \nexceed receipts in 2015. Currently, 40 million people receive Medicare, \nand the number is expected to grow to 46 million in 2010. Yet the \nMedicare trustees estimate that Medicare expenditures will exceed \nreceipts in 2010. That is just 9 years away.\n  Despite the 407-2 vote in the House last month and similar votes in \nthe House and Senate last year to protect the Medicare hospital \ninsurance trust fund, the budget does not even project the existing \n$526 billion Medicare surplus for Medicare, instead putting it into a \nfantasy reserve, an Alice in Wonderland reserve, a fantasy reserve, to \nbe used for ``unspecified purposes.'' Now, does that cause you to \nremember anything about the Reagan tax cut in 1981 where they had a $44 \nbillion magic asterisk--$44 billion magic asterisk. Those were \n``unspecified'' cuts. Nobody knew what cuts. But really in the minds of \nthe planners back then they had Social Security in mind, Social \nSecurity and Medicare. That is what they had in mind. But they didn't \nquite have the nerve to come out and say so. So they just put a little \nasterisk down at the bottom of the page. The ``magic asterisk'' it was \ncalled.\n  We are seeing the same thing over again. History does repeat itself. \nThe American people expect the President--here is what they expect the \nPresident to do--to put forward a serious, disciplined budget that \naddresses their long-term needs. That is what they expect. Yet the \nPresident is offering the people candy first, putting tax cuts in front \nof the hard work of fixing Social Security and Medicare. That is hard \nwork. That is going to take some political capital, and politicians \nwill have to expend some of that political capital when it comes to \nfixing Social Security and Medicare. But just hold on a moment, we will \nwait on that. Put the tax cuts first. We will give them the candy \nfirst.\n  It is very disturbing that Congress is moving ahead on the tax cut in \nthe absence of a complete budget. A few days ago, the House of \nRepresentatives passed the first of several bills that cut taxes. The \nfirst bill alone cuts taxes by almost $1 trillion; yet the House has \nnot taken up a budget resolution. We do not even have a full budget, as \nI said earlier, from the President. Most of the details of the \nPresident's budget are not expected to be sent to Congress until after \nthe debate on the budget resolution next month.\n  The President is telling the American people, in essence, let's serve \nup the candy now and put off the tough questions on what programs will \nbe cut until later. Instead of a menu designed to nourish the Nation \nwith the vitamins needed for healthy growth, I can see only a sweet \nsnack of tax candy.\n\n  The President's tax cut proposal could put us back on the course \ntoward deficits, returning us to the days when we had to spend the \nSocial Security surplus for day-to-day Federal operations. By \nundermining fiscal discipline, this could return us to the days of high \ninterest rates, making the average wage earner's mortgage, education, \nand automobile more expensive.\n  We should not return to an era of deficits like the 1980s. We have \nbeen down the road of big tax cuts and promised surpluses, and we ended \nup where? In the ditch.\n  When President Reagan presented his first budget to the Congress, he, \ntoo, proposed big tax cuts and future surpluses. There are not many in \nthis town who remember that President Reagan's 5-year budget plan \nprojected surpluses for fiscal year 1984, $1 billion; fiscal year 1985, \n$6 billion; and fiscal year 1986, $28 billion. Those were the projected \nsurpluses. Congress passed a tax cut bill that reduced revenues by over \n$2 trillion from fiscal year 1981 to fiscal year 1991.\n  Did the Reagan administration projections of surpluses come to pass? \nNo. In fact, precisely the opposite occurred. The fiscal year 1984 \ndeficit was not a surplus of $1 billion but a deficit of $185 billion. \nThe fiscal year 1985 deficit was not a surplus of $6 billion, but a \ndeficit of $212 billion. And the fiscal year 1986 deficit was not a \nsurplus of $28 billion, which we were promised, but it was a deficit of \n$221 billion.\n  That was an error, that was just a small error amounting to $653 \nbillion over just 3 years.\n  How much is $1 billion? $1 billion is a dollar for every minute since \nJesus Christ was born. That is $1 billion. It doesn't sound like that \nmuch when it is jingling in your pocket, or you are making big promises \nto the taxpayer. But it is $1 for every minute since Jesus Christ was \nborn. We are talking about an error not of $1 billion but of $663 \nbillion over 3 years.\n  The President asked his Secretary of Defense to undertake a thorough \nreview of the defense needs of the Nation. I am for that review. I \nsupport the President's proposal. As he stressed in his address to the \njoint session last month, he wanted a policy first, with a budget to \nfollow. In fact, the President said, these are his words ``our defense \nvision will drive our defense budget. Not the other way around.''\n  It makes sense to me. I also think the President should have the same \nphilosophy for our domestic needs. Our domestic vision should drive our \ndomestic budget, not the other way around. If the defense review \nresults in further proposed increases for defense, the budget is not \nclear on whether those increases will have to be absorbed within the 4-\npercent increase proposed in the budget. If that is the case, domestic \nprograms, which are already $5.9 billion below baseline, will have to \nbe cut even more. Already, this budget leaves infrastructure needs, \neducation, science, technology, and many other domestic programs, \nbehind. This budget continues to let the underpinnings of our economy \nslide into disrepair and neglect. No help is on the way in this budget \nblueprint.\n\n  According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, one-third of \nthe nation's roads are in poor or mediocre condition, costing American \ndrivers an estimated $5.8 billion and contributing to as many as 13,800 \nhighway fatalities annually.\n  As of 1998, 29 percent of the Nation's bridges were structurally \ndeficient or functionally obsolete. It is estimated that it will cost \n$10.6 billion a year for 20 years to eliminate all bridge deficiencies.\n\n[[Page S2342]]\n\n  Capital spending on mass transit must increase 41 percent just to \nmaintain the system in its present condition.\n  Airport congestion delayed nearly 50,000 flights in one month alone \nlast year.\n  Seventy-five percent of our nation's school buildings are inadequate \nto meet the needs of schoolchildren. The average cost of capital \ninvestment needed is $3,800 per student.\n  The nation's 54,000 drinking water systems face an annual shortfall \nof $11 billion needed to replace facilities that are nearing the end of \ntheir useful life and to comply with Federal water regulations.\n  In 1955 I traveled around the world in an old Constellation. We \ntraveled for 68 days, I believe it was. They call that a junket these \ndays. We went to the Middle East and we saw people there carrying their \nwater around in what appeared to be gasoline cans.\n  We traveled around the world. I saw the Taj Mahal; I saw the pyramids \nof Egypt; I saw many beautiful sites in many lands. But the most \nbeautiful site I saw on the whole trip was the little red lights \nflashing on the top of the Washington Monument on the night I returned.\n  I was able to go to the house, turn the faucet, and get a drink of \ngood, clean water. I had been in many countries where we couldn't drink \nthe water--couldn't drink the water. So we take our blessings for \ngranted--clean water. Yet there are places in this country where the \nwater is not clean. There are places in the great cities of this \ncountry where the water is not clean. And some sewer systems are 100 \nyears old or over 100 years old. Currently, there is a $12 billion \nannual shortfall in funding for infrastructure needs in this category.\n  Give the people back their money? Yes. Remember, it is their dirty \nwater, also; their sewer systems. Right here in the District of \nColumbia, take a look at the potholes. Read about what happens to the \nsewer system in this city.\n  There are more than 2,100 unsafe dams in the United States. There \nwere 61 reported dam failures in the past 2 years.\n  Since 1990, actual capacity has increased only 7,000 megawatts per \nyear, an annual shortfall of 30 percent. More than 10,000 megawatts of \ncapacity must be added each year until 2008 to keep up with the 1.8 \npercent annual growth in demand.\n\n  President Bush's budget does not respond to these needs.\n  The Bush budget could leave billions of dollars of gas tax receipts \nsitting in the Highway Trust Fund rather than helping us develop our \nhighways, bridges and mass transit systems for the 21st century.\n  According to the Federal Highway Administration, less than half of \nthe miles of roadway in rural America are considered to be in good or \nvery good condition. Of the road miles in rural America, 56.5 percent \nare in fair to poor condition. The people's money? Yes. Whose highway? \nThe people's highway. Conditions are even worse in urban America, where \n64.6 percent of the road miles are considered to be in some level of \ndisrepair, and only 35.4 percent of urban roadways are considered to be \nin good or very good condition.\n  Violence pervades our schools. Our students score poorly when pitted \nagainst students from other countries. Seventy percent of our 4th \ngraders have difficulty even reading. The people's money? Yes, it is \nthe people's money. But we are talking about the people's children. \nWhile the President takes credit for proposing an 11.5 percent increase \nin education programs, the Education Secretary has testified that the \nactual increase is just 5.9 percent. The President's increase of 5.9 \npercent just doesn't make the grade.\n  A study by the National Center for Education Statistics, in June, \n2000, the ``Condition of America's Public School Facilities: 1999,'' \nestimated that the total cost of putting the nation's public schools in \ngood repair is $127 billion. The people's money? Yes, it is the \npeople's money. But it is the people's school buildings. A 1994 General \nAccounting Office study put the cost of school renovations at $112 \nbillion.\n  Of the schools surveyed in the more recent study, half reported at \nleast one building feature, such as heating, plumbing, roofs, or \nsprinklers and fire alarms, in less than adequate condition, and nearly \nhalf reported at least one environmental factor, such as ventilation, \nsecurity or indoor air quality, in unsatisfactory condition. The \naverage age of a public school is 40 years; the functional age, that \nis, the age since the last major renovation, is 16 years. Yet the Bush \nbudget proposes to eliminate the Federal program that is specifically \ndesigned for renovating schools.\n  Our needs for clean water projects are growing. Wastewater treatment \nplants prevent pollutants from reaching America's rivers, lakes, and \ncoastlines. They prevent water-borne disease, keep our waters safe for \nfishing and swimming, and preserve our natural resources like the \nChesapeake Bay, Great Lakes, and Colorado River. However, the President \nproposes only level funding for the national program and he proposes to \neliminate about $350 million of projects that were earmarked by \nCongress last year.\n  We have learned that just through this outline, this blue book, ``A \nBlueprint For New Beginnings.'' That is the large print, and not all \nthe large print. Wait until we see the budget; just wait until we see \nthe small print. Then I will make another speech, if it is the Good \nLord's will, and I am still here.\n  Energy programs are proposed for over $700 million in cuts this year, \nincluding steep cuts in programs designed to promote energy \nindependence, such as energy efficiency and renewable programs and \nfossil fuel programs.\n  The President's Budget proposes cuts below baseline of 2 percent for \nthe National Science Foundation, 2 percent for NASA and 7 percent for \nthe Department of Energy. In the March 9, 2001 New York Times, Dr. D. \nAllan Bromley stated that the major driver of our nation's economic \nsuccess is scientific innovation. He stressed that many economists \nattribute much of America's 1990's boom to increased productivity \nstemming, in large part, from scientific research. He concluded that \nthe cuts proposed in the budget are, ``a self-defeating policy''. Dr. \nBromley was the science and technology adviser to President George H. \nW. Bush from 1989 to 1993. I could not agree with him more.\n  What are we leaving to America's children? How much longer can we \nafford to ignore the infrastructure needs of this nation? If we hand \nthem a worn out 19th century infrastructure which cannot support a \nvital economy, what do we tell them.\n  We can tell them: We gave your parents a tax cut. That is what we can \ntell our children.\n  I am not against tax cuts. I want to see us wipe out this marriage \npenalty that subsidizes the cohabitation of people who are not married. \nI want to wipe that out, or at least cut it. So I am for some tax cut.\n  But if we leave our children with dirty water, antiquated schools, \npoor mass transit, rusting bridges, what do we tell them? We gave your \nparents a tax cut. Can't you be happy with that?\n  If the projections are wrong, and we go back in debt, bequeathing our \nchildren nothing tangible except red ink and interest payments, will \nthey really appreciate the government's generosity in giving their \nparents a tax cut?\n  Instead, as I look at the President's budget priorities we haven't \nseen them up close; we just see them through a glass--and that is what \na budget is, a statement of priorities--I see a plan that focuses on an \nenormous tax cut instead of supporting efforts to promote school \nsafety. After the school shooting in California last week, one of the \nstudents commented that he believed that the presence of a police \nofficer who is regularly on campus helped to save lives when the \ngunfire broke out. The ``COPS in Schools'' program has been a valuable \nresource for students, teachers and school administrators. It has \nhelped to stop would-be violent acts at schools before they start. Yet \nthe Bush administration's budget proposes to ``redirect''--.\n  Remember that word ``redirect.'' I find that word in this so-called \n``A Blueprint for New Beginnings.'' I find that word ``redirect'' in \nthat blueprint more than once. It is an interesting word. See how it is \nused.\n  I have strong concerns about the word redirect--to redirect $1.5 \nbillion from Department of Justice grant programs like COPS. The \nPresident is not\n\n[[Page S2343]]\n\non the same page with the American people.\n  Mr. President, we are a nation of dreamers. We dream of a better life \nfor all of our people. We dream of a brighter future for all of our \nchildren. We are inspired by a challenge--we rise to it, we embrace its \npromise, we enjoy righting wrongs, breaking new ground, achieving the \nimpossible. When our collective will is engaged, and we agree to put \nresources behind a challenge, the United States can be an awesome force \nfor remarkable progress and for good in the world. We need leadership \nto fully galvanize our attention. Yet, when that combination of \nAmerican determination and drive is motivated by a vision, great things \ncan be achieved. Witness space exploration and putting a man on the \nmoon; witness beating the old Soviet Union in the arms race; witness \nmapping the human genome for which the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Mr. Domenici, \nis to be given great credit. This is something that originated in the \nbrain of a Member of this body to support this research.\n\n  Witness the mapping of the human genome and all of the other mind-\nboggling advances in science and medicine over the last 50 years.\n  But, where is the leadership and inspiration for this new millennium? \nI find none in the trumpeting of a tax cut, and this tax cut in \nparticular. I see no call to make the world a better place for our \nchildren. I see no appeal to mount a massive effort to beat cancer or \naids. I see no drive to make our children the best educated in the \nworld. I hear no determination to make us energy independent.\n  I hear nothing about a Moon shot to make our Nation energy \nindependent. I hear nothing about a Moon shot to make our children the \nbest educated children. I hear nothing about a Moon shot to conquer \ncancer. I was here when Sputnik burst forth from the headlines of the \nNation's newspapers and the world's newspapers. I heard John F. Kennedy \nsay, ``We are going to put a man on the Moon,'' and we did that. We put \na man on the Moon and brought him back safely to Earth again.\n  Yes. We made the world safer for democracy. We participated in two \nworld wars. We had the dream of the Marshall Plan. We had the dream \nfinally culminating in the breaking down and the tearing down of the \nBerlin Wall.\n  We remember the Berlin airlift. President Harry Truman was determined \nto break that Soviet ring that had Berlin enclosed. We didn't back away \nfrom that challenge.\n  The Interstate Highway System was another dream.\n  We hear no determination to do great things today. The centerpiece of \nthis administration is not a dream. It is not a great dream. It is not \na great call for a Moon shot to beat back the ravages of cancer, \ntuberculosis, sugar diabetes, and the other diseases that confront our \npeople. We hear only a call for huge tax cuts for the wealthy.\n  I hear no appeal to American pride to repair our dilapidated system \nof transportation. Our roads, our bridges, our mass transit systems, \nour airports, our national parks should be the envy of the world. What \nhas happened to our pride in American know how, American skills, \nAmerican research, and America as a show place to inspire visitors to \nour shores with the tangible achievements of this great experiment in \nrepresentative democracy? Are we to forgot our glory days? Are we to \nsettle for smaller dreams, and more limited horizons.\n  Is this what we are going to settle for? Do we tell our children that \nwe didn't want to go for bigger things because we gave their parents a \ntax cut?\n  I hear no call to greatness in this peddling of massive tax cuts. I \nhear only a veiled appeal to greed and to distrust of government.\n  The President is not on the same page with the American people. The \nAmerican people, according to these polls, are not asking for a refund. \nThey are not asking for a refund. They want their government to lead. \nThey want their government to inspire. They want their government to do \nthe great things for the country, the very things they pay their taxes \nfor. That is what they want. In short, they are not asking for their \nmoney back. They want their money's worth. And a king's ransom of a tax \ncut will be worth nothing to them if it shortchanges our Nation's \nchildren and downsizes our dreams.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald).

Mr. President, we are now proceeding on the bankruptcy \nbill in the regular order.\n  I want to say a few general remarks about this process of bankruptcy. \nIt is provided for in the U.S. Constitution. It was not written out in \nthe early days of our founding precisely how bankruptcy law should \napply, but it did provide for uniform Federal laws of bankruptcy. So \nour bankruptcy court system is a Federal court system presided over by \nFederal bankruptcy judges, and all the clerks are Federal civil \nservants.\n  England developed some procedures to deal with persons who owed \ndebts. Basically, they would turn over everything to the Crown, and \nsometimes they would get thrown in jail. But their assets would be \ndistributed equally to whoever was claiming money from that person in \nsort of a realistic-priority way.\n  Over the years, we have provided tremendous protections for the \nperson filing bankruptcy. It does aid them in a lot of different ways. \nHow does it actually work?\n  Let's say you are in debt and telephone calls start coming from the \ncreditors. You promised to pay certain debts and you are not paying \nthem. I do not know how we can complain too much about somebody calling \nto ask what your intentions are about paying them. They become \nburdensome on the family after a while, though--very burdensome. Then \npeople threaten lawsuits. Then they file lawsuits. And lawsuits get \ncarried on to judgment.\n  The person is being sued. They are being called. Their lives are \nreally being disrupted because they are unable to pay the debts they \nowe. So under this circumstance, a person is allowed to file \nbankruptcy. When bankruptcy is filed, that stops everything. You cannot \nbe harassed by phone calls or other claims for debts because all the \ncreditors--people who are claiming money--have to be sent a notice; and \nwhen they get the notice that you filed bankruptcy, all they can do is \nfile a claim at the bankruptcy court.\n  They cannot keep bugging the individual American citizen. They have \nto leave him or her alone or the bankruptcy judge will slap them with a \nfine if they do that, because bankruptcy does stay those kinds of \nactivities. It stops the lawsuits. All lawsuits are stopped under the \nbankruptcy. It is called a stay. A stay is issued, and the legal \nproceedings stop, so a debtor can take a breather.\n  Basically, they go into court, if it is an individual. And the \nindividual has two choices. He can file, under current law, under \nchapter 7. He can say: I am exempting my homestead. You can't take \nthat. And certain of my personal property, you can't take that. This is \nall the money I have otherwise. This is all the assets I have. You take \nthat and divide it up among all those people I can't pay. It may be 5 \ncents on the dollar, 10 cents on the dollar, 50 cents on the dollar--\nusually less than 10 cents on the dollar, or less than 30 cents on the \ndollar, anyway--when they do that.\n  Then they wipe out those debts. They are forever gone. They signed a \ncontract. They signed agreements. They got sued. And they got judgments \nagainst them. It is all wiped out; a person does not have to pay.\n  That goes on in America regularly. And it is a healthy thing for \npeople who are in debt so deep that it is not possible for them to get \nout. And we affirm that.\n\n  So over the years bankruptcy law has been amended and improved. We \nhad a Bankruptcy Reform Act in 1978, the last real reform of bankruptcy \nlaw in the United States. At that time, there\n\n[[Page S2344]]\n\nwere fewer than 300,000--I think 270,000--bankruptcies a year.\n  Since 1978, bankruptcies have increased at a steady pace. Now the \nfilings exceed--well, in 1998 or 1999 it was 1.4 million. It dropped a \nlittle last year, but it is projected to go up again significantly this \nyear. So we are talking about nearly 1.5 million filings this year. You \nmay say: That is not too many. We have 250, 260 million people in \nAmerica. A lot of them are children, and a lot of them are in jail, and \nso on. You take those numbers down--who is really eligible--and that is \ngetting to be a significant number. We do not think about the fact that \nit is happening every year. When you add up 5 years, that is 5, 6, 7 \nmillion people who have filed bankruptcy in a period of 5 years. That \nbecomes a significant portion of the American population. If they all \nqualify, then I do not have a problem with it.\n  But what has occurred in recent years is the proliferation--and I \nthink virtually every city in America has it--of some sort of \npromotional bankruptcy mill. For years, lawyers could not advertise. \nSome people can still remember that day. But now they can. So you turn \non the TV at 11:30 at night or Saturday afternoon, or pick up the dime \nstore, corner market shopping guide, and there are these \nadvertisements: Wipe out your debts. Don't pay anybody you owe. Call \nold Joe, your friendly lawyer. He will tell you how to do the deal.\n  So people call. They are in debt and having trouble managing their \nmoney. Some of them are in debt because they could not help it--maybe \nthere were serious injuries, maybe medical causes, maybe bad business \ndeals, bad judgment. Some of them just cannot manage their money. Some \nof them have drug problems. Some have alcohol problems. Some are just \nunable to manage and just will not stop spending.\n  So they go to the lawyer. And this is fundamentally what the lawyer \ntells them. He says: Now, when you get your paycheck, you save that \nmoney, and you bring it straight to me--all that money--and maybe your \nsecond check. As soon as I have $1,500 or $1,000, I will file your \nbankruptcy. Don't pay any of your other debts. Don't pay any more \ndebts. He will say: Use your credit card. Run up everything you want to \non your credit card. Live off your credit card. Come down here, and we \nwill file bankruptcy as soon as you get your money together to pay \nme. That is what has happened. That is the kind of message. They are \ntold this is the right thing to do. These people in debt are in \ntrouble. They are hurting. They are tired of people calling them. It is \nembarrassing their children and their families. They want it to end. \nThis seems to be the best way out, so they do so. The numbers through \nthis promotional activity have been going through the roof.\n\n  A lot of people are troubled by it. People who are regularly involved \nin bankruptcy and see what is happening are rightly concerned that \nquite a number of people are filing who don't qualify, who really don't \nmeet our traditional standards of someone who cannot pay all or a part \nof their debts.\n  The discussion went on for a number of years about how to deal with \nit. A Federal bankruptcy commission dealt with it, others have dealt \nwith it, lawyers groups, experts, and so forth. We have had, in the \nSenate and in the House of Representatives, hearings that have gone on \nfor over 4 years now. As a result of those hearings and refinements, \nbankruptcy bills have come forward. One passed this body 2 years ago \nwith about 88 votes. The last one passed with 70 votes. It has passed \nthe House every year with a veto-proof margin, strong bipartisan \nRepublican and Democratic support.\n  We are dealing with this incredible surge in bankruptcies and trying \nto do it in a way that allows everybody who previously legitimately \nwanted to file bankruptcy, that they could file bankruptcy, by trying \nto identify those who don't qualify and should be contained in their \nfiling. So this is a fundamental change in bankruptcy. We adopted what \nhas come to be called a means test. It says if you have the means to \npay some or all of your debt, we ought to set up a plan for you to do \nso.\n  In law today, we have two sections. I mentioned chapter 7, where you \ngo in and wipe out all your debts. Basically, the debtor can choose \nthat. He can choose in which chapter he wants to go.\n  There is a another chapter called chapter 13. In that case, if you \nfile in chapter 13, all of the lawsuits stop; all of the phone calls \nstop. The court sits down with the debtor and works out a payment \narrangement. They prioritize the debts to be paid. Some of them are \nsecured; some are not secured. The right priorities are all set. Then \nthat person basically takes his paycheck in every month. He or she \ngives it to the court. He or she keeps enough money to live on. They \ngive the money to the court, and they pay out to the debtors every \ndime.\n  Under chapter 13, many people work through their debts, people with \nlow incomes and higher incomes. They pay off all their debts.\n  In my State of Alabama, I am proud to say that in the southern \ndistrict of Alabama, where I practiced, 50 percent of the people who \nfiled filed under chapter 13. They wanted to pay their debts back. In \nfact, there are some good incentives to filing under chapter 13, a lot \nof good things for a creditor that I won't go into here.\n  They are doing it in Birmingham. In the northern district of Alabama, \nI understand 60 percent file there. I also understand there are some \ndistricts in New York and other places where less than 10 percent, \nmaybe even less than 5 percent use chapter 13. Just routinely, the \ndebtors come in and wipe out all their debts.\n  How should we deal with that? After much thought, it was decided that \nwe ought to focus this legislation on a relatively small number of \npeople filing for bankruptcy who have income sufficient to pay back \nsome or all of their debts. We thought that was a good approach, and it \nhas been widely received and voted on by most of the Members of this \nbody.\n\n  Basically, we drew a bright line. We said: Based on the size of your \nfamily and the income of your family, if you make below median income, \nwhich in America for a family of four is $50,000, you will be able to \nfile bankruptcy any way you want, 7 or 13, just like today.\n  There is no change for them in that regard. We believe probably 70, \n80, 85 percent of the people who file bankruptcy are below median \nincome, but for that 20, that 10, that 15 percent who make above median \nincome--some make $70, $80, $90, $200,000, $250,000, some are doctors, \nsome are lawyers, some have professional incomes, and so forth--to them \nwe say: We are going to look at your income. We are going to look at \nyour earning possibilities. If you are able to pay back at least 25 \npercent of that debt over 3 to 5 years, we are going to put you in \nchapter 13, as half the people in my State do anyway, and we are going \nto ask you to try to pay those debts over that period of time. You will \nbe monitored by the court.\n  By the way, this bill says, in a historic step, child support and \nalimony will be moved up to the top, to the first item that will be \npaid. For 5 years, you will be under the supervision financially of a \nFederal bankruptcy judge, and you will pay your alimony. You will pay \nyour child support on time. As a matter of fact, the judge will order a \nrepayment of past due alimony and child support under court \nsupervision.\n  I thought that ought to greatly please most people in America. It \ndeals only with the abusive cases. It confronts the problem we are \nseeing in bankruptcy. Maybe somewhat fewer people will file if they \ndon't think they can get away with ripping off the average taxpayer, \ncitizen.\n  They say: These credit card companies, these are evil companies. They \ngo out and actually lend people money. They are not citizens, they are \ncorporations. They are evil. They are always trying to cheat you, and \nwe don't need to pay them. They care about this bill. Therefore, the \nbill is no good.\n  That is silly. That is not right. The first principle of economics, \nwhich a lot of people in this body apparently don't know or forgot, is \nthere is no such thing as a free lunch. Somebody is going to pay this \ndebt if you don't pay it. Somebody is going to eat that loss. If it is \na bank or a credit card company, they have computers. They figure it \nout. They start seeing greater losses. What do they do? They have to \nraise the interest rate on all of us.\n  Experts have studied this; economists have studied it. They have \nconcluded that the average debt-paying\n\n[[Page S2345]]\n\nAmerican citizen who pays his bills is annually imposed a bankruptcy \ncost of $450. That is about $40 a month they are having to pay every \nmonth because other people in this country don't pay their debts.\n  They say: Well, maybe it was because they had a high medical bill. \nTherefore, we don't want them to pay their hospital bill. Heaven knows, \nthey should not pay the doctor and the hospital who treated them and \nhelped them get well. This bill is oppressive because it would suggest \nthat people ought to pay their hospital bill if they can.\n  Basically, that is what the argument is. If you are making below \nmedian income, lower than median income in America, then you can file, \njust as you always did, and you can wipe out your bills to the \nhospital, to any other people that you owe, including your bookie, I \nguess--wipe that all out. But if you are making above median income, \nand the judge finds you are able, only if he finds you are able to pay \n25 percent of what you owe to the hospital over a period of 3 to 5 \nyears, he can order a payment plan that requires you to pay that 25 \npercent. And he will allow you every month to have sufficient funds to \nlive on, in the court's judgment.\n\n  Well, I don't think this is oppressive. This is a reform. This is a \npiece of legislation that deals with a fundamental question. I was \nasked by a young reporter yesterday afternoon, while doing a piece for \none of the TV shows, ``Do you think this is a moral question?'' I said, \n``I absolutely think it is a moral question.''\n  What we do here when we establish law, as our Founding Fathers always \nknew, and I think we are forgetting, is that we are setting public \npolicy that guides and shapes American values. What we say you must do \nand what we say you don't have to do shapes opinions and values.\n  So I think it is a bad suggestion, an unhealthy value to promote, \nthat a person who can pay a substantial portion of his or her debt can \njust walk away from it--not pay the hospital, for example.\n  I have visited 20 hospitals in my home State this year. They have a \nbad debt section that they write off regularly. They are not expecting \nany great, huge surge of benefits from this bill. But why should you \nnot pay the hospital if you can pay a portion of it? What is bad about \nthem? Is that not a good institution that ought to be valued? Who else \nis going to pay for the hospital if the person who is using it doesn't \npay?\n  Well, they say: Maybe you didn't have health care insurance. If you \nmake above the median income, you ought to have health care insurance. \nMaybe somebody who is struggling to get by every day, who would be \nbelow median income, is not able to take out health care insurance. If \nyou are making above median income, you need to have some health \ninsurance. Why should a person who is not responsible, making above \nmedian income, who didn't have health insurance--why should they be \nable to stiff the hospital when the ``honest Joe'' and his family, who \nare making below median income, takes out his health insurance every \nmonth and pays it and makes sure his hospital is paid if he and his \nfamily go there?\n  I think it is a moral question. I think we need to set a public \npolicy that says, yes, we validate the great privilege of American \nlaw--and that has really been increased in recent years--that allows a \nperson to wipe out their debts and start over again. We validate that. \nWe do not object to that. We have tried to create a bill that does just \nthat. But we also say that if you have a higher than average income and \nyou can pay some of those debts, we want to set up a system where you \npay them.\n  I believe this is a fair approach, a balanced approach, a generous \napproach. And the legislation has quite a number of factors in it that \ncut down on fraud and abuse. We raise up the protections for women and \nchildren, as I said. We have tightened up the language on the bill to \nreaffirm a debt from a person who maybe wants to keep his car, or a \nwashing machine, and they can come in and negotiate with them. We can \nput extra protections in before they can reaffirm a debt after \nbankruptcy and want to keep something, so that the creditors are \nprotected.\n  We put in another amendment that people have asked for. I think, in \ngeneral, I will challenge people to tell me what it is about this bill \nthat is precisely unfair to anybody. If we want to talk about the means \ntest, we will talk about that. That is the real change, the only thing \nthat really happens here of significance.\n  We have made a number of other improvements to reduce abuses and \nproblems with the bill and the processing of cases in bankruptcy, which \nI think everybody would support.\n\n  We have had a lot of amendments. If anybody listens carefully, they \nwill find they are not focusing primarily on the improvement of \nbankruptcy law and the administration of assets in a bankruptcy court. \nThey are focused on rules for credit cards or bank lending rules, all \nof which are not in the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee. They \nare in the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee. Periodically, that \nkind of legislation comes forward. We will have amendments that touch \non issues outside the bill, but, for the most part, we are right on.\n  We had a vote on homestead. The homestead law in this bill eliminated \nquite a number of abuses. The homestead law basically said that States \ncould set their own standard for how much you could protect in your \nhome. If you file bankruptcy, each State has a homestead limit--some as \nlow as $5,000; some are unlimited. So in certain States you can buy a \nhome and put $2 million into your home, and when you file bankruptcy, \nyou get to keep your home.\n  I never thought that was a good idea. I voted to eliminate that. Some \nState laws have unlimited assets, and some Senators wanted to keep \nthat. They fought us and fought us and fought us. Frankly, after being \na cosponsor with Senator Kohl on a limit of $100,000, which we passed, \nwe went along with a compromise that we reached that restricted \nhomesteads, but not as much as I would like.\n  We just voted this morning to go back to the $100,000 limit. The vote \nwas here. I voted, as I agreed to last time, for the compromise. But I \ncertainly am happy with that public policy. I hope the Senators who \nlost on that vote will see just how strong this body cares about it and \nwill realize they are not really benefiting, and the citizens of their \nStates are not benefiting by allowing a millionaire to keep a million \ndollars in his home and not pay the gas station or local hospital or \nbank.\n  So those are the kinds of things that have occurred. The complaints \nhere are either about issues outside of the reform of bankruptcy court \nlaw or it is a matter in which we have it go.\n  I think we have done well. I salute Senator Hatch, the chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee, for his steadfast leadership, and Senator \nGrassley, who formerly chaired the Courts and Administration \nSubcommittee, which I am honored now to chair, when this bill came out \nof his subcommittee. He battled steadfastly to bring this bill up for a \nvote. I believe we will be able to do that today.\n  I am quite confident we will have an overwhelming vote for one of the \nmost historic reforms that we can imagine. It will improve the \noperation of bankruptcy courts, I am confident. If we made any errors \nin it, I am willing to listen to that and make further amendments, if \nneeded.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, on the Leahy amendment, I will make a \nfew comments. It includes the spouse's income in a bankruptcy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair notifies the Senator there is an \norder for a vote to occur at this time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent the Senator from Alabama be \nallowed to proceed for 1 minute and then I be allowed to proceed for 1 \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I have no objection, but reserving the right to object, it \nis my\n\n[[Page S2346]]\n\nunderstanding that, regarding the previous order entered, we are going \nto change the order in which the votes take place; is that right?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I was going to make a change in the order according to \nthe agreement that has been reached.\n  Mr. REID. I withdraw my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I believe the Senator from Delaware has a request.\n  Mr. CARPER. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 minute to engage \nin a colloquy with Mr. Leahy and Mr. Sessions.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, if \nthe Senator from Delaware amends that to also add 1 minute for the \nSenator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this would be an amendment on the \nsurface that appears to be good. However, I am of the firm opinion that \nit would be unwise and cause a very difficult problem with filing for \nbankruptcy. Under the present law, the median income is determined by \nhousehold size which includes a spouse when married and living \ntogether. Yet a debtor filing singly will be tested based on his or her \nincome only and not based on the income of the spouse as well.\n  Under the current bill, for a debtor who is married but has been \nabandoned by her spouse, that will be corrected. She will be tested \nunder the means test from her income. If she is abandoned, her expenses \nwill exceed her income and she will not be prevented from filing under \nchapter 7.\n  However, the ability of couples to maneuver income----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama has used his 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I believe we are dealing with a bill with a \ndrafting error and I am trying to correct it. For example, in the bill \nbefore the Senate, a battered spouse who flees the home with children \ncan be denied bankruptcy relief regardless of circumstances because the \nbill would count her husband's income, as well, even though she did not \nreceive any money from him.\n  Without the Leahy amendment, it is hard to imagine a more antiwoman, \nantichild, or antifamily result. My amendment would not allow separated \nspouses to somehow shield assets when they file for bankruptcy because \nthe bill already counts income of the debtor from all sources. That is \nwhy my amendment is supported by virtually every group in the country \nthat has advocated for battered women and battered spouses. They say, \nwe support this effort to correct this oversight which ``if left \nunrepaired would create a severe injustice to many women, children, and \nfamilies across the country.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. The amendment offered by Senator Leahy is a good \namendment and he has pointed to a problem with the bill, I think \nunintentional.\n  This is the situation we face: We have a husband and a wife and they \nare living separately, maybe at the end of their marriage, and the wife \nwants to file for bankruptcy. The income of her spouse will be imputed, \nregardless of whether or not that spouse is providing any kind of \nsupport at all.\n  As a result, in most cases the wife would not be able to file chapter \n7 and enjoy the benefit of safe harbor. Mr. Leahy would have us fix \nthat. That is a good thing.\n  Unfortunately, the problem that flows out of the amendment is that in \nsome cases that husband really is providing support for that spouse. It \nis important we find that out; that we not create a situation, \nunwittingly, where fraud could prevail and where that husband, in most \ncases, is supporting the wife and supporting the family and does not \nacknowledge as much. There is a simple way to fix it, and I hope in \nconference Senator Leahy and others will find that appropriate fix.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Delaware, but I note \nmy amendment does not allow a separated spouse to somehow shield assets \nbecause the bill already counts income of the debtors from all sources.\n  The definition of ``current monthly income'' on page 18, lines 4 to \n21, of the bill includes income from all sources. So if a battered \nspouse or anybody else conceal income on a bankruptcy schedule, that is \na Federal crime.\n  What I do not want is a battered wife who is getting no income from a \nseparated spouse to suddenly, if she is out there trying to put her \nfinancial situation in order, to have to consider the income of a \nspouse from whom she is getting no income.\n  I ask unanimous consent a letter from the American Academy of \nMatrimonial Lawyers, on behalf of a number of organizations, be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                               American Academy of\n\n\n                                          Matrimonial Lawyers,\n\n                                      Chicago, IL, March 15, 2001.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on the Judiciary, Russell \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: I write in strong support of your \n     ``separated spouse'' amendment to the pending means test \n     provisions of the bankruptcy bill not being considered by the \n     Senate.\n       I assume the current language in the bill is the result of \n     an unintentional drafting error. If left uncorrected, the \n     existing language will be draconian in its application to all \n     single parents with children who do not have the benefit of \n     any spousal income. It will particularly jeopardize a \n     battered spouse who flees her home with her children. This \n     debtor could be denied bankruptcy relief regardless of her \n     circumstances because the bill would count her husband's \n     income as well, even if she did not receive any money from \n     him.\n       The current language would impute to a single parent \n     debtor, for purposes of a means test, the income of a \n     separated spouse irrespective of whether the absentee spouse \n     actually contributes any income to the household.\n       There can be no justification that single parents with \n     children should suffer unduly in the bankruptcy process \n     because false and inflated income of an absentee spouse is \n     credited to debtor spouse. I support your laudable effort to \n     correct this oversight, which if left unrepaired, would \n     create a severe injustice to many women, children and \n     families across the country.\n           Respectfully yours,\n                                             Charles C. Shainberg.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I don't think I have time left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's minute has expired.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I think we can fix this.\n  I ask unanimous consent the votes now commence under the previous \norder, with the vote relative to the Boxer amendment being postponed, \nto occur at the end of the voting sequence, and the Leahy amendment \nbeing first in the sequence.\n  Mr. REID. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                        Vote On Amendment No. 19\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n19.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Have the yeas and nays been ordered, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD (when his name was called).

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 70, 71, and 73\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n70 offered by Mr. Wellstone of Minnesota.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have 1 minute; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Would it be helpful, I say to the Senator from Utah \nand the Senator from Vermont, if I did a quick summary of each one of \nthe amendments right now, one right after the other?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there is so much noise. I know the Senator \nfrom Minnesota is addressing us. I couldn't hear him.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I asked my colleagues, if they want me to, I could do \nquick summaries of each one of these amendments. They can respond and \nthen we can vote one after another, if that would expedite the process.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is fine with me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Amendment No. 70, the first amendment, fixes the means \ntest so that it looks at present and future income, not over the past 6 \nmonths. If someone has been laid off work just yesterday and you look \nat their income over the past 6 months, that is not a very accurate way \nof determining whether or not they can file for chapter 7 or how they \ncan rebuild their lives. So this means test now in the bill is unfair. \nThis is a very important correction.\n  Amendment No. 71 strikes the 5-year waiting period for a new chapter \n13 filing. I thought colleagues wanted people to go chapter 13. You \nhave an elderly person, a major medical bill puts them under. They file \nfor chapter 13 under existing law. If it happens a year from now, they \ncan file for chapter 13 again. With this bill, they can't file chapter \n13 for 5 more years. This is especially discriminatory against elderly \npeople who are struggling with medical illness.\n  Finally, amendment No. 73, a safe harbor for folks who file because \nof job losses as a result of unfair foreign trade. What I am saying is, \nthere are many egregious loopholes that will make it hard for people to \nget the relief they need. At the very minimum, if you have people in \nyour State who have lost their jobs because of unfair competition, \nbecause of unfair trade competition, at the very minimum, they ought to \nbe exempt from these very harsh provisions. Many of us come from States \nwhere there are industrial workers. At the very minimum, we ought to be \nthere for them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time remains? Did the Senator from Minnesota use \nall his time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Do I have time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 4 seconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Did my colleague from New Mexico need this minute and \na half?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would like to use half of it, if the Senator would \ngive it to me, and I would ask the permission of the Senate to use the \ntime for something else.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That would be fine.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I so request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Domenici pertaining to the introduction of S. 543 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. HATCH. Has the time of the Senator from Minnesota expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I will be short. I know these amendments \nare well intentioned, but they are terrible amendments.\n  The first amendment allows dishonest debtors to shield legitimate \nincome from the court. The amendment creates a significant new loophole \nfor debtors to exploit. The amendment would create an inaccurate \npicture of even an honest debtor's income by limiting the time period \nover which the income was measured. The legislation already allows the \ncourt to make adjustments to a debtor's income if necessary and, if \nnecessary, to do justice. That amendment should be defeated.\n  The second amendment will allow debtors to game the bankruptcy system \nby repeatedly filing in chapter 13. By striking the 5-year waiting \nperiod, the amendment encourages abusive repeat filings one right after \nthe other. I hope our colleagues will vote that down.\n  The third amendment would jeopardize bankruptcy reform by completely \nexempting debtors who lose their jobs because of trade imports from the \nprovisions of the bill. Under the bill's means test, an unemployed \nworker would still be able to discharge all of his or her debts under \nchapter 7. This amendment, however, would exempt debtors from the \nalimony, child support, and other important protections provided by \nthis bill. I worked long and hard for that, and I think almost \neverybody in this body wants it. I can't imagine anybody voting for \nthat amendment, but I know it is well intentioned. We will leave it at \nthat.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                        Vote on Amendment No. 70\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n70.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.

Mr. President, I thank Senator Biden, Senator Hatch, and \nSenator Clinton, who worked so hard with me on this issue. I thank \nSenator Phil Gramm as well. What we do is simply say that the \ndefinition of a luxury item will be raised from $250 cumulative to \n$750. Frankly, I don't think that is high enough, but it certainly \nmoves us in the right direction. I hate to think that people who \naccumulate $250 on a credit card 90 days before bankruptcy will be \nassumed to be a bad person and committing fraud. I think this is a step \nin the right direction. I appreciate it.\n  I also thank Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy on the other issue that \nthey have agreed to place into the managers' amendment: My amendment to \nensure that public education expenses are protected in bankruptcy as \nwell as private education expenses.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? The \nquestion is agreeing to amendment No. 105.\n  The amendment (No. 105) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I further ask unanimous consent that the Senator from New \nJersey be recognized for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNevada for yielding the time.\n  For more than 4 years, this body has considered the need for \ncomprehensive bankruptcy reform. I have been very proud in each of \nthose years to work with Senator Hatch and Senator Grassley in \naccommodating the needs of individual Senators in fashioning what I \nthink is a fair and balanced approach.\n  I am certainly grateful to each of them, as well as Senator Biden, \nSenator Sessions, and Senator Leahy, for what I think has been an \nextraordinary and a very balanced approach on incredibly complicated \nlegislation that has accommodated so many individual Senators.\n  We are now approaching the end of this very long and detailed debate. \nI think it is worth noting, as we approach a final vote, that the \nlegislation before the Senate has not only been considered for many \nyears but has received extraordinarily broad and deep support in the \nCongress. Indeed, very similar legislation passed the House of \nRepresentatives 2 weeks ago on a bipartisan basis with more than 300 \nvotes.\n  That legislation provided an important change to what is, by any \nreasonable assessment, a very flawed bankruptcy system. Indeed, the \nbest evidence of the need for this reform is that in 1998 alone, in the \nmidst of one of the greatest economic expansions in\n\n[[Page S2349]]\n\nAmerican history, nearly 1.5 million Americans sought bankruptcy \nprotection. This is a staggering 350-percent increase since 1980.\n\n  Indeed, while the filings may have been reduced slightly in 1999, \nthey are still far too high. It is estimated that 70 percent of filings \nwere made in chapter 7, allowing a debtor to obtain relief from almost \nall of their unsecured debts. Conversely, only 30 percent of petitions \nfiled were under chapter 13, which requires a repayment plan. This is \nthe heart of the problem. People with an ability to repay some debts \nare repaying almost no debts because current bankruptcy law allows them \nto choose, totally escaping responsibility.\n  The Department of Justice estimated that 182,000 people last year \ncould have repaid some of these debts and didn't. The question has come \nto the floor of the Senate, these 182,000 people, representing some $4 \nbillion that could have been repaid but escaped repayment, what this \nmeans in public policy. Members of the Senate appropriately have raised \nquestions about the impact on families, on poor people, on middle-\nincome people, and on small businesses. Each of us has an obligation to \nensure people meet their responsibilities, that we are not ending the \nopportunities for people who want, need, and deserve a second chance in \nAmerican life.\n  To our credit, in our system we have allowed people who often, \nthrough no fault of their own, face bankruptcy to get another chance. \nWe have been particularly sensitive to the poor, that those who have \nbeen disadvantaged or face tragedy in their lives are given a chance to \nreorganize their lives, to start over, through the protection of \nbankruptcy. It is important that every Member of the Senate know that \nthis bankruptcy bill was rewritten to be sensitive to these needs, and \nmore.\n  It has been argued on the Senate floor that these protections would \nhelp large American companies--credit card companies, banks, large \nretailers--who sometimes now are left with the price of inappropriate \nbankruptcies. It may help their interests. But how about the small \nretailer or the consumer who ultimately pays for inappropriate \nbankruptcies? How about the small business--the contractor, the \nsubcontractor--that is left to absorb the cost of these inappropriate \nbankruptcies? It happens every day. As when one person or business \ninappropriately files for bankruptcy, though they could pay the bills \nand escape their obligation, that cost is passed along, not only to the \nconsumer who pays more for everything in every store through every \nproduct but the subcontractors, the mom-and-pop businesses that are \nsometimes forced out of business by abuse of the bankruptcy law.\n  I believe this reform and these changes protect them as well. But \neven so, if we did so while still victimizing the single mother or the \nchild or child support, it wouldn't be worth doing. Indeed, I would be \nhere opposing the bill rather than fighting for it.\n  That is not what we did. This bill protects the American family, the \nvulnerable child, the single mother. Under current bankruptcy law, a \nsingle parent and the child are seventh in line behind the Government, \naccountants, rent, storage, and tax claims. Under this bill, a mother \nand child seeking money in bankruptcy stand behind no one. They are \nfirst in line in claiming assets in any bankruptcy.\n  Second, the question has been brought to the Senate, How about those \nwho are poor and seek protection in bankruptcy? Are they jeopardized if \nthey are not single mothers or not children who, through no fault of \ntheir own, find themselves in bankruptcy?\n\n  This bill provides a waiver so any judge can use discretion to ensure \nany citizen who needs bankruptcy protection because of extraordinary or \nextenuating circumstances, who is otherwise not eligible, can and will \nget it.\n  Finally, the question has been raised on the Senate floor: Is it not \ntrue that all the fault of bankruptcy is not with the individual, it is \nsometimes with unscrupulous, unnecessary, even unconscionable credit \nsolicitations? I cannot tell the Senate that in every way this bill \nprovides all the consumer protection I think it should have. Rarely in \nthe Senate do we get to vote on perfect legislation as envisioned by \nany Member. The question is, as in protection for women and children, \nIs it better than current law? Unquestionably, the answer is yes.\n  There are 3.5 billion solicitations for credit cards in America every \nyear, 41 mailings for every man, woman, and child in the country. The \nissue before the Senate is, If this bill is passed, is the consumer \nbetter protected than under current law?\n  Under this bill, we will require the prominent disclosure of the \nimpact of making only minimum payments every month so every consumer \nknows. Every consumer today does not know.\n  It will require the disclosure of late fees, what they will be, and \nwhen they will be imposed. That is not required under current law.\n  It will require disclosure of the date under which introductory or \nteaser rates will expire, as well as what the permanent rate will be \nafter that time. That is not required under current law.\n  I do not say this will provide perfect consumer protection but it is \nbetter consumer protection.\n  So in all these ways we have taken a difficult situation, recognizing \nthe reality of abuse of bankruptcy laws, and provided a more fair bill, \nwith access to the courts, protecting the most vulnerable with \nmeaningful consumer protection. For all those reasons I ask Members of \nthe Senate who on several occasions previously have voted for this bill \nto do so again, recognizing the balance we have tried to reach in one \nof the most extraordinarily complex pieces of legislation in which I \nhave ever been involved, and that we follow our 300 colleagues in the \nHouse, vote for this legislation, get it to the President in the belief \nthat he will sign bankruptcy reform and will provide these added \nprotections for American businesses, large and small, and for American \nconsumers.\n  With all the costs being imposed on American businesses in difficult \nand competitive times, one of the costs that should not be imposed is \nunfair and unreasonable petitions for bankruptcy from people and \nbusinesses that have the ability to repay these debts.\n  At long last, after all these years, having spoken on this floor more \ntimes than I care to remember for bankruptcy reform, this is my last \nspeech. The Senate is nearing its last action. It is time to vote for \nthe bill and implement bankruptcy reform. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator from \nDelaware be recognized. We are trying to work out a unanimous consent \nagreement here. He will yield to us at such time as that is ready to \ngo.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Reid. As we come to a \nconclusion on this bill, I just ask a couple of rhetorical questions I \nwant us to consider. One of those is, do we believe as a people--not \njust as a Senate but as a people--that those in our country who incur \nsubstantial debt, in many cases through no fault of their own, should \nbe able to gain access to help, to the forgiveness that can be found in \na bankruptcy court? I think most of us would say, yes, they ought to \nhave that right.\n  If we ask the second question: If someone filing for bankruptcy has \nthe ability to repay a portion of their debts, should we expect that of \nthem? I think most of us in this Chamber and across the country would \nagree, if they have the ability to repay a portion of their debts, they \nought to do that.\n  Those are really the easy questions. The harder question in this \ndebate is how do you determine who has the ability to repay a portion \nof their debts? In some cases, we give to a bankruptcy judge the \ndiscretion to make those decisions. In the legislation before us today, \nthat we will vote on in a short while for final passage, we go a step \nbeyond that. It is a good step.\n  What we do is provide, in essence, a safe harbor for those who really \ndo not have a whole lot of money in the first place, so they can gain \naccess to file\n\n[[Page S2350]]\n\nunder chapter 7 and not have to go through an extended process of \ndemonstrating a need or lack of means.\n  The way it works is pretty simple. I will discuss it again. I want to \nreiterate it.\n  Those families whose income is below 100 percent of family median \nincome--that is about $46,000 in Delaware for a family of four; in \nAlabama it might be $33,000; in Connecticut it might be $50,000--have a \nsafe harbor. They can go right to chapter 7 and file. That is pretty \nmuch the ball game.\n  For those whose income is between 100 percent of median income and \n150 percent of median income, they have the option to get an expedited \nreview, and in all likelihood will go ahead and file under chapter 7 as \nwell.\n  For those people who have extenuating circumstances, and they don't \nmeet either the test of safe harbor, the test of 100 percent or 150 \npercent of median family income, or they have extra medical expenses, \nthose can be taken into account. If they have extra expenses for \neducational needs, those can become extenuating circumstances. For \npeople who have seen a marriage end or for people who have lost their \njobs, those can be extenuating circumstances and be accounted for by a \nbankruptcy judge who is given discretion to decide whether or not a \nperson can then go ahead and file under chapter 7.\n  There is another very important change in the bill. I would like to \nshare a letter I received from the child support enforcement agency in \nmy State. As in other States, Delaware has a child support enforcement \nagency to make sure parents meet their obligations to their children \nfor whom they do not have custody. In my State, our child support \nenforcement agency endorsed this legislation.\n  Frankly, that has been the case in virtually every State across \nAmerica. The reason they do it is simple. This legislation makes it \nmore likely that people who have an obligation to the children for whom \nthey don't have custody will meet their obligations. Similarly, people \nwho have an obligation to their spouse or former spouse for alimony \nwill meet that obligation.\n  Under current law, once satisfied in bankruptcy, there are secured \ncreditors, and there is money left over. When it comes to unsecured \ncreditors, children and former spouses are near the end of the line.\n  Under this bill, children, alimony payments, and child support \npayments move not to the end of the line under the nonsecured creditors \nbut to the front of the line. That is an important change of which we \nneed to be mindful.\n  I know not everybody agrees with what we have done. There is some \ndisagreement as well.\n  We had debate on an amendment that said to those people who might try \nto take their assets and go to a State where there is no limit on the \namount of money they can put into an estate, a home, or residence to \nprotect it from bankruptcy--we have attempted to make a real change \nthere--to the extent they would have done it, it would have had to have \nbeen at least 2 years before bankruptcy, and it is capped at $150,000.\n  I know that causes heartburn for some people. But it also goes a long \nway in protecting the abuses that occasionally occur when people do \njust that.\n  I thank Senator Hatch and Senator Sessions. I express my thanks to \nthose on our side--especially to Senator Biden and Senator Torricelli, \nand others--who have worked real hard to get us to a compromise which I \nthink is fairer to creditors and certainly fairer to those who incur \ndebt than is the current case.\n\n  I think it significantly increases the ability for those who have the \ncapability of paying their debts to do so while better ensuring that \nthose who do not will not be punished.\n  I yield back the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe we are ready to go with a \nunanimous consent agreement which will allow us to complete action on \nthis legislation and hopefully go to conference. Let me propound the \nrequest, see if we can get it locked in so that we can go ahead and get \na vote here shortly. Let me note before I do that, we may allow, for \ninstance, 10 minutes or 15 minutes for debate. I am assuming that maybe \nmost of it will be yielded back. Obviously, you don't have to use the \nfull time. That is why we do put some amount of time in here so that it \nwill be available if there is a need for it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Sessions be recognized to offer \nhis amendment No. 59, that it be considered in order, and there be up \nto 10 minutes for debate, and following that debate, the amendment be \nagreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table. I \nfurther ask unanimous consent that Senator Feingold then be recognized \nto call up his amendment No. 51 and there be up to 15 minutes for \ndebate and, following the debate, a vote occur.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that all of the pending amendments be \nwithdrawn, and I ask unanimous consent that following that, the Senate \nproceed to a managers' amendment, to be followed by third reading of \nthe Senate bill, and the Senate proceed to the House companion bill, \nH.R. 333, and that the text of S. 420 be inserted, the bill be advanced \nto third reading, and passage occur on H.R. 333, as amended, and the \nSenate bill be placed on the calendar.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator allow me to make a statement?\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to Senator Reid for a comment at this point.\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask that we vote on the Senate bill. That is what we had \nagreed to do.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, on that, since the Chair asked for consent \nand it was objected to, Senator Reid is suggesting that a change be \nmade. For the information of all Senators, this is standard and routine \nlanguage necessary to send a bill to conference. This action is made \nand agreed to 40, 50 times on average in a year of a Senate session. \nHowever, this objection indicates to me that, once again, the goal here \nis to try to make it difficult for us to get to conference. The Senator \nfrom Minnesota knows what the rules are and what his rights are. You \nrecall last year we had a hard time getting the bankruptcy bill into \nconference. It was for a different set of reasons, but that is what we \nhave here, too.\n  Again, I may have to go through some hoops to get this bill to \nconference. That could take some time, and I am prepared to do that, \nsince there was objection heard. I think that with the kind of support \nthis bill has, with Senators speaking for it on both sides of the \naisle, and with 80 Senators voting to invoke cloture, surely a bill \nwith that kind of support--and I assume there are going to be about 80 \nvotes for it on final passage--we should find a way to get it to \nconference.\n  Since objection was heard, then I renew my request but amend it to \nwithdraw the reference to the House companion bill so that passage \nwould occur on the Senate bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I say to my \nfriend from Alabama principally, because of a Senator wanting to vote \non the underlying Feingold amendment and time being so precious, would \nthe Senator from Alabama agree to roll those, have his after Senator \nFeingold debates his?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. We are not going to vote on my amendment.\n  Mr. REID. That is correct.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would like to have it accepted before, and I would \nnot need but 1 minute to comment on it.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Feingold is here on the floor. The other question \nis, he has another amendment; it was my understanding that that was not \ngoing to be offered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I would just need a couple minutes to offer that as \nwell.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thought we clearly had an understanding on \nthat. That additional Feingold amendment was not included in the UC. I\n\n[[Page S2351]]\n\nurge the Senators to let us proceed with this UC because we are under \nsevere time constraints now. Could we proceed with the UC as requested?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I want to \nbe clear on the amendment No. 51, that was No. 51, as modified. The \nleader originally said amendment No. 51.\n  Mr. REID. As modified.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. As modified.\n  Mr. LOTT. We will make that change in the request: Amendment No. 51, \nas modified.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Although I had intended to offer the other amendment, \ngiven the situation here, even though it is a very worthy amendment and \nreally should be brought up on the floor, I am going to withdraw it at \nthis time.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would like to express our appreciation to Senator \nFeingold for his willingness to do that in an effort to accommodate \nSenators on both sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. Leader, I will just briefly say it is my fault. I \nexplained that to Senator Hatch, and that was the agreement we had. I \napologize to my friend from Wisconsin.\n  Prior to passage, Senator Daschle wishes 5 minutes and Senator John \nKerry 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would modify the request but also would \nneed to reserve an equal amount of time for Senator Hatch or his \ndesignee of 15 minutes in addition to that 15 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Reserving the right to object, I want to be sure that \nthe modified language Senator Feingold cared about and that he wanted \nin there--we have agreed on that language?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we have \nagreed on the modification.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I believe we have, and I will not object.\n  Mr. REID. The Chair has not accepted the unanimous consent agreement \nyet; is that true?\n  I have been informed that the manager on this side wants 5 minutes, \nand the manager on the other side wants 5 minutes before final passage.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe Senator Hatch would be in control, or his \ndesignee, of a total of 20 minutes and 20 minutes on the other side \ndivided among Senators Daschle, Leahy, Kerry and I hope none of them \nwill take the full time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the leader's request, as \namended?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 59, As Modified\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I offer my amendment No. 59, as \nmodified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 59, as modified.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 148, strike line 4 and all that follows through \n     page 151, line 15, and insert the following:\n       (a) In General.--Section 362(b) of title 11, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) by inserting after paragraph (21), as added by this \n     Act, the following:\n       ``(23) under subsection (a)(3), of the commencement or \n     continuation of any eviction, unlawful detainer action, or \n     similar proceeding by a lessor against a debtor seeking \n     possession of residential property--\n       ``(A) on which the debtor resides as a tenant; and\n       ``(B) with respect to which--\n       ``(i) the debtor fails to make a rental payment that first \n     becomes due under the unexpired specific term of a rental \n     agreement or lease or under a tenancy under applicable State, \n     or local rent control law, after the date of filing of the \n     petition or during the 10-day period preceding the date of \n     filing of the petition, if the lessor files with the court a \n     certification that the debtor has not made a payment for rent \n     and serves a copy of the certification upon the debtor; or\n       ``(ii) the debtor has a month to month tenancy (or one of \n     shorter term) other than under applicable State or local rent \n     control law where timely payments are made pursuant to clause \n     (i), if the lessor files with a court a certification that \n     the requirements of this clause have been met and serves a \n     copy of the certification upon the debtor.\n       ``(24) under subsection (a)(3), of the commencement or \n     continuation of any eviction, unlawful detainer action, or \n     similar proceeding by a lessor against a debtor seeking \n     possession of residential property, if during the 2-year \n     period preceding the date of filing of the petition, the \n     debtor or another occupant of the leased premises--\n       ``(A) commenced another case under this title; and\n       ``(B) failed to make any rental payment that first became \n     due under applicable nonbankruptcy law after the date of \n     filing of the petition for that other case;\n       ``(25) under subsection (a)(3), of an eviction action, to \n     the extent that it seeks possession based on endangerment of \n     property or the illegal use of controlled substances on the \n     property, if the lessor files with the court a certification \n     that such an eviction has been filed or the debtor has \n     endangered property or illegally used or allowed to be used a \n     controlled substance on the property during the 30-day period \n     preceding the date of filing of the certification, and serves \n     a copy of the certification upon the debtor;''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end of the flush material at the end \n     of the subsection the following: ``With respect to the \n     applicability of paragraph (23) or (25) to a debtor with \n     respect to the commencement or continuation of a proceeding \n     described in any such paragraph, the exception to the \n     automatic stay shall become effective on the 15th day after \n     the lessor meets the filing and notification requirements \n     under any such paragraph, unless--\n       ``(A) the debtor files a certification with the court and \n     serves a copy of that certification upon the lessor on or \n     before that 15th day, that--\n       ``(i) contests the truth or legal sufficiency of the \n     lessor's certification; or\n       ``(ii) states that the tenant has taken such action as may \n     be necessary to remedy the subject of the certification under \n     paragraph (23)(B)(i), except that no tenant may take \n     advantage of such remedy more than once under this title; or\n       ``(B) the court orders that the exception to the automatic \n     stay shall not become effective, or provides for a later date \n     of applicability.''.\n       (3) by adding at the end of the flush material added by \n     paragraph (2), the following:\n\n     Where a debtor makes a certification under subparagraph (A), \n     the clerk of the court shall set a hearing on a date no later \n     than 10 days after the date of the filing of the \n     certification of the debtor and provide written notice \n     thereof.

Mr. President, Senator Feingold and I have worked on \nthis for some time. He cares very deeply about this. I did, too, as a \nmatter of legal principle and what I thought was correct. I think we \nhave language with which both of us can live. The perfect being the \nenemy of the good, we might as well just take the good and bring this \nmatter to a conclusion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as the Senator from Alabama suggested, I \ndon't think either one of us is entirely happy with the outcome of \nthis. I hope we have something that takes a more reasonable approach to \nthe landlord-tenant situation.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I yield back my time on the amendment \nand suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the amendment No. \n59, as modified, is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 59), as modified, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 51, As Modified\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I send amendment No. 51, as modified, to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], for himself, Mr. \n     Thompson and Mr. Wellstone, proposes an amendment numbered \n     51, as modified.\n\n\n[[Page S2352]]\n\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To strike section 1310, relating to barring certain foreign \n                               judgments)\n\n       On page 439, strike line 19 and all that follows through \n     page 440, line 12.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am happy to be joined in offering this \nbipartisan amendment by the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Thompson, and \nthe Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone. I ask unanimous consent they \nbe listed as original cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this amendment would delete section 1310 \nfrom the bill. Section 1310 is the epitome of a special interest fix--\nits language purports to be general, it identifies no particular \nperson, but it is targeted to affect only a tiny number of people who \nwere involved in cases arising out of transactions with Lloyd's of \nLondon, a large multinational insurance company.\n\n  Those people who invested with Lloyd's are called ``names.'' This \nprovision, which bars the enforcement of certain foreign judgments \nagainst some of the ``names'' has nothing whatsoever to do with \nbankruptcy law. Very few people have heard of it but it has some \nhistory: It has been quietly promoted for at least a couple of years \nnow, but it has never been the subject of a full hearing in the \nJudiciary committee. It found its way into the conference report that \nserved as a vehicle for bankruptcy legislation last year, although it \nhad never been debated or discussed in committee or on the floor. Let \nme emphasize that point: this special provision was nowhere to be found \nin the Senate bankruptcy bill in the last Congress. Nor was it in the \nHouse bankruptcy bill last year. Yet somehow, late last year, it was \nquietly slipped into the conference vehicle that was negotiated in \nsecret. That vehicle was the empty shell of a bill unrelated to \nbankruptcy, into which was inserted the version of the bankruptcy bill \nfavored by the majority leadership, along with the special-interest \nprovision that my amendment seeks to strike. Somebody in Congress \narranged that, but nobody in Congress ever voted on it. In the end, \nlast year's conference report was vetoed.\n  As a result Section 1310 has been treated as part of the bill we \nstarted with this year, and it has reappeared in the version of the \nbill before us: the same provision, designed to assist only about 250 \ninvestors in Lloyds of London, the Names, who lost money on asbestos-\nrelated claims in the 1980s. These individuals had judgments entered \nagainst them in British courts, and American courts repeatedly have \ndeclined to throw out those judgments. In fact, eight circuit courts \nhave ruled that these investors' disputes with Lloyds should be settled \nin British courts. Now, to be fair, the Names have attorneys who argue \nthat the British courts won't treat their clients fairly and that their \nclients have suffered as a result. So they have been seeking special \ntreatment from the Congress, and if the final conference vehicle had \nnot been vetoed last year they would have succeeded.\n\n  Mr. President, this provision has been opposed by the State \nDepartment, under President Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. The State \nDepartment is worried about the impact of a law that gives the back of \nthe hand to respected foreign courts, courts that we will rightly \nexpect to respect and enforce the judgments of American courts. Here is \nwhat a State Department spokesman had to say about this issue in a \nReuters article, dated March 13:\n\n       We have reservations about section 1301. There are \n     commercial disputes involving U.S. and British companies \n     every day. It is inevitable that, in some of those disputes, \n     U.S. parties will lose.\n       But this cannot be the basis for the U.S. Congress to \n     overturn decisions of both British and U.S. courts. Such \n     action would be directly at odds with our own international \n     economic policy, which promotes a rules-based system premised \n     on the rule of law to protect U.S. investors abroad.\n\n  Just this morning Mr. President, I received a letter in support of \nour amendment, signed by Secretary of State Colin Powell and Secretary \nof the Treasury Paul O'Neill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       The Secretary of State,\n\n                                       Washington, March 15, 2001.\n     Hon. Russell D. Feingold,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator Feingold: We write in support of the amendment \n     that you and Senator Thompson have introduced to S. 420 (The \n     Bankruptcy Reform Act). The Administration supports the \n     overall bankruptcy reforms contained in S. 420. However, the \n     Administration opposes Section 1310, which would bar \n     enforcement in the United States of any foreign judgment \n     between 1975 and 1993 if a U.S. court finds that the judgment \n     was derived from fraud.\n       Section 1310 is intended to provide relief for some \n     American investors who have a private commercial dispute with \n     the Lloyd's of London (UK) insurance market that, according \n     to the contracts they signed with Lloyd's, must be heard in \n     British courts. U.S. courts have dismissed all attempts by \n     these investors to sue here, requiring that they resolve \n     their dispute in the United Kingdom as provided by their \n     contractors. U.S. courts have upheld the enforcement of the \n     U.K. court judgments. The investors now want legislation to \n     overturn these decisions.\n       By directing the outcome in these court cases, Section 1310 \n     has the potential to undercut the rule of law as it applies \n     across international borders today, with serious consequences \n     for U.S. commercial and other interests. Commercial disputes \n     involving American and British companies arise every day, and \n     it is inevitable that American parties sometimes lose. \n     However, that cannot be the basis for federal legislation to \n     overturn the decisions of both British and U.S. courts. Such \n     action would be directly at odds with our goals of promoting \n     a rules-based system to protect U.S. investors abroad.\n       The American investors have had the opportunity to argue \n     the merits of their position before U.S. courts, as well as \n     in the United Kingdom, but have not prevailed. For example, \n     under U.S. law, our courts can refuse to enforce foreign \n     court judgments if they find that the foreign court failed to \n     follow fundamental standards of fairness and due process, or \n     if the judgments violated our public policy. State and \n     federal courts hearing these cases have not found this \n     threshold to be met.\n       In these circumstances, intervening in these private \n     commercial matters through legislation could open the door to \n     reciprocal treatment in other countries. The result would be \n     to undercut the orderliness and predictability that are \n     essential to international business transactions and crucial \n     to our Nation's economic well-being. It could also weaken our \n     ability to negotiate new international rules on enforcement \n     of civil judgments and to promote the enforcement of child \n     custody cases.\n       We respectfully urge that the Senate adopt the amendment to \n     remove Section 1310 from the Bankruptcy Reform Act.\n           Sincerely,\n     Paul H. O'Neill,\n                                        Secretary of the Treasury.\n     Colin L. Powell,\n                                               Secretary of State.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. The Organization for International Investment, the \nNational Association of Insurance Commissioners, and the Council of \nInsurance Agents and Brokers oppose the provision because of their \nconcern over its potential impact on the international insurance \nmarket.\n  Now I realize there are arguments on the other side. The Names argue \nthat they were defrauded by Lloyds, misled into investing when Lloyds \nknew that there were going to be many claims based on asbestos \nlitigation. And despite their consistent losses in courts on both sides \nof the Atlantic, they might be right, and maybe the courts have been \nwrong not to let them make their claims of fraud in the way that they \ndesired.\n  They may believe they were right to try to avoid the judgments \nagainst them. But Mr. President, I don't think we in the Senate are in \na better position than the courts to assess those arguments at this \npoint. I am not yet convinced that this is a matter that should be \naddressed by legislation, certainly not by bankruptcy legislation, and \nvery certainly not without a hearing. At the very least, we need to \nhave a full hearing and air these issues in a public forum, that will \nlend itself to a thoughtful and deliberate consideration of the issues. \nThe kind of insiders' deal that led to this provision being added for a \nsmall group of people should be unacceptable to anyone who cares about \nmaintaining the people's confidence in the integrity of the legislative \nprocess.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in this bipartisan effort to strike \nthis provision for a few simple reasons: It is a special deal for a \nvery small group of people--they represent about one one-millionth of \nour population, but they somehow had the clout to get it inserted into \nthe bill; it will undermine\n\n[[Page S2353]]\n\nthe ability of American courts to see their judgments enforced abroad; \nand it has not been fully considered by the Judiciary Committee or the \nfull Senate--there have been no hearings, no debate and until the last \nfew days, no knowledge by most members that this provision was even a \npart of the bill.\n  We should strike Section 1310 and then we should ensure that it does \nnot sneak back into the bill at a later date. If we adopt this \namendment, I will keep an open mind on the issue of the remaining \nLloyds names if it comes before the committee in the future, and I \nwon't oppose a request to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee to \nschedule a hearing to examine the issues in full if the Names wish to \npursue a legislative remedy through the normal channels. But until \nthen, this special interest provision has no place in the bankruptcy \nbill or any other bill.\n  Mrs. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I have received a number of letters on \nthis subject. I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     New York, NY.\n     Re 8-420 Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection \n         Act of 2001, Sec. 1310. Enforcement of Certain Foreign \n         Judgments Barred.\n\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: I write to enlist your support in \n     protecting hundreds of innocent victims from what many \n     consider to be the biggest, most sophisticated, deliberate \n     securities fraud in financial history that has been \n     perpetrated by Lloyd's of London.\n       In the mid-seventies, when Lloyd's realized the extent of \n     their exposure from underwriting insurance policies exposed \n     to huge losses from asbestosis and pollution they set out to \n     recruit Americans and other foreign investors to fund their \n     losses. They did this with what we now know were fallacious \n     financial statements for unregistered securities. More than \n     three thousand Americans, who are called Names, were \n     recruited. They were induced on the basis of Lloyd's three \n     hundred year history to undertake what was purported to be a \n     safe, conservative investment. My involvement with Lloyd's \n     has resulted, so far, in the loss of my family home, over \n     three hundred thousand dollars and my good health. Stress \n     from Lloyd's produced heart attack. Am 77.\n       Over the years, many Names have become old and the draining \n     of their resources has brought much hardship to those \n     employed and to those no longer employed, especially those \n     who were counting on some income from their Lloyd's \n     investment to help sustain them in retirement. The constant \n     stress, effort and anxiety endured in battling for our \n     constitutional right to a fair trail, which Lloyd's has \n     fought with over eighty million dollars paid to lawyers, \n     lobbyists and campaign contributions to legislators and \n     insurance commissioners, has taken a toll on all of us. Names \n     have already sacrificed millions of dollars, stock and real \n     estate to satisfy Lloyd's claims, but they are not through \n     with having us cover their losses and that is why we need \n     your help in passing Sec. 1310. I implore you to resist \n     efforts by those conspiring to deny Names of their right to \n     due process. The deceit and arrogance of Lloyd's can no \n     longer be tolerated.\n       For the full, sordid story of fraud at Lloyd's I refer you \n     to www.truthaboutlloyds, the special twenty-four page report \n     in the February 21, 2000 European Edition of Time magazine \n     and current articles in the Los Angeles Times on the former \n     California Insurance Commissioner's acceptance of gifts and \n     four hundred thousand dollars from Lloyd's and their lawyers, \n     LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae, for among other things \n     promoting opposition in the insurance and legal communities \n     to the just claims and interests of the Names.\n       Thank you for your kind attention and, I hope, your vote in \n     favor of S. 420, Sec. 1310.\n           Yours truly,\n     Edith Anthoine.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               San Antonio TX,\n\n                                                   March 13, 2001.\n     Hon. Mary Landrieu,\n     Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: I am an 80-year-old grandmother who \n     has worked and saved all my life and who attempts to live \n     honorably, only to be cheated and lied to by fancy pants, \n     smooth talking Englishmen representing Lloyd's of London. For \n     the past decade I have been traumatized by their threats. \n     Much of my life savings have been depleted by their \n     fraudulent representations. They have used every legal trick \n     known, plus many they invented, to keep out of U.S. courts \n     because they, along with those who have aided and abetted \n     them, know that their lawlessness and misdeeds would be \n     exposed.\n       As I understand the Bankruptcy Bill, Section 1310 prohibits \n     the granting of a foreign judgment without giving the \n     defrauded defendant an opportunity to present the merits of \n     his/her case in a U.S. court. It seems to me that any fair-\n     minded person would savor the justice implicit in this \n     Amendment. Foreign interlopers who commit fraud in this \n     country should not use the technicalities of foreign \n     judgments to harvest their fraudulent gains. This will \n     provide Constitutional due process to me and other Lloyd's \n     victims. It will also provide American due process to future \n     victims of fraud by foreigners.\n       I urge, and count on you to enthusiastically support this \n     Amendment. Thank you for your help on this vital matter.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Joan B. Wilson.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   March 13, 2001.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu, I am a senior citizen and am among \n     those who have been hurt by Lloyds.\n       Right now, of course, I need what funds I do have to live \n     on as I cannot work anymore. We (my now deceased husband & \n     myself) had to sell an income producing apartment house in \n     downtown Reno in order to pay what they requested of our \n     letter of credit. In addition they wanted even more than \n     that. We could not pay it. So, we were not ``wealthy \n     Americans'' who could afford a big loss, or who refused to \n     pay--we just didn't have it.\n       With the constant threat of Lloyds grabbing everything--\n     life as you may understand--was not easy. However, compared \n     to those who went bankrupt or homeless--as dreadful as our \n     situation was, we were better off than those who went \n     bankrupt or lost their homes. Lloyds is without a conscience.\n           Sincerely,\n     Beverly Hudson.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              New Orleans, LA,\n\n                                                   March 13, 2001.\n     Re Section 1310 of the Bankruptcy Bill (S-420).\n\n     Hon. Mary Landrieu,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: I am a 72-year-old widow whose \n     husband was an investor in Lloyd's of London along with my \n     son and daughter. When my husband learned of Lloyd's fraud \n     and the devastating affect it could have upon our two \n     children he spent tireless hours attempting to right this \n     very very wrong. It seemed at every turn, Lloyd's was far too \n     powerful and far too well heeled, for my husband to fight \n     this massive institution. As the stress continued to mount \n     against him, in November of 1993 he died of a heart attack.\n       What Lloyd's of London did to my husband and my family, I \n     will never forgive. It is my understanding that you are \n     making the effort to stand up for the rights of Lloyd's \n     investors by urging the passage of Section 1310 in the \n     Bankruptcy Bill. It is my understanding that Section 1310 is \n     designed to provide a level playing field, something that \n     neither my husband nor children have had in connection with \n     their investment at Lloyd's. You are absolutely doing the \n     right thing.\n       I would ask that you let other colleagues in the Senate \n     know that if Section 1310 is not passed it will likely wipe \n     out all that my husband and two children have worked for. I \n     ask for my children, that you ask your colleagues to pass \n     Section 1310 and give all of Lloyd's investors a fighting \n     chance to put Lloyd's fraud behind them forever.\n       I would also like to thank you very much on behalf of my \n     family for taking the time to correct this wrong and not \n     having asked for anything in return.\n           Thank you very much,\n     Ruth G. Tufts.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              San Antonio, TX,\n\n                                                   March 13, 2001.\n     Senator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       I am writing to you about S. 420 Bankruptcy Bill, Sec. \n     1310. I am desperately in need of your support of this \n     legislation. It will allow me to raise a defense of fraud \n     prior to any enforcement of Lloyd's of London judgment \n     against me issued by a thoroughly biased English Court. Why \n     is Lloyd's so fearful of facing the U.S. Justice system if \n     they are not guilty?\n       Lloyd's of London purposely withheld and actively concealed \n     information from U.S. citizens regarding existing asbestos \n     claims. I foolishly believed their prior reputation and \n     invested the inheritance that my father worked so hard for--\n     only to lose it all--and much more. I was repeatedly falsely \n     reassured in written communications that ``things would \n     certainly improve next year''. As you no doubt know, the U.S. \n     Justice Department and Postal Service is currently \n     investigating Lloyd's. How can they have any credibility at \n     all? I resigned in 1993 and have been fighting them at great \n     financial and emotional expense ever since.\n       I am not a wealthy person. I am the same Shirley Cook, \n     third grade teacher, mentioned in the Time Magazine article \n     of February 28, 2000. I am now retired, age 65 and receive \n     slightly over $20,000.00 per year in retirement. I live in a \n     quite average house with a leaky roof and currently drive a \n     seven year automobile.\n       Lloyd's has offered me a ``settlement'' of its fraudulent \n     claims against me, but offer no legitimate proof of the \n     validity of their demands. Even worse, there is no finality. \n     If they want more money anytime in the future, all they have \n     to do is bill me. If I move, I must notify them of my \n     whereabouts! In fact, by payment of the settlement offer, I \n     absolve them of any past, present or future claim of fraud \n     and give up all rights to recourse of any kind. This is \n     certainly not the American way. It is a travesty, and to me, \n     personally, a tragedy.\n\n[[Page S2354]]\n\n       I implore you to vigorously support and vote for justice \n     for the Americans, your constituents, who were ill treated by \n     a foreign court favoring a dishonest foreign company.\n           Most respectfully,\n     Shirley M.

Mary Landrieu,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: As an 80 year old grandmother, who \n     has been thoroughly skinned by Lloyd's of London, I am again \n     dismayed by their arrogance and audacity in coming to \n     Washington to oppose legislation aimed at assuring Americans \n     Constitutional due process in United States courts.\n       It is obvious to me that they are afraid that a trial on \n     the merits would expose their fraud and deviousness. The \n     United States Department of Justice, the Postal Service and \n     the California Attorney General all seem to smell a rat in \n     their behavior. Please don't let them pull the wool over the \n     eyes of the Senate. I plead with you to support Section 1310 \n     of the Bankruptcy Bill.\n       Trusting your wisdom and support, I remain\n           Respectfully and sincerely yours,\n     Joan B.

I'm not the suicide type and I intend \n     to fight to the last ditch, but they have made light of the \n     many years I have worked and lived carefully, of the fact \n     that I trusted them on their assurance that Names would be \n     first in their consideration, that they would certainly honor \n     my request for modest and safe participation in their \n     investments.\n       I had a sum of money because I lost my husband in an \n     airplane accident from which I miraculously was rescued. The \n     court awarded me some money. That together with my earnings \n     which were at the time $39,000 annually, gave me $400,000, \n     which was enough for them to accept me. Obviously it had to \n     be a modest participation. I told them my goals were to make \n     a bit of supplementary money annually. They appeared to \n     understand. But what they did was something else again. They \n     put me on syndicates which they knew to be already \n     treacherous--with upcoming liabilities of billions of \n     dollars. What kind of a character does that? Do they deserve \n     the immunity that their courts have granted them? The inside \n     traders all took themselves off the syndicates. The man who \n     handled my affairs retired (in his 50s) and I should have \n     suspected.\n       I'm still working. I really dare not stop. If we can get \n     1301 through, we will not be ducking our debts. We will \n     simply be getting the time and opportunity to bring our fraud \n     charges to the American court system where we as citizens \n     should be able to plead our case and have it aired once and \n     for all. Please help to give us that chance.\n       Thank you for your attention to my letter.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Barbara Lyons.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              New Orleans, LA,\n\n                                                   March 13, 2001.\n     Re Section 1310 of the Bankruptcy Bill (S-420).\n\n     Hon. Mary Landrieu,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: I respectfully urge your continued \n     support of Section 1310 and that you inform your Senate \n     colleagues of the importance of this provision, which will do \n     no more than give me and hundreds of other defrauded U.S. \n     citizens the ability to defend ourselves against the fraud \n     perpetrated by Lloyd's of London.\n       Already as a result of Lloyd's fraud, I have had several \n     hundred thousand dollars confiscated by them; my wife and I \n     have partitioned our community to protect what is left of our \n     estate, and I have spent countless hours and spent thousands \n     of dollars in attorneys fees preparing for bankruptcy and \n     otherwise fighting the terrible Lloyd's nemace.\n       If Section 1310 is not adopted, it is highly likely that \n     Lloyd's will successfully (and wrongly) reap the rewards of \n     their fraud against those hundreds of U.S. citizens and, \n     personally, require me to file for bankruptcy.\n       As always, your help in protecting me, the citizens of \n     Louisiana, and in this case hundreds of U.S. citizens across \n     the country, is most appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Thomas O. Lind.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I agree with my colleague's assessment. \nThis is simply an effort to abrogate a series of contracts. This was a \ncontract dispute involving thousands of people; 97 percent of those \npeople settled those lawsuits. There were some who didn't settle them. \nThey went to court in England and raised a fraud claim and lost. They \nwent to court in this country and raised the fraud claim and lost.\n  In fact, there were two sets of lawsuits in England and two sets in \nAmerica, and in every case the ultimate disposition at the appellate \ncourt level--five appellate courts in the U.S. ruled on the venue \nquestion, for example. In each and every case, they had their day in \ncourt and they lost. Some of them were on the fraud issue and some on \nother issues.\n  The bottom line is that it is not our job in Congress to determine \nfactual issues in a lawsuit. So after having lost two sets of lawsuits \nin each country, they have here a provision in the bankruptcy bill that \nwould in effect open the lawsuit again. It says, ``notwithstanding any \nother provision of law or contract . . ..'' So it is a clear abrogation \nof contracts and opens the situation again for courts in this country.\n  In addition to that, I am afraid it is clearly unconstitutional. \nSpecifically, it violates article III in that it represents a \ncongressional attempt to dictate a result with respect to the parties \nin a final determination by an article III court. As Judge Posner, of \nthe Sixth Circuit, said, this thing has been litigated in England. The \nEnglish system comports to our system. It is not exactly as if there \nwas a due process of law situation. Most of us understand from where \nour court system comes. It was litigated. By this law, we are \nattempting to open up and overturn a final determination by an American \ncourt. If we get in the business in the Congress of overturning \nlawsuits with results we don't like, we will have clearly gone down a \nslippery slope and will be going contrary to the rule of law.\n  Secretary Powell and Secretary O'Neill have sent us a letter, and it \ncontains this provision:\n\n       By directing the outcome in these court cases, Section 1310 \n     has the potential to undercut the rule of law as it applies \n     across international borders today, with serious consequences \n     for U.S. commercial and other interests.\n\n  I think they are right. Our sympathy is with the 300 or so Americans \nwho had the opportunity to litigate this and lost, just as our sympathy \nis with the several thousand people who lost money and settled the \nlawsuits.\n  But the rule of law must prevail, and we must be concerned about our \nown commercial interests if, in fact, we do this when we have a British \ncitizen over here in our court that makes a similar determination.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask the Senator from Tennessee if he will yield so I \ncan offer a minute to the Senator from Texas and a minute to the \nSenator from Delaware.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Tennessee.\n  I yield a minute to the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, all over the world tonight, legislative \nbodies are meeting to try to protect their citizens from living up to \nobligations that they have with American economic interests. All over \nthe world tonight, legislative bodies that don't live up to the \nstandards we have set for this, the greatest deliberative body in \nhistory, are trying to change domestic laws to make it possible for \npeople to violate international standards of business.\n  There is no one in this body I care more about than the distinguished \nSenator from Alabama, and I have no doubt that there may very well have \nbeen wrongs committed in terms of selling people part of this \nliability. But I urge my colleagues tonight to look at the big issue of \nthe viability of world commerce, and the enforceability of contracts, \nand to live up to the standards of the greatest deliberative body in \nhistory by adopting this amendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Biden.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks of the \nSenator from Tennessee, as well as the Senator from Texas. \nInternational relations, this would be a very serious mistake for us to \nmake. Beyond commerce, this will do damage, in my view,\n\n[[Page S2355]]\n\nto our relations also with Great Britain. This will make it difficult \nfor us to make the case that when we want foreign courts to make \nconcessions based upon our needs, for them to be willing to do so, I \nthink it is a mistake.\n  I understand and admire the Senator from Alabama for his desire to \nprotect the interests of a citizen or citizens of his State, or others, \nbut I think this is a mistake.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama has 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will refer to a letter from \nCongressman Henry Hyde, chairman of the House of Representatives \nCommittee on International Relations and former chairman of the House \nJudiciary Committee, a man of great knowledge and experience. He says:\n\n       This provision does not impact State regulation of \n     insurance and it does not violate any treaty obligations of \n     this country. Consistent with the Hague Convention, \n     recognition of a foreign award may be refused if the court in \n     the country where enforcement is sought finds that \n     ``recognition or enforcement of the award would be contrary \n     to the public policy of that country.'' It certainly is \n     contrary to the public policy of this country [Chairman \n     Hyde continues] for an individual to be defrauded and then \n     denied the right to assert fraud as a defense.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters from \nthe former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Alabama, and a former \nDemocratic Senator from this body, Howell Heflin, who said:\n\n       As a former judge, I am appalled at this entire situation.\n\n  I also ask unanimous consent to have a letter from Senator Robert \nKerrey of Nebraska and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana in reference to this \nmatter, as well as a letter from Laura Unger, acting chairman of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      U.S. Securities and Exchange\n\n\n                                                   Commission,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 1, 2001.\n     Hon. Michael G. Oxley,\n     Chairman, Committee on Financial Services, House of \n         Representatives, Rayburn House Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Oxley: Thank you for your letter dated \n     February 28, 2001 regarding Lloyd's of London. As you stated \n     in your letter, the SEC has filed a number of briefs amicus \n     curiae with United States Courts of Appeals stating that \n     forum selection provisions entered into between Lloyd's and \n     plaintiffs in the cases violated the anti-waiver provisions \n     of the United States federal securities laws. The SEC stated \n     that these provisions acted to prohibit courts from giving \n     effect to contractual provisions precluding purchasers from \n     obtaining relief under the federal securities laws.\n       As we stated in our briefs, Congress has made a legislative \n     determination of the rights and obligations necessary to \n     protect investors in the United States and directed that \n     those provisions cannot be waived. As a result, we continue \n     to believe that the antiwaiver provisions of the federal \n     securities laws render void any agreement to waive compliance \n     with those laws. The SEC, however, submitted its briefs \n     solely to address the legal issue of the applicability of the \n     anti-waiver provisions and took no position on any other \n     issue.\n       I hope this information is helpful. If you have any further \n     questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Laura S. Unger,\n     Acting Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 16, 2000.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We are writing you regarding an issue of \n     concern to a number of us on both sides of the aisle. As we \n     understand it, you are aware that English courts have entered \n     summary judgments against hundreds of Americans who contend \n     that they were defrauded in the United States by Lloyd's of \n     London. These Americans were deprived of the right in these \n     actions of raising a fraud defense to Lloyd's claims. As a \n     result, they have asked Congress to give them the right to \n     raise their fraud claims in any collection action brought by \n     Lloyd's in the United States. They are merely asking to have \n     their day in court.\n       Enclosed is a copy of the proposed language which would \n     provide these Americans with the right to their day in court. \n     As you will see, it is limited in scope and the burden of \n     proof will be upon those seeking to raise a fraud defense to \n     prove such fraud. The amendment would in no way mandate how a \n     court might ultimately decide whether fraud occurred. It \n     simply gives these Americans their day in court.\n       We hope that it could be included in the pending bankruptcy \n     legislation when it emerges from conference. We would \n     appreciate your consideration in this regard.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Mary L. Landrieu,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    Howell Heflin,\n\n\n                                       U.S. Senator (Retired),\n\n                                     Tuscumbia, AL, March 2, 2001.\n     Hon. Russell D. Feingold,\n     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Russ: I am writing you about a matter which will be on \n     the Senate floor next week. I would prefer to visit directly \n     with you, but unfortunately I am unable to make the trip at \n     this time.\n       Our State Democratic Party chairman here in Alabama, Jack \n     Miller, and his law firm are old friends and supporters who \n     have been involved with me from the time I first ran for \n     Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court and throughout my \n     political career. They tell me that over the last three \n     years, they have been working with a group of Americans who \n     invested in Lloyd's of London and they have been trying to \n     help them secure ``their day in court.'' This group invested \n     in the 1980s before it was generally known that Lloyd's was \n     facing horrendous asbestos losses. When they invested, they \n     were not told of these losses. Obviously, had they been aware \n     of the losses, they would not have made the investments.\n       Despite the strong support of the SEC, including the SEC's \n     filing of amicus briefs with various courts, these Americans \n     have not been allowed to assert their claims of fraud by \n     Lloyd's. Lloyd's has used an agreement executed by agents \n     appointed by Lloyd's to preclude these Americans from raising \n     fraud as a defense. Lloyd's did this by passing a by-law \n     which authorized LLoyd's to appoint an agent for the \n     investors. The agent then signed away the investors' right to \n     assert fraud as a defense or to question how Lloyd's had \n     calculated what they allegedly owed. As a result of the \n     agent's actions, the investors were just given a sheet of \n     paper with the amounts owed and no backup information and \n     they were not permitted to question how the numbers were \n     calculated. Some of the investors instructed their agent not \n     to sign away their rights and those agents which followed the \n     investors' instructions were replaced by Lloyd's with an \n     agent which would do as LLoyd's instructed in direct \n     contravention of the instructions from the principal.\n       As a former judge, I am appalled at this entire situation. \n     As I understand it, the provision in the pending bankruptcy \n     bill, Section 1310, simply will give these Americans the \n     right to have their case heard. The burden will be on them to \n     prove by clear and convicing evidence, the highest civil \n     standard, that they were defrauded.\n       There are no treaty implications. The Hague Convention only \n     applies to arbitral awards, not judgements. Further, Article \n     V of the Convention permits host countries to refuse \n     enforcement of judgements which contravene the public policy \n     of the host country. It would be difficult to find a \n     situation which is more clearly against our country's public \n     policy.\n       I hear that you have been concerned over the increasing use \n     of arbitration provisions in the United States. Likewise, I \n     am seriously concerned. What LLoyd's is attempting to do \n     takes such provisions to a new level. The consumer is not \n     only expected to sign away his constitutional rights and \n     securities law protections, it can be done for him by another \n     who is appointed his agent by the other party.\n       Finally, I gather that you have some questions regarding \n     how this provision became part of the bankruptcy bill. As I \n     understand it, my friends here in Alabama have been working \n     for years to find a legislative vehicle to help these \n     Americans secure a day in court. They have had bipartisan \n     support, including former Senator Bob Kerrey and Senator Mary \n     Landrieu. During their efforts over the last several years, \n     the firm contacted Senator Jeff Sessions since the firm and \n     Senator Sessions are both from Mobile. As a former U.S. \n     Attorney, Senator Sessions agreed that these people had not \n     been accorded their rights and he agreed to support their \n     efforts.\n       I know that my friends here in Alabama would like the \n     opportunity to meet with you and to respond to any questions \n     you might have concenring this matter. If your scheduled \n     permits this to occur, please let me know.\n       Thank you for considering what I have to say. I hope that \n     it won't be too long before we can visit in person again.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Howell Heflin.\n                                  ____\n\n         House of Representatives, Committee on International \n           Relations,\n                                    Washington, DC, March 5, 2001.\n     Hon. Jesse Helms,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Chairman Helms: I am strongly supportive of Section \n     1310 of S. 420, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2001, and I seek \n     your support of this provision as well. It is important that \n     this provision remain in the Senate bill and not be stricken.\n       This provision is necessary to allow American investors who \n     believe they may have been defrauded by Lloyd's of London an \n     opportunity to be heard in American courts.\n\n[[Page S2356]]\n\n     Section 1310 is narrowly drafted to address the unique \n     circumstances facing those Americans who were recruited in \n     the United States to invest in Lloyd's before 1994 without \n     full disclosure that they would be saddled with asbestos \n     liabilities. The English court which rendered summary \n     judgments in favor of Lloyd's and against the American \n     investors denied those investors the right to assert fraud as \n     an affirmative defense. Section 1310 provides a measured \n     remedy in these cases, where, by clear and convincing \n     evidence, the burden of proof is on the American investor to \n     assert and prove fraud. As you are probably aware, a number \n     of Members and Senators on both sides of the aisle, as well \n     as the Securities and Exchange Commission have endeavored to \n     give the Americans who believe they have been defrauded by \n     Lloyd's legal forum in American courts with respect to the \n     representations that were made to them in this country by \n     Lloyd's and its agents. (See attached copy of the \n     Commission's letter to Chairman Oxley)\n       The provision does not impact state regulation of insurance \n     and it does not violate any treaty obligations of this \n     country. Consistent with the Hague Convention, recognition of \n     a foreign award may be refused if the court in the country \n     where enforcement is sought finds that ``recognition or \n     enforcement of the award would be contrary to the public of \n     that country.'' It is certainly contrary to the public policy \n     of this country for an individual to be defrauded and then \n     denied the right to assert fraud as a defense.\n       If you have any questions concerning this provision or my \n     support of it, I would be happy to discuss this matter with \n     you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Henry Hyde.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. This is a front page copy of Time magazine:\n\n                       Lloyd's of London, 1688--?\n\n       Its watchword is utmost good faith. So why does Lloyd's \n     stand accused of the greatest swindle ever?\n\n  I was a Federal prosecutor for 12 years in Alabama. I was also in \nlitigation. I am personally aware that there is fraud in big insurance \ncompanies. I had the opportunity and the responsibility to prosecute \nperhaps the largest insurance fraud case in the history of the United \nStates that had even been investigated by committees here in the \nSenate. In that case, people were defrauded out of over $50 million-\nplus. The guy who did that, Alan Teal, was convicted. It just so \nhappened he had previously, years before, been a member of Lloyd's. \nThat has nothing to do with this, but I relay it here to let you know \nthat I understand insurance fraud and I have been involved in \nprosecuted the big cases.\n  In addition, I was involved in asbestos litigation in the late 1970s. \nI know in the late 1970s there were thousands of asbestos cases being \nfiled, tens of thousands were being filed, and more were on the way. \nEveryone knew it. Plaintiffs were beginning to win tremendous verdicts. \nEverybody who knew anything about the litigation wondered if there \nwould ever be enough money to pay those verdicts.\n  During this same period of time, the companies that had the \nguaranteeing of the insurance, the reinsurance, was Lloyd's of London. \nWhat did they do? They were sending representatives to the United \nStates, asking those people to invest hundreds of thousands of dollars \nof their own money into these accounts, and they told them: People have \ndone well investing in Lloyd's. We think you will do well. But you are \nliable for everything that can come up. It is in the fine print. But \nthey invested, thinking Lloyd's had a good reputation. The company \nbegan in 1688 with Members of Parliament, with lords and earls as \ninvestors in this.\n  So they invested, little knowing that the bullet was already in the \nheart, that this company faced absolute financial ruin as a result of \nthe most unprecedented series of lawsuits in American history, asbestos \nlawsuits.\n  Now, when this case went to trial, they said they had a trial over \nthere. They passed a securities law in England similar to our \nsecurities law, except they exempted one named entity--Lloyd's of \nLondon. Many Members of Parliament who passed that law were investors \nin Lloyd's. I don't know if they recused themselves or not.\n  These are some of the facts at which we are looking. The heart of the \nclaim is this, that these American investors were not allowed to put on \nevidence in the British court that omission could lead to liability. In \nother words, they were not allowed to show under the law under which \nthey were forced to operate, that Lloyd's had any duty to tell them \nwhen they were investing in these syndicates, that they were doomed to \nlose, and there would be money they would have to pay--really, tens of \nbillions of dollars in asbestos claims, enough to ruin all of Lloyd's.\n  They sold these investments to American citizens, who did not fully \nknow what they were facing. As one said, these were massive, \nunquantifiable losses that were heading Lloyd's way like a tidal wave, \nvisible only to the few professional insiders who were tracking \nasbestos claims.\n  That was a fraud, I think, under any definition of the word.\n  The British judge, who excluded all evidence except the written \ndocuments that were submitted to the investors as the only evidence \nthat went in on the question of fraud, those documents were submitted \nand they said you could be liable for any claims that may come against \nLloyd's, but they did not say this tidal wave of claims was coming.\n  Up to 7 or more people all over the world, possibly up to 12, have \ncommitted suicide as a result of this. It has ruined the lives of many, \nmany citizens.\n  The judge who tried the case and who was bound by the law so he \ndidn't let this evidence in, said, ``The catalog of failings and \nincompetence in the 1980s by underwriters, managing agents, members and \nagents and others is staggering and has brought disgrace on one of the \ncity's great markets.'' He goes on to skewer Lloyd's for their \nbehavior, yet we can't get a remedy.\n  This says you don't get money as a result, you only go to court and \nshow in a court of law you may have been defrauded.\n  Mr. President, let me take just a moment to more fully explain the \nissues involved in this section of S. 420 that we are debating here \ntoday.\n  The Lloyd's of London provision would allow American investors in \nLloyd's to defend against debt collection actions by Lloyd's in \nAmerican courts by attempting to show that Lloyd's defrauded them when \nit recruited them as investors in the United States. The investors \nclaim that Lloyd's of London recruited them as investors with unlimited \nliability and without disclosing to them massive impending liabilities \nfor asbestos and pollution losses.\n  This provision was added in the quasi-conference on the Bankruptcy \nBill last year. Republicans and Democrats alike agreed to it.\n  The provision was in the Bankruptcy bill as introduced and passed by \nthe Judiciary Committee of the House and by the whole House this year. \nIt was in the Bankruptcy Bill as introduced and passed by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee this year where Senator Feingold mentioned his \nobjections to it.\n  There are legitimate arguments on both sides of this issue. I have \nlistened to investors, and I have listened to Lloyd's of London. \nFurther, my colleague from Wisconsin has spoken against this provision, \nand I respect his view.\n  Lloyd's asserts that an English court has found that Lloyd's, as a \ncorporate entity, was not liable for fraud to several American \ninvestors that participated in that trial; that international law and \ncomity among nations demands that we respect the judgment of the \nEnglish courts;\n  That the agreements signed by the investors had forum-selection and \nchoice-of-law clauses which provided that any dispute would be \nlitigated in English courts under English law; and\n  That American courts have upheld the forum-selection and choice-of-\nlaw clauses.\n  On the other hand, the investors contend that Parliament precluded \nsuits against Lloyd's for negligence and breach of contract in 1982 and \nfor securities fraud in 1986; that after the investment contract was \nsigned, Lloyd's changed its by-laws to require investors to pay their \nlosses before asserting fraud as a defense even though many investors \ncan't afford to pay their losses in full!;\n  That the English court failed to address allegations of fraud that \ntook place in America;\n  That in 1995 a Colorado court, at the behest of state attorneys \nworking under Gale Norton, issued a preliminary injunction against \nLloyd's stating its statements to American investors were ``materially \nmisleading and false because, as a result of underwriting and \nreinsurance of asbestos-related liabilities in various syndicates, \nwhich\n\n[[Page S2357]]\n\nliabilities had not been disclosed to [investors], those [investors] . \n. . are exposed to indefinite liability both in terms of amount and \nduration . . . .'';\n  That in 1996, Lloyd's settled the fraud claims of numerous State \nsecurities regulators by agreeing to reduce its claims against settling \ninvestors by $62 million; and\n  That in the February 26th edition of the Wall Street Journal it was \nreported that Lloyd's is currently under criminal investigation \nrelating to defrauding its American investors.\n  In my view, this comes down to a very simple question:\n  Is this situation egregious enough to warrant an exception to the \ngeneral rule of comity on judgments?\n  I believe that it is because of my personal experience as both \nAttorney General my State and a federal prosecutor.\n  I prosecuted criminals who defrauded policy-holders and investors.\n  In 1979, I became aware that insurance companies knew of large \nasbestos losses discovered in litigation in Pascagoula, Mississippi, \nand that these losses would be catastrophic to the insurance companies.\n  I know what it means to a family to be defrauded by an insurance \ncompany. It is wrong.\n  I believe in the sanctity of contract, but there is no contract if \nthe investors were fraudulently induced to enter the investment \nagreement.\n  I believe in comity with the British government, but there is no \ncomity if Parliament protects Lloyd's, but Congress does not protect \nAmerican investors.\n  I believe that helping wealthy investors should not be at the top of \nour priority list, but many of these investors are not wealthy and as \nTime Magazine reported some have even lost their homes to Lloyd's.\n  I also believe that defrauding investors is intolerable, but that it \nis possible Lloyd's did not commit fraud.\n  However, under the current post-contract term that requires the \ninvestors to pay before they assert fraud as a defense, investors who \ncannot afford to pay their loss in full cannot prevent debt collection \nactions by Lloyd's even if Lloyd's did defraud them.\n  This amendment says that international comity is a two-way street. \nThe British Parliament cannot protect wealthy British Investors from \nnegligence and securities law claims and expect the American Congress \nnot to at least give American investors a chance to assert fraud as a \ndefense to debt-collection actions--a right that the investors had when \nthey signed their investment contracts but that was unilaterally \nstripped away from them by Lloyd's after the fact.\n  Accordingly, I support this narrow provision in the bill to allow \npre-1994 American investors to assert fraud as a defense prior to \npayment. If they cannot prove fraud by clear and convincing evidence, \nthey will lose. If they can prove it, they will win. That is only fair.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, just so Senators know, that included the \nBaucus, Feingold, Feinstein, Leahy, Schumer, Wellstone, Leahy, Ensign/\nReid, Leahy, Kohl/Kennedy, Levin/Grassley, Biden/Specter/Sessions/\nLeahy, Collins/Kerry, Gramm of Texas, Reed of Rhode Island, Kennedy, \nLeahy, Bond/Kerry, Boxer, and Grassley amendments.\n\n\n                     amendment no. 30, as modified\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this bipartisan amendment protects \nworkers who face bankruptcy because they are owed money by employers \nfor back pay. This amendment was passed by voice vote last year, but \nwas dropped in conference. This should be a noncontroversial change, a \nchange that would ensure that workers receive all the wages that are \ndue them, workers who were denied minimum wage or overtime pay, workers \nwho were victims of discrimination, workers who were wrongfully fired, \nand veterans who were denied jobs when they returned from active \nmilitary duty.\n  Amending the bankruptcy bill to protect the back pay of workers is \nespecially appropriate, because back pay awards help many of the people \nthat this legislation places at risk, low income families, minorities, \nand women. My amendment helps workers take care of their families. \nCollecting a back pay award would give them more of the resources they \nneed to afford food, clothing, and health care without turning to \ncredit cards.\n  Our bankruptcy laws already protect wages so that businesses can \ncontinue to pay their workers during a reorganization. And some courts \nhave taken the important step of requiring employers facing bankruptcy \nto live up to their obligations to provide back pay awards. This change \nwould ensure that all workers are treated the same, no matter what \nbankruptcy court their employer has filed in.\n  The Department of Labor and the National Labor Relations Board obtain \nback pay awards on behalf of workers. For fiscal year 1998, the NLRB \ngot back pay awards on behalf of about 24,000 workers, with an average \naward of $3,750 per worker. During the past 5 years, the NLRB also \nrecovered about $1 million on behalf of approximately 300 American \nveterans who were wrongfully denied jobs after they returned to work \nfrom active military duty.\n  Similarly, for fiscal year 1999 the Department of Labor got back pay \nawards on behalf of about 2,000 workers, with an average award of about \n$900 per worker.\n  If these back pay awards do not receive protection in bankruptcy, \nmost workers will never receive them. They will have earned the back \npay, but will never see a dime. Without this amendment, workers lose \ntwice--first when they are wrongfully denied wages, and then again when \nthey are unable to collect the wages because their employers have \ndeclared bankruptcy.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate agreed to \naccept this amendment as part of the bankruptcy bill. Last session, my \namendment was accepted by the Senate only to be stripped out of the \nconference report. The compromise reached on the amendment this year \nshould ensure that it remains in the bill this year. In addition, I \nwould like to thank Senator Kennedy for joining me this year in \noffering this amendment.\n  The amendment corrects an inconsistency in current law regarding the \ntreatment of backpay awards issued for violations of state or federal \nlaws such as whistle blower protection laws, the Fair Labor Standards \nAct, or civil rights laws. For example, an employee who works ten hours \nof overtime during a pay period, but is only paid for nine, or an \nemployee who is wrongfully fired for being a whistle blower does not \ncurrently receive the same treatment as the employee who continues to \nwork for the bankrupt company postpetition. Some courts have held that \nwhere an award of backpay covers a time both before and after the \nemployer's bankruptcy petition, the entire award is considered a \ngeneral unsecured claim.\n  This amendment would clarify the treatment of backpay awards for the \npostpetition period. For example, the postpetition backpay due an \nemployee who has been reinstated after a successful suit under \nwhistleblower protection laws would clearly be an administrative \nexpense under 11 U.S.C. Sec.  503(b)(1)(A). So too would backpay due to \nworkers whose overtime compensation was illegally denied or reduced.\n  Under the terms of the compromise agreed to in this amendment, before \nthe postpetition award is treated as an administrative expense, the \nbankruptcy court must first determine that ``the award will not \nsubstantially increase the probability of layoff or termination of \ncurrent employees or nonpayment of domestic support obligations during \nthe case.'' The court should evaluate the possible impact of the award \nin the context of all other administrative expenses being awarded. The \nterm ``substantial'' will ensure that the bankruptcy court only refuses \nto treat postpetition backpay awards as an administrative expense in \nthe rarest of circumstances.\n  In general, these backpay awards range on average from only a few \nhundred dollars up to a couple of thousand dollars. Given that these \nawards are so small, there is virtually no chance that the award will \nsubstantially affect any part of an ongoing business concern. Should \nthe award of the postpetition amount be significantly more than a \ncouple of thousand dollars, it is still highly unlikely that it will \nsubstantially change the probability of layoff or termination of other \nemployees.\n  This amendment is an important clarification to the code. I am \npleased that the Senate recognized the consequence of these \npostpetition backpay awards.\n\n\n                     amendment no. 107, as modified\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, today I introduce, along with the senior \nSenator from Nevada, an amendment to the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2001 \nto create an additional bankruptcy judgeship position for the District \nof Nevada.\n  This amendment follows the recommendation of the Judicial Conference \nCommittee on the Administration of the Bankruptcy Committee to the \nJudicial Conference of the United States that legislation be \ntransmitted to Congress to create an additional judgeship for the \nDistrict of Nevada.\n  The combination of a rapidly growing population in Nevada and a high \nnumber of bankruptcy filings makes it imperative for Nevada to have \nanother judgeship. Nevada continues to be the fastest growing state in \nthe nation, and the Las Vegas metropolitan area remains one of the most \nrapidly growing cities. Between 1990 and 1999, the population of the \nstate of Nevada grew by more than 66 percent. Its population growth is \nprojected to increase by 10 percent from 2000 to 2005. At this current \nrate of growth, the Las Vegas area alone will nearly double to 2.5 \nmillion people in the next ten years.\n  Unfortunately, the growth in bankruptcy case filings in Nevada has \nbeen even more dramatic. Between 1990 and 1999 case filings grew by \nmore than 226 percent. In 2000, the District of Nevada was ranked fifth \nhighest in U.S. total filings per capita and first in the U.S. in \nfilings of Chapter 7 per capita. By every measure, weighted filings per \njudgeship, case filings per judgeship,\n\n[[Page S2362]]\n\nChapter 11 filings--the District of Nevada measured well above the \nnational average.\n  The population growth in my state and the increased number of case \nfilings clearly justifies the need for an additional bankruptcy \njudgeship position for the District of Nevada. We offer this amendment \ntoday in the hopes that we can accomplish this critical task for our \nhome state of Nevada.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that we finally adopted the \namendments in the managers' package to improve this bill. I thank the \nefforts of Senators Hatch, Daschle, Grassley, and Reid.\n  For the information of my colleagues, we adopted the following \namendments to improve this bill.\n  We adopted an amendment by Senator Baucus to resolve an ambiguity \nregarding involuntary bankruptcies.\n  We adopted an amendment by Senator Boxer to provide that public \neducation expenses are treated equally with private education expenses \nin the bill's means-test.\n  We adopted an amendment by Senator Feinstein regarding bankruptcy \npetition preparers.\n  We adopted an amendment by Senator Jack Reed calling for a General \nAccounting Office review of the bill's reaffirmation provisions.\n  We adopted an amendment by Senator Feingold to make Federal Election \nCommission fines and judges non-dischargeable in a bankruptcy \nproceeding.\n  We adopted another amendment by Senator Feingold to clarify that the \nFederal Election Commission has jurisdiction over insolvent Political \nAction Committees.\n  We adopted an amendment that I offered to clarify the definition of \ncurrent monthly income in the bill's means-test to prevent unnecessary \nlitigation.\n  We adopted another Leahy amendment to allow a person who has \nsuccessfully completed a chapter 13 plan and paid off all her creditors \nto file another chapter 13 plan if some unforeseen economic disaster--\nsuch as a job loss or high medical expenses--hits that person within \ntwo years of the first chapter 13 completion.\n  We adopted a third Leahy amendment to modify the requirements for \ndebtors to file tax returns to only Federal returns or transcripts to \nstreamline the process and reduce unnecessary court storage costs.\n  We adopted an amendment by Senator Schumer and Senator Grassley on \ncorporate business reorganizations to prevent a single creditor from \nalleging fraud to delay the reorganization and to clarify that debts \nfrom violations of the False Claims Act are non-dischargeable in \nbankruptcy.\n  We adopted an amendment by Senator Wellstone to clarify that the \ncompanies in bankruptcy must fulfil their legal obligations as sponsors \nand administrators of health care and other benefit plans.\n  We adopted an amendment by Senators Reid and Ensign to authorize a \nbankruptcy judgeship for Nevada the fastest growing state in the \nnation.\n  We also adopted, at the request of Senators Biden and Carper, an \nauthorization for an additional bankruptcy judgeship for the District \nof Delaware, which has the heaviest caseload of bankruptcy cases in the \ncountry.\n  We accepted a colloquy between Senator Levin and Senator Grassley to \nensure that spikes in gasoline prices will be taken into account in the \nbill's means-test.\n  We adopted an amendment by Senators Kohl and Kennedy to require that \nback pay awards are given the same priority as regular wages in \nbankruptcy proceedings.\n  We adopted an amendment by Senator Gramm, which Senator Sarbanes has \ncleared as the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, making \ncorrections to the bill's financial contract provisions.\n  We adopted an amendment by Senators Bond and Kerry to improve the \nbill's small business provisions.\n  We adopted an amendment by Senator Kennedy to include health \ninsurance costs in the bill's means-test.\n  We adopted an amendment by Senator Collins and Senator Kerry on \nfamily fisherman protection in bankruptcy.\n  We adopted an amendment by Senators Sessions, Leahy, Specter, and \nBiden regarding appeals of bankruptcy cases.\n  I am glad we made these important bipartisan changes to improve this \nbill and add more balance and fairness to it.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 59, As Further Modified\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment \nNo. 59 be further modified so that it strikes section 311 of the Kohl \namendment No. 68.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment (No. 59), as further modified, is as follows:\n       Strike section 311 of Kohl amendment No. 68, and insert the \n     following:\n       (a) In General.--Section 362(b) of title 11, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) by inserting after paragraph (21), as added by this \n     Act, the following:\n       ``(23) under subsection (a)(3), of the commencement or \n     continuation of any eviction, unlawful detainer action, or \n     similar proceeding by a lessor against a debtor seeking \n     possession of residential property--\n       ``(A) on which the debtor resides as a tenant; and\n       ``(B) with respect to which--\n       ``(i) the debtor fails to make a rental payment that first \n     becomes due under the unexpired specific term of a rental \n     agreement or lease or under a tenancy under applicable State, \n     or local rent control law, after the date of filing of the \n     petition or during the 10-day period preceding the date of \n     filing of the petition, if the lessor files with the court a \n     certification that the debtor has not made a payment for rent \n     and serves a copy of the certification upon the debtor; or\n       ``(ii) the debtor has a month to month tenancy (or one of \n     shorter term) other than under applicable State or local rent \n     control law where timely payments are made pursuant to clause \n     (i), if the lessor files with a court a certification that \n     the requirements of this clause have been met and serves a \n     copy of the certification upon the debtor.\n       ``(24) under subsection (a)(3), of the commencement or \n     continuation of any eviction, unlawful detainer action, or \n     similar proceeding by a lessor against a debtor seeking \n     possession of residential property, if during the 2-year \n     period preceding the date of filing of the petition, the \n     debtor or another occupant of the leased premises--\n       ``(A) commenced another case under this title; and\n       ``(B) failed to make any rental payment that first became \n     due under applicable nonbankruptcy law after the date of \n     filing of the petition for that other case;\n       ``(25) under subsection (a)(3), of an eviction action, to \n     the extent that it seeks possession based on endangerment of \n     property or the illegal use of controlled substances on the \n     property, if the lessor files with the court a certification \n     that such an eviction has been filed or the debtor has \n     endangered property or illegally used or allowed to be used a \n     controlled substance on the property during the 30-day period \n     preceding the date of filing of the certification, and serves \n     a copy of the certification upon the debtor;''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end of the flush material at the end \n     of the subsection the following; ``With respect to the \n     applicability of paragraph (23) or (25) to a debtor with \n     respect to the commencement or continuation of a proceeding \n     described in any such paragraph, the exception to the \n     automatic stay shall become effective on the 15th day after \n     the lessor meets the filing and notification requirements \n     under any such paragraph, unless--\n       ``(A) the debtor files a certification with the court and \n     serves a copy of that certification upon the lessor on or \n     before that 15th day, that--\n       ``(i) contests the truth or legal sufficiency of the \n     lessor's certification; or\n       ``(ii) states that the tenant has taken such action as may \n     be necessary to remedy the subject of the certification under \n     paragraph (23)(B)(i), except that no tenant may take \n     advantage of such remedy more than once under this title; or\n       ``(B) the court orders that the exception to the automatic \n     stay shall not become effective, or provides for a later date \n     of applicability.''.\n       (3) by adding at the end of the flush material added by \n     paragraph (2), the following:\n\n     ``Where a debtor makes a certification under subparagraph \n     (A), the clerk of the court shall set a hearing on a date no \n     later than 10 days after the date of the filing of the \n     certification of the debtor and provide written notice \n     thereof.

Mr. President, as the Senator knows, gas prices have \nfluctuated significantly in the last year. In my own state of Michigan, \ngas prices went from .80 cents a gallon in October 1999 to a high of \n$1.46 a gallon by June 2000. The Internal Revenue Service, IRS, Local \nStandards for Operating Costs and Public Transportation Costs, which \nincludes costs for gasoline, are revised in October of each year but \nare often based on statistics from as long as 2 or 3 years before that. \nThe IRS standards for gasoline costs can be out of date in a fast \nchanging economy.\n  In the event a debtor has experienced significant increases in the \ncosts of buying gasoline for their car, how would the means test adjust \nfor this?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, under the special circumstances \nprovision, the debtor could explain in the debtor's petition why an \nadditional allowance in excess of the amounts allowed under the \nInternal Revenue Standards was reasonable and necessary. As a practical \nmatter, if the costs for gas have increased significantly over the \ncosts for gas used by the Internal Revenue Service, the excess costs of \ngasoline over the IRS standard should and would be allowed under the \nspecial circumstances provision.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I am opposed to the Bankruptcy \nReform Act of 2001. I do not take my decision to vote against this \nlegislation lightly. The growing personal debt of the American people \nand the dramatic rise in bankruptcy filings over the last 10 years \nshould give us all reason for concern.\n  However, this legislation simply fails as a matter of sound public \npolicy. Rather than addressing this complex issue with a solution that \nfocuses on consumer and private sector responsibility, this bill almost \nexclusively places the burden of change on the people that bankruptcy \nlaw is supposed to help. It almost completely ignores the aggressive \nmarketing practices of lenders who in some cases, seem to have lost the \nability to judge a bad credit risk.\n  It is difficult to have sympathy for an industry that mails three \nbillion solicitations a year, and expends very little effort to ensure \nthat they are marketing to people who have the financial means or are \neven old enough to hold a credit card. It's clear that young and low-\nincome individuals, who often have the least ability to repay, are \nprime targets of the credit industry's overly aggressive marketing \ntactics.\n  It appears that these companies have made a calculation that it is \nmore profitable to have liberal lending policies and higher interest \nrates, than it is to deny credit or at least putting a reasonable \ncredit limit in place.\n  I have heard many of my colleagues talk a lot over the past week \nabout how consumers need to be more financially responsible. Fair \nenough. But I'm here to say that we should also demand more \nresponsibility from big lenders who fail to do their homework.\n  Especially in a time of economic slow-down, I do not believe we \nshould make it more difficult for people to get a fresh start unless we \nalso make further demands of an industry that could solve many of its \nproblems by simply making credit available responsibly.\n  I realize that this legislation also would benefit many small \nbusinesses that extend credit to their customers, and that are \nsometimes forced to foot the bill for individuals who choose to abuse \nthe system. My concern about reckless lending practices is not aimed at \nthe small businessman, and, I strongly want to stamp out abuse in the \nbankruptcy system.\n  However, a better bankruptcy bill would encourage responsible \nmarketing of credit services and would include stronger provisions to \ncurb predatory lending. This bill falls short of the mark in these \nareas and as result will not get my vote.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the Bankruptcy Reform bill we are voting on \ntoday has a valid, uncontroversial and necessary purpose. It is \nintended to curb bankruptcy abuse and ensure that those who can afford \nto pay their debts, do pay their debts. And I would say to you, Mr. \nPresident, if this were--all about those goals--if this were a debate \nabout personal responsibility--there would be a very different dialogue \nin the United States Senate and it would have given us a very different \nbill than the one we're voting on today. But Mr. President the bill we \nare voting on is seriously flawed and will harm innocent debtors who \nare genuinely in need of the protections and ``fresh start'' that \nbankruptcy procedures are intended to provide. It is for that reason \nthat I must vote against this bill.\n  During the 106th Congress, I voted in favor of the Senate bankruptcy \nbill, because I believe that we need to reform the system and curb \nabuse. I had some serious reservations about that bill and had hoped \nthat many of the concerns I had at that time would be addressed in \nconference. Unfortunately the conference bill, like the bill we are \nvoting on today, did not target only those who abuse the bankruptcy \nsystem. What we needed during the 106th Congress, and what we need now, \nis bankruptcy reform that does not lump together those who need the \nprotections of bankruptcy with those who abuse the system.\n  We must absolutely prevent the abuse of the bankruptcy system by the \nmillionaires whom we know have received the protections of the \nbankruptcy system despite their ability to repay their debts. But even \nbeyond the flagrant, high profile abuse of the bankruptcy system that \nwe have read about in the papers, we must also be sure that every \nconsumer acts responsibly and does not charge meals, vacations and \nclothes that he can't afford, only to turn to the bankruptcy system to \nbail him out of his debt.\n  At the same time, we must not forget that a fresh start in bankruptcy \nserves a valuable purpose for many individuals who truly need its \nprotections. When an individual gets into financial trouble because, \nfor example, she has catastrophic, unforeseen medical expenses, it is \nbetter for her, for her creditors and even for society as a whole if \nshe is given the opportunity to have her debts discharged and is given \na fresh start. The alternative is that the innocent but unlucky debtor \nmay have as much as 25 percent of her wages garnished by her creditors. \nMost people live paycheck to paycheck and would be put in serious \nfinancial trouble if their paychecks were reduced by that much. In \nthose circumstances, consumers have no choice but to cut back on other, \nimportant expenses. They stop paying for their auto insurance and \nhealth insurance. They deplete any savings they might have and stop \ncontributing to their retirement accounts. This is a perverse result \nthat doesn't benefit anyone and certainly should not be the outcome of \nour efforts to reform the bankruptcy system.\n  As you know, this bill implements a means-testing system that would \ncreate a presumption that a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, or fresh start \nbankruptcy, should be dismissed or converted to a Chapter 13 \nreorganization if a certain financial formula is satisfied. The \nmeans test applies an IRS standard to determine whether a case should \nbe dismissed or converted. The IRS standard is inflexible, and it \nprovides no room for a bankruptcy judge to determine whether the \ncircumstances that led to the debtor's financial situation warrant \ntreatment under Chapter 7. A father with a sick child is treated the \nsame way as a reckless spender who ran up his credit cards on luxury \nitems. Judges should have some discretion to distinguish those \nsituations and exempt from means-testing debtors who, due to \ncircumstances beyond their control, have come to the court to ask for \nthe protection bankruptcy is intended to provide.\n\n  The purpose of the means test is to ensure that more individuals file \nin Chapter 13 and therefore pay off more of their debts. That sounds \nlike a laudable goal. But it is likely to fail. Simply because more \npeople are forced into Chapter 13 plans does not mean that they will be \nable to successfully complete those plans. Even under the current \nsystem, only a third of those who file for Chapter 13 successfully \ncomplete their plans. Simply funneling more individuals into Chapter 13 \ndoes not in any way guarantee that more debts will be paid off.\n  Finally, the means test imposes financial disclosure requirements \nthat put significant burdens on all debtors, not just the ten percent \nor fewer whom experts say abuse the system. Under the means test, \neveryone who files for\n\n[[Page S2364]]\n\nbankruptcy must engage in more preparation, more paperwork and more \nattorney and other expenses prior to filing for bankruptcy, leaving \nfewer assets to distribute to creditors.\n  A narrowly targeted reform bill designed to reduce abuse of the \nsystem would have provided bankruptcy judges with the discretion to \ndismiss or convert a case to Chapter 7, but would not have mandated it. \nIt would have provided creditors the opportunity to ask for a dismissal \nor conversion, but would not have put the burden on every filer to \nprove that he or she deserves the protections of Chapter 7. This bill \nsimply fails to take that reasonable, targeted approach toward curbing \nabuse.\n  In its attempt to thwart abuse of the system, the bill we are voting \nwill also result in some innocent debtors losing their rented homes and \napartments. Current bankruptcy law allows individuals in bankruptcy to \nremain in their apartments as long as they keep paying their rent while \nthe bankruptcy is pending, and as long as they repay any unpaid rent. A \nlandlord must go to the bankruptcy court for permission to evict \ntenants who have filed for bankruptcy. There is no question that some \ntenants will abuse this provision, and withhold rent while gambling on \nthe fact that the time and expense of going to bankruptcy court will \nprevent the landlord from getting permission to evict the tenant. This \nbill, which allows landlords to evict debtors without going to \nbankruptcy court, punishes the innocent tenant who is paying his rent \nwhile it attempts to get at those who abuse the system. And once again, \nthe answer lies in more narrowly targeting reform. We simply need to \nmake it easier and less expensive for a landlord to evict a tenant when \nthat tenant has failed to pay his rent. It is not necessary, nor is it \ngood public policy, to allow a landlord to evict a tenant who is paying \nrent and who will pay back any debts owed.\n  Perhaps one of the most disturbing parts of the bill is its impact on \nchildren. The bill's supporters claim that by moving child support \nclaims from seventh to first priority in Chapter 7 cases, the bill \n``puts child support first.'' What they don't say is that this \nprovision is virtually meaningless and will help very few children. The \nreason is because few debtors in Chapter 7 have any assets to \ndistribute to priority unsecured creditors, such as credit card \ncompanies, after secured creditors receive the value of their \ncollateral. Therefore, this change would affect only the smallest \nnumber of cases.\n\n  In addition, by forcing more debtors to file Chapter 13, more debt, \nincluding credit card debt, will have to be repaid. The result is that \nbanks and credit card companies will be in direct competition with \nsingle parents trying to collect child support after bankruptcy. Once \nagain, Mr. President, a bill that claims to reform the system may \nactually make it worse for those most in need.\n  While this bill puts more burdens on the innocent debtor, it does not \nplace more responsibility on the creditors who provide the consumers \nwith the opportunity to take on increasing amounts of debt. A simple \nprovision requiring credit card bills to state the length of time it \nwould take and the interest that would be paid on the current debt if \nonly the monthly minimum was paid would have provided real reform. Such \na provision would have provided valuable information to consumers, and \ngiven them the tools they need to decide whether they can afford to \ntake on any new debt. This bill, however, fails to include such a \nbalanced reform provision. Instead, it includes an inadequate \ndisclosure provision that would free 80% of all banks from any \ndisclosure responsibility and place the burden of disclosure on the \nFederal Reserve for two years. After that time, it is unclear whether \nand how the consumer disclosure requirements would be maintained.\n  This bill is not only detrimental to consumers, but it also hurts our \nsmall businesses. This effort to reform our bankruptcy laws will make \nit more difficult for entrepreneurs to start a small business and \nimpose additional regulations and reporting requirements on small \nbusinesses who file for bankruptcy. I believe we must do everything \npossible to ensure the viability of small businesses and to assist in \nfostering entrepreneurship in our economy. It has been the Congress's \nlong-held belief that regulatory and procedural burdens should be \nlowered for small business wherever possible. However, the Bankruptcy \nReform Act fails to meet this challenge. Instead, this legislation \npromotes additional red tape and a government bureaucracy that we have \nworked to reduce for small business. Specifically, the provisions \nincluded in the Bankruptcy Reform Act impose new technical and \nburdensome reporting requirements for small businesses who file for \nbankruptcy that are more stringent on small businesses than they are on \nbig business. Further, the bill will provide creditors with greatly \nenhanced powers to force small businesses to liquidate their assets.\n  Any big business would have difficulty complying with these new \nburdensome reporting requirements. But think of the difficulties an \nentrepreneur or a mom and pop grocery store will have in complying with \nthis dizzying array of new and complex reporting and other \nrequirements. These small businesses are the most likely to need, but \nleast likely to be able to afford, the assistance of a lawyer or an \naccountant to comply with these new taxing requirements. That is why \nduring the consideration of this bill I offered an amendment to strike \nthe small business provisions which will make it easier for creditors \nto force liquidations of small business during the bankruptcy process. \nUnfortunately, that amendment was not adopted.\n\n  A limited number of provisions do help small businesses and family \nfishing businesses. The amendments that I offered last year to extend \nthe reorganization plan filing and confirmation deadlines for small \nbusiness are included in this bill along with a provision to include \nsmall businesses in the creditors committee. Those amendments help \nsmall businesses, but they cannot compensate for the greater burdens \nthis bill imposes.\n  Additionally, I am pleased that an amendment sponsored by Senator \nCollins and I which will extend Chapter 12 bankruptcy protections to \nour family fishermen has been included in the bill. Mr. President, \nsmall, family-owned fishing businesses are in serious trouble. Severe \nenvironmental factors such as coastal pollution, warmer oceans and \nchanging currents have resulted in severely depleted fish stocks around \nthe country. We are making progress in rebuilding stocks, however, the \ncost of this progress has been a steep decline in the amount of fishing \nallowed in Georges Bank and the Gulf of Maine. This in turn has made it \nmuch more difficult for fishermen in Massachusetts and Maine to \nmaintain profitable businesses.\n  This amendment Senator Collins and I sponsored will ensure that \nfishermen have the flexibility under Chapter 12 of the bankruptcy code \nto wait out the rebuilding of our commercial fish stocks without back-\ntracking on our conservation gains to date. It will help preserve the \nrich New England fishing heritage in Massachusetts without wiping out \nthe fiercely independent small-boat fishermen.\n  Despite those provisions, which I do believe improve the system, \noverall this bill does not provide for real bankruptcy reform. Mr. \nPresident, sponsors of this bill say it is necessary because we are in \nthe midst of a ``bankruptcy crisis.'' There has been widespread and \njustifiable concern over the increase in consumer bankruptcies during \nthe 1990s. There were more than 1.4 million bankruptcy filings in 1998. \nHowever, personal bankruptcy filings have fallen steadily since then, \ndown to 1.3 million in 1999 and to 1.2 million last year. That is fewer \nbankruptcies per capita than there were at the time the bankruptcy bill \nwas first introduced. I cannot help but think that had we enacted \nbankruptcy reform in 1998, the sponsors of the bill would have been \ntaking credit for this downturn in bankruptcies.\n  But without congressional intervention, bankruptcies have been on the \ndecline. The reason, Mr. President, is simple. Lenders are profit-\nmaximizing institutions which select their own credit criteria. If \nthere is an increase in personal bankruptcies, credit card companies \nsimply won't offer their cards to consumers who don't have the means to \npay. The free-market thus corrects any upswing in bankruptcy.\n  Although the free market will correct the over-extension of credit to\n\n[[Page S2365]]\n\nthose who can least afford it, the market will not address the small \npercentage of bankruptcy filers who abuse the system. We need \nlegislation for that. But that legislation should be targeted; it \nshould be narrowly crafted; and it should avoid punishing those who \ntruly need and deserve bankruptcy protection. This bill does not do \nthat, and I must vote against it.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased that S. 420, the bankruptcy \nlegislation, cures some abuses in the Bankruptcy Code regarding \nexecutory and unexpired leases.\n  One provision, Section 404 of the bill, amends Section 365(d)(4) of \nthe Bankruptcy Code. Presently, Section 365(d)(4) provides a retail \ndebtor 60 days to decide whether to assume or reject its lease. A \nbankruptcy judge may extend this deadline for cause, and therein is the \nproblem. Too many bankruptcy judges have allowed this exception \nessentially to eliminate any notion of a reasonable and firm deadline \non a retail debtor's decision to assume or reject a lease. Bankruptcy \njudges have been extending this deadline for months and years, often to \nthe date of confirmation of a plan.\n  This situation is unfair. A shopping center operator is a compelled \ncreditor. It has no choice but to continue to provide space and \nservices to the debtor in bankruptcy. Yet, the current Code permits a \nretail debtor as much as years to decide what it will do with its \nlease. Coupled with the increased use of bankruptcy by retail chains, \nthe Bankruptcy Code is tipped unfairly against the shopping center \noperator.\n  Some stores curtail their operations or go dark, and still the lessor \ncannot regain control of its space.\n  This legislation, like the conference report in the last two \nCongresses, ends this abuse. It imposes a firm, bright line deadline on \na retail debtor's decision to assume or reject a lease, absent the \nlessor's consent. It permits a bankruptcy trustee to assume or reject a \nlease on a date which is the earlier of the date of confirmation of a \nplan or the date which is 120 days after the date of the order for \nrelief. A further extension of time may be granted, within the 120-day \nperiod, for an additional 90 days, for cause, upon motion of the \ntrustee or lessor. Any subsequent extension can only be granted by the \njudge upon the prior written consent of the lessor: either by the \nlessor's motion for an extension, or by a motion of the trustee, \nprovided that the trustee has the written approval of the lessor. This \nis important. We are taking away the bankruptcy judges' discretion to \ngrant extensions of the time for the retail debtor to decide whether to \nassume or reject a lease after a maximum possible period of 210 days \nfrom the time of entry of the order of relief. Beyond that maximum \nperiod, there is no authority in the judge to grant further time unless \nthe lessor has agreed in writing to the extension.\n  Retail debtors filing for bankruptcy will factor into their plans \nthis new deadline. Most retail chains undertake a careful review of \ntheir financial condition and business outlook before they file for \nbankruptcy. They will already have an understanding of which leases are \nones they wish to assume and which ones they wish to dispose of. The \nlegislation gives them an additional 120 days to decide on what to do \nwith their leases, once they file for bankruptcy. Within that 120 day \ntime period, an additional 90 days can be granted for cause. A further \nextension may be negotiated by the retail debtor and the lessor if \ncircumstances warrant, and any such extension can be granted by a judge \nonly with prior written consent of the lessor. Further, a lessor's \nprior written approval of one such extension does not constitute \napproval for any further extensions, each such extension beyond the 210 \nday period requires the lessor's prior written approval. The current \nimbalance between the retail debtor and the lessor will be redressed by \nthe legislation.\n  The bill in Section 404 also amends Section 365(f)(1) of the \nBankruptcy Code to make sure that all of the provisions of Section \n365(b) are adhered to and that Section 365(f) does not override Section \n365(b).\n  This addresses another growing abuse under the Bankruptcy Code. The \nbill makes clear that an owner must be able to retain control over the \nmix of retail uses in a shopping center. When an owner enters into a \nuse clause with a retail tenant forbidding assignments of the lease for \na use different than that specified in the lease, that clause should be \nhonored. Congress has so intended already, but bankruptcy judges have \nsometimes ignored the law.\n  Congress made clear, in Section 365(f)(2)(B), that the trustee may \nassign an executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor, only if \nthe trustee makes adequate assurance of future performance under the \ncontract or lease.\n  In Section 365(b)(3), Congress provided that for purposes of the \nBankruptcy Code:\n\n       ``Adequate assurance of future performance of a lease of \n     real property in a shopping center includes adequate \n     assurance--\n       ``(A) of the source of rent and other consideration due \n     under such lease, and in the case of an assignment, that the \n     financial condition and operating performance of the proposed \n     assignee and its guarantors, if any, shall be similar to the \n     financial condition and operating performance of the debtor \n     and its guarantors, if any, as of the time the debtor became \n     the lessee under the lease;\n       (B) that any percentage rent due under such lease will not \n     decline substantially;\n       (C) that assumption or assignment of such lease is subject \n     to all provisions thereof, including (but not limited to) \n     provisions such as a radius, location, use, or exclusivity \n     provision, and will not breach any such provision contained \n     in any other lease, financing agreement, or master agreement \n     relating to such shopping center; and\n       (D) that assumption or assignment of such lease will not \n     disrupt any tenant mix or balance in such shopping center.\n\n  Congress added these provisions to the Code in recognition that a \nshopping center must be allowed to protect its own integrity as an on \ngoing business enterprise, notwithstanding the bankruptcy of some of \nits retail tenants. A shopping center operator, for example, must be \nable to determine the mix of retain tenants it leases to. Congress \ndecided that use or similar restrictions in a retail lease, which the \nretailer cannot evade under nonbankruptcy law, should not be evaded in \nbankruptcy.\n  Regrettably, bankruptcy judges have not followed this Congressional \nmandate. Under another provision of the Code, Section 365(f), a number \nof bankruptcy judges have misconstrued the Code and allowed the \nassignment of a lease even though terms of the lease are not being \nfollowed. This ignores Section 365(b)(3) and is wrong.\n  For example, if a shopping center's lease with an educational \nretailer requires that the premises shall be used solely for the \npurpose of conducting the retail sale of educational items, as the \nlease in the In re Simon Property Group, L.P. v. Learningsmith, Inc. \ncase provided, then the lessor has a right to insist on adherence to \nthis use clause, even if the retailer files for bankruptcy. The clause \nis fully enforceable if the retailer is not in a bankruptcy proceeding, \nand the retailer should not be able to evade it in bankruptcy. \nOtherwise, the shopping centers operator loses control over the nature \nof his or her business.\n  Unfortuantley, in the Learningsmith case, the judge allowed the \nassignment of the lease to a candle retailer because it offered more \nmoney than an educational store to buy the lease, in contravention of \nSection 365(b)(3) of the Code. As a result, the lessor lost control \nover the nature of its very business, operating a particular mix of \nretail stores. If other retailers file for bankruptcy in that shopping \ncenter, the same result can occur.\n  The bill remedies this problem by amending Section 365(f)(1) to make \nclear it operates subject to all provisions of Section 365(b).\n  The legal holding in the Learningsmith case, and other cases like it \nwhich do not enforce Section 365(b), particularly 365(b)(3), are \noverturned by this legislation.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, Title IX of S. 420, the Bankruptcy Reform \nAct of 2001, involves financial contract provisions. The provisions of \nTitle IX have been carefully crafted with the assistance of the \nPresident's Working Group on Financial Markets following a review of \ncurrent statutory provisions governing the treatment of qualified \nfinancial contracts and similar financial contracts upon the insolvency \nof a counterparty.\n  Title IX amends the Bankruptcy Code, the Federal Deposit Insurance \nAct, FDIA, as amended by the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, \nand Enforcement Act of 1989, FIRREA, the payment system risk reduction \nand\n\n[[Page S2366]]\n\nnetting provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation \nImprovement Act of 1991, FDICIA, and the Securities Investor Protection \nAct of 1970, SIPI. These amendments address the treatment of certain \nfinancial transactions following the insolvency of a party to such \ntransactions. The amendments are designed to clarify and improve the \nconsistency between the applicable statutes and to minimize the risk of \na disruption within or between financial markets upon the insolvency of \na market participant.\n  Since its adoption in 1978, the Bankruptcy Code has been amended \nseveral times to afford different treatment for certain financial \ntransactions upon the bankruptcy of a debtor, as compared with the \ntreatment of other commercial contracts and transactions. These \namendments were designed to further the policy goal of minimizing the \nsystemic risks potentially arising from certain interrelated financial \nactivities and markets. Similar amendments have been made to the FDIA \nand the FDICIA. Both the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, FDIC, \nand the Securities investor Protection Corporation, SIPC, have issued \npolicy statements and letters clarifying general issues in this regard.\n  Systemic risk has been defined as the risk that a disruption at a \nfirm, in a market segment, to a settlement system, etc., can cause \nwidespread difficulties at other firms, in other market segments or in \nthe financial system as a whole. If participants in certain financial \nactivities are unable to enforce their rights to terminate financial \ncontracts with an insolvent entity in a timely manner, to offset or net \npayment and other transfer obligations and entitlements arising under \nsuch contracts, and to foreclose on collateral securing such contracts, \nthe resulting uncertainty and potential lack of liquidly could increase \nthe risk of an inter-market disruption.\n  Congress has in the past taken steps to ensure that the risk of such \nsystemic events is minimized. For example, both the Bankruptcy Code and \nthe FDIA contain provisions that protect the rights of financial \nparticipants to terminate swap agreements, forward contracts, \nsecurities contracts, commodity contracts and repurchase agreements \nfollowing the bankruptcy or insolvency of a counterparty to such \ncontracts or agreements. Furthermore, other provisions prevent \ntransfers made under such circumstances from being avoided as \npreferences or fraudulent conveyances, except when made with actual \nintent to defraud and taken in bad faith. Protections also are afforded \nto ensure that the acceleration, termination, liquidation, netting, \nsetoff and collateral foreclosure provisions of such transactions and \nmaster agreements for such transactions are enforceable.\n  In addition, FDICIA sought to protect the enforceability of close-out \nnetting provisions in ``netting contracts'' between ``financial \ninstitutions.'' FDICIA states that the goal of enforcing netting \narrangements is to reduce systemic risk within the banking system and \nfinancial markets.\n  The orderly resolution of insolvencies involving counterparties to \nsuch contracts also is an important element in the reduction of \nsystemic risk. The FDIA allows the receiver for an insolvent insured \ndepository institution the opportunity to review the status of certain \ncontracts to determine whether to terminate or transfer the contracts \nto new counterparties. These provisions provide the receiver with \nflexibility in determining the most appropriate resolution for the \nfailed institution and facilitate the reduction of systemic risk by \npermitting the transfer, rather than termination, of such contracts.\n  In general, Title IX is designed to clarify the treatment of certain \nfinancial contracts upon the insolvency of a counterparty and to \npromote the reduction of systemic risk. It furthers the goals of prior \namendments to the Bankruptcy Code and the FDIA regarding the treatment \nof those financial contracts and of the payment system risk reduction \nprovisions in FDICIA. It has four principal purposes:\n  1. To strengthen the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and the FDIA \nthat protect the enforceability of acceleration, termination, \nliquidation, close-out netting, collateral foreclosure and related \nprovisions of certain financial agreements and transactions.\n  2. To harmonize the treatment of these financial agreements and \ntransactions under the Bankruptcy Code and the FDIA.\n  3. To amend the FDIA and FDICIA to clarify that certain rights of the \nFDIC acting as conservator or receiver for a failed insured depository \ninstitution (and in some situations, rights of SIPC and receivers of \ncertain uninsured institutions) cannot be defeated by operation of the \nterms of FDICIA.\n  4. To make other substantive and technical amendments to clarify the \nenforceability of financial agreements and transactions in bankruptcy \nor insolvency.\n  All these changes are designed to further minimize systemic risk to \nthe banking system and the financial markets.\n  In section 901, subsections (a) through (f) amend the FDIA \ndefinitions of ``qualified financial contract,'' ``securities \ncontract,'' ``commodity contract,'' ``forward contract,'' ``repurchase \nagreement'' and ``swap agreement'' to make them consistent with the \ndefinitions in the Bankruptcy Code and to reflect the enactment of the \nCommodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 (CFMA). It is intended that \nthe legislative history and case law surrounding those terms, to the \ndate of this amendment, be incorporated into the legislative history of \nthe FDIA.\n\n  Subsection (b) amends the definition of ``securities contract'' \nexpressly to encompass margin loans, to clarify the coverage of \nsecurities options and to clarify the coverage of repurchase and \nreverse repurchase transactions. The inclusion of ``margin loans'' in \nthe definition is intended to encompass only those loans commonly known \nin the securities industry as ``margin loans,'' such as arrangements \nwhere a securities broker or dealer extends credit to a customer in \nconnection with the purchase, sale or trading of securities, and does \nnot include loans that are not commonly referred to as ``margin \nloans,'' however documented. The reference in subsection (b) to a \n``guarantee by or to any securities clearing agency'' is intended to \ncover other arrangements, such as novation, that have an effect similar \nto a guarantee. The reference to a ``loan'' of a security in the \ndefinition is intended to apply to loans of securities, whether or not \nfor a ``permitted purpose'' under margin regulations. The reference to \n``repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions'' is intended to \neliminate any inquiry under the qualified financial contract provisions \nof the FDIA as to whether a repurchase or reverse repurchase \ntransaction is a purchase and sale transaction or a secured financing. \nRepurchase and reverse repurchase transactions meeting certain criteria \nare already covered under the definition of ``repurchase agreement'' in \nthe FDIA (and a regulation of the FDIC). Repurchase and reverse \nrepurchase transactions on all securities (including, for example, \nequity securities, asset-backed securities, corporate bonds and \ncommercial paper) are included under the definition of ``securities \ncontract''.\n  Subsection (b) also specifies that purchase, sale and repurchase \nobligations under a participation in a commercial mortgage loan do not \nconstitute ``securities contracts.'' While a contract for the purchase, \nsale or repurchase of a participation may constitute a ``securities \ncontract,'' the purchase, sale or repurchase obligation embedded in a \nparticipation agreement does not make that agreement a ``securities \ncontract.''\n  A number of terms used in the qualified financial contract \nprovisions, but not defined therein, are intended to have the meanings \nset forth in the analogous provisions of the Bankruptcy Code or FDICIA \n(for example, ``securities clearing agency''). The term ``person,'' \nhowever, is not intended to be so interpreted. Instead, ``person'' is \nintended to have the meaning set forth in 1 U.S.C. Sec. 1.\n  Subsection (e) amends the definition of ``repurchase agreement'' to \ncodify the substance of the FDIC's 1995 regulation defining repurchase \nagreement to include those on qualified foreign government securities. \nSee 12 CFR Sec. 360.5. The term ``qualified foreign government \nsecurities'' is defined to include those that are direct obligations \nof, or fully guaranteed by, central governments of members of the \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD. Subsection \n(e) reflects developments in the repurchase\n\n[[Page S2367]]\n\nagreement markets, which increasingly use foreign government securities \nas the underlying asset. The securities are limited to those issued by \nor guaranteed by full members of the OECD, as well as countries that \nhave concluded special lending arrangements with the International \nMonetary fund associated with the Fund's General Arrangements to \nBorrow.\n  Subsection (e) also amends the definition of ``repurchase agreement'' \nto include those on mortgage-related securities, mortgage loans and \ninterests therein, and expressly to include principal and interest-only \nU.S. government and agency securities as securities that can be the \nsubject of a ``repurchase agreement.''\n  This amendment is not intended to affect the status of repos \ninvolving securities or commodities as securities contracts, commodity \ncontracts, or forward contracts, and their consequent eligibility for \nsimilar treatment under the qualified financial contract provisions. In \nparticular, an agreement for the same and repurchase of a security \nwould continue to be a securities contract as defined in the FDIA, even \nif not a ``repurchase agreement'' as defined in the FDIA. Similarly, an \nagreement for the sale and repurchase of a commodity, even though not a \n``repurchase agreement'' as defined int he FDIA, would continue to be a \nforward contract for purposes of the FDIA.\n  Subsection (e), like subsection (b) for ``securities contracts,'' \nspecifies that repurchase obligations under a participation in a \ncommercial mortgage loan do not make the participation agreement a \n``repurchase agreement.'' such repurchase obligations embedded in \nparticipations in commercial loans (such as recourse obligations) do \nnot constitute a ``repurchase agreement.'' However, a repurchase \nagreement involving the transfer of participations in commercial \nmortgage loans with a simultaneous agreement to repurchase the \nparticipation on demand or at a date certain one year or less after \nsuch transfer would constitute a ``repurchase agreement'', as well as a \n``securities contract''.\n  Subsection (f) amends the definition of ``swap agreement'' to include \nan ``interest rate swap, option, future, or forward agreement, \nincluding a rate floor, rate cap, rate collar, cross-currency rate \nswap, and basis swap; a spot, same day-tomorrow, tomorrow-next, \nforward, or other foreign exchange of precious metals agreement; a \ncurrency swap, option, future, or forward agreement; an equity index or \nequity sway, option future, or forward agreement; a debt index or debt \nswap, option, future, or forward agreement; a total return, credit \nspread or credit swap, option, future, or forward agreement; a \ncommodity index or commodity swap, option, future, or forward \nagreement; or a weather swap, weather derivative, or weather option.'' \nAs amended, the definition of ``swap agreement'' will update the \nstatutory definition and achive contractual netting across economically \nsimilar transactions.\n  The definition of ``swap agreement'' originally was intended to \nprovide sufficient flexibility to avoid the need to amend the \ndefinition as the nature and uses of swap transactions matured. to that \nend, the phrase ``or any other similar agreement'' was included int he \ndefinition. (The phrase ``or any similar agreement'' has been added to \nthe definition of ``forward contract,'' ``commodity contract,'' \n``repurchase agreement'' and ``securities contract'' for the same \nreason.) To clarify this, subsection (f) expands the definition of \n``swap agreement'' to include ``any agreement or trqansaction that is \nsimilar to any other agreement or transaction referred to in Section \n11(e)(8)(D)(vi) of the FDIA and is of a type that has been, is \npresently, or in the future becomes, the subject of recurrent dealings \nin the swap markets and that is a forward, swap, future, or option on \none or more rates, currencies, commodities, equity securities or other \nequity instruments, debt securities or other debt \ninstruments, quantitative measures associated with an occurrence, \nextent of an occurrence, or contingency associated with a financial, \ncommercial, or economic consequence, or economic or financial indices \nor measures of economic or financial risk or value.''\n\n  The definition of ``swap agreement,'' however, should not be \ninterpreted to permit parties to document non-swaps as swap \ntransactions. Traditional commercial arrangements, such as supply \nagreements, or other non-financial market transactions, such as \ncommercial, residential or consumer loans, cannot be treated as \n``swaps'' under either the FDIA or the Bankruptcy Code simply because \nthe parties purport to document or label the transactions as ``swap \nagreements.'' In addition, these definitions apply only for purposes of \nthe FDIA and the Bankruptcy Code. These definitions, and the \ncharacterization of a certain transaction as a ``swap agreement,'' are \nnot intended to affect the characterization, definition, or treatment \nof any instruments under any other statute, regulation, or rule \nincluding, but not limited to, the statutes, regulations or rules \nenumerated in subsection (f). Similarly, Section 914 and a new \nparagraph of Section 11(e) of the FDIA provide that the definitions of \n``securities contract,'' ``repurchase agreement,'' ``forward \ncontract,'' and ``commodity contract,'' and the characterization of \ncertain transactions as such a contract or agreement, are not intended \nto affect the characterization, definition, or treatment of any \ninstruments under any other statute, regulation, or rule including, but \nnot limited to, the statutes, regulations or rules enumerated in \nsubsection (f).\n  The definition also includes any security agreement or arrangement, \nor other credit enhancement, related to a swap agreement, including any \nguarantee or reimbursement obligation related to a swap agreement. This \nensures that any such agreement, arrangement or enhancement is itself \ndeemed to be a swap agreement, and therefore eligible for treatment as \nsuch for purposes of termination, liquidation, acceleration, offset and \nnetting under the FDIA and the Bankruptcy Code. Similar changes are \nmade in the definitions of ``forward contract,'' ``commodity \ncontract,'' ``repurchase agreement'' and ``securities contract.''\n  The use of the term ``forward'' in the definition of ``swap \nagreement'' is not intended to refer only to transactions that fall \nwithin the definition of ``forward contract.'' Instead, a ``forward'' \ntransaction could be a ``swap agreement'' even if not a ``forward \ncontract.''\n  Subsection (g) amends the FDIA by adding a definition for \n``transfer,'' which is a key term used in the FDIA, to ensure that it \nis broadly construed to encompass dispositions of property or interests \nin property. The definition tracks that in section 101 of the \nBankruptcy Code.\n  Subsection (h) makes clarifying technical changes to conform the \nreceivership and conservatorship provisions of the FDIA. This \nsubsection (h) also clarifies that the FDIA expressly protects rights \nunder security agreements, arrangements or other credit enhancements \nrelated to one or more qualified financial contracts, QFCs. An example \nof a security arrangement is a right of setoff, and examples of other \ncredit enhancements are letters of credit, guarantees, reimbursement \nobligations and other similar agreements.\n  Subsection (i) clarifies that no provision of Federal or state law \nrelating to the avoidance of preferential or fraudulent transfers, \nincluding the anti-preference provision of the National Bank Act, can \nbe invoked to avoid a transfer made in connection with any QFC of an \ninsured depository institution in conservatorship or receivership, \nabsent actual fraudulent intent on the part of the transferee.\n\n  Section 902 provides that no provision of law, including FDICIA, \nshall be construed to limit the power of the FDIC to transfer or to \nrepudiate any QFC in accordance with its powers under the FDIA. As \ndiscussed below, there has been some uncertainty regarding whether or \nnot FDICIA limits the authority of the FDIC to transfer or to repudiate \nQFCs of an insolvent financial institution. Section 902, as well as \nother provisions in the Act, clarify that FDICIA does not limit the \ntransfer powers of the FDIC with respect to QFCs.\n  Section 902 denies enforcement to ``walkaway'' clauses in QFCs. A \nwalkaway clause is defined as a provision that, after calculation of a \nvalue of a party's position or an amount due to or from one of the \nparties upon termination, liquidation or acceleration of the QFC, \neither does not create a payment obligation of a party or extinguishes \na payment obligation of a\n\n[[Page S2368]]\n\nparty in whole or in part solely because of such party's status as a \nnon-defaulting party.\n  In Section 903, subsection (a) amends the FDIA to expand the transfer \nauthority of the FDIC to permit transfers of QFCs to ``financial \ninstitutions'' as defined in FDICIA or in regulations. This provision \nwill allow the FDIC to transfer QFCs to a non-depository financial \ninstitution, provided the institution is not subject to bankruptcy or \ninsolvency proceedings.\n  The new FDIA provision specifies that when the FDICa QFCs that are \ncleared on or subject to the rules of a particular clearing \norganization, the transfer will not require the clearing organization \nto accept the transferee as a member of the organization. This \nprovision gives the FCIC flexibility in resolving QFCs cleared on or \nsubject to the rules of a clearing organization to accept for clearing \nany QFCs from the transferee, except on the terms and conditions \napplicable to other parties permitted to clear through that clearing \norganization. ``Clearing organization'' is defined to mean a ``clearing \norganization'' within the meaning of FDICIA, as amended both by the \nCFMA and by Section 906 of the Act.\n  The new FDIA provision also permits transfers to an eligible \nfinancial institution that is a non-U.S. person, or the branch or \nagency of a on-U.S. person or a U.S. financial institution that is not \nan FDIC-insured institution if, following the transfer, the contractual \nrights of the parties would be enforceable substantially to the same \nextent as under the FDIA. It is expected that the FDIC would not \ntransfer QFCs to such a financial institution if there were an \nimpending change of law that would impair the enforceability of the \nparties' contractual rights.\n  Subsection (b) amends the notification requirements following a \ntransfer of the QFCs of a failed depository institution to require the \nFDIC to notify any party to a transferred QFC of such transfer by 5:00 \np.m. Eastern Time on the business day following the date of the \nappointment of the FDIC acting as receiver or following the date of \nsuch transfer by the FDIC acting as a conservator. This amendment is \nconsistent with the policy statement on QFCs issued by the FDIC on \nDecember 12, 1989.\n  Subsection (c) amends the FDIA to clarify the relationship between \nthe FDIA and FDICIA. There has been some uncertainty whether FDICIA \npermits counterparties to terminate or liquidate a QFC before the \nexpiration of the time period provided by the FDIA during which the \nFDIC may repudiate or transfer a QFC in a conservatorship or \nreceivership. Subsection (c) provides that a party may not terminate a \nQFC based solely on the appointment of the FDIC as receiver until 5:00 \np.m. (Eastern Time) on the business day following the appointment of \nthe receiver or after the person has received notice of a transfer \nunder FDIA section 11(d)(9), or based solely on the appointment of the \nFDIC as conservator, notwithstanding the provisions of FDICIA. This \nprovides the FDIC with an opportunity to undertake an orderly \nresolution of the insured depository institution.\n  The amendment also prohibits the enforcement of rights of termination \nor liquidation that arise solely because of the insolvency of the \ninstitution or are based on the ``financial condition'' of the \ndepository institution in receivership or conservatorship. For example, \ntermination based on a cross-default provision in a QFC that is \ntriggered upon a default under another contract could be rendered \nineffective if such other default was caused by an acceleration of \namounts due under that other contract, and such acceleration was based \nsolely on the appointment of a conservator or receiver for that \ndepository institution. Similarly, a provision in a QFC permitting \ntermination of the QFC based solely on a downgraded credit rating of a \nparty will not be enforceable in an FDIC receivership or \nconservatorship because the provision is based solely on the financial \ncondition of the depository institution in default. However, any \npayment, delivery or other performance-based default, or breach of a \nrepresentation or covenant putting in question the enforceability of \nthe agreement, will not be deemed to be based solely on financial \ncondition for purposes of this provision. The amendment is not intended \nto prevent counterparties from taking all actions permitted and \nrecovering all damages authorized upon repudiation of any QFC by a \nconservator or receiver, or from taking actions based upon a \nreceivership or other financial condition-triggered default in the \nabsence of a transfer (as contemplated in Section 11 (e)(10) of the \nFDIA).\n  The amendment allows the FDIC to meet its obligation to provide \nnotice to parties to transferred QFCs by taking steps reasonably \ncalculated to provide notice to such parties by the required time. This \nis consistent with the existing policy statement on QFCs issued by the \nFDIC on December 12, 1989.\n  Finally, the amendment permits the FDIC to transfer QFCs of a failed \ndepository institution to a bridge bank or a depository institution \norganized by the FDIC for which a conservator is appointed either (i) \nimmediately upon the organization of such institution or (ii) at the \ntime of a purchase and assumption transaction between the FDIC and the \ninstitution. This provision clarifies that such institutions are not to \nbe considered financial institutions that are ineligible to receive \nsuch transfers under FDIA section 11(e)(9). This is consistent with the \nexisting policy statement on QFCs issued by the FDIC on December 12, \n1989.\n\n  Section 904 limits the disaffirmance and repudiation authority of the \nFDIC with respect to QFCs so that such authority is consistent with the \nFDIC's transfer authority under FDIA section 11(e)(9). This ensures \nthat no disaffirmance, repudiation or transfer authority of the FDIC \nmay be exercised to ``cherry-pick'' or otherwise treat independently \nall the QFCs between a depository institution in default and a person \nor any affiliate of such person. The FDIC has announced that its policy \nis not to repudiate or disaffirm QFCs selectively. This unified \ntreatment is fundamental to the reduction of systemic risk.\n  Section 905 states that a master agreement for one or more securities \ncontracts, commodity contracts, forward contracts, repurchase \nagreements or swap agreements will be treated as a single QFC under the \nFDIA (but only to the extent the underlying agreements are themselves \nQFCs). This provision ensures that cross-product netting pursuant to a \nmaster agreement, or pursuant to an umbrella agreement for separate \nmaster agreements between the same parties, each of which is used to \ndocument one or more qualified financial contracts, will be enforceable \nunder the FDIA. Cross-product netting permits a wide variety of \nfinancial transactions between two parties to be netted, thereby \nmaximizing the present and potential future risk-reducing benefits of \nthe netting arrangement between the parties. Express recognition of the \nenforceability of such cross-product master agreements furthers the \npolicy of increasing legal certainty and reducing systemic risks in the \ncase of an insolvency of a large financial participant.\n  In section 906, subsection (a)(1) amends the definition of ``clearing \norganization'' to include clearinghouses that are subject to exemptions \npursuant to orders of the Securities and Exchange Commission or the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission and to include multilateral \nclearing organizations, the definition of which was added to FDICIA by \nthe CFMA.\n  Subsection (a)(2). FDICIA provides that a netting arrangement will be \nenforced pursuant to its terms, notwithstanding the failure of a party \nto the agreement. However, the current netting provisions of FDICIA \nlimit this protection to ``financial institutions,'' which include \ndepository institutions. This subsection amends the FDICIA definition \nof covered institutions to include (i) uninsured national and State \nmember banks, irrespective of their eligibility for deposit insurance \nand (ii) foreign banks, including the foreign bank and its branches or \nagencies as a combined group, or only the foreign bank parent of a \nbranch or agency. The latter change will extend the protections of \nFDICIA to ensure that U.S. financial organizations participating in \nnetting agreements with foreign banks are covered by the Act, thereby \nenhancing the safety and soundness of these arrangements. It is \nintended that a non-defaulting foreign bank and its branches and \nagencies be considered to be a single financial institution for \npurposes of the bilateral netting provisions of FDICIA (except to the \nextent\n\n[[Page S2369]]\n\nthat the non-defaulting foreign bank and its branches and agencies on \nthe one hand, and the defaulting financial institution, on the other, \nhave entered into agreements that clearly evidence an intention that \nthe non-defaulting foreign bank and its branches and agencies be \ntreated as separate financial institutions for purposes of the \nbilateral netting provisions of FDICIA).\n\n  Subsection (a)(3) amends FDICIA to provide that, for purposes of \nFDICIA, two or more clearing organizations that enter into a netting \ncontract are considered ``members'' of each other. This assures the \nenforceability of netting arrangements involving two or more clearing \norganizations and a member common to all such organizations, thus \nreducing systemic risk in the event of the failure of such a member. \nUnder the current FDICIA provisions, the enforceability of such \narrangements depends on a case-by-case determination that clearing \norganizations could be regarded as members of each other for purposes \nof FDICIA.\n  Subsection (a)(4) amends the FDICIA definition of netting contract \nand the general rules applicable to netting contracts. The current \nFDICIA provisions require that the netting agreement must be governed \nby the law of the United States or a State to receive the protections \nof FDICIA. However, many of these agreements, particularly netting \narrangements covering positions taken in foreign exchange dealings, are \ngoverned by the laws of a foreign country. This subsection broadens the \ndefinition of ``netting contract'' to include those agreements governed \nby foreign law, and preserves the FDICIA requirement that a netting \ncontract not be invalid under, or precluded by, Federal law.\n  Subsections (b) and (c) establish two exceptions to FDICIA's \nprotection of the enforceability of the provisions of netting contracts \nbetween financial institutions and among clearing organization members.\n  First, the termination provisions of netting contracts will not be \nenforceable based solely on (i) the appointment of a conservator for an \ninsolvent depository institution under the FDIA or (ii) the appointment \nof a receiver for such institution under the FDIA, if such receiver \ntransfers or repudiates QFCs in accordance with the FDIA and gives \nnotice of a transfer by 5:00 p.m. on the business day following the \nappointment of a receiver. This change is made to confirm the FDIC's \nflexibility to transfer or repudiate the QFCs of an insolvent \ndepository institution in accordance with the terms of the FDIA. This \nmodification also provides important legal certainly regarding the \ntreatment of QFCs under the FDIA, because the current relationship \nbetween the FDIA and FDICIA is unclear.\n  The second exception provides that FDICIA does not override a stay \norder under SIPA with respect to foreclosure on securities, but not \ncash, collateral of a debtor, section 911 makes a conforming change to \nSIPA. There is also an exception relating to insolvent commodity \nbrokers.\n  Subsections (b) and (c) also clarify that a security agreement or \nother credit enhancement related to a netting contract is enforceable \nto the same extent as the underlying netting contract.\n  Subsection (d) adds a new section 407 to FDICIA. This new section \nprovides that, notwithstanding any other law, QFCs with uninsured \nnational banks, uninsured Federal branches or agencies, or Edge Act \ncorporations, or uninsured State member banks that operate, or operate \nas, a multilateral cleaning organization and that are placed in \nreceivership or conservatorship will be treated in the same manner as \nif the contract were with an insured national bank or insured Federal \nbranch for which a receiver or conservator was appointed. This \nprovision will ensure that parties to QFCs with these institutions will \nhave the same rights and obligations as parties entering into the same \nagreements with insured depository institutions. The new section also \nspecifically limits the powers of a receiver or conservator for such an \ninstitution to those contained in 12 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1821(e)(8), (9), \n(10), and (11), which address QFCs.\n  While the amendment would apply the same rules to such institutions \nthat apply to insured institutions, the provision would not change the \nrules that apply to insured institutions. Nothing in this section would \namend the International Banking Act, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, \nthe national Bank Act, or other statutory provisions with respect to \nreceiverships of insured national banks or Federal branches.\n  In section 907, subsection (a)(1) amends the Bankruptcy Code \ndefinitions of `'repurchase agreement'' and ``swap agreement'' to \nconform with the amendments to the FDIA contained in sections 901(c) \nand 901(f) of the Act.\n  In connection with the definition of ``repurchase agreement,'' the \nterm ``qualified foreign government securities'' is defined to include \nsecurities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed by, \ncentral governments of members of the Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development OECD. This language reflects developments \nin the repurchase agreement markets, which increasingly use foreign \ngovernment securities as the underlying asset. The securities are \nlimited to those issued by or guaranteed by full members of the OECD, \nas well as countries that have concluded special lending arrangements \nwith the International Monetary Fund associated with the Fund's General \nArrangements to Borrow.\n  Subsection (a)(1) also amends the definition of ``repurchase \nagreement'' to include those on mortgage-related securities, mortgage \nloans and interests therein, and expressly to include principal and \ninterest-only U.S. government and agency securities as securities that \ncan be the subject of a ``repurchase agreement.'' The reference in the \ndefinition to United States government- and agency-issued or fully \nguaranteed securities is intended to include obligations issued or \nguaranteed by Fannie Mae and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation \n(Feddie Mac) as well as all obligations eligible for purchase by \nFederal Reserve banks under the similar language of section 14(b) of \nthe Federal Reserve Act.\n  This amendment is not intended to affect the status of repos \ninvolving securities or commodities as securities contracts, commodity \ncontracts, or forward contracts, and their consequent eligibility for \nsimilar treatment under other provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. In \nparticular, an agreement for the sale and repurchase of a security \nwould continue to be a securities contract as defined in the Bankruptcy \nCode and thus also would be subject to the Bankruptcy Code provisions \npertaining to securities contracts, even if not a ``repurchase \nagreement'' as defined in the Bankruptcy Code. Similarly, an agreement \nfor the sale and repurchase of a commodity, even though not a \n``repurchase agreement'' as defined in the Bankruptcy Code, would \ncontinue to be a forward contract for purposes of the Bankruptcy Code \nand would be subject to the Bankruptcy Code provisions pertaining to \nforward contracts.\n\n  Subsection (a)(1) specifies that repurchase obligations under a \nparticipation in a commercial mortgage loan do not make the \nparticipation agreement a ``repurchase agreement.'' Such repurchase \nobligations embedded in participations in commercial loans, such as \nrecourse obligations, do not constitute a ``repurchase agreement.'' \nHowever, a repurchase agreement involving the transfer of \nparticipations in commercial mortgage loans with a simultaneous \nagreement to repurchase the participation on demand or at a date \ncertain one year or less after such transfer would constitute a \n``repurchase agreement'', as well as a ``securities contract''.\n  The definition of ``swap agreement'' is amended to include an \n``interest rate swap, option, future, or forward agreement, including a \nrate floor, rate cap, rate collar, cross-currency rate swap, and basis \nswap; a spot, same day-tomorrow, tomorrow-next, forward, or other \nforeign exchange or precious metals agreement; a currency swap, option, \nfuture, or forward agreement; an equity index or equity swap, option, \nfuture, or forward agreement; a debt index or debt swap, option, \nfuture, or forward agreement; a total return, credit spread or credit \nswap, option, future, or forward agreement; a commodity index or \ncommodity swap, option, future, or forward agreement; or a weather \nswap, weather derivative, or weather option.'' As amended, the \ndefinition of ``swap agreement'' will update the statutory definition \nand achieve contractual netting across economically similar \ntransactions.\n\n[[Page S2370]]\n\n  The definition of ``swap agreement'' originally was intended to \nprovide sufficient flexibility to avoid the need to amend the \ndefinition as the nature and uses of swap transactions matured. To that \nend, the phrase ``or any other similar agreement'' was included in the \ndefinition. The phrase ``or any similar agreement'' has been added to \nthe definitions of ``forward contract,'' ``commodity contract,'' \n``repurchase agreement,'' and ``securities contract'' for the same \nreason. To clarify this, subsection (a)(1) expands the definition of \n``swap agreement'' to include ``any agreement or transaction that is \nsimilar to any other agreement or transaction referred to in [Section \n101(53B) of the Bankruptcy Code] and that is of a type that has been, \nis presently, or in the future becomes, the subject of recurrent \ndealings in the swap markets and that is a forward, swap, future, or \noption on one or more rates, currencies, commodities, equity securities \nor other equity instruments, debt securities or other debt instruments, \nquantitative measures associated with an occurrence, extent of an \noccurrence, or contingency associated with a financial, commercial, or \neconomic consequence, or economic or financial indices or measures of \neconomic or financial risk or value.''\n  The definition of ``swap agreement'' in this subsection should not be \ninterpreted to permit parties to document non-swaps as swap \ntransactions. Traditional commercial arrangements, such as supply \nagreements, or other non-financial market transactions, such as \ncommercial, residential or consumer loans, cannot be treated as \n``swaps'' under either the FDIA or the Bankruptcy Code because the \nparties purport to document or label the transactions as ``swap \nagreements.'' These definitions, and the characterization of a certain \ntransaction as a ``swap agreement,'' are not intended to affect the \ncharacterization, definition, or treatment of any instruments under any \nother statute, regulation, or rule including, but not limited to, the \nstatutes, regulations or rules enumerated in subsection (a)(1)(C). \nSimilarly, Section 914 provides that the definitions of ``securities \ncontract,'' ``repurchase agreement,'' ``forward contract,'' and \n``commodity contract,'' and the characterization of certain \ntransactions as such a contract or agreement, are not intended to \naffect the characterization, definition, or treatment of any \ninstruments under any other statute, regulation, or rule including, but \nnot limited to, the statutes, regulations or rules enumerated in the \ndefinition of ``swap agreement.''\n\n  The definition also includes any security agreement or arrangement, \nor other credit enhancement, related to a swap agreement, including any \nguarantee or reimbursement obligation related to a swap agreement. This \nensures that any such agreement, arrangement or enhancement is itself \ndeemed to be a swap agreement, and therefore eligible for treatment as \nsuch for purposes of termination, liquidation, acceleration, offset and \nnetting under the Bankruptcy Code and the FDIA. Similar changes are \nmade in the definitions of ``forward contract,'' ``commodity \ncontract,'' ``repurchase agreement,'' and ``securities contract.'' An \nexample of a security arrangement is a right of setoff; examples of \nother credit enhancements are letters of credit and other similar \nagreements. A security agreement or arrangement or guarantee or \nreimbursement obligation related to a ``swap agreement,'' ``forward \ncontract,'' ``commodity contract,'' ``repurchase agreement'' or \n``securities contract'' will be such an agreement or contract only to \nthe extent of the damages in connection with such agreement measured in \naccordance with Section 562 of the Bankruptcy Code (added by the Act). \nThis limitation does not affect, however, the other provisions of the \nBankruptcy Code (including Section 362(b)) relating to security \narrangements in connection with agreements or contracts that otherwise \nqualify as ``swap agreements,'' ``forward contracts,'' ``commodity \ncontracts,'' ``repurchase agreements'' or ``securities contracts.''\n  The use of the term ``forward'' in the definition of ``swap \nagreement'' is not intended to refer only to transactions that fall \nwithin the definition of ``forward contract.'' Instead, a ``forward'' \ntransaction could be a ``swap agreement'' even if not a ``forward \ncontract.''\n  Subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3) amend the Bankruptcy Code definitions \nof ``securities contract'' and ``commodity contract,'' respectively, to \nconform them to the definitions in the FDIA.\n  Subsection (a)(2), like the amendments to the FDIA, amends the \ndefinition of ``securities contract'' expressly to encompass margin \nloans, to clarify the coverage of securities options and to clarify the \ncoverage of repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions. The \ninclusion of ``margin loans'' in the definition is intended to \nencompass only those loans commonly known in the securities industry as \n``margin loans,'' such as arrangements where a securities broker or \ndealer extends credit to a customer in connection with the purchase, \nsale or trading of securities, and does not include loans that are not \ncommonly referred to as ``margin loans,'' however documented. The \nreference in subsection (b) to a ``guarantee'' by or to a ``securities \nclearing agency'' is intended to cover other arrangements, such as \nnovation, that have an effect similar to a guarantee. The reference to \na ``loan'' of security in the definition is intended to apply to loans \nof securities, whether or not for a ``permitted purpose'' under margin \nregulations. The reference to ``repurchase and reverse repurchase \ntransactions'' is intended to eliminate any inquiry under Section 555 \nand related provisions as to whether a repurchase or reverse repurchase \ntransaction is a purchase and sale transaction or a secured financing. \nRepurchase and reverse repurchase transactions meeting certain criteria \nare already covered under the definition or ``repurchase agreement'' in \nthe Bankruptcy Code. Repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions on \nall securities (including, for example, equity securities, asset-backed \nsecurities, corporate bonds and commercial paper) are included under \nthe definition of ``securities contract''. A repurchase or reverse \nrepurchase transaction which is a ``securities contract'' but not a \n``repurchase agreement'' would thus be subject to the ``counterparty \nlimitations'' contained in Section 555 of the Bankruptcy Code (i.e., \nonly stockbrokers, financial institutions, securities clearing agencies \nand financial participants can avail themselves of Section 555 and \nrelated provisions).\n\n  Subsection (a)(2) also specifies that purchase, sale and repurchase \nobligations under a participation in a commercial mortgage loan do not \nconstitute ``securities contracts.'' While a contract for the purchase, \nsale or repurchase of a participation may constitute a ``securities \ncontract,'' the purchase, sale or repurchase obligation embedded in a \nparticipation agreement does not make that agreement a ``securities \ncontract.''\n  Subsection (b) amends the Bankruptcy Code definitions of ``financial \ninstitution'' and ``forward contract merchant.'' The definition for \n``financial institution'' includes Federal Reserve Banks and the \nreceivers or conservators of insolvent depository institutions. With \nrespect to securities contracts, the definition of ``financial \ninstitution'' expressly includes investment companies registered under \nthe Investment Company Act of 1940.\n  Subsection (b) also adds a new definition of ``financial \nparticipant'' to limit the potential impact of insolvencies upon other \nmajor market participants. This definition will allow such market \nparticipants to close-out and net agreements with insolvent entities \nunder sections 362(b)(6), 555 and 556 even if the creditor could not \nqualify as, for example, a commodity broker. Sections 362(b)(6), 555 \nand 556 preserve the limitations of the right of close-out and net such \ncontracts, in most cases, to entities who qualify under the Bankruptcy \nCode's counterparty limitations. However, where the counterparty has \ntransactions with a total gross dollar value of at least $1 billion in \nnotional or actual principal amount outstanding on any day during the \nprevious 15-month period, or has gross mark-to-market positions of at \nleast $100 million (aggregated across counterparties) in one or more \nagreements or transactions on any day during the previous 15-month \nperiod, sections 362(b)(6), 555 and 556 and corresponding amendments \nwould permit it to exercise netting and related rights irrespective of \nits inability otherwise to satisfy those counterparty limitations. This \nchange\n\n[[Page S2371]]\n\nwill help prevent systemic impact upon the markets from a single \nfailure, and is derived from threshold tests contained in Regulation EE \npromulgated by the Federal Reserve Board in implementing the netting \nprovisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement \nAct. It is intended that the 15-month period be measured with reference \nto the 15 months preceding the filing of a petition by or against the \ndebtor.\n  ``Financial participant'' is also defined to include ``clearing \norganizations'' within the meaning of FDICIA, as amended by the CFMA \nand Section 906 of the Act. This amendment, together with the inclusion \nof ``financial participants'' as eligible counterparties in connection \nwith ``commodity contracts,'' ``forward contracts'' and ``securities \ncontracts'' and the amendments made in other Sections of the Act to \ninclude ``financial participants'' as counterparties eligible for the \nprotections in respect of ``swap agreements'' and ``repurchase \nagreements,'' take into account the CFMA and will allow clearing \norganizations to benefit from the protections of all of the provisions \nof the Bankruptcy Code relating to these contracts and agreements. This \nwill further the goal of promoting the clearing of derivatives and \nother transactions as a way to reduce systemic risk. The definition of \n``financial participant'' (as with the other provisions of the \nBankruptcy Code relating to ``securities contracts,'' ``forward \ncontracts,'' ``commodity contracts,'' ``repurchase agreements'' and \n``swap agreements) is not mutually exclusive, i.e., an entity that \nqualifies as a ``financial participant'' could also be a ``swap \nparticipant,'' ``repo participant,'' ``forward contract merchant,'' \n`commodity broker,'' ``stockbroker,'' ``securities clearing agency'' \nand/or ``financial institution.''\n\n  Subsection (c) adds to the Bankruptcy Code new definitions for the \nterms ``master netting agreement'' and master netting agreement \nparticipant.''\n  The definition of ``master netting agreement'' is designed to protect \nthe termination and close-out netting provisions of cross-product \nmaster agreements between parties. Such an agreement may be used (i) to \ndocument a wide variety of securities contracts, commodity contracts, \nforward contracts, repurchase agreements and swap agreements of (ii) as \nan umbrella agreement for separate master agreement between the same \nparties, each of which is used to document a discrete type of \ntransaction. The definition includes security agreements or \narrangements or other credit enhancements related to one or more such \nagreements and clarifies that a master netting agreement will be \ntreated as such even if it documents transactions that are not within \nthe enumerated categories of qualifying transactions (but the \nprovisions of the Bankruptcy Code relating to master netting agreements \nand the other categories of transactions will not apply to such other \ntransactions).\n  A ``master netting agreement participant'' is an entity that is a \nparty to an outstanding master netting agreement with a debtor before \nthe filing of a bankruptcy petition.\n  Subsection (d) amends section 362(b) of the Bankruptcy Code to \nprotect enforcement, free from the automatic stay, of setoff or netting \nprovisions in swap agreements and in master netting agreements and \nsecurity agreements or arrangements related to one or more swaping \nagreements or master netting agreements. This provision parallels the \nother provisions of the Bankruptcy Code that protect netting provisions \nof securities contracts, commodity contracts, forward contracts, and \nrepurchase agreements. Because the relevant definitions include related \nsecurity agreements, the references to ``setoff' in these provisions, \nas well in section 362(b)(6) and (7) of the Bankruptcy Code, are \nintended to refer also to rights to foreclose on, and to set off \nagainst-obligations to return, collateral securing swap agreements, \nmater netting agreements, repurchase agreements, securities contracts, \ncommodity contracts, or forward contracts. Collateral may be pledged to \ncover the cost of replacing the defaulted transactions in the relevant \nmarket, as well as other costs and expenses incurred or estimated to be \nincurred for the purpose of hedging or reducing the risks arising out \nof such termination. Enforcement of these agreements and arrangement \nfree from the automatic stay is consistent with the policy goals of \nminimizing systemic risk.\n  Subsection (d) also clarifies that the provisions protecting setoff \nand foreclosure in relation to securities contracts, commodity \ncontracts, forward contracts, repurchase agreements, swap agreements, \nand master netting agreements free from the automatic stay apply to \ncollateral pledged by the debtor but that cannot technically be ``held \nby'' the creditor, such as receivables and book-entry securities, and \nto collateral that has been repledged by the creditor and securities \nre-sold pursuant to repurchase agreements.\n\n  The current codification of section 546 of the Bankruptcy Code \ncontains two subsections designated as ``(g)''; subsection (e) corrects \nthis error.\n  Subsections (e) and (f) amend sections 546 and 548(d) of the \nBankruptcy Code to provide that transfers made under or in connection \nwith a master netting agreement may not be avoided by a trustee except \nwhere such transfer is made with actual intent to hinder, delay or \ndefraud and not taken in good faith. This amendment provides the same \nprotections for a transfer made under, or in connection with, a master \nnetting agreement as currently is provided for margin payments, \nsettlement payments and other transfers received by commodity brokers, \nforward contract merchants, stockbrokers, financial institutions, \nsecurities clearing agencies, repo participants, and swap participants \nunder Sections 546 and 548(d), except to the extent the trustee could \notherwise avoid such a transfer made under an individual contract \ncovered by such master netting agreement.\n  Subsections (g), (h), (i) and (j) clarify that the provisions of the \nBankruptcy Code that protect (i) rights of liquidation under securities \ncontracts, commodity contracts, forward contracts and repurchase \nagreements also protect rights of termination or acceleration under \nsuch contracts, and (ii) rights to terminate under swap agreements also \nprotect rights of liquidation and acceleration.\n  Subsection (k) adds a new section 561 to the Bankruptcy Code to \nprotect the contractual right of a master netting agreement participant \nto enforce any rights of termination, liquidation, acceleration, offset \nor netting under a master netting agreement. Such rights include rights \narising (i) from the rules of a derivatives clearing organization, \nmultilateral clearing organization, securities clearing agency, \nsecurities exchange, securities association, contract market, \nderivatives transaction execution facility or board of trade, (ii) \nunder common law, law merchant or (iii) by reason of normal business \npractice. This reflects the enactment of the CFMA and the current \ntreatment of rights under swap agreements under section 560 of the \nBankruptcy Code. Similar changes to reflect the enactment of the CFMA \nhave been made to the definition of ``contractual right'' for purposes \nof Sections 555, 556, 559 and 560 of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  Subsections (b)(2)(A) and (b)(2)(B) of new Section 561 limit the \nexercise of contractual rights to net or to offset obligations where \nthe debtor is a commodity broker and one leg of the obligations sought \nto be netted relates to commodity contracts traded on or subject to the \nrules of a contract market designated under the Commodity Exchange Act \nor a derivatives transaction execution facility registered under the \nCommodity Exchange Act. Under subsection (b)(2)(A) netting or \noffsetting is not permitted in these circumstances if the party seeking \nto net or to offset has no positive net equity in the commodity \naccounts at the debtor. Subsection (b)(2)(B) applies only if the debtor \nis a commodity broker, acting on behalf of its own customer, and is in \nturn a customer of another commodity broker. In that case, the latter \ncommodity broker may not net or offset obligations under such commodity \ncontracts with other claims against its customer, the debtor. \nSubsections (b)(2)(A) and (b)(2)(B) limit the depletion of assets \navailable for distribution to customers of commodity brokers. This is \nconsistent with the principle of subchapter IV of chapter 7 of title 11 \nthat gives priority to customer claims in the bankruptcy of a commodity\n\n[[Page S2372]]\n\nbroker. Subsection (b)(2)(C) provides an exception to subsections \n(b)(2)(A) and (b)(2)(B) for cross-margining and other similar \narrangements approved by, or submitted to and not rendered ineffective \nby, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, as well as certain other \nnetting arrangements.\n\n  For the purposes of Bankruptcy Code sections 555, 556, 559, 560 and \n561, it is intended that the normal business practice in the event of a \ndefault of a party based on bankruptcy or insolvency is to terminate, \nliquidate or accelerate securities contracts, commodity contracts, \nforward contracts, repurchase agreements, swap agreements and master \nnetting agreements with the bankrupt or insolvent party.\n  The protection of netting and offset rights in sections 560 and 561 \nis in addition to the protections afforded in sections 362(b)(6), \n(b)(7), (b)(17) and (b)(28).\n  Under the Act, the termination, liquidation or acceleration rights of \na master netting agreement participant are subject to limitations \ncontained in other provisions of the Bankruptcy Code relating to \nsecurities contracts and repurchase agreements. In particular, if a \nsecurities contract or repurchase agreement is documented under a \nmaster netting agreement, a party's termination, liquidation and \nacceleration rights would be subject to the provisions of the \nBankruptcy Code relating to orders authorized under the provisions of \nSIPA or any statute administered by the SEC. In addition, the netting \nrights of a party to a master netting agreement would be subject to any \ncontractual terms between the parties limiting or waiving netting or \nset off rights. Similarly, a waiver by a bank or a counterparty of \nnetting or set off rights in connection with QFCs would be enforceable \nunder the FDIA.\n  Section 502 of the Act clarifies that, with respect to municipal \nbankruptcies, all the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code relating to \nsecurities contracts, commodity contracts, forward contracts, \nrepurchase agreements, swap agreements and master netting agreements \n(which by their terms are intended to apply in all proceedings under \ntitle 11) will apply in a Chapter 9 proceeding for a municipality. \nAlthough sections 555, 556, 559 and 560 provide that they apply in any \nproceeding under the Bankruptcy Code, Section 502 makes a technical \namendment in Chapter 9 to clarify the applicability of these \nprovisions.\n  New section 561 of the Bankruptcy Code clarifies that the provisions \nof the Bankruptcy Code related to securities contracts, commodity \ncontracts, forward contracts, repurchasing agreements, swap agreements \nand master netting agreements apply in a proceeding ancillary to a \nforeign insolvency proceeding under new Chapter 15.\n  Subsections (l) and (m) clarify that the exercise of termination and \nnetting rights will not otherwise affect the priority of the creditor's \nclaim after the exercise of netting, foreclosure and related rights.\n  Subsection (n) amends section 553 of the Bankruptcy Code to clarify \nthat the acquisition by a creditor of setoff rights in connection with \nswap agreements, repurchase agreements, securities contracts, forward \ncontracts, commodity contracts and master netting agreements cannot be \navoided as a preference.\n\n  This subsection also adds setoff of the kinds described in sections \n555, 556, 559, 560, and 561 of the Bankruptcy Code to the types of \nsetoff excepted from section 553(b).\n  Subsection (o), as well as other subsections of the Act, adds \nreferences to ``financial participant'' in all the provisions of the \nBankruptcy Code relating to securities, forward and commodity contracts \nand repurchase and swap agreements.\n  Section 908 amends section 11(e)(8) of the Federal Deposit Insurance \nAct to explicitly authorize the FDIC, in consultation with appropriate \nFederal banking agencies, to prescribe regulations on recordkeeping by \nany insured depository institution with respect to QFCs only if the \ninsured depository institution is in a troubled condition (as such term \nis defined in the FDIA).\n  Section 909 amends FDIA section 13(e)(2) to provide that an agreement \nfor the collateralization of governmental deposits, bankruptcy estate \nfunds, Federal Reserve Bank or Federal Home Loan Bank extensions of \ncredit or one or more QFCs shall not be deemed invalid solely because \nsuch agreement was not entered into contemporaneously with the \nacquisition of the collateral or because of pledges, delivery or \nsubstitution of the collateral made in accordance with such agreement.\n  The amendment codifies portions of policy statements issued by the \nFDIC regarding the application of section 13(e), which codifies the \n``D'Oench Duhme'' doctrine. With respect to QFCs, this codification \nrecognizes that QFCs often are subject to collateral and other security \narrangements that may require posting and return of collateral on an \nongoing basis based on the mark-to-market value of the collateralized \ntransactions. The codification of only portions of the existing FDIC \npolicy statements on these and related issues should not give to any \nnegative implication regarding the continued validity of these policy \nstatements.\n  Section 910 adds a new section 562 to the Bankruptcy Code providing \nthat damage under any swap agreement, securities contract, forward \ncontract, commodity contract, repurchase agreement or master netting \nagreement will be calculated as of the earlier of (i) the date of \nrejection of such agreement by a trustee or (ii) the date of \nliquidation, termination or acceleration of such contract or agreement.\n  New section 562 provides important legal certainty and makes the \nBankruptcy Code consistent with the current provisions related to the \ntiming of the calculation of damages under QFCs in the FDIA.\n  Section 911 amends SIPA to provide that an order or decree issued \npursuant to SIPA shall not operate as a stay of any right of \nliquidation, termination, acceleration, offset or netting under one or \nmore securities contracts, commodity contracts, forward contracts, \nrepurchase agreements, swap agreements or master netting agreements (as \ndefined in the Bankruptcy Code and including rights of foreclosure on \ncollateral), except that such order or decree may stay any right to \nforeclose on or dispose of securities (but not cash) collateral pledged \nby the debtor or sold by the debtor under a repurchase agreement or \nlent by the debtor under a securities lending agreement. A \ncorresponding amendment to FDICIA is made by section 906. A creditor \nthat was stayed in exercising rights against such securities would be \nentitled to post-insolvency interest to the extent of the value of such \nsecurities.\n  Section 912 generally protects asset-backed securitization \ntransactions from legal uncertainties and disruptions related to the \nbankruptcies of certain parties and allows for the further development \nof structured finance. Asset securitization involves the issuance of \nsecurities supported by assets having an ascertainable cash flow or \nmarket value. Securitization of receivables, such as small-business \nloans, commercial and multifamily mortgages, and car loans, allows for \nthe funding of such loans from capital market sources. The process \ngenerally enlarges the pool of capital available and reduces financing \ncosts for vital lending purposes such as the financing of small-\nbusiness operations and home ownership.\n  Through a number of definitions designed to ensure that the exclusion \nfrom property of the estate applies only to the intended type of \ntransaction, new section 541(b)(5) of the Bankruptcy Code excludes from \nthe property of a debtor's estate any ``eligible asset'', and proceeds \nthereof, tot he extent that such eligible asset was ``transferred'' by \nthe debtor, before the date of commencement of the case, to an \n``eligible entity'' in connection with an ``asset-backed \nsecuritization.'' Each term is explicitly defined to reflect its \nspecific role or application in the securitization process to ensure \nthat only bona fide securitizations are eligible for the safe harbor \nexclusion. All defined elements of a securitization must be present for \nthe safe harbor to apply. Other commercial transactions lacking any of \nthe defined elements, such as transactions documented and structured as \ncollateralized lending arrangements and other commercial asset sales or \nfinancings that are unrelated to securitization transactions, would be \nineligible for the safe harbor provided by section 541(b)(5).\n  The phrase ``to the extent'' in new section 541(b)(5) makes clear \nthat a\n\n[[Page S2373]]\n\nportion of the eligible asset may remain part of the debtor's estate, \nfor example, where the eligible entity obtains the right to receive \nonly interest payments on the first 10 percent of payments due on a \nreceivable in connection with an asset-backed securitization. In \naddition, the reference to section 548(a) in new section 541(b)(5) will \nmake clear that the safe harbor does not supersede a trustee's power to \navoid fraudulent transfers.\n  New section 541(b)(5) is not intended to override state law \nrequirements, if any, regarding ``perfection'' of an asset sale. \nHowever, regardless of strict compliance with such state \nlaw requirements, new section 541(b)(5) is intended to provide an \nexclusion of the debtor's interest in eligible assets, and proceeds \nthereof, from the debtor's estate, upon compliance with section \n541(b)(5). Thus, despite an eligible entity's failure to have properly \nperfected a sale for state law purposes, the eligible assets in \nquestion would remain excluded from the debtor's estate. In such event, \nhowever, a third party creditor with an interest in such eligible \nassets under state law would not be precluded from asserting, outside \nof the bankruptcy proceedings, such interest against the issuer or any \nother party purporting to have an interest in those assets. In other \nwords, the amendments do not purport to extinguish any party's interest \nin the securitized assets other than the debtor's interest to the \nextent transferred by the debtor to the securitization vehicle. In \norder to provide certainty to participants in the asset-backed \nsecurities marked, including both issuers and purchasers of such \nsecurities, it is noted that the ``strong-arm'' provisions of section \n544 of the Bankruptcy Code are not intended to override the general \nrule set forth in new section 541(b)(5) so as to bring such assets back \ninto the debtor's estate.\n\n  Frequently, asset securitizations involve the issuance of more than \none class of securities with differing payment priorities, \nsubordination provisions and other characteristics. The definition of \n``asset-backed securitization'' contained in new section 541(e)(1) \nrequires that at least one tranche of the asset-backed securities \nbacked by the eligible assets in question be rated investment grade, \nthereby requiring that each asset-backed securitization as to which \neligible assets are excluded from the debtor's estate be a carefully \nreviewed transaction subjected to third party scrutiny by a nationally \nrecognized statistical rating organization. The investment-grade rating \nrequirement applies only when the security is initially issued. In view \nof the cost and time associated with obtaining an investment-grade \nrating, such ratings are generally not pursued for smaller \ntransactions. These and other burdens of the rating process add further \nprotection against potential abuse of the safe harbor for sham \ntransactions and ensure its application of its intended purpose--to \npreserve payments on asset-backed securities issued in the public and \nprivate markets.\n  New section 541(e)(4) defines the term ``eligible asset.'' This \ndefinition is based upon the definition provided in rule 3a-7 under the \nInvestment Company Act of 1940, which provides an exemption from \nregistration under the Investment Company Act for issuers of asset-\nbacked securities (i.e., issuers in the business of purchasing, or \notherwise acquiring, and holding eligible assets). The phrase ``or \nother assets'' is intended to cover assets often conveyed in connection \nwith securitization transactions such as letters of credit, guarantees, \ncash collateral accounts, and other assets that are provided as \nadditional credit support. This phrase would also cover other assets, \nsuch as swaps, hedge agreements, etc., that are provided to protect \nbondholders against interest rate, currency and other market risks. The \ninclusion of cash and securities as eligible assets allows so-called \nmarket-value based securitizations of equity and other non-amortizing \nsecurities to fall within the purview of the amendment, although \nsecuritizations of such securities are not included under Rule 3a-7 and \ntherefore would be subject to regulation under the Investment Company \nAct if another exemption therefrom were not available.\n  New sections 541(e)(3) and (4) define the terms ``eligible entity'' \nand ``issuer,'' respectively. The definitions exclude operating \ncompanies by encompassing only single purpose entities. Because \nsecuritization transactions often involve intermediary transferees, an \neligible entity can be either an issuer or an entity engaged \nexclusively in the business of acquiring and transferring eligible \nassets directly or indirectly to an issuer.\n\n  New section 541(e)(5) defines the term ``transferred.'' In order for \nthe eligible assets to be excluded from the debtor's estate under \nsection 541, the debtor must represent and warrant in a written \nagreement that such eligible assets were sold, contributed or otherwise \nconveyed with the intention of removing them from the debtor's estate \npursuant to section 541 (whether or not reference is made to section \n541 in the written agreement). The definition makes clear that the \ndebtor's written intention as to the exclusion of the eligible assets \nwill be honored, regardless of the state law characterization of the \ntransfer as a sale, contribution or other conveyance, and regardless of \nany other aspect of the transaction (such as the debtor's holding an \ninterest in the issuer or any securities issued by the issuer, the \nongoing servicing obligation of the debtor; the tax and accounting \ncharacterization; or any recourse to the debtor, whether relating to a \nbreach of a representation, warranty or covenant, or otherwise) which \nmay affect a state law analysis as to the true sale.\n  In Section 913, subsection (a) provides that the amendments made \nunder Title IX take effect on the date of enactment.\n  Subsection (b) provides that the amendments made under Title IX shall \nnot apply with respect to cases commenced, or to conservator/receiver \nappointments made, before the date of enactment. The amendments would, \nhowever, apply to contracts entered into prior to the date of \nenactment, so long as a Bankruptcy Code case were commenced or a \nconservator/receiver appointment were made on or after the date of \nenactment under any Federal or state law.\n  Section 914 provides that the meaning of terms used in Title IX are \napplicable for purposes of Title IX only, and shall not be construed or \napplied so as to challenge or affect the characterization, definition, \nor treatment of any similar terms under any other statute, regulation, \nor rule, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Legal Certainty for \nBank Products Act of 2000, the securities laws (as that term is defined \nin Section 3(a)(47) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), and the \nCommodity Exchange Act.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 420, the \nBankruptcy Reform Act of 2001, and I commend Senators Grassley, Hatch, \nand Sessions for their hard work, dedication, and perseverence. As a \nresult of their efforts, a sense of balance and fairness has been \nrestored to our legal system and American consumers and businesses will \nboth benefit.\n  This bill is long overdue as over the past decade there has been an \nexplosion in the number of bankruptcy filings. Last year, there were \n1.25 million total bankruptcy filings in America, in 1990, a mere ten \nyears earlier, there were 782,960 filings. In Arkansas, there were \n7,062 filings in 1990 and 16,784 in 2000. This explosion is due in no \nsmall part to the current Bankruptcy Code's generous, no questions \nasked policy of providing complete debt forgiveness under Chapter 7 \nwithout seriously considering whether a person filing bankruptcy can \nrepay some or all of those debts.\n  Furthermore, the United States economy loses $40 billion annually as \na result of bankruptcy filings and the U.S. Department of Justice \nestimates that creditors lose $3.22 billion every year because of \nbankruptcies filed by persons who could repay their debts. These losses \nare passed on to all consumers--including, and especially, those who \nresponsibly pay at least part of their debts but choose not use the \nbankruptcy code to escape them. The Congressional Budget Office \nestimates that as a result each American household pays an extra $400 \nannually in the form of higher costs for goods, services, and credit.\n  The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2001 will reduce the number of frivolous \nbankruptcy filings while still allowing those who truly need help to \nobtain a fresh start. I am proud to support this legislation and I ask \nmy colleagues to\n\n[[Page S2374]]\n\njoin me in support of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2001.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the \nbankruptcy reform legislation. This legislation offers an imperfect but \nfairly balanced approach to reforming the bankruptcy system. Through \nthe amendment process we have improved the bill, but it could be more \nfair to all sectors of our society. I am disappointed some good \namendments that would have improved the legislation were rejected.\n  The bankruptcy reform legislation that passed the House a couple of \nweeks ago is less friendly to individuals in adverse circumstances not \nof their own doing. If this bankruptcy reform bill is weakened in \nconference, I will have a hard time supporting it. I will likely oppose \na conference agreement that looks at all like the House bill.\n  In recent years, consumer bankruptcy filings have dramatically \nincreased. We debated bankruptcy reform in the last two Congresses. \nThose discussions showed our desire to elevate personal responsibility \nin consumer financial transactions; to prevent bankruptcy filings from \nbeing used by consumers as a financial planning tool; and, to recapture \nthe stigma associated with a bankruptcy filing. It is clear the system \nis broke, and bankruptcy reform is needed.\n  I voted for bankruptcy reform in both the 105th and 106th Congresses, \nand I plan to vote for this bill. Despite these votes, I have \nreservations about how the unintended consequences of this bill will \naffect the less fortunate.\n  The bill will have an enormous impact on women and child support. The \nlargest growing group of filers are women, usually single mothers. The \nbill's overall philosophy of pushing debtors from chapter 7 to chapter \n13 will have an unintended effect on women. They usually have fewer \nmeans and are more susceptible to crafty creditors seeking to \nintimidate and reaffirm their debts. They need the protection of \nchapter 7, but could be pushed into chapter 13.\n  Women will also be disadvantaged by provisions in this bill that fail \nto prioritize domestic obligations. Under the provisions of this bill, \nwomen will find themselves competing with powerful commercial creditors \nfor necessary resources, such as past-due child support, from spouses \nwho are in bankruptcy. It is unfair to place the critical needs of \nfamilies and single mothers trying to survive behind those of well-off \ncommercial creditors.\n  Another problem with this bill is the new filing requirements are \nvery complex, which could result in unintended discrimination against \nlower-income individuals and families. Many low-income families don't \nhave the means to combat most creditors. Because debtors must prove \nthey are filing for legitimate reasons, those without the means to \ncombat powerful commercial interests will be placed at an unfair \ndisadvantage.\n  I was also disappointed that the U.S. Senate failed to adopt some \nvery good amendments that would have significantly improved the bill. \nSenator Kohl offered an amendment that would have limited the practice \nof wealthy debtors shielding themselves from creditors in bankruptcy \nbehind State homestead exemption laws that allow them to shelter large \namounts of money in a new home. His amendment would have placed a \nnational cap on this exemption, and limited the abusive practice of \nsheltering large amounts of money in large homes. I supported this \nneeded amendment, but it was rejected on the floor of the Senate.\n  Several amendments were also offered that would have restricted the \nmarketing to and use of credit cards by young people. Credit card \ncompanies are aggressively marketing to young people, and many young \npeople are getting into massive debt. Companies should only be allowed \nto offer credit cards to those who can pay for them.\n  Finally, I am disappointed that amendments were rejected that would \nhave limited predatory lending practices. Some of these predatory loans \ncan have interest rates over 100%.\n  I was pleased to see that the bill included language to end the \npractice of using the bankruptcy code to escape civil punishment for \nviolence, intimidation or threats against individuals using family \nplanning services. This provision was added in the Judiciary Committee \nand greatly improves the bill. It ensures that those who violate the \nlaw cannot escape justice through the bankruptcy laws. This critical \nprovision of this bill that must not be stripped or drastically changed \nin conference.\n  Overall, this is a decent bill that will improve on the current \nabuses of the bankruptcy system. While I have concerns over many of \nthis bill's provisions, I hope they can be dealt with in conference or \nin future legislation.\n  This bill should be strengthened in conference, not weakened as has \nhappened to other versions of bankruptcy legislation. I will closely \nexamine a conference agreement with this in mind before voting to send \nthis legislation to the President.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, once again the Senate will vote on a \nbankruptcy reform bill. In the last session of Congress, when the \nbankruptcy bill came before the Senate, I voted in favor of the bill. I \nsaid at the time that because of the amendments adopted in the Senate, \nthe bill was a more reasonable approach to bankruptcy reform that had \nbeen reported by the Judiciary Committee. However, I further stated \nthat if the legislation came back from conference, without those modest \namendments, I would consider opposing the bill. In the end, the \nbankruptcy legislation came back from conference in a form that I could \nnot support. The conferees who worked out the differences on the bill \ndeleted or weakened many of the provisions I had supported.\n  Today, I will vote for this bill with the hope that it does not \nreturn from conference in a form I cannot support. The Senate today \nadopted the Kohl amendment establishing a nationwide homestead cap. \nThat provision must be retained in conference. The Senate has now \nspoken twice with respect to homestead abuse. We cannot legitimately \nreform the bankruptcy system if we do not prevent wealthy debtors from \nshielding luxurious homes while shedding thousands of dollars of debt \nin bankruptcy.\n  In addition, the conferees should keep in the final bill, the \namendment making debts arising from clinic violence nondischargeable, \nthe amendment on landlord-tenant, the amendment on separated spouses, \nand the amendment on the means test with respect to high energy costs. \nIt is also my hope that the conference will yield more protections for \nconsumers.\n  If the bankruptcy bill comes back from conference without these and \nsome of the other reasonable amendments adopted in the Senate, I may \nonce again be forced to oppose the final legislation.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of final passage \nof S. 420, the Bankruptcy Reform Act. Many of my colleagues may \nremember that I was a strong critic of the bill that passed out of the \n106th Congress because I did not believe it provided a balanced \napproach to bankruptcy reform.\n  While we have yet to achieve the kind of bankruptcy reform I believe \nis possible, I have worked with a number of people over the past three \nyears to make improvements that bring us closer to our goals, \nparticularly when it comes to child support.\n  Women can now be assured that they can continue to collect child \nsupport payments after the child's father has declared bankruptcy. The \nlegislation makes child support the first priority during bankruptcy \nproceedings.\n  This year, we have made more progress. The Senate agreed to include a \nrevised version of Senator Schumer's amendment to ensure that any debts \nresulting from any act of violence, intimidation, or threat would be \nnon-dischargeable. Earlier today, this body agreed to include a cap on \nthe homestead exemption to ensure that wealthy debtors could not shield \ntheir wealth by purchasing a mansion in a state with no cap on \nhomestead exemption. And finally, today I worked hard to make sure that \nonce a person has been declared bankrupt, single mothers can still \ncollect the child support they depend upon. Senator Hatch and I passed \nan amendment to ensure that child's custodian--usually the mother--will \nbe informed by the bankruptcy trustee of her right to have the State \nchild support agency collect the non-dischargeable child support from \nthe ex-spouse.\n\n[[Page S2375]]\n\n  In addition, I was concerned about competing non-dischargeable debt \nso I worked hard with Senator Boxer to ensure that more credit card \ndebt can be erased so that women who use their credit cards for food, \nclothing and medical expenses in the 90 days before bankruptcy do not \nhave to litigate each and every one of these expenses for the first \n$750.\n  Let me be very clear--I will not vote for final passage of this bill \nif it comes back from conference if these kind of reforms are missing. \nI am voting for this legislation because it is a work in progress, and \nit is making progress towards reform.\n  Bankruptcy reform is important. I grew up with a father who worked \nhard to avoid having debts. In recent weeks, I have heard form many \nsmall credit unions throughout New York, hard working small lenders \nwhose entire membership suffers when the credit union is faced with \ncovering bankruptcy losses.\n  One credit union from Hoosick Falls has assets of only $2.5 million, \nbut when one of their members filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, this small \ncredit union was left with a bill of thousands, which penalized the \nentire 1,000 membership with increased fees.\n  Reform is needed. The right kind of reform is necessary. We're on our \nway toward that goal, and I hope we can achieve final passage of a good \nbankruptcy reform bill this year.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of final passage of \nthe bankruptcy bill.\n  The Senate has worked on this legislation for over four years. The \nJudiciary Committee, on which I sit, has debated this issue again and \nagain, and we have even sent a bill to the President although that bill \nwas fatally flawed and was vetoed as a result.\n  This bill is by no means perfect. However, the bill now before us is \nbetter than the Conference Report we were faced with at the end of last \nyear, and it is better and more balanced than the bill presented to us \nin the Judiciary Committee just a few weeks ago.\n  I believe that the modifications to the legislation made in Committee \nand on the Floor merit a ``Yes'' vote on final passage.\n  Since the bill's introduction, I have consistently supported its \nunderlying goal of promoting personal responsibility--as, I think, has \nevery member of this Senate. Debtors who can pay back what they owe, \nshould pay what they owe or at least part of it.\n  Moreover, the bankruptcy code should not be a haven for irresponsible \nindividuals who have recklessly accumulated debts by spending freely \nwithout regard to the consequences. After all, bankruptcy has a \nsocietal cost.\n  And although much has been made of the big credit card companies and \nbanks, not every creditor is a big business. Many harmed by bankruptcy \nfilings are small businessmen and women dry cleaners, home repair \nworkers, and others.\n  An empirical review of bankruptcy filings indicates that reform is \nneeded. Despite a recent drop, bankruptcy filings continue to remain at \nunacceptably high levels.\n  In 1980, individuals filed 287,000 bankruptcies.\n  In 1999, more than 1.3 million Americans filed for bankruptcy--an \nincrease of 358 percent over 20 years. Bankruptcy has become so \ncommonplace that more than one in a hundred households will file for \nbankruptcy this year.\n  The bill we are voting on today appropriately readjusts our \nbankruptcy laws so that bankruptcy filers must repay a portion of their \ndebts, if they can do so. At the same time, the bill protects debtors \nbelow the median income who are truly in need of a fresh start.\n  This bill assists single parents with children in collecting child \nsupport debt from the bankruptcy estate. Philip Strauss, Principal \nAttorney of the San Francisco Department of Child Support Services, \ntestified on this issue at a February 8, Judiciary Committee hearing, \nnoting that the Bankruptcy Act of 2001 ``will enhance substantially the \nenforcement of child support obligations against debtors in \nbankruptcy.''\n  Specifically, the Bankruptcy Act of 2001 gives child support the \nhighest priority of unsecured claims in a bankruptcy estate. Moreover, \nthe bill prevents a debtor from confirming a bankruptcy plan if the \ndebtor does not make full payment of any child support becoming due \nafter the petition date.\n  This bill is significantly improved from the Conference Report I \nvoted against in December. While I voted for the Senate-passed \nbankruptcy bill in the 106th Congress, I voted against the Conference \nReport because the shadow conference deleted key Senate-passed \namendments and did not strike a fair enough balance between creditors \nand debtors.\n  For example, last year, the Conference Report deleted a Senate passed \namendment that would prevent anti-abortion extremists from using \nbankruptcy laws to avoid paying civil judgements against them under the \nFreedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act.\n  The FACE Act has led to successful criminal and civil judgements \nagainst groups that use intimidation and outright violence to prevent \npeople from obtaining or providing reproductive health services. This \namendment is crucial to protecting a woman's safe access to \nreproductive services.\n  This year, however, I am pleased that the Bankruptcy Act of 2001 has \nincorporated a modified version of the FACE amendment, and now makes \n``non-dischargeable'' all debts incurred for harassing, obstructing, or \nother threatening violence against a person seeking any lawful goods \nand services, including access to reproductive health clinics. I \nappreciate the efforts of Senators Schumer and Hatch in coming to this \nagreement.\n  Additionally, this bill includes the Kohl-Feinstein homestead \namendment, which places a nationwide $125,000 cap on the amount of \nmoney a bankruptcy filer can shield from creditors simply by buying a \nhome. This amendment closes a loophole in bankruptcy code that permits \nwealthy bankruptcy filers to hide their assets in multimillion dollar \nestates.\n  This bill contains my amendment to curb abuses by bankruptcy mills. \nThese operations, generally under the control of a non-attorney \nbankruptcy petition preparer, are often linked with price gouging of \ndebtors, incompetent service, and remain a significant source of fraud \nin the bankruptcy system. California, in particular, has suffered from \nthe abuses of these mill operators.\n  Bankruptcy courts will now have the authority to fine these mill \noperators $500 per violation, with triple fines if the mill operator \ndoes not tell debtor she was filing for bankruptcy or advises the \ndebtor to hide assets. The amendment empowers the U.S. Trustee to take \nenforcement actions against the mills, sets maximum fees for petition \npreparers, and victims can sue for increased damages.\n  In addition, the Senate bill includes a compromise amendment I forged \nwith Senator Sessions and Senator Feingold to balance the needs of \nlandlords and tenants, when a tenant files bankruptcy.\n  Finally, this legislation contains my amendment directing the Federal \nReserve Board to investigate the practice of issuing credit cards \nindiscriminately, without taking steps to ensure that consumers are \ncapable of repaying their debt, or in a manner that encourages \nconsumers to accumulate additional debt.\n  The amendment allows the Federal Reserve Board to issue regulations \nthat would require additional disclosures to consumers, and to take any \nother actions, consistent with its statutory authority, that the Board \nfinds necessary to ensure responsible industry-wide practices and to \nprevent resulting consumer debt and insolvency.\n  It was my hope that we could improve this bill even more--with limits \non how credit card companies provide products to minors, and with \ndisclosure and other requirements to give consumers the tools to handle \nthe burdens of credit card debt. I also believe bankruptcy judges \nshould have some discretion in applying the means test. Unfortunately, \nseveral such amendments failed.\n  So I do have concerns about this bill, and I know that I will make \nsome people in my State unhappy by voting for it. I understand their \npoint of view, and by voting for this legislation I am not turning my \nback on those concerns. I do think we should try this approach. If it \nturns out that this bill does not appropriately solve the current \nproblems with our nation's bankruptcy laws, I will be on the front \nlines of the fight to reopen this debate and to fix the glitches.\n\n[[Page S2376]]\n\n  Nevertheless, this bill is a necessary, reasoned approach to solving \nsome real problems with our bankruptcy laws. Abuses are rampant. For \nmany, bankruptcy has become a financial planning tool, rather than its \nintended use as an option of last resort. Something must be done, and I \nwill vote for this bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nbankruptcy reform bill. We have been working on this reform for several \nyears now. Indeed, we passed this bill last year, only to have it \npocket vetoed by President Clinton. It is time we get it passed and \nsigned by the President.\n  Although there has been a slight decline in bankruptcies recently, \nthe 1990s saw a steady increase, despite a robust economy. There are \nnow more than a million bankruptcies a year. Many people are concerned \nthat bankruptcy is being used as a financial planning tool and the \npublic has become frustrated with many stories of bankruptcy abuse.\n  This bill goes a long way to curbing the abuse without undercutting \nthe truly needy debtor's right to a fresh start. This legislation \naccounts for the honest but unfortunate debtor who faces mounting bills \nas a result of medical expenses, divorce, and other reasonable causes.\n  However, it prevents a debtor from pursuing a lavish lifestyle and \nthen using bankruptcy to avoid obligations. Debtors must take \nresponsibility for their spending. After all, the money creditors lose \nin bankruptcy is passed on to consumers in higher prices for consumer \ngoods, services, and credit. This often has the greatest adverse affect \non the neediest in our society.\n  This bill strikes a fair balance between the interests of debtors and \ncreditors. Those who truly need bankruptcy relief will receive a \n``fresh start'' under Chapter 7. Those debtors who can afford to repay \nsome of their debt will be required to do so under a Chapter 13 \nrepayment plan. It is just common sense that a debtor who can afford to \nrepay some of their debt should do so.\n  Here's how the crux of the bill works. The bankruptcy court looks at \n100 percent of the debtor's living expenses, priority expenses, and \nsecured debt. If after their review, the debtor can still pay $10,000 \nor 25 percent of his or her debt, they are required to do so under a \nChapter 13 repayment plan. This makes sense.\n  The legislation also provides a $125,000 homestead exemption cap so \nthat the debtor cannot declare bankruptcy but still retain his million \ndollar home. Again, this makes sense.\n  This is reasonable reform that benefits debtors, consumers, and \ncreditors alike and I will again vote for its passage.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the bankruptcy bill before us today has \ncome this far because it is needed to address the record number of \nbankruptcy filings this country has seen in recent years.\n  The number of personal bankruptcies hit 1.4 million in 1998--a new \nrecord. While that number declined slightly last year--to 1.3 million \nbankruptcy filings--it is still too high. It is still nearly twice the \nnumber we saw in 1990, during the depths of a recession.\n  What accounts for this increase?\n  It's clear that most people who file for bankruptcy do so only after \nsuffering a serious reversal, such as serious illness, divorce or job \nloss. And most do so only as a last resort.\n  But economic conditions clearly are not the only factor. If they \nwere, we would have seen a drop in bankruptcy filings during the 1990s, \ngiven the booming economy. Instead, we saw record increases during the \n90s.\n  Clearly, some people are gaming and abusing the bankruptcy system. \nFor them, the old stigma associated with bankruptcy has faded.\n  The purpose of this bill is to stop those abuses.\n  Many have asked--fairly--whether the solution it imposes is too tough \non ordinary debtors who deserve the protection of bankruptcy court.\n  Critics of this bill say that it makes it more difficult for people \nwho have incurred overwhelming debts through no fault of their own to \nget back on their feet.\n  In many ways, I agree with them.\n  This bill could have been more balanced. It could have been crafted \nin a way that would have allowed all consumers to have their problems \nfully considered in bankruptcy court.\n  A number of Democratic Senators offered amendments that would have \nmade this bill better. Unfortunately, many of those amendments were \nrejected.\n  I am pleased, however, that two key amendments were adopted. Both \nSenator Schumer's amendment on clinic violence, and Senator Kohl's \namendment closing the homestead loophole, were needed to address real \nabuses of the bankruptcy code.\n  If we are going to insist that consumers repay more of their debts, \ncertainly we should also insist that people who resort to violence at \nhealth clinics must repay the debts they incur as a result of their \nillegal behavior. And certainly we must ensure that people who declare \nbankruptcy can't squirrel away millions of dollars in fancy homes that \ncreditors can't touch.\n  These abuses were not addressed in the bill President Clinton refused \nto sign last year. Their inclusion in this bill is one reason I am able \nto support it today.\n  A bigger reason for my support is a basic principle that I grew up \nwith. People who incur debts have a responsibility to repaying them if \nthey can.\n  That is a fundamental belief in South Dakota. It's part of the fabric \nof who we are.\n  The pioneers who settled our state relied on each other during the \nhard times, the weak harvests, and at planting times. They knew they \ncould trust each other to make good on their debts--because they had \nto.\n  Their survival depended on it.\n  Most people I know still feel that way.\n  This bill is needed because of the people who do not share that \nbelief--the minority of people who see bankruptcy as an easy out, \nrather than a last resort. It says to those people: ``Paying your debts \nisn't a matter of choice. It's a matter of honor. And it is a legal \nresponsibility to which you will be held accountable.''\n  There are real costs when somebody does not repay their debts. \nSomebody has to pick up the tab.\n  Some of those costs fall on lenders. But some are passed on to honest \nborrowers who do repay their debts. They get stuck with higher interest \nrates. So there are consumers on both sides of this equation.\n  Under current law, people can file under Chapter 7 to wipe out their \ndebts, and a judge can throw out a case if he or she determines that \nthe filer can afford to repay some of the debts. But there is no \nconsistent legal standard for determining one's ability to pay.\n  This bill establishes such a standard. It says that bankruptcy judges \nmust determine if a filer can pay $10,000--or 25 percent of his debts--\nover the next five years.\n  It is important to note: This new standard does not apply to filers \nwho--after deducting food, rent, transportation, education and other \nexpenses--earn less than their state's median income. These people can \nstill file for relief under chapter 7.\n  Opponents of the bill say it imposes new legal hurdles and paper \nburdens on consumers that will deny many the protection they deserve. \nThese are serious concerns.\n  We must monitor implementation of this new standard closely. If this \nbill is enacted into law--if we see that creditors are abusing the \nprovisions of this law to harass debtors--we have a moral \nresponsibility to revisit this law. And I can tell you, I will be the \nfirst Senator on this floor calling for that re-examination.\n  Time will tell if this bill strikes the right balance.\n  The Senate has heard good arguments on both sides of this debate.\n  Because of the improvements that were made in committee and on the \nfloor, and because of the fundamental values with which I was raised, I \nwill vote for it.\n  At the same time, I urge the conferees who will take it up next to \nrespect and preserve the balance in it, so it can continue to command \nthe broad, bipartisan support it will need to reach the President's \ndesk and be signed into law.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to vote for \nthis important bankruptcy bill. We've been working on bankruptcy reform \nfor a long time, and it's high time that we\n\n[[Page S2377]]\n\npass this bill. This bill will be a big step forward in restoring \npersonal responsibility and in cracking down on bankruptcy abuse. It \nwill also be a big step forward in providing key information to credit \ncard customers and helping people manage their debt.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that the fundamental question we face \nwith this bill is whether or not people should repay their debts. S. \n420 provides that when a person can repay his or her debts, then that \nperson won't be able to take the easy way out. The bill will end the \nfree ride for wealthy deadbeats who walk away from their debts and pass \nthe tab on to honest consumers. No more will those freeloaders get off \nscott free. But the bill does this by preserving the ability for people \nwho truly need to go into bankruptcy and wipe away their debts so they \ncan have a fresh start.\n  The point I'm trying to make is that we have a good balance in the \nbill. Contrary to what our critics say, bankruptcy should not be easy. \nYes, we need to have a way for people who are in dire straits to be \nable to start anew. Our bill does not close out the availability of \nbankruptcy for these people. Yet, it is just and fair for people who \ncan pay their debts to do just that--pay up. I don't know what people \nthink, but the fact is that someone has to pay if people walk away from \ntheir debts. It is not only businesses that have to pay--we all pay \nwhen people walk away from their debts. Economic losses from bankruptcy \ncause higher prices for goods and services, so everyone picks up the \ntab--consumers, small businesses, the economy.\n  Our bill makes many improvements with the current system. We make it \nharder for people to commit fraud and abuse. We prioritize certain \ndebts, such as child support and alimony. We include a number of \nconsumer protections, such as more expansive disclosure requirements, \ncredit counseling, and increased penalties for abusive creditors and \ndeceptive advertising. These are all important steps in correcting many \nproblems in the bankruptcy system.\n\n  An important provision in the bill is the permanent extension of \nChapter 12, which expired last June. Our family farmers need this \ncrucial protection because they can face bankruptcy due to low \ncommodity prices. The bill also provides significant new tax relief \nwhen they sell off assets. This is an extra reason to vote for this \nbill for my colleagues from farm country.\n  So, let me remind my colleagues again what this bill does. S. 420 \nreforms the bankruptcy system to require repayment of debts by \nindividuals who have the ability to pay, while protecting the right of \ndebtors to a financial fresh start. S. 420 strengthens protections for \nchild support and alimony payments by making family support obligations \na first priority in bankruptcy. S. 420 makes permanent Chapter 12 \nbankruptcy for family farmers and lessens the capital gains tax burden \non financially strapped farmers who declare bankruptcy.\n  S. 420 also creates new protections for patients when hospitals and \nnursing homes declare bankruptcy. S. 420 requires credit card companies \nto disclose the dangers of making only minimum payments and prohibits \ndeceptive advertising of low introductory rates. S. 420 strengthens \nenforcement and penalties against abusive creditors for predatory debt \ncollection practices.\n  So the bill is fair and balanced. S. 420 deserves to be passed by an \noverwhelming vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have tried over the last several weeks to \nimprove this bankruptcy legislation through the legislative process. We \nwere able to have an informative hearing and a productive Committee \nmarkup. Unfortunately, the Committee did not provide a Committee report \nto inform other Senators of what was good about the bill and what \nprompted eight members of the committee to vote against it.\n  This important matter was, instead, rushed to the floor last week. \nLast Monday we began debating the bill, but on Tuesday, the first day \nthe bill was open to amendment, the Republican leadership abandoned \nwork on the bill. Instead, the Republican leadership chose to shift the \nSenate's attention to overriding the ergonomics rule that had been \ndeveloped by the Department of Labor over the past decade.\n  On Wednesday we returned to the bankruptcy bill but beginning on \nThursday and carrying through until Tuesday of this week, the main \nfocus of the debate were the competing budgetary amendment on providing \na lockbox for Medicare. That too is an exceedingly important topic and \none on which a majority of the Senate voted to adopt the Democratic \nlockbox proposal.\n  That proposal is not in the bill because after the vote the \nRepublican side invoked the Budget Act and the chair ruled that the \namendment, although supported by a majority of the Senate was not \nconsistent with the technical requirements of the Budget Act. That \ndebate was a major disruption in our efforts to otherwise improve the \nbankruptcy bill.\n  Beginning last Wednesday and continuing through today I have offered \namendments to improve the bill and urged others with amendments to do \nthe same. There has never been an effort to filibuster this debate or \nthis bill. The only threat of a filibuster I can recall is when the \nRepublican chairman of the Banking Committee spoke against certain \namendments.\n  That threat was overcome and with the commitment of Senator Grassley \nand the cooperation of Senator Hatch, we were able to obtain votes on \nthe Schumer predatory lending amendment and in relation to the Durbin \namendment. I thank both Senator Grassley and Senator Hatch for their \ncooperation in this regard. In fact, once the Senate had an opportunity \nto consider it, we voted to adopt the Schumer amendment.\n  Despite the lack of a filibuster threat or a filibuster, the \nRepublican Senate leadership filed a cloture petition on Monday \nafternoon. There was no need for cloture then or on Wednesday when, \nwith the support of the Senate leadership, cloture was invoked. I voted \nagainst cloture. I voted against it because I reject the use of cloture \nas a time management tool. I believe that cloture is properly reserved \nin the Senate to those circumstances where unreasonable delay or a \nfilibuster are interfering with the work of the Senate.\n  Unfortunately, over the last 6 years the Republican leadership has \nabused the cloture process to avoid considering amendments and to \ninterfere with the Senate doing its work. In my view, the invocation of \ncloture this week on this bill was unnecessary and unfortunate. It \nsignals a retreat from the progress shown by Senate adoption of S. Res. \n8 in January and threatens a return to the dark days of the last few \nCongresses when cloture became a regular instrument, rather than the \nlast resort, of Senate leadership.\n  Through the legislative process, through our hearing and Judiciary \nCommittee markup and by means of amendments being adopted on the Senate \nfloor, we have made some progress. It is sufficient for me to support \nthe bill.\n  I had hoped and worked for a more open process. I wanted to be able \nto moderate the bill, improve it and be able to support it. I supported \nthe bankruptcy bill that passed the Senate 97 to one in the 105th \nCongress.\n  I even supported the bankruptcy bill that passed the Senate in the \nlast Congress given the progress we showed during Senate consideration \nand in hopes that we would be able to continue to improve the bill in \ncooperation with the House. I vote for this bill in that same spirit--\nto move the process forward and improve our legislative product. \nUnfortunately, last year the conference that resulted was under the \nauspices of the Foreign Relations Committee and not the Judiciary \nCommittee and the product that resulted was changed and tilted too \nharshly against American consumers and working people. That was the \nmodified bill that I voted against last year, that was the bill the \nPresident vetoed, and that was the bill that was the basis for S. 220 \nand S. 420 this year.\n  I am encouraged that we have included some privacy protection in the \nbill. The Leahy-Hatch amendment adopted by the Judiciary Committee to \ndeal with the Toysmart.com-type situation and customer information of \nbankrupt companies is a good start. It is something I have worked on \nfor some time and thank Senator Hatch for his joining with me in that \neffort.\n  I am pleased that we were also able to add some protection today for\n\n[[Page S2378]]\n\nshielding the identity of children whose names appear in bankruptcy \nrecords. By a vote of 99 to none, the Senate agreed to adopt our \namendment. I thank Senator Hatch for joining with me in that effort, as \nwell.\n  I filed amendments to do more to enforce financial privacy laws and \nprotections. Unfortunately, the bill still falls short in this regard.\n  I am encouraged that we have made progress in assuring access to \nhealth clinics. Senator Schumer is to be commended for his steadfast \nefforts in this regard. The Schumer-Leahy amendment that the Senate \nadopted by a bipartisan vote with 80 Senators in favor last year was \ndropped in S. 220 and S. 420. I again want to commend Senator Hatch for \nworking with Senator Schumer to include a modified version of Senator \nSchumer's amendment in the bill.\n  I am encouraged that the Senate beat back an attempt to table the \nKohl-Feinstein amendment and their sensible cap on the homestead \nexemption has been included in the bill. Throughout the debate \nRepublican supporters have indicated that a key outstanding issue is \nthe homestead exemption cap. That question was answered today when the \nSenate adopted the Kohl-Feinstein amendment today.\n  I was pleased that we adopted the Bingaman LIHEAP amendment, which I \ncosponsored, and the Carnahan energy cost amendment.\n  I am pleased that the Leahy amendment on separate spouses to protect \nbattered women was adopted by a bipartisan majority of Senators and I \nthank them.\n  I am encouraged that we were able to make other improvements in the \nmeasures included in the managers' package. We started work on that \npackage last Friday. Unfortunately Republican delay prevented its \nadoption before the cloture vote on Wednesday.\n  I regret that we have not made the progress that we should have, and \nthat we have made in the past, in terms of providing consumers with \ngreater disclosures and protections to help them avoid overextending \ntheir credit and consumption.\n  Early in the debate I took the bill's supporters at face value when \nthey argued that we need this bill to help small businesses. Those \nclaims began this debate and were repeated today. In between I gave \nthem the chance to shown that they meant it by voted for a small \nbusiness amendment that would have allowed small businesses, as already \ndefined in the bill, priority over large corporate creditors. That \namendment was unfortunately, and in my view unwisely, rejected.\n  We have also heard claims from the outset of this debate and through \ntoday that the bill is needed to address the $500 a family ``tax'' that \nbankruptcy abuse loads onto each American family. I have been asking \nhow this bill benefits the average American family and where that ``tax \nrefund'' is achieved. I have heard only silence from the other side. I \nhave noted in this year's debate and in debates past that billions of \ndollars in benefits that are expected to flow to credit card companies \nand other large corporate creditors, hundreds of millions to individual \ncompanies.\n  What I have been asking is where this bill or those corporations' \npractices will pass those benefits on ordinary Americans. Again, I have \nheard only silence. In fact, the benefits of this bill will flow to the \nprofits of those large corporate interests. There is no provision in \nthis bill to lower annual fees for credit cards, for example. There is \nno provision to lower interest rates for consumers. If this bill will \nbenefit creditors to the tune of $5 billion or over the next several \nyears, then why have then made no commitment to pass those benefits \nthrough to their customers and American consumers?\n  Instead, what this bill does is require American taxpayers through \nour taxpayer-financed bankruptcy courts to assist creditors in their \ndebt collection efforts and requires consumers to do more paperwork and \nconfront more rules and hurdles and government bureaucracy to file for \nbankruptcy.\n  I will continue to work in good faith with Chairman Hatch, Senator \nGrassley, Senator Sessions, Senator Biden and others who strongly \nsupport S.420.\n  I will continue to work through the legislative process to improve \nthis measure, to add balance, moderation and fairness. I hope to be \nable to support the final legislative product after a productive \nconference. I trust that this Congress, the Senate conferees will \nsupport the Senate position where we have made improvements to the bill \nand not so easily abandon those advancements in our discussions with \nour House counterparts. Had we done that in the 105th Congress, three \nyears ago, we would already have a reformed bankruptcy law. \nUnfortunately, that was not the position of Republican Senate conferees \nin those days.\n  I commend all Senators on both sides of the aisle who have worked so \nhard this year to improve this bill. I commend those who have \nparticipated in our debates and discussions. I especially appreciate \nthe help I received in managing this bill from Senator Schumer, who \nconsented to manage from time to time when I could not and who is the \nRanking Democrat on the Judiciary Subcommittee of jurisdiction, and \nSenator Reid, who remains a great help in some many ways on so many \nmatters. I congratulate Senator Schumer, Senator Kohl, Senator \nFeinstein, and Senator Feingold for the improvements they have been \nable to make. I thank Senator Hatch for his courtesy to Senator Durbin \non his alternative amendment and thank Senator Grassley for his \ncourtesy to Senator Schumer with respect to his predatory lending \namendment. I thank Senator Biden for his support of our efforts to have \nthis matter considered by the Judiciary Committee.\n  I thank the staffs of all Senators who participated in this debate \nfor their hard work and, in particular, the staffs of Senators Kennedy, \nBiden, Kohl, Feinstein, Feingold, Schumer, Durbin, Daschle, and Reid \nand the staffs of Senators Hatch, Grassley and Sessions. In particular, \nI want to thank the following staff: Makan Delrahaim, Renee Augustine, \nRita Lari, Kolan Davis, Ed Haden, Melody Barnes, Jim Greene, Victoria \nBassetti, Jeff Miller, David Hantman, Tom Oscherwitz, Jennifer Leach, \nBob Schiff, Ben Lawsky, Natacha Blain, Jim Williams, Mark Childress, \nJonathan Adelstein, Eddie Ayoob, Peter Arapis, Liz McMahon, and Greg \nCota. I appreciate the exceptional work of my counsel Ed Pagano, who \nhas labored long and hard to help improve this bill.\n  Although bankruptcy filing had been going down over the last two \nyears, I have seen recent reports that link this bill with an expected \nrise in such filings. Unfortunately, the effect of House passage of its \nbill has been to generate fear in the public that people had better \nfile for bankruptcy now rather than wait for the harsh and onerous new \nburdens contemplated in that bill and, unfortunately, in the Senate \nbill. I can understand if bankruptcy lawyers feel an obligation to \nadvise their clients of the possibility that the terms and paperwork \nand costs of filing for bankruptcy may soon change.\n  Indeed, a principal reason Senator Feinstein successfully opposed the \nWyden-Smith amendment was a similar argument with respect to California \nutilities--that a prospective change in the law would force them into \npremature and possibly unnecessary bankruptcies.\n  In much the same way that the Bush administration's talk about \nweakness in the economy has served to drive the market down, shatter \nconsumer confidence and contribute to a further weakening, this drive \nfor exacting requirements of those on the brink of insolvency seems to \nbe accelerating bankruptcy filings and contributing to the economic \ndownturn. That is an immediate and unfortunate byproduct of this \neffort.\n  Perhaps it is appropriate that we end this phase of the debate today, \non March 15. It is on this day that we are reminded to beware the Ides \nof March. There remains much about this bill that counsels caution. \nUnless it is further moderated and balanced in discussions between the \nHouses or at the insistence of the President, enactment of a bill like \nthe one the Senate is voting on today will be the start of a process \nthat will likely consume several years.\n  Just as the overreaching that occurred in so-called immigration \nreform and welfare reform and telecommunications reform have required \nus to revisit those matters and still require corrections, so, too, the \nbankruptcy bill as currently constituted will result\n\n[[Page S2379]]\n\nin hardships and consequences that will require us to return to these \nmatters again and again in the days, months and years ahead.\n  In addition, I expect we will be hearing more about this bill and the \nlobbying efforts and the contributions by the bill's corporate \nbeneficiaries as soon as next week, when campaign finance reform is \ndebated.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, S. 420, the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act, \nis one of the most important legislative efforts to reform the \nbankruptcy laws in decades.\n  I want to thank a few of the people who have worked on the bill. Let \nme first acknowledge the majority leader, who has worked very hard to \nkeep this bill moving forward. Because of his dedication to the \nimportant reforms in this bill, we now have legislation that makes \nenormous strides in eliminating abuse in the bankruptcy system. I am \nalso grateful to the assistant majority Leader, Senator Nickles, along \nwith Senators Daschle and Reid for their efforts in trying to work with \nus to move the legislation forward.\n  Let me also acknowledge the ranking Democratic member of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, who has worked where he can to \nreach agreement on many of the bill's provisions, and who ably managed \nthe bill for his side of the aisle. I also want to commend my \ncolleagues, Senators Grassley, Biden and others for their sponsorship \nof and leadership on this much needed legislation. I particularly \nappreciate the dedication they have shown in working with me in making \nthe passage of this bill an inclusive and bipartisan process.\n  Also, let me express my thanks to Senator Sessions who has shown \nunwavering dedication to accomplishing the important reforms in this \nbill, to Senator Gramm for his efforts over the past several years in \nhelping see sensible reform through the Senate, and to the many other \nmembers of the Senate for their hard work and cooperation.\n  At the Committee staff level, let me acknowledge a few people who \nhave worked very hard on this bill. Kolan Davis and Rita Lari Jochun, \nof Senator Grassley's staff, along with Ed Haden and Brad Harris of \nSenator Sessions' staff, all of whom deserve praise for their \nimpressive efforts on this legislation. In addition, Judiciary \nCommittee Staff Director, Makan Delrahim, who has been lead counsel on \nthis bill, and Judiciary Committee Counsel, Rene Augustine, who has \nreally been working day and night to make sure this bill stayed on \ntrack.\n  Let me make one observation here. When we started this bankruptcy \nreform process, Rene didn't have any children, and by the time this \nbill becomes effective, she will have two children. Mr. President, I \nfeel like I have given birth twice during this process myself. Thanks \nas well should be given to the Judiciary Committee's Chief Counsel, \nSharon Prost, and all of the other Judiciary Committee staff who have \nworked hard on this.\n  On Senator Leahy's Committee staff, I want to acknowledge Minority \nChief Counsel Bruce Cohen, and thank counsel Ed Pagano for his efforts. \nIn addition, I want to recognize the efforts of Jennifer Leach of \nSenator Torricelli's staff, as well as the dedicated work of Jim Greene \nof Senator Biden's staff, as well as the very able Ben Lawsky of \nSenator Schumer's staff.\n  I also want to commend John Mashburn and Dave Horpe of the majority \nleader's staff, Stewart Verdery, Eric Ueland, and Matt Kirk of the \nAssistant Majority Leader's staff, and Eddie Ayoob of the Minority \nWhip's office for their efforts on this legislation.\n  Also, my thanks goes to Laura Ayoud, and others in the office of \nSenate Legislative Counsel, for their extraordinary efforts that have \nmade this legislation possible.\n  The compelling need for this reform is underscored by the dramatic \nrise we have seen over the past several years in bankruptcy filings. \nThe Bankruptcy Code was liberalized back in 1978, and since that time, \nconsumer bankruptcy filings have risen at an unprecedented rate.\n  Mr. President, the bankruptcy system was intended to provide a \n``fresh start'' for those who truly need it. We need to preserve the \nbankruptcy system within limits to allow individuals to emerge from \nfinancial hardship. What we do not need is to preserve the elements of \nthe system that allow it to be abused--that allow some debtors to use \nbankruptcy as a financial planning tool rather than as a last resort. I \nfirmly believe that by allowing people who can repay their debts to \navoid their financial obligations, we are doing a disservice to the \nhonest and hardworking people in this country who end up paying for it.\n  Mr. President, again I would like to applaud the bipartisan efforts \nof my colleagues who have made S. 420 a broadly-supported bill. The \nimpact of this important legislation not only will be to curb the \nrampant number of frivolous bankruptcy filings, but also will be to \ngive a boost to our economy.\n  Thank you.

Mr. President, prior to our going out today, I want to \nspeak on something that is not related to bankruptcy. What I would like \nto talk about today is the disappointment I have that we are not going \nto be able to do a bipartisan brownfields bill, S. 350, tomorrow or \nMonday. I want to talk about this bill which is entitled the \nBrownfields Revitalization and Environmental Restoration Act. I am \nsorry we cannot take this up today.\n  We cannot take it up because there has been objection on the other \nside. We have worked very hard. We wanted\n\n[[Page S2380]]\n\nto have a unanimous consent agreement. We have a window with some time \non Friday before we get into any heavy lifting on campaign finance \nreform. We would do it anytime: Early in the morning, late at night \ntomorrow, or on Monday.\n  This is a bill blessed with wide support. The bill has almost 60 \ncosponsors and passed out of our committee last week with a 15-3 vote. \nWe went to tremendous effort to satisfy those three. For example, \nSenator Voinovich, who is a very fine legislator, had some problems. I \ntold him during the markup that we would work with him to try to \nresolve those differences, and we did that. I know some of my \ncolleagues on the committee voiced their concerns about some specific \nbill language, including my friend Senator Voinovich, at the markup. I \nam pleased to say that Senator Voinovich and all of the others who had \nproblems, we worked night and day, the staff worked night and day to \nreconcile differences.\n  The chairman of the committee is Bob Smith of New Hampshire. I am the \nranking member. We have worked extremely hard on this legislation. We \nwanted to have a bipartisan bill come out of that committee, a 50/50 \ncommittee, as are all the committees over here. The President supports \nthis bill. This bill reflects the bipartisan efforts of Senator Smith \nand myself on the committee. It also reflects the tremendous staff work \nof our committee in helping us work out these differences we had, even \nthough the bill was reported out 15-3. We wanted to make sure they were \nsatisfied.\n  I appreciate the cooperation of my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to address these concerns and others and produce a bill with even \nmore broad support. We have worked closely with Senators Inhofe, Bond, \nand Crapo--I have already mentioned Senator Voinovich--as well as \nSenators Clinton, Boxer, Corzine, and Graham to accommodate the \ninterests they expressed at our committee hearing. I understand the \nbill we have before us to date does just that. I am very proud of that.\n  This bill is truly the best compromise we could reach and is a symbol \nof our ability to reach across the aisle and enact truly bipartisan \nlegislation.\n  I understood, when we entered into this historic power-sharing \nagreement this year, that we would truly work together. I understood \nthat we would truly work to pass thoughtful bipartisan legislation, \njust like the bill we had before us today.\n  This brownfields legislation, S. 350, is an issue on which President \nBush campaigned. This is a bill his administration has endorsed. Yet we \nstand here today basically being denied the opportunity to bring up \nthis bill. We know there is a need for this legislation. There are more \nthan 500,000 contaminated, abandoned sites in the United States. They \nare waiting to be cleaned and to become thriving parts of our \ncommunities. It works in urban areas; it works in rural areas.\n  Redeveloping a site will create almost 600,000 jobs nationally. In \nthe State of Nevada, it would create hundreds of new jobs, millions of \ndollars in tax revenue, and, on a national level, tax revenues would be \nincreased to as much as $2.5 billion.\n  This bill is good, and we need it. This bill provides three important \nthings to directly spur cleanup and reuse of these abandoned and \ncontaminated sites.\n  No. 1, it provides critically needed money to assess and clean up \nabandoned and underutilized brownfields sites, which will create jobs, \nincrease tax revenues, and preserve and create parks and open space.\n  No. 2, it encourages cleanup and redevelopment by providing legal \nprotections for innocent parties such as contiguous property owners, \nprospective purchasers, and innocent landowners.\n\n  Every day that goes by that we do not pass this legislation means \nproperty owners have problems. One reason I care so strongly about this \nissue is that we waited for 2 years, the entire last Congress, to get \nthis to the Senate floor, and we were always prevented from doing so.\n  No. 3, this legislation provides for funding and enhancement of State \ncleanup programs and a balance between providing certainty for \ndevelopers, which they want, and others but still ensuring protection \nof public health.\n  This legislation has been signed off on by the business community, \nthe development community. It has been signed off on by the \nenvironmental community. It is a fine balance, but it is good \nlegislation.\n  This bill does a number of additional things that are not in the \ncommittee report. It clarifies the coordination between the States and \nEPA. Senator Voinovich thought this was important. It provides \nclarification that cities and others can purchase insurance at \nbrownfields sites. It provides for an additional $50 million per year \nfor addressing abandoned sites which are contaminated by petroleum, \nsuch as corner gas stations.\n  For those of you not familiar with Superfund, it does not cover \npetroleum, so our original brownfield bill did not cover these sites \neither. I am pleased, however, that we were able to work out provisions \nso that these numerous sites can also be addressed.\n  This was a provision requested by Senators Inhofe and Crapo, and I am \npleased we were able to agree to it. Senator Crapo felt very intensely \nabout his objections to this bill. He expressed them well. As a result \nof that, we came back and corrected his problem. I do appreciate the \nintensity of his feelings about this.\n  This legislation also adds provisions so that areas with higher than \naverage instances of cancer and disease and sites with disproportionate \neffects on children, minority communities, or other sensitive \nsubpopulations will be given consideration in making grant decisions. \nThis is something that was advocated very well by Senators Clinton, \nCorzine, and Boxer.\n  This legislation also increases citizen participation by adding to \nthe list of State brownfields program elements the right for citizens \nto request that a site be considered under the State program.\n  All these changes have been carefully considered and provide \nimprovements to the bill. We acknowledge that. Moreover, they \ncollectively represent the same delicate balance, as does the \nunderlying bill, in the managers' amendment. We address the different \nbut often complementary needs of the real estate community, \nenvironmentalists, States, mayors, and other local government \nofficials, land and conservation groups, and the communities that are \nmost directly affected by these sites. This balance is what makes this \nbill unique and makes it a success.\n  As we all know, S. 350 has the support of a wide variety of groups \nincluding, as I have already mentioned, environmentalists, mayors, \nbusinesses, and the real estate community. This is a bill that reflects \na meeting of the minds from all sectors of American society because it \nis so badly needed. It is also something that is bipartisan in nature. \nThis is not something that either the Democrats or Republicans are \ntrying to cram down our throats. It is a model of how an evenly divided \ncommittee can work.\n\n  I urge the Senate to recognize how good this legislation is and to \nprove to Americans that a 50/50 Senate can be productive and we can \nenact these laws. I am terribly disappointed that we are in a position \nnow where we cannot go forward with this legislation. I am not going to \nask unanimous consent that this agreement be effectuated. I will not do \nthat. I understand there is an objection on the other side. I \nacknowledge that.\n  I do say, however, that it is too bad we can't move forward on this \nlegislation. It has been signed off on by every Democratic Senator. I \nhope there will be work done, maybe even during the night, so we can do \nsomething about this legislation and move forward on it. It is \nimportant legislation. It would be great for America in so many \ndifferent ways, and I hope that very quickly we can have whatever \nproblems are on the side of the Republicans alleviated and we can move \nforward on this most timely and important legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will take one moment to express my \nappreciation to the people who worked extremely hard to make this \nbankruptcy bill a success. The 83-15 vote is a strong testament to the \nwisdom and the balance that this bill maintains. Some said it is not \nbalanced and is unfair but when we had the final full debate and people \nvoted, there was an overwhelming vote.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, seldom on legislation of this kind \ndoes that large a vote result. I am pleased with that.\n  I am honored to have worked with Senator Hatch and Senator Grassley \nin making this a reality. I think it is appropriate that we take just a \nmoment to express appreciation to some people who gave extraordinary \neffort to make this successful conclusion a reality.\n  First, I note that in my office Ed Haden, who is with me today, is \none of the finest legal minds in this Senate, an exceedingly hard \nworker, a man of integrity and ability who dedicated himself to \nreaching the just result of today.\n  I could not have been successful without Ed's leadership and \nassistance. Also, Brad Harris on our staff, and Sean Costello, who used \nto be there; Lloyd Peeples, on our staff previously, now in private \npractice; Kristi Lee, who preceded Ed, is now a U.S. magistrate judge. \nThey all worked in previous years on this legislation. I know they are \nhappy to see it come to a conclusion. I am, too.\n  I must note that Makan Delrahim on Senator Hatch's staff has provided \ntremendous leadership, as did Rene Augustine; Senator Grassley's Rita \nLari Jochum and Kolan Davis provided tremendous effort. Senator \nGrassley was the original sponsor of this legislation. I must also \nthank Dave Hoppe and John Mashburn of Senator Lott's office, who also \nworked on it significantly.\n  Mr. President, one more thing about this. Senator Biden has been a \nstrong leader in this legislation, and he is here to speak. I have \nthought, from day one, there was a good concept of this bill. I have \nexpressed my overall view of what it is about, what it attempted to do, \nand why I thought it was important.\n  I have been somewhat disappointed to see certain people in consumer \ngroups I admire take positions that I thought were unconnected to the \nreality of this legislation. I am glad that after full and open \nhearings, now three different times have we voted here, all those \nissues were aired and people had the chance to have their say. I am \nvery confident that it is good legislation that will improve the \nadministration of justice in the Federal bankruptcy courts of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/15/senate-section/article/S2381-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2381-S2382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RADIATION EXPOSURE COMPENSATION TRUST FUND\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I rise to express my continued \ndismay with the lack of funding for the Radiation Exposure Compensation \nTrust Fund. Hundreds of former uranium miners, including many New \nMexicans, have recently been mailed IOUs from the Department of \nJustice. These individuals have had their claims approved, but have \nbeen told that there is no money in the Fund to compensate them. These \nare former miners who are stricken with radiation-related diseases, and \nunfortunately, many will die soon.\n  We often pledge that we will never forget our Nation's veterans, who \nhave sacrificed so much in order to secure our freedoms. But, we have \nforgotten the uranium miners, who also sacrificed for our nation's \nsecurity while building up our nuclear arsenal. These miners endured \nlong, dark, and dust-filled days underground. Often, the only fresh air \nthat they breathed was what leaked out of the air compressors used to \noperate their jack-hammers. These miners were not even given protective \nmasks or gloves, and they were never warned about the lethal medical \nrisks until decades later.\n  These miners are afflicted with cancer and various respiratory \ndiseases, and very few have sufficient money to pay their staggering \nmedical bills. Most of these miners were never given the opportunity to \nbuild up a pension because they were continuously moved from one \ncompany to another. And now, while our veterans rightfully enjoy a \ngreat many benefits, these miners are left with only a depleted \ncompensation fund and a handful of IOUs. Unfortunately, an IOU does not \npay their medical bills.\n  I recently introduced legislation to provide $84 million in emergency \nsupplemental appropriations to pay for those claims that have already \nbeen approved, as well as the projected number of claims for FY2001. \nBecause of the urgency of these claims, I will make this promise to our \nminers: I will introduce this legislation as an amendment to the first \nappropriate legislative vehicle to ensure our miners are compensated as \nquickly as possible.\n  We must replenish the trust fund immediately. Our miners have urgent \nhealth care needs and medical bills that will continue to pile up. Many \nminers have died without receiving any of the compensation that they \nwere promised. Many will die without compensation, if we do not take \naction now. We must not break our promise to the miners who sacrificed \nand suffered to protect our Nation's security.\n  I promise today to make every effort to ensure that our miners are \ncompensated for their sacrifice. We must make sure that they don't die \nwith only an IOU in their hands.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Albuquerque Tribune \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Albuquerque Tribune, Mar. 14, 2001]\n\n                       Half-Lives, Half Measures\n\n                        (By M.E. Sprengelmeyer)\n\n       They were promised government compensation, but dying \n     former uranium miners say they get nothing but IOUs.\n       Richard Leavell doesn't want to die with a government IOU \n     in his pocket.\n       Like his father, Merle, Leavell helped the United States \n     fight the Cold War from the trenches of the Colorado Plateau. \n     And like his father, he paid a high price.\n       The Leavells were uranium miners, helping provide the raw \n     material America craved for its nuclear arsenal.\n       Only years later did the federal government tell miners \n     about the deadly health risks they faced while blasting and \n     digging through the hills of the Four Corners region, \n     breathing radioactive dust that would take its toll as they \n     aged.\n       After Merle Leavell was left with radiation-related lung \n     damage, the federal government promised $100,000 of \n     ``compassionate compensation'' under a law enacted by \n     Congress in 1990. But the check didn't arrive until after his \n     death in 1995.\n       Now the same thing could happen to his son because of a \n     funding oversight in Congress last year and a long list of \n     unpaid government IOUs.\n       At 57, Richard Leavell suffers from pulmonary fibrosis and \n     silicosis of the lungs, which leave him gasping for air and \n     tied to expensive, ever-present bottles of oxygen.\n       ``I can't do anything,'' he said. ``This is no kind of \n     life.''\n       Last year, the government sent him a notice that he \n     qualifies for $100,000 compensation. ``Regretfully,'' the \n     letter said, there's no money to back it up.\n       Doctors aren't sure whether Leavell, who lives in Cortez, \n     Colo., will live another six months or several years, but he \n     says government officials don't seem to be in any hurry.\n       ``They told us they accept responsibility, and this was \n     supposed to be some kind of apology,'' Leavell said. ``It's \n     not much of an apology if you don't get it.''\n       The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act is in a crisis, but \n     even an emergency fix could come too late for many of the 275 \n     aging former miners, nuclear test participants, \n     downwinders or their surviving spouses with unpaid IOUs.\n       Commonly known as RECA, the program got only $10.8 million \n     this fiscal year but needs at least $84 million on top of \n     that to pay all the claims expected to be approved in 2001.\n       Although Congress voted to increase each victim's \n     compensation by $50,000, President Bush put that on hold \n     while he reviews virtually every new regulation approved last \n     year. Bush also signaled he is reluctant to approve any \n     supplemental funding requests while he focuses on a proposed \n     $1.6 trillion tax cut.\n       ``Here we've got this huge surplus in Washington, D.C., and \n     the government is sending these IOUs to people who are \n     dying,'' said Rebecca Rockwell, a private investigator from \n     Durango, Colo., who helps miners compile their claims.\n       ``I've lost 10 of my IOU holders since October,'' Rockwell \n     said. ``The problem is people are dying. I've gone to about \n     as many funerals as I can take.''\n       Republican Sens. Pete Domenici, of Albuquerque, and Orrin \n     Hatch, of Utah, recently introduced legislation asking for \n     $84 million in emergency appropriations. Rep. Scott\n\n[[Page S2382]]\n\n     McInnis, a Republican whose district includes the mining \n     county of western Colorado, plans to introduce a House \n     version of the emergency funding bill.\n       However, legislative analysts say it's unlikely any new \n     money will be approved before the summer or, more likely, at \n     the end of the fiscal year in October.\n       The IOUs are worse than an embarrassment or inconvenience, \n     said Ed Brickey, co-chairman of the Western States RECA \n     Reform Coalition, a collection of citizen groups that are \n     advocates for victims covered by the act.\n       ``It has been an injustice to delay any further \n     appropriations or the regulations because the people that \n     have (IOUs) are dying,'' Brickey said.\n       The RECA program has long been plagued by complaints about \n     a complex application process that often takes victims many \n     tries and several years to clear.\n       The program got into its current funding mess during the \n     11th-hour haggling over the budget in late 2000. Ironically, \n     it came just months after Congress amended the law to ease \n     restrictions, cover more medical conditions, add another \n     $50,000 in compensation under a separate program, and allow \n     uranium mill workers and ore transporters to qualify for the \n     first time.\n       The Justice Department estimated it would take $93 million \n     to cover all the claims expected to be approved in fiscal \n     2001. But that request came too late, and when the budget was \n     approved in December it included only $10.8 million for the \n     trust fund. The shortfall includes about $23 million for \n     those already waiting for their money.\n       The waiting has left many victims bitter and hopeless in \n     the small towns of southern and western Colorado, eastern \n     Utah and northwest New Mexico, where uranium once meant a \n     livelihood.\n       These guys went underground. They would work their butts \n     off, sometimes 10 to 16 hours a day . . . so the government \n     could get their damned uranium,'' said Anna Cox of Montrose, \n     Colo. ``And how do they get repaid? They die for it, with a \n     promissory note that maybe you'll get something . . . after \n     you're dead.''\n       Her 63-year-old husband, Eugene, has lung cancer. He worked \n     10 years in the uranium mines outside Grants in New Mexico \n     and Naturita, Slick Rock and Gateway, Colo.\n       In the early days, before strict radon monitoring, \n     companies and workers gave little regard to the health risks, \n     he said.\n       ``It was work, guaranteed,'' Eugene Cox said. ``You drilled \n     holes with a jackhammer and you shot, blasted out. Then you \n     loaded, either with a slusher or by hand and a scoop \n     shovel.''\n       Dust filled the air, but workers never wore protective \n     masks. They used gloves only if they brought their own. Some \n     miners remember days when the only ``fresh air'' they \n     breathed was what leaked out of the air compressors that ran \n     the jackhammers.\n       ``I was a young, healthy man,'' Eugene Cox said. ``I did \n     not know. It was a livelihood for me and my three children \n     and my wife.''\n       It took three years for Eugene Cox to verify his work \n     history and qualify his illness for compensation. Last year, \n     he finally got an approval letter, which explained the lack \n     of funding and told him to wait.\n       ``I stuck it in a box,'' Anna Cox said. ``That's what good \n     it's doing me.''\n       Uranium left its mark on whole communities throughout the \n     Four Corners region.\n       In tiny Monticello, Utah, local newspaper editor Bill Boyle \n     has a map stuck with more than 200 pins, one for each local \n     resident who died or is dying of a radiation-related illness.\n       One pin represents a small, one-story house in the center \n     of town.\n       There, former miner Joe Torres has turned his family's \n     living room into a medical ward, with a bed propped where the \n     sofa should be. Cancer has spread from his lungs to his \n     liver, and a government IOU is doing him little good when he \n     needs to buy more painkilling patches.\n       ``I'm very shaken,'' he said. ``I can't do a bit of work. \n     And Social Security doesn't give me enough money to pay for \n     my medicines.  . . . I'd like to get at least part of my \n     money to get by.''\n       Combined, he and his wife, Vicenta, get just over $1,000 a \n     month from Social Security. The painkillers alone cost $300 a \n     month, and health insurance is coming due soon, she said.\n       Torres, 74, started working in the mines of 1951.\n       ``They went in and worked and came back pretty well dusty \n     from head to toe,'' Vicenta remembers. ``But he had no idea \n     that in time it would do something to them.''\n       Shortly after talking with a reporter, Torres was \n     hospitalized.\n       Since 1990, the radiation compensation program has relied \n     on year-to-year allocations in the federal budget. Several \n     lawmakers say it should be converted into an entitlement \n     program so payments are guaranteed without a year-to-year \n     budget fight. But they disagree on how to accomplish that.\n       Regardless of the answer, Rep. Mark Udall, D-Colo., says \n     filling the trust fund's coffers should be a national \n     priority.\n       ``These people, as you know, have been jacked around for a \n     lot of years,'' he said. ``The statement we would make by \n     providing them with this compensation they're due would be \n     more than the money.''\n       Meanwhile, surviving victims struggle to pay high medical \n     bills and widows wait, not knowing when the government's \n     promise will be kept.\n       In the northwest New Mexico town of Aztec, 56-year-old \n     miner's widow Helen Story says she works two jobs a day shift \n     and an overnight shift taking care of elderly hospice \n     patients to get by.\n       She worked the same jobs while her husband, Jerald, fought \n     the final months against cancer before he died last March at \n     age 59.\n       Jerald Story started working in the uranium and coal mines \n     as a teen-ager.\n       He never built up a pension because, like many miners, he \n     bounced from one company to another over several decades. \n     Health problems forced him to retire and go onto Social \n     Security disability in the early 1980s.\n       ``I was having to work as much as I could, which took time \n     away from him,'' Helen Story said. ``Some days you think you \n     just can't take much more.''\n       The couple first applied for RECA compensation three years \n     ago. The government IOU came after Jerald Story's death, and \n     his widow has become bitter.\n       ``If they weren't going to stand good with the program, \n     they never should have started it,'' Helen Story scoffs. \n     ``It's for sure that if we owed the government, they wouldn't \n     wait this long on us.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/15/senate-section/article/S2382-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT KIDS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

PATRICK'S DAY STATEMENT BY THE FRIENDS OF IRELAND\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, the Friends of Ireland in Congress \nreleased its annual St. Patrick's Day Statement. The Friends of Ireland \nis a bipartisan group of Senators and Representatives opposed to \nviolence and terrorism in Northern Ireland and dedicated to a United \nStates policy that promotes a just, lasting and peaceful settlement of \nthe conflict.\n  I believe this year's Friends of Ireland Statement will be of \ninterest to all of our colleagues who are concerned about this issue, \nand I ask unanimous consent that it may be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Friends of Ireland Statement--St. Patrick's Day 2001\n\n       The Friends of Ireland in the Congress join 44 million \n     Irish Americans in celebrating the unique ties between \n     America and the island of Ireland. We welcome the Taoiseach, \n     Bertie Ahern, to the United States, and we send warm \n     greetings to the President of Ireland, Mary McAleese.\n       We commend President Bush for expressing his willingness to \n     remain involved in the pursuit of peace in Northern Ireland. \n     The active engagement of President Clinton played an \n     instrumental role in advancing the peace process, and it is \n     vital that President Bush remain engaged.\n       The valuable work carried out by the new institutions set \n     up under the Good Friday Agreement demonstrates the capacity \n     of these institutions to contribute significantly to the \n     welfare of the people of Northern Ireland and throughout \n     Ireland. We call on all political representatives to develop \n     the potential of the new arrangements by operating them to \n     the full, under the rules, and in the spirit of the Agreement \n     and thereby to consolidate the institutions for which the\n\n[[Page S2383]]\n\n     people have voted and which they clearly want to see working \n     for the common benefit. We appeal to all parties to work \n     together to remove the remaining obstacles standing in the \n     way of the full achievement of this goal.\n       The Good Friday Agreement was endorsed by the people of \n     Ireland and Northern Ireland with majorities from both \n     communities. It provided a mandate to those working on behalf \n     of peace, justice, and the creating of a new beginning in \n     Northern Ireland. Its provisions are interdependent, and to \n     ensure the successful implementation of the Good Friday \n     Agreement, those provisions must be addressed concurrently.\n       In the past, dangerous political vacuums have been avoided \n     when all parties to the Good Friday Agreement have been \n     willing to make difficult political decisions and implement \n     confidence-building measures. We urge them to do so again.\n       We believe the Patten recommendations on police reform must \n     be fully implemented. We acknowledge that progress has been \n     made, but further steps must be taken to ensure that the \n     police service will be representative of all people in \n     Northern Ireland and have the support of the community it \n     serves. An inclusive and credible police service, which is \n     supported by nationalists and unionists, is in the interest \n     of everyone in Northern Ireland. Likewise, the criminal \n     justice system must be fair and impartial. It must be \n     responsive to the community's concerns, encourage community \n     involvement wherever possible, and have the confidence of all \n     parts of the community.\n       We also believe the British Government should scale back \n     its military presence in Northern Ireland, particularly in \n     South Armagh. The dismantlement of watchtowers and military \n     installations in Northern Ireland would represent a \n     significant confidence-building measure that would advance \n     the pursuit of peace.\n       We welcome the May 5, 2000 statement by the IRA that it \n     ``will initiate a process that will completely and verifiably \n     put IRA arms beyond use . . . in such a way as to avoid risk \n     to the public and misappropriation by others and ensure \n     maximum public confidence,'' and we welcome the IRA's recent \n     decision to reengage with the de Chastelain Commission on \n     decommissioning. The IRA's decision is a welcome first step, \n     and we hope it will pave the way for further action by all \n     parties. We urge the IRA to engage in meaningful dialogue \n     with the Commission and take tangible steps to put weapons \n     beyond use.\n       We also emphasize the importance of advancing human rights \n     and equality issues under the Good Friday Agreement, \n     including the creation of a Bill of Rights. Similarly, we \n     call for the establishment of independent inquiries into the \n     Finucane, Nelson, and Hamill cases, to demonstrate commitment \n     to human rights and accountability.\n       We commend the Irish and British Governments for their \n     ongoing efforts to work with the political leaders in \n     Northern Ireland and to advance the peace process in Northern \n     Ireland. On St. Patrick's Day, we urge all the leaders to \n     recognize the danger of delay and redouble efforts to fully \n     implement the Good Friday Agreement.\n       Friends of Ireland Executive Committee.\n       House: Dennis J.

Mr. President, I will be participating in the Habitat for \nHumanity ``House the Senate Built.'' We will be breaking ground March \n17th at 1:00 p.m. This home will be built for the Portillo family at \n1209 Raven Place in Loveland, Colorado. I am especially proud to be \nworking with the Loveland Habitat for Humanity chapter because Loveland \nis my hometown. In addition, the Loveland chapter has existed for 14 \nyears and, in that time, they have built 41 houses. Forty-one families \nthat may have never been in a position to own a home, are now \nhomeowners thanks to the Loveland chapter of Habitat for Humanity.\n  This is not my first involvement with Habitat for Humanity. During \nthe Republican Convention last year my wife Joan and I had the \nopportunity to work on a project with the Philadelphia chapter of \nHabitat. I have also participated in builds with Colorado affiliates in \nFort Morgan and in Loveland. This September Habitat International will \nbe celebrating their Silver Anniversary. Since its inception, Habitat \nhas built a total of 100,000 houses.\n  When I reflect on my vision of housing assistance, an old saying \ncomes to mind: ``If you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. If \nyou teach a man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime.'' I am especially \nsupportive of Habitat for Humanity because the way that they operate as \nan organization, fits this old saying perfectly. While Habitat homes \nare purchased by the individual homeowner families, corporations, faith \ngroups and others all provide financial support and assistance in \nbuilding the home, and the work is organized at the local level. \nInstead of relying solely on perennial handouts from the government, \nHabitat seeks out both private and community resources to form a \npartnership that results in homes for people who, otherwise, may not \nhave them. This approach works because people at the local level are \nbest equipped to know who needs assistance and are most familiar with \nthe way that local systems operate. Homeowner families are chosen by \nthe local Habitat affiliate according to their need; their ability to \nrepay the no-profit, no-interest mortgage; and their willingness to \nwork in partnership with Habitat. Each family is responsible for paying \nback their loan and participating in the building of their own home. \nAll of this indicates that Habitat is far more interested in helping \npeople to create a new life for themselves than they are in simply \nputting a roof over their heads. Put quite simply, Habitat is a very \neffective way to promote the American dream of home ownership.\n  On this same note, I would also like to talk for a moment about two \npeople that I hold in high esteem. The first person I would like to \nrecognize is someone whom I can say, with very little bias, is one of \nthe most wonderful women in the world: my wife Joan. She is someone who \noften seems tireless in her willingness to pitch in. This willingness \nwas exemplified again at the House the Senate Built. Now, as I said \nbefore, Joan has worked on several of the Habitat projects with me, and \nthis project was no exception. Just before the Senate members departed \nthe building site to return to the Capitol, many of us passed our \nhammers on to our spouses so that they could continue building into the \nafternoon. I was proud to be able to hand my hammer over to Joan. She \ncame home exhausted, but pleased with the progress that was made on the \nhome, which I understand was considerable. In fact, I am told that when \na crew member was walking back to the building site with several of the \nladies Joan warned him that ``now that the men are gone it's time for \nthe real work to begin.'' She then put in several hours in her hardhat \npounding nails, stuffing insulation and lending a hand wherever it was \nneeded.\n\n  The second is Colorado's first lady Frances Owens. She has made \nHabitat for Humanity projects a top priority since her husband was \nelected several years ago. She has participated in three builds within \nthe last few years and will now be host to a program called Women \nBuilding a Legacy. This program will take place May 5-11 in Montbello, \na suburb of Denver. Women Building a Legacy will be a blitz build that \nwill result in five houses in seven days. These homes will be a much \nneeded addition to the Montbello neighborhood where they are to be \nbuilt and I commend Mrs. Owens for her efforts.\n  Again, I say thank you to Habitat for Humanity for the services that \nthey provide to so many communities throughout America and the world, \nthank you to Frances Owens for the work that she does on behalf of \nHabitat and thank you to my wife Joan for always being willing to do \nwhat needs to be done for no bigger reason than because it needs to be \ndone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/15/senate-section/article/S2383-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2383-S2384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FOIA TURNS 35\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, James Madison said that if men were angels, \nno government would be necessary. But because people and governments \nare fallible, he added, ``experience has taught mankind the necessity \nof auxiliary precautions.'' The Freedom Of Information Act (FOIA), a \nmodern improvement in American government, has proved itself as a vital \nprecaution that has served the people well in defending their right to \nknow what their government is doing--or not doing. Friday is the 250th \nbirthday of James Madison and, appropriately, this is also the day that \nwe commemorate FOIA's 35th anniversary.\n  I am not sure that we could pass FOIA if it were offered in Congress \ntoday, but thank heaven it is firmly etched by now in our national \nculture. Just this month a unanimous U.S. Supreme Court affirmed FOIA's \nmandate of broad disclosure, noting that full agency disclosure would \n``help ensure an informed citizenry, vital to the functioning of a \ndemocratic society.''\n  FOIA may be an imperfect tool, but as one foreign journalist \nobserved, ``in\n\n[[Page S2384]]\n\nits klutzy way, it has become one of the slender pillars that make \nAmerica the most open of modern societies.''\n  In recent years records released under FOIA have revealed the \ngovernment's radiation experiments on human guinea pigs during the Cold \nWar, the evidence that the Food and Drug Administration had about \nheart-valve disease at the time it approved the Fen-Phen diet drug, the \nFederal Aviation Administration's concerns about ValuJet before the \n1996 crash in the Everglades, radiation contamination by a government-\nrun uranium processing plant on nearby recreation and wildlife areas in \nKentucky, the government's maltreatment of South Vietnamese commandos \nwho fought in a CIA-sponsored army in the early 1960's, the high \nsalaries paid to independent counsels, and the unsafe lead content of \ntap water in the nation's capital.\n  Five years ago we updated FOIA's charter with the Electronic Freedom \nof Information Act that I proposed as a way to bring the law into the \ninformation age, recognizing that technology is dramatically changing \nthe way government handles and stores information. The ``E-FOIA'' law \ndirects federal agencies to make the information in their computer \nfiles available to citizens on the same basis as that in conventional \npaper files. We also took this as an opportunity to encourage agencies \nto use technology and the Internet to make government more accessible \nand accountable to its customers, the citizens. For instance, we now \nhave the technology to translate government records into Braille \nor large print or synthetic speech for people with sight or hearing \nimpairments, and the new law promotes that. Electronic records also \nmake it possible to offer dial-up access to citizens over the Internet \nso they can have instant direct access to unclassified information \nstored in government computer banks. This is far easier for Vermonters \nthan having to travel to Washington to visit an agency's public reading \nroom. Information is a valuable commodity, and the federal government \nis the largest single producer and repository of data on topics ranging \nfrom agriculture to geography to labor statistics and the weather. \nBetter and timelier access to this information helps lubricate our \neconomy.\n\n  FOIA today is healthy, but only constant vigilance will keep Congress \nfrom needlessly whittling away its promise to the American people. We \nfought back one such effort last year, and new carve-out proposals are \nalready in the air.\n  FOIA gives each American the power to ask--and the government the \nobligation to answer--questions about official actions or inaction. We \ncan count on a government agency to tell us when it does something \nright, but we need FOIA to help tell us when it does something wrong. \nOf all the laws that fill our law libraries, none better than FOIA \nbreathes life into the first words in our Constitution, ``We the people \nof the United States'' and into our First Amendment rights to petition \nour government. This is a law to celebrate, to use, and to defend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/15/senate-section/article/S2384-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2384-S2385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             VETERANS EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE PRIORITIES\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, as I travel my state of South Dakota and \nmeet with veterans, I am reminded of the very core of what the Founding \nFathers meant when they talked about America's citizen soldiers who \nserve as the bulwark of defending our democracy and freedom. The \nsacrifices of the men and women who served this nation in time of war \nare a dramatic story that we need to tell to future generations.\n  We need to remind younger generations of the sacrifice of the quiet \nheroes who have served our nation in the military service. We need to \nremind them that freedom isn't really free. Throughout our nation's \nproud history, people have made profound sacrifices to preserve liberty \nand democracy.\n  I have had the privilege this past year of honoring the South \nDakotans who so bravely defended the seeds of democracy in the foreign \nsoil of Korea and remember those who fought and died for democracy. In \nceremonies across my state, I have had the honor of presenting the \nKorean War Service Medals as a long-overdue expression of gratitude \nfrom the American public and the South Korean government. It may have \ntaken 50 years for us to properly recognize these veterans for their \nsacrifices in Korea. But there is no time limit on their patriotism or \nour country's gratitude.\n  Unfortunately, it has also taken too long for our government to fully \nhonor the commitment made to our veterans for educational benefits and \nlifetime health care.\n  I am pleased to report that Congress has finally begun to honor \nadditional commitments made to veterans nationwide. We all know the \nhistory: for decades, men and women who joined the military were \npromised educational benefits and lifetime health care coverage for \nthemselves and their families. Many of the veterans we honor today were \ntold, in effect, ``If you disrupt your family, if you work for low pay, \nif you endanger your life and limb, our nation will in turn guarantee \nan opportunity for an education and lifetime health benefits.''\n  Those promises have too often not been kept, not only to our veterans \nbut also our military retirees, and that is threatening our national \nsecurity. Veterans are our nation's most effective recruiters. However, \ninadequate education benefits and poor health care options make it \ndifficult for these men and women to encourage the younger generation \nto serve in today's voluntary service. We are blessed to have \nunprecedented federal budget surpluses, and the only question is \nwhether veterans health care and educational benefits should be a \npriority instead of an afterthought.\n  Veterans from around the nation have been calling on Congress to \nprovide the VA with adequate funding to meet the health care needs for \nall veterans. Without additional funding, VA facilities will be unable \nto deliver the necessary health care services to our veterans \npopulation.\n  For a number of years, I have worked with veterans to increase flat-\nline appropriations for veterans' health care. Thanks to the grass \nroots efforts of veterans, we were successful two years ago in getting \na historic $1.7 billion increase for VA medical care. We fought last \nyear for another $1.4 billion increase. While these increases will help \nrelieve some of the VA's budgetary constraints, I believe that more \nneeds to be done to make up for those years of budgetary neglect, as \nwell as to keep pace with rising costs of health care.\n  Another priority for me this year will be to continue to improve \neducational benefits for veterans. The Montgomery GI Bill has been one \nof the most effective tools in recruiting and retaining the best and \nthe brightest in the military. It has also been a critical component in \nthe transition of veterans to civilian life. Unfortunately, the current \nGI Bill fails to keep pace with the rising costs of higher education. \nOn the first day of this legislative year, I joined Senator Susan \nCollins in introducing legislation to bring the GI Bill in the 21st \nCentury by creating a benchmark level of education benefits that \nautomatically covers inflation to meet the increasing costs of higher \neducation. Our concept is a very simple one: at the very least, GI Bill \nbenefits should be equal to the average cost of a commuter student \nattending a four-year university. Currently, less than one-half of the \nmen and women who contribute $1200 of their pay to qualify for the GI \nBill actually use these benefits.\n  The Veterans' Higher Education Opportunities Act--S. 131--has broad \nbipartisan support and the support of an unprecedented partnership of \nveterans groups and higher education organizations.\n  My bipartisan ``Keep Our Promises to America's Military Retirees \nAct'' called for the government to fulfill its obligation of lifetime \nhealth care for military retirees and their dependents. While I am \npleased that last year's enactment of the TRICARE-for-Life program \nbegins to address problems with military retiree health care, there is \nmore work that needs to be done.\n  In fact, a recent federal court of appeals ruling finally supported \nwhat we have been saying all along: that the government has not lived \nup to its contract with millions of military retirees who were told \nthey would receive lifetime health care in return for 20 years of \nservice in the military. That is why I am once again working with \nSenator\n\n[[Page S2385]]\n\nOlympia Snowe and Senator Jeff Bingaman to finish the job we started \nlast year and fulfill our country's commitment. Honoring our commitment \nto active duty personnel, military retirees, and veterans is of special \nimportance to me for a number of reasons. My oldest son, Brooks, \ncurrently serves in the Army and tells me firsthand how broken promises \nimpact the morale of active duty personnel and their families.\n  Finally, an issue that needs to be addressed this year is concurrent \nreceipt. I find it indefensible that our government forces men and \nwomen who fought for our country and are disabled as a result of it to \nchoose between retirement pay and disability compensation. This nickel-\nand-diming of our country's heroes must stop, and I recently joined \nSenator Harry Reid in introducing the Retired Pay Restoration Act of \n2001, S. 170. I am hopeful that we will be able to continue on the \nprogress made last year on Concurrent Receipt and finally make this \nlong-overdue correction for 437,000 disabled veterans nationwide.\n  Veterans are our country's heroes, and their selfless actions will \ninspire generations of Americans yet to come. Our country must honor \nits commitments to veterans, not only because it's the right thing to \ndo, but also because it's the smart thing to do. I consider myself \nfortunate to live in our democracy, and I am filled with a sense of \npatriotism each day as I travel to work and see the United States \nCapitol come into view. In this city that is filled with monuments to \nthe heroism of our Founding Fathers and the men and women who have \nserved to protect our freedoms, I pledge that I will continue to fight \nto make veterans issues a priority in Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/15/senate-section/article/S2385-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PRESIDENT BUSH'S NEW JERSEY VISIT\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, yesterday, I joined with my distinguished \ncolleague from New Jersey, Senator Toricelli, in welcoming the \nPresident of the United States to our State of New Jersey.\n  I was very pleased that the President decided to visit our State, and \nout of respect for him I decided to go to New Jersey to welcome him \npersonally. In my view, it is critical that members of both parties \nwork together in a positive and constructive way to address our \nNation's problems. Although the President and I disagree on a number of \nissues, I sincerely want to cooperate with him wherever possible to \nhelp the people of New Jersey and all Americans, and I appreciated the \nchance to spend some time with him.\n  Unfortunately, because I was in New Jersey with the President, I \nmissed a vote on the motion to table the Wyden amendment, No. 78. This \namendment would have made nondischargeable certain debts arising from \nthe exchange of electric energy in response to the recent crisis in \nCalifornia. If I had been present, I would have voted ``aye'' on the \nmotion to table. Like Senator Feinstein, I am concerned that by \ninterjecting ourselves into this issue and giving a priority to certain \ncreditors, we could trigger a rush to bankruptcy court that could force \nCalifornia utilities into bankruptcy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/15/senate-section/article/S2385-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVES TAX CREDIT\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, last week I met with South Dakota \nNational Guard Adjutant General Phil Killey and a group of about 30 men \nand women from the South Dakota Guard and Reserves. Almost every \ncommunity in our state benefits from the work of these Guardsmen and \nReservists. For example, Guard units helped clean up the debris from \nlast August's windstorm that hit Spearfish and Mitchell. Guard units in \nAberdeen and Brookings spearheaded city-wide clean up efforts, and \nsoldiers in Brookings even sponsored underprivileged children during \nthe holiday season. The Guard also was instrumental in fighting the \nJasper fire in the Black Hills last summer. The list goes on. From \nAberdeen to Yankton, the Guard and Reserves are active members of the \nSouth Dakota community.\n  In addition to the support the Guard and Reserves give to South \nDakota, they have also supported overseas operations including those in \nCentral America, the Middle East, Europe, and Asia. The South Dakota \nAir Guard is currently preparing for its mission later this year, where \nit will patrol the ``No-Fly Zone'' in Iraq.\n  Most South Dakotans know at least one of the 4,500 current members of \nthe South Dakota Guard and Reserves or the thousands of former \nGuardsmen and Reservists. Sometimes, the connection is even more \ndirect. Before joining the Army, my oldest son was a member of the \nSouth Dakota Army Guard in Yankton.\n  General Killey reported that South Dakota ranks third in the nation \nin the readiness of its Guard and Reserve units. South Dakota's units \nare also tops in the nation in the quality of its new recruits. I \ncommend the South Dakota Guard and Reserves for their continued \nexcellence. National rankings only confirm the quality that has come to \nbe expected of the Guard and Reserve of a great state.\n  However, recruiting and keeping the best of the best in the South \nDakota National Guard and Reserves is becoming more of a challenge as \nour military's operations tempo has remained high while the number of \nactive duty military forces has decreased. This tempo places \nsignificant pressure on members of the reserve component and those who \nemploy them as they experience greater training and participation \ndemands. That is why I am joining Senator Mike DeWine in introducing \ntargeted tax relief for Guardsmen, Reservists, and those who employ \nthem.\n  The legislation, called the Reserve Component Tax Assistance Act, \nwill allow Guardsmen and Reservists to claim deductions for travel, \nmeals, and lodging when they travel away from home and remain overnight \nto attend National Guard and Reserve meetings. A significant portion of \nthe Guard and Reserve in South Dakota must travel at least 40 miles for \ntraining and meetings.\n  The second part of this legislation gives their employers a tax \ncredit when the Reservists and Guardsmen are called up for a \ncontingency operation. Often, these men and women will be gone months \nin support of overseas military efforts, leaving employers in a \ndifficult position. This year the Air Guard will be deployed to Iraq, \nand members of the Army National Guard will be deployed to Bosnia next \nyear. Our bipartisan legislation helps to minimize the economic impact \nby giving a maximum tax credit per employee of $2000. Each employer \nwould be eligible for a maximum credit of $7500. This credit will help \nan estimated 1,100 to 1,300 businesses in our state who employ \nGuardsmen and Reservists.\n  Our legislation provides much needed tax relief to Guardsmen and \nReservists, and the employers who support them, and I will continue to \ndo all I can to support our National Guard and Reserves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/15/senate-section/article/S2385-3", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2385-S2386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nADDITIONAL STATEMETNS\n                                  ____\n\n                        NATIONAL GIRL SCOUT WEEK\n\n Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, this week marks the 89th \nanniversary of the founding of the Girl Scouts of America. What began \nwith a single troop of 12 girls in 1912 has grown into a 3.6 million \nmember organization. Missouri alone has nearly 100,000 members. Over \nthe last 89 years Girl Scouts of America has helped to instill in \ncountless girls strong values, a social conscience, and the conviction \nof their own potential and self- worth.\n  Earlier this week, I cosponsored a resolution to designate this week \nas National Girl Scout Week. I thank my colleagues for unanimously \npassing that resolution. The Girl Scouts of America has become a \nnational institution. The organization has held a Congressional charter \nfor more than 50 years, and spread to nearly every city in the nation. \nGirl Scouts learn to be, as the Girl Scout Law says, ``considerate, \ncaring, courageous and strong.'' They develop a strong sense of \ncommunity responsibility along with a sense of self worth. These girls \nserve as role models in their communities and become tomorrow's \nleaders.\n  Community service is a bedrock principal of the Girl Scouts. Every \nyear, each troop conducts a service project to assist their community. \nThe Girl Scout Council of Greater St. Louis is about to start their \nannual April Showers project. Every year they collect and\n\n[[Page S2386]]\n\ndistribute personal care items like shampoo, toothbrushes, and diapers \nto families in need throughout the area. Last year they collected \nnearly one million items, helping countless families.\n  On the other side of Missouri, Kara Dorsey, a member of Troop 706 in \nWarrensburg, recently won her Girl Scout Gold Award for creating a \nlibrary at the new Warrensburg Veteran's Home. Kara organized two \nfundraising events then purchased books, tapes and magazine \nsubscriptions with the proceeds. Because of Kara's work, the veterans \nin Warrensburg have a recreational and educational outlet they might \nnot have had otherwise.\n  Girl Scouts may be most famous for Thin Mints, Samoas and Tagalongs, \nbut those cookies are more than delicious snacks. Cookie sales teach \nthe scouts about money management, selling skills, and give the girls a \nchance to give back to their community. Junior Girl Scout Troop 59, in \nOdessa, Missouri, voted to give a percentage of the money it earned in \nJanuary to the House of Hope, a shelter for victims of domestic \nviolence. When someone asked Rachel Kopp, a member of the troop, why \nthey had donated the money, she said, ``It was the Girl Scout thing to \ndo.'' Indeed it is. That is what makes the Girl Scouts so unique. Girl \nScouts provide an environment where girls are challenged and guided to \nbecome capable, self-reliant, ethical women who make a difference.\n  On this, their anniversary, I want to thank the Girl Scouts of \nAmerica for enriching so many young lives, and once again thank my \ncolleges for unanimously calling for the recognition of National Girl \nScout Week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/15/senate-section/article/S2386-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY OF THE REV. AND MRS. BENJAMIN HOOKS\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, every day in towns and cities across \nAmerica, moms and dads, uncles and cousins, gather, in time-honored \ntradition, to celebrate the milestones of their lives--the births, \nbaptisms, and anniversaries that bind them together and make them one.\n  Perhaps the most cherished of these is the celebration of marriage \nbecause it is marriage, after all, that creates the first and most \nessential cell of human society--the family.\n  If they are blessed, Mr. President, these anniversary celebrations of \nmarriage include larger circles of friends and colleagues who recognize \nnot only the value of a special couple's commitment to each other, but \nalso the value of that commitment to all of us as the larger family of \nGod.\n  On March 24, 2001, in Memphis, Tennessee, Mr. President, such a \ngathering will occur, and it is in honor of that occasion that I rise \ntoday to pay special tribute to a special couple, the Rev. Benjamin \nHooks and his bride, Frances, who will celebrate 50 years as husband \nand wife.\n  Mr. President, this son of Memphis, is a man whose accomplishments as \na pioneer of the civil rights movement, a courageous leader of the \nSouthern Christian Leadership Conference and, more recently, as \nDirector of the NAACP are well-known to most Americans. Less known, \nperhaps, is his work as a public defender, the first African American \njudge in Tennessee elected since Reconstruction, an outspoken critic of \nmedia portrayals of minority stereotypes, and pastor of the Greater \nMiddle Baptist Church in Memphis where I have been honored to worship, \nand where both Benjamin and Frances have tirelessly dedicated \nthemselves to bringing the goodwill of the family to all society.\n  But as important as their public work is and has been, it is the \nprivate union of these two remarkable human beings that we honor \ntoday--their affection and devotion, their deep and lasting commitment \nand, most of all, the love that encompasses not only each other but all \nwho know them.\n  Mr. President, it is my honor and privilege to join with their \ndaughter, Patricia, their family, and all their many friends, in \ncongratulating the Rev. and Mrs. Benjamin Hooks on 50 years of \nmarriage. May the good Lord continue to bless them all the days of \ntheir lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/15/senate-section/article/S2386-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN MEMORY OF GINA PENNESTRI\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is with a combination of great \nsadness and great joy that I ask the Senate to pause briefly so that I \nmay share a little of the remarkable life of my dear friend and \nconfidante Gina Pennestri.\n  I first met Gina when she was working for my hero and former boss, \nCongressman John Burton. When John announced his decision to leave the \nHouse in 1982, I decided to run for his seat. I can say without \nhesitation that without Gina I never would have won my first election \nto Congress. In fact, it is almost certain that without Gina I would \nnot be here today as a U.S. Senator. After that first election she came \nto work for me and headed my district office until her retirement in \n1989. For these and all her other gifts, I will be forever in her debt.\n  Gina was born on September 30, 1923 in Washington, DC. In retrospect, \nthis makes perfect sense. She always seemed to have been born into \npolitics. She attended George Washington University and became active \nlocally advocating for voting rights for District residents. She began \nher long career in public service during World War II conducting \nemployee relations for civilian employees stationed overseas. After the \nWar she assisted with the Berlin Airlift working to assure that \nmedical, food and other supplies got to those who needed them.\n  Gina moved to San Francisco in 1951, where she began at once to raise \na family and more than one ruckus. From her first days in the City \nuntil her very last, Gina was known for her community spirit and \nactivism. Over the years she worked to protect open space, to achieve \ncivil rights, to end the war in Vietnam and so much more. Gina could be \ntough. She believed deeply in the inherent worth of all people, and \nworked especially hard to protect those less fortunate. She was that \nall-to-rare person whose depth of compassion was matched by an astute \npolitical mind. When it came to fighting for what was right, she let \nnothing and no one stand in the way. Her example inspires me to this \nday.\n  A thorn in the side to a few, she was deeply beloved by countless \nmore. And to those who knew her best she was more than just an ally or \nfriend, she was a member of the family. When Gina let you into her life \nyou were there for keeps. Her loyalty was legendary, and her wisdom \nhelped me navigate many difficulties, both in my professional and \nprivate life. My family and I will miss her tremendously. Our thoughts \nand prayers are with her son Marc, his wife Nancy and their children \nLaura and Daniel, to all of whom Gina was deeply devoted.\n  So today, I stand before you full of tremendous sorrow over the loss \nof a true friend and partner. But through the process of remembering \nGina and her time among us, I am also filled with tremendous joy--joy \nthat I was so fortunate to have met her and shared in her generous \ngifts and spirit. It comforts me to know that although she is gone, \nthese will most assuredly live on in the many lives she \ntouched.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/15/senate-section/article/S2386-3", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/15/senate-section/article/S2386-4", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/15/senate-section/article/S2386-5", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2386-S2387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:32 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it: requests the concurrence of \nthe Senate:\n\n       H.R. 327.

A bill to provide for infant crib safety, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation \ndesigned to eliminate injuries and deaths that result from crib \naccidents.\n  While there are strict guidelines on the manufacture and sale of new \ncribs, there are still 25 to 30 million unsafe cribs sold throughout \nthe U.S. in ``secondary markets,'' such as thrift stores and resale \nfurniture stores. These cribs should be taken off the market, and \neither made safe, or destroyed.\n  There are a number of reasons why unsafe cribs should be taken off \nthe market.\n  Each year, at least 50 children ages two and under die from injuries \nsustained in cribs. That is almost one child a week.\n  The number of deaths from crib incidents exceeds deaths from all \nother nursery products combined.\n  Over 12,000 children are hospitalized each year as a result of \ninjuries sustained in cribs.\n  To illustrate the need for this legislation, I want to share with you \nthe story of Danny Lineweaver.\n  At the age of 23 months, Danny was injured during an attempt to climb \nout of his crib. Danny caught his shirt on a decorative knob on the \ncornerpost of his crib and hanged himself.\n  Though his mother was able to perform CPR the moment she found him, \nDanny lived in a semi-comatose state for nine years and died in 1993. \nThis injury and subsequent death could have been prevented.\n  Since Danny's accident, we have passed laws mandating safety \nstandards for the manufacture of new cribs. But this is not enough.\n  There are nearly four million infants born in this country each year, \nbut only one million new cribs sold. As many as half of all infants are \nplaced in secondhand, hand-me-down, or heirloom cribs, cribs that are \nsold in thrift stores or resale furniture stores. These cribs may be \nunsafe, and may in fact threaten the life of the infants placed in \nthem.\n  This legislation requires thrift stores and retail furniture stores \nto remove decorative knobs on the cornerposts of cribs before selling \nthose cribs.\n  Additionally, the bill prohibits hotels and motels from providing \nunsafe cribs to guests, or risk being fined up to $1,000.\n  The Infant Crib Safety Act makes the sale of used, unsafe cribs \nillegal. I hope my colleagues will join me in putting a stop to \npreventable injuries and deaths resulting from unsafe cribs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Warner, Mr. Levin, Mr. McCain, \n        Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Helms, Mr. Miller, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. \n        Cleland, Mr. Inhofe, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Allard, Mr. Allen, Mr. \n        Cochran, Ms. Collins, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inouye, \n        Mr. Johnson, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. \n        Thurmond, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Sessions, and Mr. Lott).\n  S. 540. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow as \na deduction in determining adjusted gross income the deduction for \nexpenses in connection with services as a member of a reserve component \nof the Armed Forces of the United States, to allow employers a credit \nagainst income tax with respect to employees who participate in the \nmilitary reserve components, and to allow a comparable credit for \nparticipating reserve component self-employed individuals, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my distinguished \ncolleagues, including Senators Warner, Levin, McCain, Lieberman, Helms, \nMiller, Hutchinson from Arkansas, Cleland, Inhofe, and Landrieu, to \nintroduce the ``Reserve Component Tax Assistance Act of 2001.''\n  We are introducing this bill today because it represents one way we \ncan help retain the brave men and women who serve in our military's \nGuard and reserve components. Our bill would offer much-needed support \nfor them and their families by restoring a tax deduction to our \nreservists for travel expenses incurred getting to and from duty \nassignments. The bill also would provide a tax credit to employers who \nsupport employees serving in the reserve component.\n  As my colleagues are well aware, the security of our nation hinges on \nall the men and women who serve in uniform, both active duty and \nreserves. That became very clear a decade ago, when members of our \nactive duty and reserve forces came together to drive Saddam Hussein \nand the Iraqi Republican Guard out of Kuwait. Operation Desert Storm \nwas one of the largest and most successful military operations since \nthe inception of the all-volunteer force of the early 1970's. Its \nsuccess was due in large part to the efforts of reserve component \npersonnel. Since then, our reservists and Guardsmen and women have \ncontributed in every U.S. military and humanitarian operation.\n  This increased reliance on our reserve personnel came at a time when \nU.S. military forces were downsizing in response to the ``peace \ndividend'' linked to the collapse of the Soviet Union and the fall of \nthe Berlin Wall. Despite the end of the Cold War, the tempo of our \nmilitary's operations remains at a steady beat. In fact, the military's \ndependence on our reservists and Guardsmen and women has remained at \nnear Gulf War levels. The military has placed greater training and \nparticipation demands on our reservists, taking them away from family \nand civilian employment.\n  This increased demand does not occur without cost, particularly \nfinancial costs to our reserve military components and their full time \nemployers. The bill we are introducing today is an attempt to provide \nsome additional compensation for these dedicated men and women. It is a \nsmall step, but one that is necessary. I urge my colleagues to support \nour bill and demonstrate our commitment to supporting the proud and \ndedicated reservists, Guardsmen and women, and employers who play such \na pivotal role in our national defense. I am pleased that this \nlegislation already has the support of the Reserve Officers \nAssociation, the National Guard Association, the Military Coalition, \nand the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 540\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve foreign language instruction; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing The Foreign \nLanguage Acquisition and Proficiency Improvement Act of 2001. It is a \nbill which makes changes in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nthat encourage and make possible the teaching of a second language to \nstudents in elementary and secondary schools, in particular, those \nschools heavily impacted by the unique problems of educating a high \npopulation of disadvantaged students.\n  My bill also provides schools an incentive to initiate foreign \nlanguage programs, promotes technology, distance learning, and other \ninnovative activities in the effective instruction of a foreign \nlanguage.\n  According to the Center for Applied Linguistics in Washington, D.C., \nthe early study of a second language offers many benefits for students: \nacademic achievement, positive attitudes toward diversity; flexibility \nin thinking; sensitivity to language; and a better ear for listening \nand pronunciation. Foreign language study also improves children's \nunderstanding of their native language, increases creativity, helps \nstudents get better SAT scores, and increases their job opportunities.\n  The evidence shows that children who learn foreign languages score \nhigher in all academic subjects than those who speak only English. Most \ndeveloped countries recognize this and, according to the National \nForeign Language Center, the United States is alone in not teaching \nforeign languages routinely before the age of twelve.\n  In 1999, the Center for Applied Linguistics released the results of a \nU.S. Department of Education funded survey of foreign language teaching \nin preschool through twelfth grade in the United States. The results \nshow a rising awareness and increase in the teaching of foreign \nlanguages, but in the 31 percent of elementary schools that offered \nforeign language instruction, only 21 percent had proficiency as the \ngoal of the program. Among the most frequently cited problems facing \nforeign language programs were inadequate funding, inadequate in-\nservice teacher training, teacher shortages and a lack of sequencing \nfrom elementary to secondary school.\n  This survey is a good snapshot of the state of the teaching of \nforeign languages K-12 in our country. It can be read as encouraging: \nthat we know we should be teaching languages earlier; that more schools \nare attempting to teach foreign languages; and, that more languages are \nbeing taught. It also clearly shows where we need improvement: that we \nneed to show accomplishment in teaching our students foreign languages; \nthat more schools need to have the resources to offer the necessary \ncourse work for attaining this skill; and, that foreign languages \nshould be a priority.\n  The picture hasn't changed dramatically in the last two years.\n  Last year, I chaired hearings of the Governmental Affairs \nSubcommittee on International Security, Proliferation, and Federal \nServices which examined the relationship between foreign language \npreparedness and national security.\n  These are some of the things we learned about foreign language \nlearning at those hearings:\n  The most attainable skill students can acquire for likely college \nadmission is foreign language proficiency;\n  The best predictor of foreign language proficiency in college is \nprevious foreign language training, even if in another language;\n  There are not enough foreign language teachers. For example, Fairfax \nCounty, Virginia schools have an agreement with the Education Ministry \nin Spain, which provided at least five Spanish language teachers last \nyear. In Mississippi, it is not unusual to be taught French or German \nby distance learning, using live video transmission in classrooms \naround the state.\n  The earlier one begins to learn any language, the quicker he or she \nwill become proficient and sound like a native speaker.\n  And, as to how foreign language acquisition relates to national \nsecurity, it was clear from the testimony of representatives from the \nCIA, FBI, Department of Defense, and the State Department, that:\n\n  There is a continuing need for highly proficient speakers of many \nlanguages for surveillance, reconnaissance, negotiations and other \ndefense and intelligence gathering activities;\n  The federal government spends up to $70,000 to train one person in a \nlanguage as common as Spanish;\n  Recruiting for language specialists includes attracting current \nteachers;\n  Language learning, especially in sensitive government positions, best \nincludes experience in the mother tongue country. This enhances \ncultural understanding, colloquialisms and other language usage that \ncannot be approximated in a classroom.\n  Another fact is that America's businesses need foreign language \nspeakers. According to a USA TODAY survey, top executives cited foreign \nlanguage skills twice as great as any other skill in demand.\n  The National Foreign Language Center published a 1999 report titled, \nLanguage and National Security for the 21st Century: The Federal Role \nin Supporting National Language Capacity. This report is very \ncompelling in its review of the need for military and civilian \npersonnel with foreign language capability. It explains that the \nlanguage training business is estimated to be $20 billion \ninternationally. That is money spent by our government, our businesses \nand individuals to teach adults a skill essential in the global \nrelationships of industry, diplomacy, defense, and higher education.\n  The evidence of need is great, and yet there is a lack of sufficient \nforeign language training at the K-12 level. We have one program in the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act aimed at providing incentives \nand giving grants to schools for this purpose.\n  I am happy that we've been successful in raising the funding for this \nprogram from $5 million in 1998 to $14 million in FY 2001. However, the \nsection of this law providing grants to schools that already offer \nforeign language instruction programs has never been funded. A \nfrustrating aspect of this good program is that the schools in the most \nneed of the assistance can't afford the ante. My amendments establish a \n50 percent set-aside for schools serving the most disadvantaged \nstudents, and eliminates the matching share requirement for those \nschools. This bill also increases the annual authorization for the \nprogram from $55,000,000 to $75,000,000.\n  I hope that we will give greater attention to this program when we \nmake funding decisions, so that schools without the advantages of \nplentiful resources can provide their students with a high quality and \ncompetitive education.\n  The Foreign Language Acquisition and Proficiency Improvement Act will \nprovide new opportunities and encouragement to our school children, \nteachers, and parents, so we can better meet our global business \nchallenges and national security needs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD.\n  S. 542. A bill to amend the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United \nStates to provide separate subheadings for hair clippers used for \nanimals; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that would \nmake a simple correction to our Harmonized Tariff Schedule creating a \nseparate subheading for hair clippers used for animals.\n  The United States has been engaged in an on-going dispute with the \nEuropean Union, EU, over the EU's refusal to import hormone-treated \nbeef from the U.S. In reaction to the EU's failure to comply with a WTO \nruling that found that this ban on treated beef has been harmful to the \nU.S. economy, the United States Trade Representative issued a list of \nproducts on which retaliatory duties of 100 percent would be levied. \nPursuant to Section 407 of the Trade and Development Act of 2000, the \nproducts designated for retaliatory duties must be related to the \nindustries that are affected by the EU's non-compliance with the WTO \ndecision.\n  One of the many products included on the Trade Representative's list \nis hair clippers. However, no distinction\n\n[[Page S2393]]\n\nis made between those clippers used for animals and those used for \nhumans, specifically, beard trimmers. Since both types of clippers are \ngrouped within the same subheading under the Harmonized Tariff \nSchedule, human beard trimmers could potentially be subject to 100 \npercent duties. Yet, the personal care industry and beard trimmers have \nno relationship to the current beef-hormone dispute as is required by \nSection 407.\n  In an effort to prevent this inadvertent application of duties on \nbeard trimmers, the bill I am introducing would provide a separate \nsubheading for clippers used by animals. I believe that this simple \nclarification will ensure the fair application of our trade laws and \nprovide safeguards to U.S. companies and consumers from the unintended \nconsequences resulting from these types of trade disputes. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in supporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Specter, Mr. \n        Kennedy, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Reed, Mr. Reid, \n        Mr. Warner, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. \n        Johnson):\n  S. 543. A bill to provide for equal coverage of mental health \nbenefits with respect to health insurance coverage unless comparable \nlimitations are imposed on medical and surgical benefits; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today with great pleasure and \nexcitement to introduce the ``Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act of \n2001.'' I would also like to thank Senator Wellstone for once again \njoining me to cosponsor this important piece of legislation.\n  The human brain is the organ of the mind and just like the other \norgans of our body, it is subject to illness.\n  And just as we must treat illnesses to our other organs, we must also \ntreat illnesses of the brain.\n  Building upon that, I would ask the following question: what if \nthirty years ago our nation had decided to exclude heart disease from \nhealth insurance coverage?\n  Think about some of the wonderful things we would not be doing today \nlike angioplasty, bypasses, and valve replacements and the millions of \npeople helped because insurance covers these procedures.\n  I would submit these medical advances have occurred because insurance \ndollars have followed the patient through the health care system. The \npresence of insurance dollars has provided an enticing incentive to \ntreat those individuals suffering from heart disease.\n  But sadly, those suffering from a mental illness do not enjoy those \nsame benefits of treatment and medical advances because all too often \ninsurance discriminates against illnesses of the brain.\n  Individuals suffering from a mental illness face this discrimination \neven though medical science is in an era where we can accurately \ndiagnose mental illnesses and treat those afflicted so they can be \nproductive.\n  I simply do not understand, why with this evidence would we not cover \nthese individuals and treat their illnesses like any other disease?\n  There simply should not be a difference in the coverage provided by \ninsurance companies for mental health benefits and medical benefits, \nmerely because an individual suffers from a mental illness.\n  The introduction of our Bill marks a historic opportunity for us to \ntake the next step towards mental health parity. The timing of our Bill \nis even more important because the landmark Mental Health Parity Act of \n1996 will sunset on September 30 of this year.\n  As my colleagues know, this is an issue I have a long involvement \nwith and I would like to begin with a few observations.\n  I believe that we have made great strides in providing parity for the \ncoverage of mental illness. However, mental illness continues to exact \na heavy toll on many, many lives.\n  Even though we know so much more about mental illness, it can still \nbring devastating consequences to those it touches; their families, \ntheir friends, and their loved ones. These individuals and families not \nonly deal with the societal prejudices and suspicions hanging on from \nthe past, but they also must contend with unequal insurance coverage.\n  I would submit the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 is a good first \nstart, but the Act is also not working. While there may adherence to \nthe letter of the law, there are certainly violations of the spirit of \nthe law. For instance, ways are being found around the law by placing \nlimits on the number of covered hospital days and outpatient visits.\n  That is why I believe it is time for a change.\n  Some will immediately say we cannot afford it or that inclusion of \nthis treatment will cost too much. But, I would first direct them to \nthe results of the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996. That law contains \na provision allowing companies to no longer comply if their costs \nincrease by more than one percent.\n\n  And do you know how many companies have opted out because their costs \nhave increased by more than one percent? Less than ten companies \nthroughout our entire country.\n  With that in mind I would like to share a couple of facts about \nmental illness with my colleagues:\n  Within the developed world, including the United States, 4 of the 10 \nleading causes of disability for individuals over the age of five are \nmental disorders.\n  In the order of prevalence the disorders are major depression, \nschizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder.\n  Disability always has a cost and the direct cost to the United States \nper year for respiratory disease is $99 billion, cardiovascular disease \nis $160 billion, and finally $148 billion for mental illness.\n  One in every five people, more than 40 million adults, in this Nation \nwill be afflicted by some type of mental illness.\n  Nearly 7.5 million children and adolescents, or 12 percent, suffer \nfrom one or more mental disorders.\n  Schizophrenia alone is 50 times more common than cystic fibrosis, 60 \ntimes more common than muscular dystrophy and will strike between 2 and \n3 million Americans.\n  Let us also look at the efficacy of treatment for individuals \nsuffering from certain mental illnesses, especially when compared with \nthe success rates of treatments for other physical ailments. For a long \ntime, many who are in this field, especially on the insurance side, \nhave behaved as if you get far better results for angioplasty than you \ndo for treatments for bipolar illness.\n  Treatment for bipolar disorders, that is, those disorders \ncharacterized by extreme lows and extreme highs, have an 80 percent \nsuccess rate if you get treatment, both medicine and care. \nSchizophrenia, the most dreaded of mental illnesses, has a 60-percent \nsuccess rate in the United States today if treated properly. Major \ndepression has a 65 percent success rate.\n  Lets compare those success rates to several important surgical \nprocedures that everybody thinks we ought to be doing:\n  Angioplasty has a 41-percent success rate.\n  Atherectomy has a 52-percent success rate.\n\n  I would now like to take a minute to discuss the Mental Health \nEquitable Treatment Act of 2001. The Bill seeks a very simple goal: \nprovide the same mental health benefits already enjoyed by Federal \nemployees.\n  The Bill is modeled after the mental health benefits provided through \nthe Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, FEHBP, and expands the \nMental Health Parity Act of 1996 to prohibit a group health plan from \nimposing treatment limitations or financial requirements on the \ncoverage of mental health benefits unless comparable limitations are \nimposed on medical and surgical benefits.\n  Our Bill provides full parity for all categories of mental health \nconditions listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental \nDisorders, Fourth Edition, DSM IV, with coverage being contingent on \nthe mental health condition being included in an authorized treatment \nplan, the treatment plan is in accordance with standard protocols, and \nthe treatment plan meets medical necessity determination criteria.\n  Like the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996, the Bill does not require \na health\n\n[[Page S2394]]\n\nplan to provide coverage for alcohol and substance abuse benefits. \nMoreover, the Bill does not mandate the coverage of mental health \nbenefits, rather the Bill only applies if the plan already provides \ncoverage for mental health benefits.\n  In conclusion, the Bill provides mental heath benefits on par with \nthose already enjoyed by Federal employees and I would urge my \ncolleagues to support this important piece of legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a summary of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 543\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my colleague \nfrom New Mexico once again to introduce a bill for fairness in health \ncoverage for those with mental illness. The Mental Health Equitable \nTreatment Act of 2001 will take the critical next steps to ensure that \nprivate health insurance companies provide the same level of coverage \nfor mental illness as they do for other diseases. This bill will be a \nmajor step toward ending the discrimination against people who suffer \nfrom mental illness.\n  In 1996, I was proud to introduce the Mental Health Parity Act, a law \nwhich broke new ground, placing mental health alongside other medical \nand surgical coverage for parity in insurance coverage. Although the \n1996 bill was limited to parity in annual and lifetime limits in care, \nthe message was clear: there is no place for discrimination against \nthose with mental illness. Since the Mental Health Parity Act became \nlaw, we have seen that the costs have remained low and manageable, but, \nunfortunately, we have also seen that employers and insurance companies \nhave taken advantage of the gaps that remain in coverage for mental \nillness. Patients have faced increases in copayment and deductible \ncosts, more problems in gaining access to care, fewer approvals for \nhospital stays and outpatient days, and refusals to cover care. The \nsuffering of people with mental illness has grown, and the time to end \nthis discrimination is now.\n  For too long, mental illness has been stigmatized as a character \nflaw, rather than as the serious disease that it is. As a result, \npeople with mental illness are often ashamed and afraid to seek \ntreatment, for fear that they will lose their jobs or friends; for fear \nthat people will not recognize the suffering that they endure; for fear \nthat they will not be able to receive help. We have all seen portrayals \nof mentally ill people as somehow different, as dangerous, or as \nfrightening. Such stereotypes only reinforce the biases against people \nwith mental illness. Can you imagine this type of portrayal of someone \nwho has a cardiac problem, or who happens to carry a gene that \npredisposes them to diabetes? And yet, we have all known someone with a \nserious mental illness, within our families or our circle of friends, \nor in public life. Many people have courageously come forward to speak \nabout their personal experiences with their illness, to help us all \nunderstand better the effects of this illness on a person's life, the \nways in which effective treatments have helped them, or, sadly, the \nways in which a loved one died through suicide as a result of untreated \nmental illness. I commend those who speak out on this issue, for their \nhonesty and courage to come forward about their experiences, to help \nthe world to understand the reality of this disease.\n  The statistics concerning mental illness, and the state of health \ncare coverage for adults and children with this disease are startling, \nand disturbing. A watershed in our understanding of the impact of \nmental disorders is the 1996 Global Burden of Disease, GBD, study, \nconducted for the World Bank and World Health Organization by experts \nat Harvard University. The GBD defined a very useful concept, called \nthe Disability Adjusted Life Year, DALY, which refers to healthy years \nof life lost to either disability or premature mortality. Based on this \nmeasure of disease burden, mental disorders--which are prevalent \nworldwide, often begin early in life, and frequently are characterized \nby recurrent episodes, as in depression, or chronicity, as in \nschizophrenia, produce a disproportionate share of DALYs, much of which \nis due to the disabling nature of mental illness. According to the GBD \nstudy, in the U.S. and throughout the developed world, depression is \nthe leading cause of disability, and three other mental disorders are \namong the top ten causes of disability, bipolar disorder, \nschizophrenia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.\n  The National Institute of Mental Health, a NIH research institute \nwithin the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, describes \nserious depression as an extremely critical public health problem. More \nthan 18 million people in the United States will suffer from a \ndepressive illness this year, and many will be unnecessarily \nincapacitated for weeks or months, because their illness goes \nuntreated. The cost to the nation is in the billions of dollars. The \nsuffering of depressed people and their families is immeasurable.\n  The situation is worse for children. The 1998 Surgeon General's \nReport on Mental Health estimates that between 5 and 9 percent of those \nunder age 18 have mental disorders so severe that they face \noverwhelming difficulties in their efforts to function well with their \nfamilies, friends, and teachers. For children, mental illness carries a \ndouble burden: both the suffering of the disorder itself, as well as \nthe lost period of healthy learning and social development needed to \nhelp children live up to their potential. The recent tragic episodes of \nviolence in our schools remind us that inadequately treated emotional \nand behavioral disorders in our children can literally have lethal \nconsequences in terms of suicide and murder.\n  Our investment in mental health research is paying off well. We know \nso much more now about brain disease, behavioral and emotional \ndisorders, and treatment. But without access to care, such treatments \ncannot help those who are suffering from mental illness. We know from \nNIH-funded research that available medications and psychological \ntreatments, alone or in combination, can help 80 percent of those with \ndepression. But without adequate treatment, future episodes of \ndepression may continue or worsen in severity. Yet, the steady decline \nin the quality and breadth of health care coverage is truly disturbing.\n  The inequities related to the status of mental disorders in health \ninsurance is indisputable. The U.S. General Accounting Office issued a \nreport in May, 2000, that verified that despite passage of the 1996 \nmental health parity law, 14 percent of employers failed to comply with \neven the limited protections required by that law. Of the 86 percent \nthat did comply, most (87%) continued to limit their mental health \nbenefits, thus violating the spirit, if not the letter, of the law. In \nother words, the majority of employers who claim to provide mental \nhealth benefits restrict actual care through limitations on coverage or \naccess, or by increasing the cost to the patient. And they do this \ndespite the fact that costs are low. According to most reports on \nparity, including the most recent analysis requested by Congress from \nthe National Advisory Mental Health Council, when mental health \ncoverage is managed appropriately, premium increases can be as low as 1 \npercent.\n\n  Yet inequities in coverage continue, despite the 1996 law and the \nnumerous state laws that have tried without success to finally put an \nend to this health care discrimination. The discrimination continues \ndespite the fact that there is no biomedical justification for \ndifferentiating serious mental illness\n\n[[Page S2396]]\n\nfrom other serious and potentially chronic disorders, nor for judging \nmental disorders to be in any way less real or less deserving of \ntreatment. What does exist and continues to grow is an extensive body \nof rigorous research that has demonstrated that treatment for mental \ndisorders is both precise and cost-effective.\n  Although the costs for coverage have been shown to be low, the \nconsequences of untreated mental illness in our society are very \nserious and far-reaching--especially when one looks at how it affects \nindividuals, families, employers, corporations, social service systems, \nand criminal justice systems. I have seen first hand in the juvenile \ncorrections system what happens when mental illness is criminalized, \nwhen youth with mental illness are incarcerated for exhibiting symptoms \nof their illness. To treat ill people as criminals is outrageous and \nimmoral. We must make treatment for this illness as available and as \nroutine as treatment for any other disease. The discrimination must \nstop.\n  The Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act of 2001 is modeled after \nthe Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan, and provides full parity for \nall categories of mental health conditions. Group health plans would be \nprohibited from imposing treatment limitations, including restricting \nnumbers of visits or covered hospital days, or financial requirements, \nsuch as higher copayments, that are different from other medical/\nsurgical benefits. This bill is a major step forward in coverage for \nmental illness by private health insurers. It does not require that \nmental health benefits be part of a health benefits package, but \nestablishes a requirement for parity in coverage for those plans that \noffer mental health benefits. This bill goes a long way toward our \nbipartisan goal: that mental illness be treated like any other disease \nin health care coverage.\n  The Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act of 2001 is designed to take \na large step toward ending the suffering of those with mental illness \nwho have been unfairly discriminated against in their health coverage. \nThe time to pass this bill is now.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join Senator \nDomenici and Senator Wellstone in introducing the Mental Health \nEquitable Treatment Act of 2001. This Act is an important step in the \nfight to end the stigma against mental illness and ensure that those \nsuffering from mental illness receive the services they need. For too \nlong, individuals with mental disorders have faced unfair treatment \nrestrictions and paid more for the services they need than have \nindividuals requiring medical or surgical services.\n  The groundbreaking report on mental health that the Surgeon General \nreleased last year reveals that disproportionate cost-sharing \nrequirements and treatment limitations ``reduce appropriate use, of \nmental health services,'' and ``leave people to bear catastrophic costs \nthemselves.''\n  The Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act aims to halt these \ntroubling trends by ensuring that group health plans treat mental \nhealth benefits the same way they do medical and surgical benefits.\n  In 1996, we enacted the Mental Health Parity Act. While this \nimportant legislation made progress in advancing the fair treatment of \nindividuals with mental illness, it did not go far enough in providing \ntrue protection for all people suffering from mental disorders.\n  The Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act of 2001 improves upon this \nearlier legislation by providing full parity for a broad range of \nmental health disorders. Under the Act, group health plans must limit \nthe treatment restrictions and financial requirements that they impose \nfor mental health benefits to the same level that they set for medical \nor surgical benefits. Co-payments for office visits must be comparable, \nfor example, regardless of whether the office is a physician's or a \npsychiatrist's. While the Act does not apply to group health plans that \ndo not provide any mental health benefits or that have 25 employees or \nless, it is a critical step in ending the blatant discrimination that \npeople with mental disorders face in trying to obtain necessary and \naffordable treatment.\n  As we have learned more about the brain and the way it works, we have \ndeveloped promising treatments that can significantly improve the \nhealth of individuals with mental illness and help them lead productive \nlives. Success rates for treating mental illnesses are now as high as \n80 percent. Without strong parity legislation, however, these effective \ntreatments will remain elusive for the millions of individuals who need \nthem.\n  The Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act will finally help these \nindividuals receive the care they need by eliminating one of the \nbiggest barriers to care, cost. I strongly encourage my colleagues to \nsupport this groundbreaking piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS (for himself, Mr. Bond, Mr. Craig, and Mr. Thomas):\n  S. 544. A bill to amend the Federal Meat Inspection Act to provide \nthat a quality grade label issued by the Secretary of Agriculture may \nnot be used for imported meat food products; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to sponsor a bill on an issue \nof great importance to my state and to the entire livestock industry. \nThe subject is that of restricting the quality USDA Grade Stamp to only \nU.S. livestock products. It would prohibit foreign meat from coming \ninto America and unfairly receiving the USDA Grade Stamp.\n  This language offered today, will insure that all meat products \nimported from foreign countries will not be allowed to use the USDA \nGrade. For years, other countries have used the USDA Grade Stamp to \ntheir advantage, and to the disadvantage of our own producers. \nHistorically, Canada and Mexico have shipped livestock into the United \nStates, and by doing so they have reaped the benefits of the premium \ngiven by USDA for our labeled grades.\n  USDA Prime and USDA Choice grades are given a premium price in the \nmarketplace. By allowing foreign countries to compete using our grade \nlabels, American livestock producers are effectively prevented from \nreceiving a premium for something that should belong solely to them.\n  Agricultural producers from across our borders ship livestock to the \nUnited States, and feed them for a short period of time in order to \nbypass current restrictions. The animals are then slaughtered here as a \nUnited States product. This is not only unfair, but it is a betrayal of \ntrust that our producers have placed in the system. It is one that \nAmerican producers should not have to tolerate. My bill provides for a \n90 day feeding period to prevent this from happening, yet maintains the \nprofits lightweight cattle from foreign countries bring to American \nfeeders.\n  The huge influx of imports from both Canada and Mexico, that American \nagricultural producers are currently faced with, has provided an added \nhardship to the agricultural economy. This is one obstacle that could \neasily be remedied by this legislation.\n  When consumers see the USDA Grade Stamp on meat, most assume that \nthey are buying a U.S. raised product. Even though imported carcasses \nare required to have a ``foreign origin mark,'' it is trimmed off prior \nto retail sales for marketing purposes. This is very misleading for our \nconsumers.\n  This bill will protect both the American producer and the American \nconsumer. If the Grade Stamp is reserved exclusively for U.S. products, \nwe eliminate the disadvantage American producers face in competing with \nimported meats. We would also be ensuring that American consumers know \nthat the meat they purchase, is the top quality American product they \nhave always assumed they were buying. Producers and consumers alike \ndeserve to know that the USDA grade label really means what it says, \nproduced in the U.S.\n  This bill would also help assure the American consumer that the meat \nthey are eating is disease free, something that our friends in Europe \nare truly concerned about right now.\n  I am proud and pleased to sponsor this bill, and I look forward to \nmoving it through the process so we may insure that Americans truly \nhave the opportunity to use what is theirs and theirs alone, the USDA \nGrade.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S2397]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 544\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to redesignate the Federal Old-Age and Survivors \nInsurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund as \nthe Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Accounting Fund and the \nFederal Disability Insurance Accounting Fund, respectively; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a simple, but \nessential bill that would change the name of the Social Security Trust \nFunds to the Social Security Accounting Funds. It is my honor to have \nCongressman DeMint introducing an identical measure in the House of \nRepresentatives today.\n  It is time for us to talk straight to Americans about the Social \nSecurity program. When they see and hear ``Trust Fund'', it makes them \nbelieve that their retirement money is sitting in a bank vault safe and \nsound. However, the truth is precisely the opposite.\n  Payroll tax revenues for the Social Security program in excess of \nwhat is needed to pay Social Security benefits, are deposited into the \ngovernment's general funds as part of the U.S. Treasury. They are \naccounted for through the issuance of federal securities to the Social \nSecurity ``trust funds''. However, the trust funds themselves do not \nhold the money; they are simply accounts.\n  This legislation would accurately designate the Social Security \nprogram funds as accounting funds not trust funds.\n  Additionally, I would like to take this opportunity to once again \nremind my colleagues of the precarious financial condition of the \nentire Social Security system and the urgent need for a serious, \nbipartisan effort to reform and revitalize this cornerstone of many \nAmericans' retirement planning.\n  The only way to achieve real reform of the Social Security system is \nto work together in a bipartisan manner. It's time to abandon the \nirresponsible game of playing partisan politics with Social Security. \nDemocrats will have to stop using the issue to scare seniors into \nvoting against Republicans. Republicans will have to resist using \nSocial Security revenues to finance tax cuts. And both parties must \nstop raiding the Trust Funds to fund more government spending. We must \nface up to our responsibilities, not as Republicans or Democrats, but \nas elected representatives of the American people with a common \nobligation to protect the generation of today and of tomorrow.\n  It is time for us to talk straight to Americans about Social Security \nand begin working together in a bipartisan fashion to make the \nnecessary changes to strengthen and save the nation's retirement \nprogram for the seniors of today and tomorrow.\n  We must work together to develop fair and effective reforms that will \npreserve and protect the Social Security system for current and future \nretirees, while allowing all Americans, particularly low- and middle-\nincome individuals, the opportunity to share in the great prosperity \nthat our nation enjoys today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 547\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide enhanced reimbursement for, and expanded capacity to, \nmammography services under the medicare program, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on finance.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by \nSenators Snowe, Mikulski, Murkowski, Murray, Schumer and Reid to \nintroduce the ``Assure Access to Mammography Act of 2001.'' This \nimportant legislation will help improve access to life-saving breast \nscreenings for millions of women.\n  I lost both of my sisters to breast cancer. I strongly believe that \nif they had had access to regular mammography services and today's \nadvanced treatments, they would still be alive today.\n  Over the past several years, we've made a great deal of progress \nagainst breast cancer. In particular, we've been able to secure \nsignificant funding increases for research to understand the causes of \nand find treatments for breast cancer.\n  Almost a decade ago, when I looked into the issue of breast cancer \nresearch, I discovered that barely $90 million was spent on breast \ncancer research.\n  That's why, in 1992, I offered an amendment to dedicate $210 million \nin the Defense Department Budget for breast cancer research. This \nfunding was in addition to the funding for breast cancer research \nconducted at the National Institutes of Health. My amendment passed \nand, overnight, it doubled Federal funding for breast cancer.\n  Since then, funding for breast cancer research has been included in \nthe Defense Department Budget every year.\n  Today, I am proud to say, between the DoD and NIH, over $600 million \nis being spent on finding a cure for this disease.\n  But our success in building our research enterprise will be pointless \nif breakthroughs in diagnosis, treatment and cures are not available \nfor patients.\n  That is why, a decade ago, as Chairman of the Senate Labor, Health \nand Human Services and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, I worked \nwith Senator Mikulski to create a program, run by the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, to provide breast and cervical cancer \nscreening for low-income, uninsured women. And last year, I pushed a \nnew law to provide Medicaid coverage to women diagnosed through this \nprogram so they can get the treatment they need.\n  But we still have a long way to go. Breast cancer is the second-most \ncommon form of cancer in the United States, next to skin cancers. \nApproximately 3 million women are living with cancer today, 2 million \nwho have been diagnosed, and an estimated 1 million who do not yet now \nthey have the disease. If we are going to win the war against breast \ncancer, we've got to be able to detect it early enough to apply the \nlatest treatments effectively. We can prolong and save the lives of \nmillions of women if the cancer is detected when it is small and has \nnot yet spread to other areas of the body. Although not the perfect \nsolution, screening mammograms are the best known way to diagnose \nbreast cancer and reduce mortality. For example, routine mammograms in \nclinical trials resulted in a 25-30 percent decrease in breast cancer \nmortality for women aged 50-70.\n\n  In 1990, Congress acted to ensure access to screening by creating a \nMedicare mammography benefit and provided adequate payment for \nscreening mammography by setting reimbursement for the procedure at \n$55, indexed to inflation. Today that amount is $69.23. Unfortunately, \nthis payment has not kept pace with the costs of the procedure, and \nwomen's access to screening mammography is being curtailed.\n  Hundreds of facilities across the country are losing money on \nscreening mammography, and since September of 1999, 243 facilities have \nclosed their doors; close to 100 of them in the last 5 months. At the \nsame time, one million additional women each year need regular \nmammograms.\n  To compound the problem, there is increasing evidence of a shortage \nof practicing radiologists and radiology residents willing to conduct \nmammography screening and receive the necessary specialty training. \nRadiologists report that mammography is under-reimbursed and has a \ncomparatively higher workload, high malpractice costs and more on-the-\njob stress.\n  In addition, this shortage of radiologic technologists appears to be \nworsening at the same time as the demand for medical imaging escalates. \nThe number of RT trainees who take the certification exams has declined \ndramatically in the past several years, from 10,330 in 1995 to 7,149 in \n2000. Facilities nationwide report an inability to find and keep \nqualified RTs.\n  As a result, women in many different parts of the country are having \nto wait many weeks and months to get a mammogram. These kinds of delays \nput women at risk for more advanced and less treatable forms of breast \ncancer.\n  Some of my colleagues may have read in TIME Magazine recently about \nPaula Sperling from New York. When she called her local mammography \nfacility, they told her she'd have to wait 5 months for her annual \nmammogram, even though she has a history of breast cancer in her \nfamily. She told TIME, ``Three or four months could mean the difference \nbetween a tumor that's localized and one that's spread into the lymph \nnodes.''\n  In my home state of Iowa, the situation is less dire, but our \nmammography facilities are struggling because reimbursement doesn't \ncome anywhere near the costs of providing the service. For example, \nMercy Medical Center's Cedar Rapids mobile mammography unit serves \nthousands of women in 7 rural counties in the surrounding area. Many of \nthese women would find it very difficult, if not impossible, to get \ntheir mammograms in any other way. But because of low reimbursements, \nthis mobile unit lost $75,000 last year; losses that simply cannot be \nsustained. It is a day to day struggle to keep that mobile unit going.\n  Congress has a responsibility to make sure our Medicare policy \nensures that women have access to timely, quality mammography services. \nOur legislation would do the following:\n  Increase the Medicare reimbursement for screening mammograms to\n\n[[Page S2399]]\n\n$90 for 2002, based on currently available cost data.\n  Increase Medicare graduate medical education funding for added \nradiology residency slots, some of whom will choose mammography as a \nspecialty.\n  Increase funding for allied health profession loan programs to \nincrease the supply of qualified radiologic technicians (RTs) available \nto conduct mammograms.\n  In addition, we have included two important studies in our bill. \nRecent research has suggested that the Medicare reimbursement structure \nfor physician work undervalues services and procedures done primarily \nin women when compared to similar male-specific procedures. Our bill \nrequires the General Accounting Office to further evaluate this \nresearch and make recommendations to Congress on how to make Medicare \nreimbursement more equitable.\n  Also, there is evidence that screening services are undervalued in \nthe physician fee schedule relative to other procedures. Given the \nimportance of regular screening to prevent and catch disease in the \nearly stages, from breast cancer to colorectal and prostate cancer, we \ninclude a provision in our bill requiring the Medicare Payment Advisory \nCommission, MedPAC, to study this issue and make recommendations to \nCongress.\n  Our legislation has the support of the American Cancer Society, \nAmerican College of Radiologists, Society of Breast Imaging and the \nAmerican Society of Radiologic Technologists. I ask unanimous consent \nthat their letters of endorsement be printed in the Congressional \nRecord. And for the sake of women across America and their families and \nfriends, I urge my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this important \nbill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 548\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Tom: On behalf of the American Cancer Society and its \n     more than 28 million supporters, I am writing to thank you \n     for recognizing the importance of assuring that American \n     women have adequate access to mammography and for drafting \n     legislation aimed at addressing this complex issue. We are \n     most grateful for your leadership and commitment.\n       As you know, there have been increasing indicators that \n     suggest an erosion in the current capacity to meet the breast \n     imaging needs of American women. We have been troubled by \n     recent reports of problems related to economic pressures, \n     personnel shortages, and a growing disinterest in mammography \n     on the part of practicing radiologists and recent residency \n     program graduates. Unfortunately, we do not yet have much \n     concrete data to illuminate the extent of the problem.\n       The Society is currently working in collaboration with the \n     Society of Breast Imaging (SBI) and the American College of \n     Radiology (ACR) to gather data to better understanding the \n     underlying systemic problems that are reflected in a growing \n     number of anecdotal reports about problems with mammography. \n     We are also in the process of convening a series of meetings \n     with other breast cancer advocacy groups to try to answer the \n     questions raised by the recent news reports.\n       The Society strongly believes that continued access to \n     quality mammography must be assured and that this issue must \n     be addressed in a timely fashion. Increasing women's access \n     to high quality breast cancer screening is a goal that has \n     long had strong bi-partisan Congressional support, as \n     evidenced by the enactment of legislation in 1990 to provide \n     a Medicare breast cancer screening benefit and the passage of \n     the ``Mammography Quality Standards Act'' in 1992. Congress \n     has also taken steps to increase access to mammography and \n     breast cancer treatment for the medically underserved by \n     establishing the Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection \n     Program and enacting the Breast & Cervical Cancer Treatment \n     Act. In addition, thanks to successful\n\n[[Page S2400]]\n\n     public-private partnerships, many women have gotten the \n     message about the importance of regular mammograms. Your \n     support on these issues has been greatly appreciated.\n       Now that women are getting the message and seeking out \n     screening services, the country needs to ensure that the \n     capacity to provide mammography services meets the demand. \n     Approximately 40,600 Americans will die this year from breast \n     cancer. We knew that early detection is key to saving lives \n     from breast cancer, and it increases a women's treatment \n     options. Mammography is the only scientifically proven tool \n     currently available to detect breast cancer before the onset \n     of symptoms. The aging of the baby boomer population means \n     that the number of American women requiring regular screening \n     is increasing dramatically at an estimated rate of over one \n     million per year.\n       Your legislation, the ``Assure Access to Mammography Act,'' \n     is an important step in addressing these issues. We know that \n     increasing the reimbursement rate and raising the number of \n     radiology residents--measures addressed in your legislation--\n     are important components of the mammography capacity issue. \n     We also believe the MedPAC study called for in the bill will \n     lay the groundwork for shoring up future capacity by \n     evaluating whether or not screening services are undervalued \n     in the physician fee schedule.\n       Once again, we commend you for your leadership on this \n     critical issue. As our data collection and analysis efforts \n     progress, we look forward to sharing this information with \n     you and working together to ensure that women across the \n     country continue to have access to high quality mammography \n     services. If you or your staff have any additional questions, \n     please contact Megan Gordon, Manager of Federal Government \n     Relations (202-661-5716).\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Daniel E. Smith,\n            National Vice President, Federal and State Government \n     Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                American College of Radiology,\n\n                                       Reston, VA, March 12, 2001.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: On behalf of the American College of \n     Radiology (ACR), I would like to commend you on your efforts \n     to improve women's health by introducing the ``Assure Access \n     to Mammography Act of 2001'' and offer the College's full \n     support for the enactment of this legislation.\n       As you know, the College has been working closely with you \n     and your staff to address the growing access problem to \n     timely mammography screening. For over a decade, the Congress \n     and the College have recognized screening mammography as an \n     essential element in women's health and have been committed \n     to providing this valuable service. With the enactment of \n     this legislation, that commitment to women's health will \n     continue.\n       Raising reimbursement for screening mammography, and \n     maintaining that level of reimbursement, will allow \n     radiologists to continue providing this lifesaving service in \n     a timely fashion and help avoid the delays that have been \n     widely reported in the media. The College also fully supports \n     the provisions in your legislation regarding the need for \n     additional radiologists and associated allied health \n     personnel. In addition, your provisions requesting the study \n     of Medicare reimbursement of gender-specific services and \n     Medicare reimbursement for screening services in general are \n     solely needed.\n       Since the College and you share the common goal of \n     continuing to provide timely access to screening mammography, \n     ACR looks forward to continuing our work together to pass \n     this vital legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Harvey L. Neiman, M.D.,\n     Chair, Board of Chancellors.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Society of Breast Imaging,\n\n                                       Reston, VA, March 12, 2001.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: Mammography can have a significant \n     impact on women's lives. When screening mammography detects \n     breast cancer at an early stage, women have a better chance \n     of survival and an improved quality of life. Early detection \n     may also spare many women from mastectomy. The American \n     Cancer Society, the American Medical Association, and many \n     other medical organizations now recommend that women begin \n     annual screening mammography at age 40 years.\n       The number of screening mammograms performed each year in \n     our country has doubled over the past decade. There are now \n     56 million American women age 40 or older. About 30 million \n     women have had a mammogram during the past 2 years.\n       The need for mammography is expected to increase even \n     further in the future. Each year, a greater percentage of \n     women in the breast cancer age group follow the mammography \n     screening guidelines. Also, the population of women age 40 \n     and older will grow by 1 million each year over the next five \n     years.\n       Today, our medical care system is unable to keep up with \n     this increasing demand for mammography by providing this \n     examination in a timely manner. Waiting time for a \n     mammography appointment has increased. Many facilities now \n     report waits of weeks or even months. The underlying reason \n     for these excessively long waits is inadequate reimbursement \n     rates. At current reimbursement rates, mammography usually \n     loses money. The more mammograms performed, the greater the \n     loss. The current Medicare reimbursement rate of $68.00 for a \n     screening mammogram is less than the cost of performing the \n     examination. Reimbursement rates for other health care plans \n     are based upon the Medicare fee schedule. At current \n     reimbursement rates, many hospitals and clinics have been \n     unable to purchase enough mammography equipment, hire enough \n     radiologists and technologists, and pay for enough office \n     space for breast imaging.\n       Long waits for a mammography appointment lead to \n     unnecessary anxiety. Some women feel discouraged. Others may \n     even be deterred from having a mammogram. Extremely long \n     waiting times may result in delay in diagnosis and treatment \n     of breast cancer. This can shorten a woman's life.\n       If the trend in financial loses from the performance of \n     mammography continues, the availability of this study will be \n     further curtailed. Some hospitals and medical facilities may \n     even be forced to stop performing this examination. And, most \n     facilities cannot afford to expand despite the projected \n     increasing need for mammograms.\n       The Society of Breast Imaging supports your proposed \n     legislation. By bringing reimbursement rates in line with the \n     cost of performing mammography, your bill will ensure that \n     American women will have access to this lifesaving procedure.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        Stephen A. Feig, MD, FACR,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n         American Society of Radiologic Technologists,\n                                                    March 9, 2001.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: On behalf of the American Society of \n     Radiologic Technologists (ASRT), a nationwide organization \n     representing more than 87,000 medical imaging and radiation \n     therapy professionals, we would like to express our strong \n     support for the ``Fairness in Mammography Reimbursement Act \n     of 2001.''\n       ASRT supports your call for increases in both mammography \n     reimbursement and federal support for allied health \n     professions educational program grants. ASRT recognizes that \n     current reimbursements do not cover costs for performance of \n     these procedures. In addition, shortages of qualified \n     radiologic technologists have had an adverse affect on access \n     to quality mammography services. We appreciate your \n     acknowledgment that the problem of access to quality \n     mammography is both a reimbursement problem, as well as a \n     personnel problem.\n       In 1991, you were one of the first Senators to recognize \n     the need to improve access to and the quality of mammography \n     services. Your cosponsorship of the Woman's Health Equity Act \n     of 1991--which ultimately became the Mammography Quality \n     Standards Act (MQSA) of 1992--was an important first step \n     towards improving the quality of radiologic imaging services. \n     An important component of that bill was the establishment of \n     minimum federal standards for radiologic technologists \n     performing mammography services.\n       While considerable progress has been made since 1992 in \n     improving the quality of mammography services, we regret that \n     a similar statement cannot be made with respect to other \n     radiologic imaging services. We would therefore like to take \n     this opportunity to bring to your attention legislation we \n     are promoting entitled the Consumer Assurance of Radiologic \n     Excellence (CARE). This legislation is designed to increase \n     the quality of all radiologic services and reduce medical \n     errors by establishing federal minimum standards for \n     education and credentialing of personnel who perform plan or \n     deliver medical imaging procedures or radiation therapy.\n       Again, we commend and support your efforts to improve \n     access and availability of quality mammography services and \n     we look forward to working with you on Legislation that will \n     improve the quality of all medical imaging services.\n           Sincerely,\n                               Michael DelVecchio, B.S., R.T. (R),\n                                                   ASRT President.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to join Senator \nHarkin and Senator Mikulski as an original cosponsor of the Assure \nAccess to Mammography Act of 2001. This bill addresses an emerging need \nin the fight for breast cancer--the need for adequate reimbursement for \nscreening mammography in the Medicare Program and the need to preserve \naccess to mammographies services for women across the country.\n  Mr. President, we are clearly making small gains in fighting breast \ncancer, which is one of the most challenging and daunting health \nproblems in America today. There is no question that a diagnosis of \nbreast cancer is something that every woman dreads. But for an \nestimated 192,200 American women, this is the year their worst fears \nwill\n\n[[Page S2401]]\n\nbe realized. One thousand new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed \namong the women in Maine, and 200 women in my home state will die from \nthis tragic disease. The fact is, one in nine women will develop breast \ncancer during their lifetime, and for women between the ages of 35 and \n54, there is no other disease which will claim more lives.\n  But the fact is that mammograms are the most powerful weapon we have \nin the fight against breast cancer. They enable us to detect and treat \nbreast cancer at its earliest stage when the tumors are too tiny to be \ndetected by a woman or her doctor, providing a better prognosis. An \nestimated 30 million mammograms were performed last year at a cost of \nover $2 billion--a valuable down-payment in our fight against an \nunmerciful killer. And due to the aging of the baby boom generation it \nis estimated that more than one million additional women each year will \nneed regular mammograms.\n  In 1990 we succeeded in making screening mammography the very first \npreventive benefit available under Part B of the Medicare Program, and \nwe set the reimbursement level in statute. In 1998, the Medicare \nProgram alone provided over 6 million mammography procedures. \nUnfortunately the Medicare payment, which was indexed to inflation \nunder the statute, has not kept pace with the actual increase in health \ncare costs. Last year the Medicare reimbursement for a screening \nmammogram was $69.23--well under the mean cost of $90 per procedure.\n  There is evidence that radiology clinics are closing their doors, and \nthat radiologists are no longer able to provide mammography services \ndue to the simple fact that providers are not reimbursed enough for \ntheir work and cannot justify the losses they incur by providing \nmammography services. Over the past 18 months 243 facilities have \nclosed their doors; close to 100 of them in just the past four months. \nThis is a problem that must be addressed immediately.\n  The legislation we introduce today would increase Medicare \nreimbursement for screening mammograms to $90 for 2002, insuring that \nradiologists across the country are appropriately reimbursed for the \nvaluable service they provide.\n  On March 7, 2001, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) issued a \nfascinating report evaluating the new technologies of mammography \ntitled ``Mammography and Beyond: Developing Technologies for the Early \nDetection of Breast Cancer.''\n  At the same time, the IOM recommended analyzing current Medicare and \nMedicaid reimbursement rates for mammography to determine whether they \nadequately cover the total costs of providing the procedure. The report \nalso recommends that the Health Resources and Services Administration \n(HRSA) undertake or fund a study to analyze trends in speciality \ntraining for breast cancer screening among radiologists and radiologic \ntechnologists, and examine factors affecting the decision of \npractitioners to enter or remain in the field.\n  We have taken these recommendations very seriously and by introducing \nthis legislation today, we are acting to preserve access to \nmammography. The truth is we simply cannot risk slipping back in our \nfight against breast cancer.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this very important \nbill and work towards passing it this year.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues Senators \nHarkin, Snowe, Murkowski, Murray, Schumer, and Reid in introducing the \nAssure Access to Mammography Act of 2001. The goal of this bill is to \nhelp ensure that women have access to screening mammograms.\n  Breast cancer mortality has decreased because of early detection, \ndiagnosis, and treatment. Mammography is vital to early detection, yet \nI have seen press reports about women having to wait weeks or months \nfor a mammogram. In Maryland, waiting times for mammograms at some \nfacilities have increased from one to two weeks to six to eight weeks. \nIn addition, some wait times have increased from one to two days to two \nweeks for a diagnostic mammogram. In these cases, usually a woman has \nalready had a suspicious finding from a screening mammogram and has to \nwait longer to get the results of a diagnostic mammogram to determine \nif she has breast cancer or not.\n  I have also heard about mammography facilities closing down because \nthey could no longer make ends meet. In fact, a couple mammography \nfacilities in the Baltimore area have closed their doors. This \ncoincides with a national trend. Over the last 18 months, close to 250 \nmammography facilities have closed down, with almost 100 facilities \nclosing between October 2000 and February 2001. Women living in areas \nwith no or few mammogram facilities are less likely to have mammograms \nthan those living in areas with more facilities.\n  At the same time, the size of the population requiring annual \nmammograms is increasing about one million per year. The American \npopulation is aging. There will be 70 million Americans aged 65 and \nover in 2030. Age is also the most important risk factor for breast \ncancer. A woman's chance of getting breast cancer is 1 out of 2,212 by \nage 30. This increases to 1 out of 23 by age 60 and 1 out of 10 by age \n80. More than 85 percent of breast cancers occur in women over the age \nof 50. This means that more and more women will be on Medicare and need \nscreening mammograms. Screening mammograms have been shown to reduce \nbreast cancer mortality by 25-30 percent in women age 50-70. About 68 \npercent of Maryland women age 65 and older had a mammogram within the \nlast year. More women will need this screening at the same time that we \nare seeing fewer mammography facilities available to provide this \nvaluable service to women.\n  Eleven years ago, I introduced the Medicare Screening Mammography \nAmendments of 1990 to provide Medicare coverage of annual screening \nmammography. This bill set out the conditions under which Medicare \nwould cover screening mammograms and how they would be reimbursed. My \nlegislation was included in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of \n1990. Before that, Medicare did not cover routine annual screening \nmammograms. The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) reimburses \nscreening mammograms at a rate of $55 indexed to inflation. This means \nthat for 2001, Medicare pays $69.23 for screening mammograms. Last \nyear, Congress changed how Medicare pays for screening mammograms. \nStarting in 2002, screening mammograms will be reimbursed through the \nMedicare physician fee schedule like diagnostic mammograms and other \nservices.\n  Mammography is a unique procedure. Screening mammography has been \nreimbursed differently under Medicare than diagnostic mammography. \nMammography is also one of the most technically challenging \nradiological procedures. Ensuring the quality of the image is difficult \nand mammograms are the most difficult radiologic images to read. I \nauthored the mammography Quality Standards Act of 1992 to set uniform \nquality standards for mammography facilities, personnel, and equipment \nso that women would have safe and reliable mammograms. These standards \nare unique to mammography. A study has found that allegation of error \nin the diagnosis of breast cancer is now the most prevalent reason for \nmedical malpractice lawsuits among all claims against physicians and is \nassociated with the second highest indemnity payment size.\n  Last week, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) released a report entitled \n``Mammography and Beyond: Developing Technologies for the Early \nDetection of Breast Cancer''. Among the IOM's recommendations is that \nHCFA should analyze the current Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement \nrates for mammography, including a comparison with other radiological \ntechniques, to determine whether they adequately cover the total costs \nof providing the procedure. The cost analysis should include the costs \nassociated with meeting the requirements of the Mammography Quality \nStandards Act. The bill we are introducing today would delay for one \nyear (until 2003) the inclusion of screening mammography in the \nMedicare physician fee schedule. This would give time for HCFA to \ncollect data and review Medicare reimbursement rates for screening \nmammography before moving it into the physician fee schedule and to \nhelp ensure a smooth transition into the fee schedule. This is \nimportant given the unique characteristics of mammography that I\n\n[[Page S2402]]\n\nhave already outlined. In the meantime, the bill would increase \nMedicare reimbursement for screening mammograms to $90 in 2002 to help \ndecrease waiting times and the closure of mammography facilities so \nthat women have timely access to screening mammograms.\n\n  In addition, there is evidence that fewer numbers of radiologists and \ntechnologists are going into mammography. That's why this bill \nincreases Medicare Graduate Medical Education funding for additional \nradiology residency slots and increases funding for Allied Health \nProfessions programs to increase the supply of radiologic technologists \n(RTs) able to conduct mammograms. The IOM report last week acknowledges \nthis concern by recommending that the Health Resources and Services \nAdministration (HRSA) should undertake or fund a study that analyzes \ntrends in specialty training for breast cancer screening among \nradiologists and radiologic technologists and that examines the factors \nthat affect practitioners' decision to enter or remain in the field.\n  Finally, this bill would require a General Accounting Office study of \nthe Medicare reimbursement structure for gender-specific procedures and \nrequire a Medicare Payment Advisory Commission study of Medicare \nreimbursement for screening services. These studies will provide \nimportant information for Congress and HCFA to consider as we look at \nways to improve and modernize Medicare.\n  I'm pleased that this legislation has the support of the American \nCancer Society, the American College of Radiology, the American Society \nof Radiologic Technologists, and the Society of Breast Imaging. I hope \nthis bill will begin a conversation about the adequacy of Medicare \nreimbursement of screening mammograms. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis bill, and I urge my colleagues on the Finance Committee to \nconsider this bill as they craft Medicare reform legislation. A decade \nago Congress provided coverage of annual mammograms to women under \nMedicare. This legislation will help ensure that the promise we made a \ndecade ago remains a meaningful promise to current and future Medicare \nbeneficiaries. Without it, some women at risk for breast cancer may not \nhave access to screening that could detect cancer earlier and help them \nlive longer.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAPO (for himself and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 549. A bill to ensure the availability of spectrum to amateur \nradio operators; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Amateur Radio \nSpectrum Protection Act of 2001. This bill would help preserve the \namount of radio spectrum allocated to the Amateur Radio Service during \nthis era of dramatic change in our telecommunications system. I am \npleased to be joined today in this bi-partisan effort by Senator Daniel \nAkaka.\n  Organized radio amateurs, more commonly known as `ham' operators, \nthrough formal agreements with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, \nthe National Weather Service, the Red Cross, the Salvation Army, and \nother government and private relief services, provide emergency \ncommunication when regular channels are disrupted by disaster. In \nIdaho, these trained volunteers have performed tasks as various as \nhelping to rescue stranded back-country hikers, organizing cleanup \nefforts after the Payette River flooded, and helping the Forest Service \ncommunicate during major forest fires. In other communities, they may \nbe found monitoring tornado touchdowns in the Midwest, helping \nauthorities reestablish communication after a hurricane in the Gulf or \nsending ``health and welfare'' messages following an earthquake on the \nWest Coast. Not only do they provide these services using their own \nequipment and without compensation, but they also give their personal \ntime to participate in regular organized training exercises.\n  In addition to emergency communication, amateur radio enthusiasts use \ntheir spectrum allocations to experiment with and develop new circuitry \nand techniques for increasing the effectiveness of the precious natural \nresource of radio spectrum for all Americans. Much of the electronic \ntechnology we now take for granted is rooted in amateur radio \nexperimentation. Moreover, amateur radio has long provided the first \ntechnical training for youngsters who grow up to be America's \nscientists and engineers.\n  The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 requires the Federal Communications \nCommission, FCC, to conduct spectrum auctions to raise revenues. Some \nof that revenue may come from the auction of current amateur radio \nspectrum. This bill simply requires the FCC to provide the Amateur \nRadio Service with equivalent replacement spectrum if it reallocates \nand auctions any of the Service's current spectrum.\n  The Amateur Radio Spectrum Protection Act of 2001 will protect these \nvital functions while also maintaining the flexibility of the FCC to \nmanage the nation's telecommunications infrastructure effectively. It \nwill not interfere with the ability of commercial telecommunications \nservices to seek the spectrum allocations they require. I ask my \ncolleagues to join the more than 670,000 U.S. licensed radio amateurs \nin supporting this measure and welcome their co-sponsorship.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 549\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Amateur Radio Spectrum \n     Protection Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) More than 650,000 radio amateurs in the United States \n     are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission.\n       (2) Among the basic purposes of the Amateur Radio and \n     Amateur Satellite Services are to provide voluntary, \n     noncommercial radio service, particularly emergency \n     communications.\n       (3) Emergency communications services by volunteer amateur \n     radio operators have consistently and reliably been provided \n     before, during, and after floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, \n     forest fires, earthquakes, blizzards, train accidents, \n     chemical spills, and other disasters.\n       (4) The Federal Communications Commission has taken actions \n     which have resulted in the loss of at least 107 MHz of \n     spectrum to radio amateurs.\n\n     SEC. 3. FEDERAL POLICY REGARDING REALLOCATION OF AMATEUR \n                   RADIO SPECTRUM.\n\n       Section 303 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \n     303) is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     subsection:\n       ``(z) Notwithstanding subsection (c), after the date of the \n     enactment of this subsection--\n       ``(1) make no reallocation of primary allocations of bands \n     of frequencies of the amateur radio and amateur satellite \n     services;\n       ``(2) not diminish the secondary allocations of bands of \n     frequencies to the amateur radio or amateur satellite \n     service; and\n       ``(3) make no additional allocations within such bands of \n     frequencies that would substantially reduce the utility \n     thereof to the amateur radio or amateur satellite service;\n     unless the Commission, at the same time, provides equivalent \n     replacement spectrum to amateur radio and amateur satellite \n     service.''.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nIdaho (Mr. Crapo) for introducing this very important legislation that \nwill help to protect and preserve the radio spectrum necessary to \nensure the continuation of the Amateur Radio Service. The Amateur Radio \nSpectrum Act of 2001 is a bipartisan effort to secure the amateur radio \nspectrum as the telecommunications industry continues to change.\n  Amateur radio operators, more commonly known as ``hams,'' have been \naround as long as radio itself, and a few pioneers in amateur radio \nprovided valuable insight into the current communications system that \nwe know today. While many people may look at amateur radio operators as \nradio enthusiasts with a fun hobby, I would like to remind everyone \nthat they also provide a valuable service to communities all over the \nworld.\n  Mr. President, the Amateur Radio Service was created by the Federal \nCommunications Commission (FCC) to utilize amateur radio operators to \nprovide backup emergency communications. These operators set up and \noperate organized communications networks locally for governmental and \nemergency officials.\n  While television and radio broadcast stations are the more common \nmethods of providing emergency information to\n\n[[Page S2403]]\n\nthe public, these stations may not be in service for weeks after such \ndisasters as tornados and hurricanes. Instead, this valuable emergency \nservice usually is provided by the Amateur Radio Service. Through \nseveral networks that are decentralized, with many transceivers and \nantennas, amateur radio operators are able to transmit safety and \nhealth conditions in times of disasters.\n  In the State of Hawaii, the sole source of information in the \nimmediate aftermath of Hurricane Iniki, which hit the island of Kauai \non September 11, 1992, was from amateur radio operators. The \ndevastation to the island was immense; one out of five of the island's \npower and telephone poles were down, power, cable television, and phone \nlines were out, cellular phone, microwave dishes, two-way radio antenna \nboosters, television station translators, and radio station \ntransmitters were damaged. Kauai Electric Company was inoperable and \n100 percent of its customers were without power. While the company did \nhave a disaster plan, no one fathomed that a storm would have such a \ndevastating effect. Fortunately, amateur radio operators on Kauai were \nable to keep state officials informed about the island's condition.\n  Mr. President, Senator Crapo and I are here today because the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997 requires the FCC to conduct spectrum \nauctions as a means to increase revenue. While these auctions may not \nimmediately take away from the Amateur Radio Service, there is nothing \nto prevent the FCC from selling off portions of the spectrum currently \nutilized by amateur radio operators.\n  Mr. President, this bill will protect the Amateur Radio Service by \nrequiring the FCC to provide the Service with equivalent spectrum if it \nreallocates and auctions any of the Service's current spectrum. The \nAmateur Radio Spectrum Protection Act of 2001 will ensure that the \nvaluable service provided by amateur radio operators will continue.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Crapo in this bipartisan \neffort to protect the Amateur Radio Service and ask my colleagues to \nsupport this important measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Baucus, \n        Mr. Cochran, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 550. A bill to amend part E of title IV of the Social Security Act \nto provide equitable access for foster care and adoption services for \nIndian children in tribal areas; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing legislation to \ncorrect an inequity in the laws affecting many Native American \nchildren. I am joined by Senators McCain, Inouye, Baucus, Feinstein, \nand Cochran in supporting this important piece of legislation. This \neffort is also supported by the National Indian Child Welfare \nAssociation, American Public Human Services Association, and National \nCongress of American Indians.\n  Every year, for a variety of often tragic reasons, thousands of \nchildren across the country are placed in foster care. To assist with \nthe cost of food, shelter, clothing, daily supervision and school \nsupplies, foster parents of children who have come to their homes \nthrough state court placement receive money through Title IV-E of the \nSocial Security Act. Additionally, states receive funding for \nadministrative training and data collection to support this program. \nUnfortunately, because of a legislative oversight, many Native American \nchildren who are placed in foster care by tribal courts do not receive \nfoster care and adoptive services to which all other income-eligible \nchildren are entitled.\n  Not only are otherwise eligible Native children denied foster care \nmaintenance payments, but this inequity also extends to children who \nare adopted through tribal placements. Currently, the IV-E program \noffers limited assistance for expenses associated with adoption and the \ntraining of professional staff and parents involved in the adoption. \nThese circumstances, sadly, have meant that many Indian children \nreceive little Federal support in attaining the permanency they need \nand deserve.\n  In many instances, these children face insurmountable odds. Many come \nfrom abusive homes. Foster parents who open their doors to care for \nthese special children deserve our help. These generous people who take \nthese children into their homes should not have sleepless nights \nworrying about whether they have the resources to provide nourishing \nfood or a warm coat, or even adequate shelter for these children. This \nlegislation will go a long way to ease their concerns.\n  Currently, some tribes and states have entered into IV-E agreements, \nbut these arrangements are the exception. They also, by and large, do \nnot include funds to train tribal social workers and foster and \nadoptive parents. This bill would make it clear that tribes would be \ntreated like States when they run their own programs under the IV-E \nprogram. The bill would make funding fair and equitable for all \nchildren, Native and non-Native.\n  The bill I am introducing today would do the following:\n  Extend the Title IV-E entitlement programs to tribal placements in \nfoster and adoptive homes;\n  Authorize tribal governments to receive direct funding from the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services for administration of IV-E \nprograms (tribes must have HHS-approved programs):\n  Allow the Secretary flexibility to modify the requirements of the IV-\nE law for tribes if those requirements are not in the best interest of \nNative children; and\n  Allow continuation of tribal-State IV-E agreements.\n  In a 1994 report, HHS found that the best way to serve this \nunderfunded group is to provide direct assistance to tribal governments \nand qualified tribal families. I want to emphasize that this bill would \nnot result in reduced funding for the States, as they would continue to \nbe reimbursed for their expenses under the law. I strongly believe \nCongress should address this oversight and provide equitable benefits \nto Native American children who are under the jurisdiction of their \ntribal governments, and I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting \nthis bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor legislation with \nmy colleagues, Senators Daschle, Inouye, Baucus, Feinstein and Cochran, \nto amend the Social Security Act and extend eligibility for Indian \ntribes to fully implement, like states, the Title IV-E Foster Care and \nAdoption Assistance Act. This important legislation will make certain \nthat Indian children living in tribal areas have the same access to \nservices of the Title IV-E Foster Care and Adoption Assistance Program \nenjoyed by other children nationwide.\n  The purpose of the Title IV-E program is to ensure that children \nreceive adequate care when placed in foster care and adoption programs. \nThe Title IV-E program operates as an open-ended entitlement program \nfor eligible state governments with approved plans. State governments \nreceive funding for foster care maintenance payments to cover food, \nshelter, clothing, school supplies, and liability insurance for income-\neligible children placed in foster homes by state courts, and for \nrelated administrative and training costs.\n  While Congress intended that the Title IV-E program should benefit \nall eligible children, Indian children who are under the jurisdiction \nof the respective tribal court are generally not considered eligible. \nWhen enacted, the Title IV-E law did not properly consider that Indian \ntribal governments retain sole jurisdiction over the domestic affairs \nof their own tribal members, particularly Indian children.\n  State administrators have attempted to meet the intended goals of \nthese programs by extending their efforts to Indian country. However, \nadministrative and jurisdictional hurdles make it nearly impossible to \nprovide these services. As a result, Indian children in need of foster \ncare and child support are not accorded the same level of service as \nother children nationwide. Tribal governments, who are legally \nresponsible for Indian children in foster care, are not entitled to \nfederal reimbursement for children placed in foster care by a tribal \ncourt, unless the tribe, as a public agency, enters into a cooperative \nagreement with the state.\n  A cooperative agreement may not sound all that difficult, but in \nreality,\n\n[[Page S2404]]\n\nsuch an agreement can prove impossible. Rather than providing \nincentives, current law often discourages states from entering into \nagreements with tribes. For example, a state is accountable for tribal \ncompliance with Title IV-E requirements. If a tribe cannot fulfill a \nmatching requirement, the state must assume the costs on behalf of the \ntribe in order to retain federal funds. It is entirely possible that \nstates could lose their Title IV-E funds if tribal records were out of \ncompliance.\n  Unfortunately, State-tribal relations are not always productive, \nparticularly when disputes arise over issues unrelated to child \nwelfare. Providing this direct eligibility for tribal governments, with \nthe same accountability and enforcement requirements, will resolve such \nproblems. State agencies have indicated that direct participation by \nthe tribes would help address an overburden of casework and preclude \ntension over jurisdictional issues. While direct tribal authority would \nbe authorized by enactment of this legislation, I want to make clear \nthat we have no intention to supplant or discourage State-tribal \nagreements. Existing agreements will be honored, while allowing Indian \ntribes to directly access needed resources for further protection for \nincome-eligible Indian children.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, CBO, estimated that this legislation \nwould cost $236 million over a five-year period, which generally \namounts to less than 1 percent of total federal Title IV-E \nexpenditures. While this legislation does not currently include any \nidentified offsets to pay for adding tribal eligibility for this \nentitlement program, I have been assured by Senator Daschle that the \ninclusion of an offset, prior to final passage, will in no way affect \nthe Social Security Trust Fund or increase the federal debt. We have \npledged to work together to find the necessary and agreeable offset for \nthis program.\n  Enactment of this legislation will bring an end to the disparate \ntreatment of eligible Indian children under Title IV-E programs. I urge \nmy colleagues to correct this unfair oversight and make the benefits of \nthe Title IV-E entitlement program available for all children as \nintended.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am happy to co-sponsor this legislation \nwith my colleagues, Senators Daschle, McCain, Inouye, Feinstein, and \nCochran, to extend the Title IV-E Foster Care and Adoption Assistance \nprograms to Indian tribes. This legislation will enhance tribal \nsovereignty by giving tribes choices when it comes to providing child \nwelfare services to their children.\n  Hundreds of thousands of children are currently in foster care due to \nabuse, neglect, or abandonment. The programs authorized under Title IV-\nE of the Social Security Act play an important role in safeguarding the \nwell-being of these children. The programs provide funding to states to \ncover the costs of food, shelter, clothing, and other supplies for \neligible children that are placed in foster care. States also receive \nfunding for related administrative and training costs.\n  Unfortunately, thousands of Native American children who meet income \neligibility criteria are not automatically eligible to receive this \nfunding if they are placed in foster care or up for adoption by a \ntribal agency. Under current law, only states can directly benefit from \nthis funding source. In order to receive these monies, tribes must form \ncooperative agreements with their respective states.\n  In Montana, all seven of our tribes have developed foster care \nagreements with the state government, and the agreements reportedly are \nsuccessful for the parties involved. But we are lucky. Not all tribes \nor states have been able to form these agreements with each other. Nor \nshould they have to.\n  This legislation will allow tribes, like states, to submit plans to \nthe Department of Health and Human Services in order to receive Title \nIV-E payments directly. Or tribes could continue their cooperative \nstate agreements. The point is, this bill will give tribes choices when \nit comes to their child welfare services. It will enhance tribal \nsovereignty. And for many tribes, it will give them access to funding \nsources currently not available to them.\n  I believe this legislation is important for Indian children and \ntribal sovereignty. I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this \nbill and making Title IV-E programs available to all eligible children.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Gregg, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 551. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to simplify \nthe individual income tax by providing an election for eligible \nindividuals to only be subject to a 15 percent tax on wage income with \na tax return free filing system, to reduce the burdens of the marriage \npenalty and alternative minimum tax, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there is a great deal of discussion and \ndebate going on right now about cutting taxes. Everyone, it seems, \nsupports a tax cut although there is great disagreement over how big it \nshould be, when it should take effect and who it should benefit.\n  The American people deserve and need a tax cut, and I hope they will \nget one.\n  But there is another part to this discussion that's not getting much \nattention. The American people also deserve and need tax \nsimplification. There is broad agreement on this question, much broader \nand much deeper than any consensus on the need for a tax cut.\n  I think we ought to act to provide it.\n  Just a few months ago, the press reported several independent studies \nshowing that American families and business will spend at least $115 \nbillion trying to comply with federal tax laws this year. That is an \nenormous amount of money. It represents an enormous amount of time, an \nenormous amount of effort, and I'm pretty certain, it represents an \nenormous amount of frustration for tens of millions of American \ntaxpayers.\n  Lately there has been a lot of talk about lifting tax burdens, and we \nshould be talking about that, but let's also talk about one of the \nbiggest tax burdens of all: the tax compliance burden, the colossal \nhassle taxpayers face to file their tax returns each year. I think it \nis simply inexcusable that it is so complex, so difficult, and so \nexpensive for Americans to fulfill this basic civic duty.\n  I find it even more unacceptable that we should do nothing to lift \nthis burden, even as the nation is focused on lifting the tax burden \nwhen it comes to what is owed.\n  We must do both.\n  As I mentioned, taxpayers will spend somewhere around $115 billion \nand more than 3 billion hours this year in the effort to meet their \nfederal income tax obligations. At this very moment, millions of \ntaxpayers are probably just beginning the gut-wrenching process of \nwading through complex forms and instruction books so they can meet \nthis year's fast-approaching filing deadline. After completing this \nannual ritual, they will once again start barraging congressional \noffices with letters imploring us to simplify the tax code. I don't \nblame them for doing so.\n  They are right. Each little provision in the tax code has a \njustification, but together they add up to a big headache for the \nAmerican taxpayer. We can't blame the IRS for the misery endured this \nyear or in the years ahead. There's no way to truly simplify tax day \nunless Congress changes the underlying law. Nevertheless, the President \nand Congress appear ready to move forward with tax relief of possibly \nhistoric proportions without addressing the tax compliance burden that \nmost Americans urgently want fixed.\n  That's why I am pleased to be joined by Senators Gregg and Durbin in \nre-introducing a tax reform proposal that we call the ``Fair and Simple \nShortcut Tax'', FASST plan. Our plan would give most taxpayers the \nopportunity to pay their federal income taxes without having to prepare \na tax return if they so choose. More than thirty countries already \nenable their citizens to pay their federal taxes in this way. We \nbelieve tax simplification along these lines can work in this country, \ntoo.\n  Our bill is based on a principle that both sides of the aisle \ngenerally are eager to espouse, namely, choice. The bill would allow \ntaxpayers to choose to pay their taxes without complexity, paperwork \nand hassle. Those who prefer to use the current system, with its\n\n[[Page S2405]]\n\ncomplexity and expenses, could do so if they wanted. But if they want \nsomething simpler, they could choose our approach instead.\n  Under FASST, most taxpayers could forget about filing a federal tax \nreturn on April 15th. Instead, their entire income tax liability would \nbe withheld at work. There would be no more deciphering statements from \nmutual funds, no more frantic search for records and receipts, and no \nlast minute dash to the Post Office in order to meet the midnight \ndeadline. According to Treasury Department officials who have studied \nit, the FASST plan could give at least 70 million Americans the \nopportunity to elect the no-return option.\n  Specifically, under the FASST plan, most taxpayers could choose the \nno-filing option by filling out a slightly modified W- 4 form at work. \nUsing tables prepared by the IRS, their employers would determine the \nemployee's exact tax obligation at a single rate of 15 percent on \nwages, after several major adjustments, and withhold that amount. This \namount would satisfy the taxpayer's entire federal income tax \nobligation for the year, absent some unforeseeable changes in \ncircumstances.\n  The FASST plan would be available for couples earning up to $100,000 \nin wages and no more than $5,000 in other income such as interest, \ndividends or capital gains. In the case of individual taxpayers, the \nwage and non-wage income limits would be $50,000 and $2,500, \nrespectively. Popular deductions would continue under this plan: the \nstandard deduction, personal exemptions, the child credit and Earned \nIncome Tax Credit, along with a deduction for home mortgage interest \nexpenses and property taxes. Our bill would include critical \nsavings incentives for average Americans by exempting up to $5,000 of \nall interest, dividends and capital gains income from taxation for \ncouples, $2,500 for singles. Moreover, savings contributions made \nthrough employers would be excluded from the wage calculations in the \nbeginning.\n\n  Consider some of the advantages of this hassle-free plan:\n  No taxpayers would lose. If a taxpayer prefers to file an ordinary \nreturn, he or she would still have that choice, and no one would be \nforced to lose a tax deduction that he or she wants to keep.\n  Wages would be taxed at a single, low rate of 15 percent.\n  A deduction for home mortgage interest expenses, the Earned Income \nTax Credit, and other popular parts of our current tax code would be \npreserved. Other major tax reform plans would eliminate those \ndeductions, which many people count on.\n  The alternative minimum tax, AMT, and the marriage penalty would be \neliminated.\n  Compliance costs for taxpayers and government alike would fall. If 70 \nmillion Americans chose the FASST option, hundreds of millions of \ndollars now spent on paper pushing could be used in more productive \nways.\n  Those taxpayers who continued to file under the old system would get \nrelief too. The plan would reduce the marriage penalty by making the \nstandard deduction for married couples double the amount available for \nsingle filers. Also, it would virtually eliminate the complicated AMT \nfor most sole proprietors, farmers and other small businesses by \nexempting the first $1 million in self-employment income from the AMT \ncalculations. This legislation also would provide a 50 percent credit \nfor up to $1,000 in expenses that businesses might incur implementing \nthe FASST plan. In addition, it would grant taxpayers who continue to \nuse the current system a 50 percent tax credit for up to $200 in tax \npreparer expenses, provided they file their returns electronically. \nFinally, the bill would offer individuals a substantial incentive for \nsavings and investment by exempting up to $500 of dividend and interest \nincome, $1,000 for couples.\n  Our bill is both simple and fair, and it gives most taxpayers the \nchoice to avoid the annual tax filing nightmare that they have come to \ndread.\n  In testimony before a Senate subcommittee last year, IRS Commissioner \nRossotti testified that it's ``unquestionable that this bill provides \nsignificant tax simplification.''

A bill to help establish and enhance early childhood family \neducation programs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \ncreates a competitive grant program modeled on one of Minnesota's \ngreatest successes in education, the Early Childhood and Family \nEducation program. Let me first mention my gratitude to some of the \nfinest educators my home state has to offer--Betty Cooke, Lois \nEngstrom, Jackie Anderson, and Don Kramlinger. I would like to also \nthank Ernie Pines for his vision and spirit and former Minnesota State \nSenator Jerry Hughes, whose vision for early childhood education in the \nsixties has led to stronger families today. Of course, I must also \nthank the many early childhood education coordinators, parent \neducators, teachers and paraprofessionals in our small rural \ncommunities for reaching from within to give parents and their children \nevery opportunity to succeed.\n  The ECFE program, which has broad bipartisan support in Minnesota, is \nbased on the idea that the family provides a child's first and most \nimportant learning environment, and parents are a child's first and \nmost significant teachers. ECFE is a voluntary, center-based, parent-\nchild education program that is open to all families in a school \ndistrict or locality with children under the age of 5 regardless of \ncost. It provides concurrent or joint classes for parents and children \nthat include training in parenting skills and children's social, \nemotional, cognitive and physical development. The classes teach ways \nfor parents to foster strong learning environments for their children \nand ways to help prepare children for kindergarten. They provide \nactivities geared toward enhancing children's social, emotional, \ncognitive and physical development and school readiness.\n  ECFE is not a child care program, but rather offers parents a few \nhours a week to get the support they need to be better parents and \nteachers for their children through discussion groups, play activities \nfor kids, parent-child interactive activities, home visits, early \nscreening for health and developmental problems and community resource \nreferrals.\n\n  The program addresses the need of all communities and has been \nsuccessful in all communities and with all types of families, whether \nit is dealing with the unique needs of immigrant communities, \ncommunities of color, suburban communities, first time families, single \nparent families, families with members with disabilities, families with \na history of abuse and families that for whatever reason, want some \nextra help and support as they try to be the best parents that they \ncan.\n  The program in Minnesota has been extraordinarily successful. It is \nthe largest early childhood program in Minnesota and is now offered in \ndistricts that together encompass 99 percent of the population of \ninfants and toddlers in the state. 44 percent of all young children and \ntheir families participate in the program.\n  Four different studies of outcomes of the ECFE program have all \nconcluded that ECFE is effective with all types of families. Benefits \nfor children include improved social interactions and relationships, \nimproved social skills, increased self confidence and self-esteem, and \nimprovement in language and communication skills. For parents, ECFE \nincreases the ability to know what is important for children's healthy \ngrowth and development over time, improves their confidence and leads \nto far higher participation in parental involvement activities in \nelementary school.\n  A recent study by the Office of Educational Research and Improvement \nat the United States Department of Education has described the \nMinnesota ECFE program as an example of the type of program that can \nprovide children and families with ``continuity and [can] ease the \ncritical transition to school.''\n  The words of parents probably tell the story the best. One parent \nsaid, ``when my son throws things, I try to keep it in perspective. I \nno longer yell and slap. I relax and do not push him all the time. I've \nlearned different ways to discipline.'' Another said, ``Raising a child \nis a wonderful, awesome and sometimes overwhelming experience. It is a \nshame that a job so important is generally without adequate \npreparation. ECFE provides some of that preparation, knowledge and \nsupport that is vital to being a good parent. It is not a frill, it is \na necessity.''\n\n  Recently, I had the opportunity to spend a morning at the South \nWashington County School's ECFE program. There I met with a group of \nparents who were committed to being the best parents they could be. I \nmet a father who was learning English, a single mother who was learning \nchild raising skills from other mothers in the class, and a new \nimmigrant from Korea who talked of the isolation she felt before \nmeeting other parents in her community. This program was a model as it \ncombined Early Childhood Family Education with Adult Basic Education \ngiving parents the tools to not only be great parents, but to learn \nEnglish and obtain their GED as well. These parents told me that ECFE \nwas teaching them to better parent their children.\n  Last year, the Minnesota Early Care and Education Finance Commission, \na non-partisan Commission dedicated to improving the lives of young \nchildren in Minnesota, issued a report called ``The Action Plan for \nEarly Care and Education in Minnesota.'' That non-partisan Commission, \nled by Don Fraser, the former Mayor of Minneapolis, and Bob Caddy \nissued a challenge to the people of my state when they unequivocally \nconcluded that ``without question, the importance of the parent child \nrelationship must be asserted as a\n\n[[Page S2409]]\n\nfundamental moral value of our state.'' They asked for a ``new covenant \nbetween parents and Minnesota.''\n  Today I ask for the same between parents and the United States. The \nneed is so clearly established. 40 percent of all American children \nenter kindergarten unprepared for school. This is unacceptable. We know \nthat children need to be in a stimulating environment to spur the brain \ndevelopment that is critical to intelligence. We know the role that \nparents can play in creating that environment. ECFE will help with \nthis.\n  We have an obligation to do more for children. The whole debate \naround the elementary and secondary education act and our desire to \nclose the achievement gap between poor and more affluent students will \nbe moot if we do not intervene early. The achievement gap is greatest \nwhen children start school. If we want children to have an equal start, \nwe have to start with our youngest children. ECFE is not the only \nanswer, but it is one way to meet this covenant so aptly called for in \nMinnesota, that we have with our parents and our children.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. Murray (for herself, Ms. Collins, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. \n        Cantwell, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. Chafee):\n  S. 554. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nexpand medicare coverage of certain self-injected biologicals; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by \nSenators Collins, Mikulski, Cantwell, Cochran, and Chafee in \nintroducing the Access to Innovation for Medicare Patients Act of 2001. \nThis legislation will give Medicare patients access to innovative \nmedical treatments that are convenient and affordable and will remove a \nbureaucratic burden to promising new drugs.\n  For many years, patients with diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, \nmultiple sclerosis, hepatitis C and deep vein thrombosis could only get \neffective treatments in a doctor's office. This method of drug delivery \nputs a great burden on patients with limited mobility.\n  Fortunately, in recent years, new medical technologies have created \npromising drug treatments that patients can use in their own homes. \nThese drugs don't have to be administered by a doctor. Patients can \ninject the drugs themselves. So instead of traveling to a doctor's \noffice several times a week, patients can now get the same treatments \nin their own homes. These new treatments, known as self-injectible \nbiologics, mean patients can save time and have a better quality of \nlife.\n  Biologics are genetically-engineered proteins that must be infused or \ninjected into a patient to be effective. If swallowed orally, biologics \nsimply pass through the body during the digestion process and are not \nabsorbed into the system. These drugs represent a major breakthrough in \ndisease treatment and management.\n  Today, many patients with private insurance and those on Medicaid \nhave coverage for many self-injectible biologics. Unfortunately, \npatients on Medicare do not. Today, Medicare discriminates against \nthese effective medical treatments and patients are feeling the impact.\n  The time has come to remove this unfair burden and give Medicare \npatients access to self-injectible biologics. As sponsors of this bill, \nwe believe that Medicare should not discriminate against patients who \nare treated with the same drugs either in a doctor's office or at home. \nThe bill we are introducing today will correct this mistake and ensure \nthat Medicare patients have access to safe, promising drugs.\n  Our legislation has been endorsed by the Arthritis Foundation, the \nAmerican Public Health Association, National Association of Retired \nFederal Employees, National Council on the Aging, National Farmers \nUnion, National Hispanic Council on Aging, Association of Jewish Aging \nServices and the Visiting Nurses Associations of America.\n  I want my colleagues to understand that this bill does not address \nthe broader need for prescription drug coverage overall. Congress still \nmust address that hole in the Medicare system. But this bill does \ncorrect a clear mistake in Medicare's payment rules for self-\ninjectible biologics.\n\n  This unfair policy has several consequences. First, it prevents \npatients from getting the treatments they need. The FDA has recently \napproved several new self injected biologics to treat rheumatoid \narthritis, multiple sclerosis, hepatitis C and deep vein thrombosis. \nMedicare beneficiaries should have immediate access to these new \ntreatments without delay. Many of these diseases hinder a patient's \nmobility and quality of life. It is difficult to explain to these \npatients that in order to have treatments covered they must travel to \ntheir physicians office once, twice or even three times a week. Many of \nthese patients are disabled and depend on family or friends for \ntransportation. Patients in rural areas are particularly hurt by this \npolicy, where their doctor may be many miles away. These patients might \nhave to drive 50 or 60 miles a week. For individuals living on fixed \nincome, this policy is especially difficult.\n  This outdated policy hits women the hardest. As many of my colleagues \nknow, more women are covered by Medicare, and women are twice as likely \nas men to live with a disabling, chronic condition. Women are also \ntwice as likely as men to live in poverty after age 65. Older women or \ndisabled women simply do not have the same economic resources as men. \nIn addition, many of the illnesses that could be treated with self \ninjected biologics strike women in larger numbers. Rheumatoid arthritis \nand multiple sclerosis most often affect women. Any policy that limits \naccess to new innovative treatments for rheumatoid arthritis and \nmultiple sclerosis places women at a severe disadvantage.\n  In addition to the impact this policy has on patients, it also affect \ndrug development. This practice discourages drug companies from \noffering patients new drugs that are self-injectible. That can hinder \ninnovations and developments in biotechnology research. In the future, \ncompanies may choose not to develop self injected biologics. Our \npolicies should promote new drug development, not discourage it.\n  As you know, the U.S. Senate has voted overwhelmingly to doubling NIH \nfunding to encourage more research. it's one of my top priorities, and \nwe are on track. However, I am troubled that patients on Medicare might \nnot benefit from our efforts. It is counterproductive to invest in \nmedical research, but then deny Medicare beneficiaries the fruits of \nthat investment.\n  I would like to briefly mention one particular new self-injected \nbiologic treatment that has literally changed the lives of hundreds of \nRA patients. This particular treatment, Enbrel, took well over 10 years \nto develop and bring to patients. Since its introduction, however, it \nhas dramatically improved the lives of RA suffers. I have heard from \nmany patients about how Enbrel has allowed them to remain productive \nand how it has dramatically reduced their daily pain and suffering. \nSince RA can and does lead to disability, preventing or delaying the \ndisabled effects of this disease means huge economic savings for all of \nus. Medicare should not discriminate against this new, patient-friendly \ntherapy simply because it is self-injected.\n  I urge my colleagues to carefully review this legislation and to talk \nto patients and health providers about how an outdated policy hinders \naccess and discourages innovation and how the measure we are \nintroducing today can give Medicare patients access to innovative \ndrugs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 555. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nrequire the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a \ntolerance for the presence of methylmercury in seafood, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last month the Food and Drug Administration \nissued new consumer guidance, warning pregnant women, women of \nchildbearing age, nursing mothers, and young children not to eat shark, \nswordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish in order to avoid exposure to \nmethylmercury. I commend the FDA\n\n[[Page S2410]]\n\nfor issuing this guidance, which is important information for the most \nvulnerable members of our population. Unfortunately, despite \nacknowledging the problem of mercury contamination in large fish, the \nFDA still has not revised its so-called ``action level,'' which is \nimportant data for consumers and local governments, nor do they enforce \nthis level. There is a lot more to be done to protect the public, and \nafter so many years of delays, we should not wait any longer.\n  That is why Senator Harkin and I are introducing important \nlegislation today to promote food safety and protect thousands of \nAmericans, especially pregnant women and young children, from the \nserious risks of methylmercury. The ``Mercury-Safe Seafood Act of \n2001'' requires the Food and Drug Administration to establish a formal \ntolerance for safe methylmercury levels in seafood. It mandates seafood \ntesting to ensure compliance, along with public education and health \nadvisories to inform the public.\n  Mercury is a dangerous poison that is still not fully regulated in \nthe United States. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, \ncoal-fired power plants, waste incinerators, and other sources spew 150 \ntons of mercury into the atmosphere each year. Although new and \nexpected EPA rules address much of this pollution, full compliance and \nlarge emission reductions are still years away. Much of this mercury \nreturns to earth with rain to pollute our waterways. It accumulates in \nfish as methylmercury, especially in large predatory species, and is \npassed on to the humans who eat these fish. Methylmercury is a powerful \nneurotoxin that affects the human central nervous system. It is \nespecially harmful to pregnant women, infants, and young children, \nwhere even small doses can cause permanent damage to their developing \nbrains and nervous systems.\n  Last year's comprehensive report by the National Academy of Sciences, \n``Toxicological Effects of Methylmercury,'' estimates that 60,000 \nnewborns each year may be at risk from prenatal mercury exposure. Two \nweeks ago, the Centers for Disease Control released preliminary results \nfrom an ongoing study showing that 10 percent of American women may \nhave potentially hazardous levels of mercury. This means that a lot \nmore newborns may be at risk. This is a public health problem we cannot \nignore.\n  Certain commercial seafood species--large predators such as \nswordfish, shark, mackerel, and tuna--can have dangerously high levels \nof methylmercury contamination. Food and Drug Administration data \nthroughout the 1990's showed numerous fish samples with high mercury \nlevels, exceeding FDA's own action level and presenting a direct hazard \nto consumers. FDA stopped testing for mercury in 1998, which means they \nhave no way to enforce their action level. Yet recent testing by \nindependent organizations still shows high mercury levels in some fish \nspecies.\n\n  FDA's action level of 1.0 part per million was established in 1979 \nusing information from the 1970's, without regard for the greater \nvulnerability of pregnant women, infants, and children. More recent \nstudies have highlighted the damaging effects of mercury, especially \nfor these populations. In 1997, EPA's ``Mercury Study Report to \nCongress'' recommended a level five times more strict than FDA's action \nlevel, and this was confirmed by last year's National Academy of \nSciences report. FDA's current action level, even if there were \nsampling and enforcement, is not stringent enough to protect the most \nvulnerable American consumers from mercury.\n  Last month the General Accounting Office released a report on seafood \nsafety, at the request of Senator Harkin and Senator Lugar. That report \nconfirms that FDA has not acted vigorously enough to address the issue \nof mercury in seafood.\n  This bill seeks to remedy these problems. It amends the Federal Food, \nDrug, and Cosmetic Act to require a tolerance level for methylmercury \nin seafood, with special attention to pregnant women, infants, and \nchildren. This will replace FDA's outdated and unenforced action level \nwith a formal tolerance that must be enforced. It mandates ongoing \nsampling of mercury levels to ensure compliance. This will restart the \ntesting which FDA stopped three years ago. It mandates public education \nand health advisories to ensure the public is aware of the new \nstandards and of the risks of mercury contamination in seafood. It \nrequires consideration of last year's National Academy of Sciences \nreport, which clearly shows the need for prompt, strong action. \nFinally, it authorizes modest appropriations to support not only FDA's \nsampling and public education but also the efforts of our States to \nprotect our citizens from methylmercury in freshwater fish.\n  I enjoy fishing and I love eating fish. This legislation is not meant \nto harm the fishing industry--it is meant to help bring the safest fish \nto market for the American consumer. Most importantly, this bill will \nprotect pregnant women and young children who may now unknowingly be \nexposed to high levels of mercury. No one can dispute the science that \ntells us mercury is toxic and unsafe at certain levels in fish. We need \nto bring those levels down. But, until we do, we also need to keep the \nfood supply safe for all Americans--especially those most at risk.\n  We have a responsibility to protect the American public, especially \nour children.

A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to reduce emissions from \nelectric powerplants, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am here to announce the \nintroduction of the Clean Power Act of 2001 which reduces emissions \nfrom power plants of the four primary air pollutants. These four \npollutants, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, mercury, and carbon \ndioxide are the major cause of the nation's most serious public health \nand environmental problems: smog, soot, acid rain, mercury \ncontamination, and global warming. The Clean Power Act set standards \nfor these four serious pollutants that are both cost-effective and \ntechnologically feasible.\n  The 1970 Clean Air Act, and its subsequent amendments, were enacted \nto improve the quality of our nation's air. This was a major milestone \nin environmental legislation. I was proud to be one of the principle \nnegotiators of the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act. Those were \nimportant steps to take to improve the quality of our Nation's air and \nsince that time we have made significant headway in that direction. \nAlthough current legislation sets standards for nitrogen oxides and \nsulfur dioxide, they are at levels that we now know are far too high to \nprotect us from the devastating effects of resulting smog, acid rain, \nand increased respiratory disease. Currently, there is no standard for \ncarbon dioxide pollution, the primary greenhouse gas responsible for \nglobal warming, and no standard for mercury emissions, a dangerous \npollutant linked to cognitive and developmental ailments in children \nand responsible for fish advisories in forty states. Therefore, there \nis still much to be done to protect the quality of our nation's air and \nnow is the time to take the next step.\n  Electric generating power plants are our nation's single largest \nsource of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Annual power \nplants emissions are responsible for 64 percent of the nation's sulfur \ndioxide, or 13 million tons, 26 percent of the nitrogen oxides, or 6 \nmillion tons, 40 percent of the carbon dioxide, that's over 2 billion \ntons, and 52 tons of mercury.\n  Updating electric power plants represent the most cost-effective way \nto reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide. Many of the \nmost polluting power plants were exempt from stringent controls imposed \nby the original Clean Air Act and today, after more than 30 years, they \nare still in use. As a result, these outdated power plants can emit \nbetween 10 and 100 times the amount of nitrogen oxides and sulfur \ndioxide pollution emitted by a modern power plant.\n  Sulfur dioxide fine particle pollution for U.S. power plants cuts \nshort the lives of over 30,000 people each year. Ground-level ozone \nsmog triggers over 6.2 million asthma attacks each summer in the \neastern United States alone; another 160,000 people are sent to the \nemergency room and 53,000 are hospitalized due to smog induced \nrespiratory distress. The National Academy of Sciences' National \nResearch Council has concluded that over 60,000 children are born in \nthe U.S. each year at risk for adverse neurodevelopmental effects due \nto in utero exposure to mercury. Over forty states have issued fish \nconsumption advisories to mitigate this threat. Power plants are our \nnation's largest unregulated source of mercury emissions.\n  Fortunately, we now have technologies available that will permit\n\n[[Page S2412]]\n\npower plants to reach the levels set in the Clean Power Act. The \nnitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and mercury reductions are set at \nlevels in the Clean Power Act that are known to be cost effective with \navailable technologies. The Clean Power Act will allow power plants to \nuse market-oriented mechanisms in order to reach these much needed \nemissions standards for nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and carbon \ndioxide. Therefore, with new technologies at our disposal and trading \nmechanisms providing flexibility to the utilities, we no longer need to \ncompromise the health of our great nation; neither it's citizens nor \nit's environment. We only need the will to act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Bingaman).\n  S. 557. A bill to clarify the tax treatment of payments made under \nthe Cerro Grande Fire Assistance Act; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is a simple bill that stands for \nthe proposition that when the Federal Government burns your house down \nit is not a taxable event.\n  I can't believe any member of this chamber would argue that the \nFederal Government is so hard up for revenue that it would try to tax \nthe very payment that it makes to someone whose home, business, and \ncommunity it burned down.\n  Let me summarize the events:\n  The Park Service decided to start a fire--a so-called ``controlled \nburn.''\n  The Park Service didn't follow its own guidelines regarding when it \nis safe to conduct a controlled burn.\n  They lit a fire when the rules were clear that they shouldn't.\n  The fire raged out of control and burned 48,000 acres.\n  It burned down hundreds of homes, and businesses.\n  No dispute that this fire should never have been set.\n  Congress passed a bill to compensate the victims for their losses.\n  When Congress passed the Cerro Grande Fire Assistance Act we were \nassured that the FEMA payments to the victims of the Cerro Grande Fire \nwould not be taxed under current law.\n  Well, apparently there are some in the IRS who now have a different \nview.\n  While it only took Congress 50 days from the day the fire was lit to \nthe day legislation creating the claims process was signed into law, it \nhas taken the IRS at least seven months to answer pretty basic \nquestions, and the best they can offer is that people have extra time \nto file their income taxes.\n  These victims should be paid. They should rebuild their lives and the \nIRS shouldn't be trying to tax the payments that are intended to put \nthem back to the same place they were on the day before the Park \nService lit the fire.\n  I hope my colleagues will support me in expeditiously passing this \nbill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCain (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Baucus, \n        and Mr. Campbell):\n  S. 558. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax credits for investment in Indian reservation economic development, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation, \nalong with my colleagues, Senators Daschle, Inouye, Baucus and \nCampbell, to foster economic investment, development, and growth in \nNative American communities. This legislation would establish \ninvestment tax credits that will serve to attract private sector \ninvestments on Indian reservations.\n  As a nation, the United States ranks third in entrepreneurial \nactivity among the world's leading economies. The level of \nentrepreneurial activity in the country remains strong despite recent \nfluctuations in the market. However, what also remains are deep pockets \nof poverty in our country that have not substantially improved along \nwith the economic growth that has swept the rest of our Nation, and \nthose areas include Native American reservations.\n  During my tenure in the Congress, I have worked on various \nlegislative initiatives to help Indian tribes address the problems and \nbarriers they face in attracting private sector activity onto \nreservation areas. Indian country, both historically and at the present \ntime, cannot successfully compete with other areas in attracting \nbusinesses due to the unique issues affecting Indian country, such as \njurisdictional complexities, taxation, and infrastructure deficits. \nMost Indian communities continue to struggle to provide basic jobs, \ninfrastructure, housing and telephone service to tribal members.\n  Some of my colleagues might only be aware of the handful of Indian \ntribes that have been successful in generating economic revenues \nthrough gaming activities. However, for the majority of Indian tribes, \nthe main economic activity is the kind generated by federal or tribal \ngovernment employment. I understand why this is the case, but I also \nbelieve that free enterprise must be allowed to flow freely on Indian \nlands as it does in the rest of our nation.\n  By their very nature, governments, including tribal governments, \nsimply are not good at running businesses. I know this is acknowledged \nby many tribes, who, consistent with their cultural traditions, have \ncreated tribal corporations or cooperative ventures that mix private \nsector business with tribal principles. I believe that private \ninvestment needs to be encouraged on Indian reservations if we are to \nsee a significant improvement in the economies of Indian tribes.\n  The investment tax credits we are proposing today are geared \nspecifically to Indian reservations where there is economic need. The \nfull credit is available to those reservations whose Indian \nunemployment rate exceeds the Nation's average unemployment by 300 \npercent. One-half of the credit is available on reservations where the \nunemployment rate is 150 to 300 percent of the national average. No \ninvestment tax credit is provided where the Indian unemployment rate is \nless than 150 percent of the national average. The bill is restricted \nto non-gaming related economic activity, which would prevent the \ninvestment from being used for development and/or operation of gaming \nestablishments on Indian reservations.\n  While this legislation may not be the panacea for all the economic \nills afflicting Indian reservations today, I believe that the adoption \nof a specific program of Indian tax incentives would be a critical step \ntoward the goal of providing Indian tribal governments with the \nopportunity to strengthen their economies.\n  In previous Congresses, I have offered amendments to the federal tax \ncode to create incentives for private sector investment on Indian \nreservations and remove inequities in the tax code so that tribal \ngovernments can enjoy the same tax benefits accorded other nontaxable \ngovernment entities. I have offered these provisions, not to provide an \nadvantage to Indians, but merely to give them the same kind of tax \nincentives and benefits the Congress has given other economically \ndepressed areas and other units of government. We have been successful \nin enacting a few measures, but given the extremely underdeveloped \neconomies of Native American communities, I believe we should enact \nthese additional tax incentives.\n  My colleagues and I are sponsoring this measure today because we \nbelieve these investment tax credits are necessary to reach out to \nthose tribal communities that do not have the economic advantage of \nliving near a booming metropolitan area, or do not enjoy the benefits \nof Indian gaming revenue. We believe that a strategy of tax incentives \nsuch as this legislation proposes is the most effective way that the \nfederal government can act to stimulate reservation economic \ndevelopment. Tax incentives do not depend for their effectiveness on \nthe actions of federal bureaucracies that are often slow-moving and \nunimaginative. The incentives are usable only by viable businesses \nready and able to invest in Indian communities, which will consequently \nfoster a strong entrepreneurial environment on Native American \nreservations.\n  I look forward to working with my respective colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle to enact this important legislation. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 558\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Indian Reservation Economic \n     Investment Act of 2001''.\n\n[[Page S2413]]\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to reform the financing of Federal elections; to the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I realize that I am not going out on a \nlimb here, but I want to say this: I support Campaign Finance Reform. \nTo that end, today I am introducing the Campaign Finance Integrity Act \nof 2001.\n  My bill would:\n\n       Require candidates to raise at least 50 percent of their \n     contributions from individuals in the state or district in \n     which they are running.\n       Equalize contributions from individuals and political \n     action committees, PACs, by raising the individual limit from \n     $1000 to $2500 and reducing the PAC limit from $5000 to \n     $2500.\n       Index individual and PAC contribution limits for inflation.\n       Reduce the influence of a candidate's personal wealth by \n     allowing political party committees to match dollar for \n     dollar the personal contribution of a candidate above $5000.\n       Require corporations and labor organizations to seek \n     separate, voluntary authorization of the use of any dues, \n     initiative fees or payment as a condition of employment for \n     political activity, and requires annual full disclosure of \n     those activities to members and shareholders.\n       Prohibit depositing an individual contribution by a \n     campaign unless the individual's profession and employer are \n     reported.\n       Encourage the Federal Election Commission to allow filing \n     of reports by fax machines and other emerging technologies \n     and to make that information accessible to the public on the \n     Internet less than 24 hours of receipt.\n       Ban the use of taxpayer financed mass mailings.\n\n  This is common sense campaign finance reform. It drives the candidate \nback into his district or state to raise money from individual \ncontributions. It has some of the most open, full and timely disclosure \nrequirements of any other campaign finance bill in either the Senate or \nthe House of Representatives. I strongly believe that sunshine is the \nbest disinfectant.\n  The right of political parties, groups and individuals to say what \nthey want in a political campaign is preserved--but the right of the \npublic to know how much they are spending and what they are saying is \nalso recognized. I have great faith that the public can make its own \ndecisions about campaign discourse if it is given full and timely \ninformation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/15/senate-section/article/S2414-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 25--HONORING THE SERVICE OF THE 1,200 \n  SOLDIERS OF THE 48TH INFANTRY BRIGADE OF THE GEORGIA ARMY NATIONAL \n   GUARD AS THEY DEPLOY TO BOSNIA FOR NINE MONTHS, RECOGNIZING THEIR \n     SACRIFICE WHILE AWAY FROM THEIR JOBS AND FAMILIES DURING THAT \n DEPLOYMENT, AND RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF ALL NATIONAL GUARD \n AND RESERVE PERSONNEL AT HOME AND ABROAD TO THE NATIONAL SECURITY OF \n                           THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. MILLER (for himself and Mr. Cleland) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, I know my colleagues are accustomed to \nseeing me leave the Chamber 5 minutes after the last vote to catch a \ntrain to go home. As a colleague said today when I indicated I was \ngoing to speak this evening, they are sorry to see I am not on the \ntrain today. They are very happy that I commute every day.\n  The reason I am speaking at this time is that I did not want to \npostpone the vote on the bankruptcy bill which, I might add, to state \nthe obvious, passed overwhelmingly, with overwhelming bipartisan \nsupport. Only 14 Democrats voted against it and 1 Republican, as I best \ncounted. So this was an overwhelming vindication of the point that this \nbill is at least thought by the vast majority of the Senate in both \nparties to be a fair and equitable bill.\n  But I want to go into some detail on this point, and it will take me \nsomewhere in the range of 10 to 15 minutes to do it. This is the one \nportion of the bill that particularly Democratic colleagues most asked \nme about: Are women and children disadvantaged by the new bankruptcy \nlaw we passed today, assuming it becomes law after conference and is \nsigned by the President? The resounding answer is: No.\n  When some in the credit industry came to me and asked for my support \nfor this legislation early on, I indicated I would be unable to support \nthe legislation as initially proposed several years ago. I thought it \nrequired some significant changes. And not to my surprise, but to my \nsatisfaction, there was little or no opposition to the proposed changes \nwith which I was most concerned. I want to thank Christian Cabral, who \nis with me this evening on the floor, for putting together the material \nI asked for, which I am about to speak to, which will demonstrate just\n\n[[Page S2417]]\n\nhow much better off women receiving alimony or support payments are \nunder the new proposed legislation, which just passed out of here with \n83 votes, than they are with the present law.\n  As I have indicated, I have heard a lot in recent days about how this \nbill lacks compassion--specifically, that it will hurt women and \nchildren who depend on alimony or child support. The critics claim that \nby making sure more money is paid back to other creditors, this bill \nwill make it harder for women and children to get payments that should \nbe coming to them through alimony and child support.\n  Mr. President, I am particularly proud of my record in protecting \nwomen and children during my 28-year career in the Senate. I am most \nproud of my work in drafting and passing the Violence Against Women \nAct, to protect women who are victims of domestic violence and all \nviolence. I am also proud of my work to track down and hold responsible \ndeadbeat dads.\n  As long ago as 1992, I was on the Senate Democratic task force for \nchild support enforcement. While I was chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, we enacted two major child support initiatives. As far as I \nam concerned, this bill is an extension of years of work on my part and \nothers' to protect and enhance family support enforcement.\n  I am here today to show that, contrary to a lot of the rhetoric we \nhave heard tossed around on this floor over the last couple weeks, this \nbill actually improves the situation of women and children who depend \nupon child support. I specifically would like to speak to how this bill \ntargets the problems they now face under the current bankruptcy law and \nturns the bankruptcy system into a virtual extension of the current \nnational family support collection system.\n  S. 420, the bill we just passed, is so far superior to current law \nthat the National Child Support Enforcement Association, representing \n60,000 child support professionals, supports it. These are the people \nfrom Salt Lake City to Wilmington, DE, in their family courts or \nwhatever you call them in your respective States, who have the job of \ncollecting support that is ordered by the court or agreed to in a \nsettlement by a father for his children. Sometimes it is a mother, but \noverwhelmingly it is the father who has a support requirement to take \ncare of the financial needs of the children who are with the mother. \nThese are 60,000 child support professionals, hardly harsh people.\n  The National Council for Child Support Directors supports the \nlegislation we just passed.\n  S. 420 is so far superior to current law that the National \nAssociation of Attorneys General supports this law. The association's \nletter of support is personally signed by 27 State attorneys general.\n  The attorney general of the State of Vermont endorses the family \nsupport protection in this legislation.\n  The attorney general of Minnesota endorses this law, along with the \nattorneys general of Illinois, Massachusetts, California, Montana, \nNorth Carolina, Michigan, Maryland, Iowa, Hawaii, and Washington.\n  S. 420, the bill we passed tonight, is so far superior to current law \nthat the National District Attorneys Association, representing more \nthan 7,000 local prosecutors, supports this legislation.\n  In particular, California embraces this bill, the California Family \nSupport Council, whose 2,500 enforcement professionals carry out the \nchild support program in California. The California District Attorneys \nAssociation, consisting of elected district attorneys from each and \nevery one of California's 58 counties and over 2,500 deputy district \nattorneys--they all support this bill that we were told is so heartless \nto children and women.\n  Support enforcement professionals west of the Mississippi support \nthis bill. The Western Interstate Child Support Enforcement Council, \ncomposed of child support professionals from the private as well as the \npublic sector west of the Mississippi, wanted this bill passed.\n  Finally, the corporation counsel of the City of New York supports the \ndomestic support provisions. Yes, even New York City loves this bill.\n  Why has this legislation earned such overwhelming support from \nprofessionals who are out in the field, who are in the trenches trying \nto collect money from regular dads and deadbeat dads who owe child \nsupport for their children or alimony to their wives if this is such a \ncompassionless bill? They support it because the system is broken and \nthis bill fixes it.\n  When a deadbeat dad files for bankruptcy under the current system, \nwhat happens to mom and the kids? If the dad is actually making \npayments, those payments stop. They stop now. That is right, the \npayments stop cold. Mom then has to find a lawyer or a government \nadvocate, take time off from work, go to the bankruptcy court, and try \nto get those payments started again.\n  When she goes to court, her claim may not be heard that day, so she \nwill have to return again. If she is late, she will miss her day in \ncourt. In the meantime, the kids are getting no support payments.\n  This bill changes all that. She will be paid, and her children will \nget their child support payments while every other creditor has to wait \nfor the bankruptcy court proceedings to unfold. This is a major \nimprovement over current law.\n\n  Rather than putting women at a disadvantage, this bill empowers \nwomen. It gives them a say in the bankruptcy proceedings relating to \nher absent spouse. Once a father is under a bankruptcy plan and he \nfails to make his support payments, a mother can march to bankruptcy \ncourt and ask the court to dismiss his bankruptcy plan.\n  The court will call the dad back to explain himself. He does not want \nto make payments during the bankruptcy plan: that is what he says. That \nis how it was before. He did not have to do it before. Fine. He can be \nthrown out of bankruptcy and find himself back at square one.\n  Under current law, when the dad's bill collectors show up in the \nbankruptcy court, mom has to fight with them over the child support.\n  In asserting her claim, she is not the No. 1 collector in the line, \nnor No. 2, 3, 4, or 5. She is No. 7 in line, the seventh to be paid. \nThe current code handicaps her at the starting line by permitting other \nbill collectors to beat her in the race to get dad's assets.\n  Why is this so important? As a practical matter, she does not have to \nfind room in her hectic schedule to make an appearance in bankruptcy \ncourt, an intimidating place for most people. She can go to work \nwithout interrupting her day. She can run her errands. She can pick up \nher kids from school and, under this bill, she will automatically be \nfirst in line for her support and alimony claim. She will continue to \nreceive her payments during the bankruptcy proceeding.\n  When we pass this bill, she does not have to work her way through the \nbankruptcy system; the system will work its way for her, not against \nher.\n  Another provision added to this bill in the managers' package was the \nmoment the husband declares bankruptcy, the bankruptcy court is \nrequired to file with and notify, immediately, the spouse. So just in \ncase the old man had not mentioned that he has these payments and there \nis not a record of it, she knows immediately. The court is required to \nnotify the spouse if he files for bankruptcy.\n  The system will work for the mother. That is the beauty of the bill. \nIt is self-executing. The provisions to be added to the bankruptcy code \nwill function automatically, and that is vital. Women who do not have a \nlawyer to help them will be most helped by this aspect of the bill.\n  Under the current code, they have to get an attorney, go to court and \nassert their claims, and, again, they are No. 7 when they assert their \nclaims.\n  There are other important ways in which this bill will remove real \nobstacles to justice that exist in the current bankruptcy law. This \nbill not only lifts the stay on support payments in bankruptcy--let me \nemphasize that.\n  The husband goes into Delaware and files for bankruptcy. What \nimmediately happens is a stay on all the payments he makes occur. The \nfamily court wonders why he ``ain't'' paying. They automatically stay \nthe payment when they get a notice that he has filed for bankruptcy. \nBankruptcy can go on for weeks, months--a long time. In the meantime, \nwhat does that mother do? How does she feed her children if, in fact, \nthat is her primary source of income for her children?\n\n[[Page S2418]]\n\n  That is how it works now. That is how it works now in almost every \nState.\n  I have an order in my pile of papers. I will refer to the order.\n  In my home State of Delaware, a woman went to court and requested a \nrestraining order against her abusive husband. He had already filed for \nbankruptcy. Incredibly, the judge found that under the current \nbankruptcy code, a proceeding for a domestic abuse restraining order is \nautomatically stayed.\n  Did my colleagues hear what I just said? This is a woman who says she \nis being abused. She wants an order to keep her abusive husband away \nfrom her. The husband has filed for bankruptcy, and the court finds \nthat under the current bankruptcy code, a proceeding for a domestic \nabuse restraining order is automatically stayed ``by operation of \nlaw.''\n  All those folks who stand on the floor--and I heard them lecture me \nabout how abusive this law is--do not understand the present system and \nthe part we are trying to correct and what we do correct in this \nbill. That is right. We have judges out there right now who look at \ntoday's bankruptcy code and find that filing bankruptcy stops all other \nproceedings. They find we have failed to write an exception for \nproceedings such as those for domestic violence. They find their hands \nare tied.\n\n  Then they send a woman in here to get the bankruptcy court to lift \nthe automatic stay so she can go back into court and get a stay to keep \nthe abusive husband away from her. This bill permits that restraining \norder to go forward, while the current law does not do that.\n  If anyone thinks it is fair, if anyone prefers this state of \naffairs--and I know the Presiding Officer does not--I guess you will \nthink we passed a bad bill. Personally, I am proud of this bill. I am \nsurprised opponents failed to take note of the important improvements \nthis bill has made for women and children. If they have their way in a \nconference or when it comes back here, women and children in this \ncountry depending on alimony and child support will be robbed of real \nprotections we have in this bill. I think that would be a crime.\n  This is another way the bill provides women with the resources and \nthe influence they now lack under the current bankruptcy code. Section \n219 of the bill requires the U.S. bankruptcy trustee to notify a woman \nof her rights to use the services of her State child support \nenforcement agency, and gives her the agency's address and phone number \nthe moment the husband files. Better yet, the trustee, likewise, \nnotifies the agency independently of the woman's claim.\n  That is striking. The bankruptcy judge is now, if we pass this law, \nrequired to notify the child support agency of what is going on, in \naddition to the woman. A woman who needs help will get information they \nneed because the bankruptcy system is charged with reaching out to \nfamily support professionals, acting under the family Federal support \ncollection law, which I helped pass, and putting them at the service of \nwomen and children who need these services.\n  This last item needs stressing because so much has been made about \nwhat will happen after someone who owes family support payments comes \nout of bankruptcy. The claim is that ``a more powerful creditor will \npush women and children aside and strip the dad bare before he can make \nany payments to his family.'' That makes for a very moving story. \nHowever, it is plain, ordinary fiction. As one of our former colleagues \nused to say, with his great sense of humor, Senator Simpson of Wyoming, \nhow many times through the years I served on this floor with him in the \nJudiciary Committee, and he turned and said: I understand the gentleman \nis entitled to his own opinion, but he is not entitled to his own \nfacts. He is not entitled to his own facts.\n  The facts are, that after the bankruptcy payment is made, after they \nhave worked out if they are in a chapter 7, afterwards, the bankruptcy \ntrustee is required to notify both the woman and the family support \ncollection professionals about the dad's release from bankruptcy, his \nlast known address, the name and address of his employer, and a list \nnaming all of the bill collectors that will still be there trying to \ncollect from dad. This section helps mother both during and after \nbankruptcy. The new notification procedures will help a mother and the \nsupport enforcement agencies keep track of the father, where he is \nworking, and what other bills he is required to pay. Because of this \nmonitoring, which would be put in place by the bankruptcy system under \nthis bill, mothers and collection agencies can more easily go to court \nand get that portion of the father's wages that now belong to them. Dad \nmay complete his bankruptcy plan, but his obligations to mom will not \nstop.\n\n  These new procedures guarantee that family support claims of women \nand children will always receive No. 1 priority during and after \nbankruptcy. The process for obtaining a portion of the father's wages, \nthrough a wage attachment, already guarantees priority to women and \nchildren over all other collectors, whoever they are.\n  Under the wage attachment, the money is taken out of his paycheck \nbefore he even sees it. He can't be forced ``by powerful creditors'' to \nchoose between them and his alimony or child support. These payments \nare automatic. Again, the picture of the greedy bill collector, rushing \nin front, elbowing mom out of line, and the starving children, is a \ndynamic story-telling device, but it is only that--story telling. It is \na plain story. As I said, quoting my friend from Wyoming, everyone is \nentitled to their own opinion, but not their own facts.\n  Even if a father does not earn wages, support enforcement agencies \nstill have many tools to ensure that the mother and children get paid. \nSupport enforcement agencies can intercept taxes, unemployment \nbenefits, revoke driver's license, professional recreational licenses, \ndeny passports, institute criminal and contempt proceedings. All of \nthis she is unable to do now because she doesn't know where dad took \noff to but the bankruptcy court is required, even after he works out a \nbankruptcy, to tell her, and tell her who the collectors are. That is \nwhy, even compared to any imaginary powerful creditor you might be able \nto conjure up, mother and children have real, tangible, protections and \nresources at their disposal to bring a first priority claim against \nfather's wages after bankruptcy, or anything else dad has.\n  Finally, let me conclude where I began, with the enthusiasm for this \nlegislation that we have heard from the folks in the trenches. This is \nwhat the National Association of Attorneys General asserts. The bill \n``improves the treatment of domestic support obligations,'' and when \nthe current code ``obstacles are removed, as this legislation seeks to \naccomplish, we believe that our State and local support enforcement \noffices will continue to be able to collect those moneys effectively, \nregardless of whether the lower priority creditors remain.''\n  The National District Attorneys Association, with more than 7,000 \nlocal prosecutors in their membership, is convinced that women and \nchildren will not be disadvantaged by this bill. ``To the contrary, \nsupport collectors have vastly more effective, and meaningful, \ncollection readiness before a bankruptcy case is filed, or after the \ncase is completed, than any other financial institution. It is under \nthe current law, during bankruptcy, that support collectors have the \ngreatest difficulty, because they are in competition with all other \ncreditors for bankruptcy estate assets and because their most effective \ncollection remedies have been stayed. This legislation provides a major \nimprovement to the problems facing child support creditors in \nbankruptcy proceedings.''\n  I worked very hard to see that many of these things got in the bill. \nI support enthusiastically the reform that enforcement professionals \ncall for from New York City to California, from Minnesota to Vermont, \nfrom Massachusetts to Michigan. I want to save women and children from \nhaving to fight their way through a broken bankruptcy system, and even \nif they get there, they end up seventh in line. I want to make some \nsystem work for them and not against them. I believe all those who \nvoted for this bill today voted to do just that. That is why I so \nstrongly supported the bill.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/15/senate-section/article/S2419-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2419-S2420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S2419]]\n                 YUGOSLAV FORCES ENTER THE BUFFER ZONE\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the agreement \nconcluded this week under which NATO is allowing limited, selected \nunits of the armed forces of Yugoslavia to reenter a part of the so-\ncalled Ground Safety Zone in extreme southern Serbia, opposite the \nsoutheastern tip of Kosovo.\n  This decision, which I consider to be a wise one, was prompted by the \nescalating violence of three loosely organized ethnic Albanian guerilla \ngroups, which collectively call themselves the ``Liberation Army of \nPresevo, Medvedja, and Bujanovac'', or UCPMB.\n  These insurgents have taken advantage of the unintended military \nvacuum in the GSZ to operate with virtual impunity and take control of \nmuch of the small border area.\n  In this context, it is important to note that NATO's decision was \nquickly followed by a one-week cease-fire agreement between the rebels \nand the Yugoslav Government.\n  The Ground Safety Zone was created in the Presevo Valley as part of \nthe Military-Technical Agreement concluded in June 1999 at the end of \nOperation Allied Force, the Kosovo Air War. It is a five-kilometer-wide \nstrip, which was intended to separate the NATO-led troops occupying \nKosovo from the Yugoslav Army and Serbian police in Serbia proper.\n  In the last half-year the situation has changed fundamentally. \nSlobodan Milosevic, the authoritarian war-criminal who was responsible \nfor starting four bloody wars in eight years, was deposed last October \nafter he tried to thwart the will of the Yugoslav electorate.\n  Although some of his successors have extreme nationalist backgrounds \nof their own and, in the case of Yugoslav President Kostunica, often \nvoice rather other-worldly anti-American pronouncements, they are \ndemocrats and represent a significant break with Milosevic.\n  Therefore, NATO believes that the troops under its command in Kosovo \nno longer must fear attacks from Yugoslav units across the border in \nSerbia proper. In short, NATO, through this week's agreement, has given \nan important, if limited, vote of confidence in the new administration \nin Belgrade.\n  Again, this ground security zone, which coincidentally, as I know the \nPresiding Officer knows, is an area of southern Serbia bordering Kosovo \nwhich is predominantly Albanian. We did not put that ground security \nzone there because we were worried about the Albanian extremists, \nalthough we worry about them. We put it there so you wouldn't have the \nSerbian Army under Milosevic's command facing off border to border with \nNATO forces. That is why it was put there.\n  In the meantime, there is no evidence that the KLA, the Kosovo \nLiberation Army, and its former leaders, Mr. Hashim Thaci and Mr. \nRamush Haradinaj, are involved in these raids going on in that area of \nthe Presevo Valley.\n  In light of that, when I spoke to Major General George W. Casey, who \nis in charge of Camp Bondsteel and the KFOR forces in that sector, \nabout a month ago, he proposed two things: One, that the Serbs have to \ncome up with a political solution to deal with the plight of the \nAlbanians living in Serbia who are denied political representation. In \nthe meantime, we had to think about working out an agreement whereby in \nat least part of the Ground Safety Zone, we would allow patrols by the \nSerbian military to stop the infiltration of these renegade Albanian \nguerrilla forces who are seemingly not united, but who could cause the \nspark for a new war in the region.\n  Meanwhile, the UCPMB attacks have grown bolder, and small groups of \nethnic Albanian gunmen have begun attacks in the Former Yugoslav \nRepublic of Macedonia, just across from southern Kosovo.\n  This latter outbreak of violence stems from local conditions, not the \nleast of which is common criminality. Although the two insurgencies are \nfundamentally different--the ethnic Albanians in Macedonia have full \nrights and are represented in the highest levels of the national \ngovernment--there has been a steady stream of smuggling of arms between \nthe two areas. Moreover, this smuggling route goes directly through the \nsector of the GSZ that is to be re-occupied. NATO obviously hopes that \none beneficial aspect of this week's agreement will be the interdiction \nof this smuggling route.\n  Incidentally, I believe that the Bush Administration made a mistake \nby refusing to go along with the proposal by our British allies for \nentry of KFOR troops into the Groud Safety Zone to help pacify the \narea.\n  Here I must underscore that the overall plan for the Presevo Valley \nis not a purely military one. It has an important civilian component, \nworked out by Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Covic. I will return to \nthat aspect in a few minutes.\n  Several articles in today's press have given sketchy outlines of what \nhas been agreed upon. I believe, however, that since American troops \nare directly involved in this new situation, it would be wise to go \ninto greater detail for the benefit of the Members of this chamber and \nfor American citizens.\n  First of all, the GSZ, Ground Safety Zone, has not been narrowed or \notherwise reduced. The Commander of KFOR intends to permit certain \nforces of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, popularly known as the \nFRY, to enter the small Sector C, East, of the GSZ on specified dates \nand times.\n  The presence of FRY forces is subject to the authorization of the \nKFOR Commander, who retains the right to revoke his authorization in \nthe event of a violation of the specified terms and conditions. Now to \nthe most important specific military conditions in the agreement.\n  First, no FRY forces or authorities will be permitted to enter \nKosovo. The agreement applies only to the GSZ in Serbia proper.\n  Second, no FRY or Serbian irregular or paramilitary forces are to \nenter the GSZ. Only regular forces are involved.\n  I will not take the time, but there is a gigantic difference between \nthe regular FRY forces and the paramilitary forces that were \nresponsible for the horrible damage and the horrible atrocities in \nKosovo and other places.\n  Third, several categories of equipment and weapons systems are \nprohibited from the sector to be re-occupied by FRY units, and are not \nto be used to fire into Kosovo.\n  They include: tanks, helicopters, towed and self-propelled artillery, \nmultiple launch rocket systems, mortars greater than eighty-two \nmillimeters, anti-tank guns and guided missiles, and cannon greater \nthan thirty millimeter caliber, anti-aircraft and air defense weapons \nsystems, and mines and booby-traps of all types.\n  I am sorry to go into such detail, but it is important that this be \nin the Record.\n  Fourth and finally, FRY forces and authorities will at all times \nrespect and ensure fundamental human rights and will abide by the \nprovisions of all international humanitarian law conventions and \ncovenants and the Geneva Convention. Monitoring of FRY forces will be \nconducted by the European Union.\n  NATO has insisted that the commanding officers of the FRY forces \ngoing back into the GSZ must not have been involved in any of the \natrocities committed in Kosovo in 1998 and 1999.\n  Nonetheless, today's New York Times reported that the returning \nforces included General Pavkovic, the Chief of the General Staff of the \nYugoslav Army, and General Lazarevic, the head of the national \nparamilitary police, both of whom compiled a record of brutality in \nKosovo two years ago.\n  Upon hearing this, my staff contacted U.S. Ambassador William \nMontgomery, who was on the scene in the Presevo Valley, to ascertain \nwhat had happened.\n  His report illustrates both the progress in democratization that \nSerbia and Yugoslavia have made, and also how much more there is to do \nin that regard.\n  Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Covic--as I said, who I met with for \nhours and is a democrat and a decent man--had been given authority to \nset up a special military unit to conduct the reentry of Yugoslav \nforces into the small southernmost area of the Ground Safety Zone.\n  He placed in charge a general, with loyal subordinates, all of whom \nwere not associated with the brutality in Kosovo 2 years ago.\n  And, in fact, as of this morning there has not been any real \nviolations of the cease-fire by either side.\n\n[[Page S2420]]\n\n  Now comes the intrigue that illustrates the split in the Belgrade \nGovernment. Without informing anyone in advance, General Pavkovic went \ndown to the Presevo Valley and went into the Ground Safety Zone in a \nwhite jeep--in a white jeep, like some tinhorn dictator--stayed about \nan hour to assert his authority as Chief of the General Staff of the \nArmy, and then left.\n  Deputy Prime Minister Covic, a decent man about whom I will shortly \nspeak, was apparently livid. In a press interview he snapped: ``The \ndogs of war must go, no matter how important the positions they \noccupy''--obviously referring to the Chief of the General Staff of the \nArmy who rode around in his white jeep like some tinhorn dictator.\n  We should not kid ourselves. Milosevic is gone from power, but many \nof his most important henchmen in the military and the police are \ntrying to hang on to their posts.\n  I hope, and expect, that President Kostunica--who personally \nemphasized his commitment to constitutional government to me 2 months \nago in Belgrade--will shortly dismiss General Pavkovic, and General \nLazarevic, and other military leaders who have Kosovar blood on their \nhands. President Kostunica must realize that this is a litmus test for \nYugoslav democracy.\n  Mr. President, earlier I mentioned the so-called Covic Plan, drawn up \nby the Deputy Prime Minister of Serbia.\n  In January, I had a lengthy meeting with Mr. Covic and his senior \nadvisors. I judge him to be a genuine democrat who can be trusted.\n  In fact, he already has won the grudging confidence of most ethnic \nAlbanians in the Presevo Valley with whom he has been in negotiations.\n  The Covic Plan has six fundamental elements, which are intended to \ncreate long-term stability, but keep the Presevo Valley as part of \nSerbia.\n  First, Serbia and the FRY commit to solving the crisis by political \nand diplomatic means.\n  Second, there will be no special status or border changes for \nPresevo, Medvedja, and Bujanovac. I am getting good at these names, but \nnot good enough, Mr. President.\n  Third, there will be no constitutional changes. Ethnic Albanians in \nthe area will be integrated into the existing system.\n  Fourth, representatives of human rights organizations and the media \nwill have free access to the area.\n  Fifth, both the Serbian and ethnic Albanian sides in the area will \ndemilitarize.\n  And sixth, and most important, the ethnic Albanians will be \nintegrated into the political, economic, and social systems of the \nPresevo Valley--in other words, the new government in Belgrade pledges \nto reverse the shameful discrimination and persecution of ethnic \nAlbanians in the area carried out by Milosevic and his thugs.\n  Mr. President, NATO's move this week was calculated, and it was a \ntwo-part gamble. First, we are betting that the new government in \nBelgrade has made a clean break with the ruthless, racist, and \nexploitative policies of Milosevic.\n  Second--and this is probably more of a stretch--we are hoping that \nthe majority of ethnic Albanian guerillas will permanently lay down \ntheir weapons if they see that Covic and his plan are being implemented \nin good faith and is producing tangible results.\n  I should add that if the Serbian and Yugoslav authorities meet their \npart of the bargain, we should be ready to provide economic and \nhumanitarian assistance to the Presevo Valley.\n  Mr. President, one, or even both of these gambles may not pan out. If \nthat happens, we, in concert with our allies, will have to recalibrate \nour policies.\n  But in the highly complex and emotionally charged current situation, \nthis agreement is, I believe, a risk necessary to take.\n  As I have said innumerable times on this floor and elsewhere, the \nstakes for the United States in creating stability in the Balkans are \ntoo high for us to walk away from this problem.\n  Either we remain intimately engaged politically, militarily, and \neconomically or, I am firmly convinced, at some future date we will \nhave to go back into a newly devastated Balkan area with a much higher \ncost.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank the pages. I thank the staff. I thank \neverybody for indulging me until 7:20 at night. But, Mr. President, I \nthink it is vitally important that we all know what we are undertaking \nin the Presevo Valley and what we are undertaking in Kosovo. I am \nconvinced we have no choice but to proceed as we have.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I thank the Senator from Delaware.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/15/senate-section/article/S2420-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, MARCH 19, 2001\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
