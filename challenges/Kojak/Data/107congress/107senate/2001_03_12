Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a subject of major \nimportance to the national security of the United States--the \nmaintenance of our nuclear weapons stockpile.\n  For most of the nuclear age, the United States has relied on nuclear \ntesting to ensure that our nuclear weapons remained safe, secure, and \nreliable. Our country conducted more than one thousand nuclear tests in \nfurtherance of these goals. In July 1992, President George Bush \nannounced that the United States would suspend underground testing. We \ninitiated the Stockpile Stewardship Program, which was designed to \nreplace detonations at the Nevada Test Site with computer simulations.\n  In 1999, concerns about the Stockpile Stewardship Program were a \ncritical element of the Senate debate over ratification of the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty. It was unfortunate that the Senate was \nforced to take up the treaty in a highly politicized atmosphere. The \nCTBT was not a new subject, but in 1999, the Senate was not prepared to \ndevelop the consensus necessary to ratify a major treaty with far-\nreaching consequences for U.S. security.\n  I opposed ratification of the CTBT, because I did not believe that \nthe treaty's verification and enforcement provisions would be \nsuccessful. Equally important, I was concerned about our ability to \nmaintain the integrity and safety of our nuclear arsenal under the \nconditions imposed by the treaty.\n  The United States must maintain a reliable nuclear deterrent for the \nforeseeable future. The end of the cold war provided tremendous \nnational security benefits, but the necessity of our nuclear deterrent \ndid not disappear. The transformation of the former Soviet Union has \npermitted the United States to consider lower numbers of nuclear \nweapons, but the current security atmosphere does not permit us to \nconsider their elimination.\n  Our nuclear arsenal continues to play a critical role in ensuring the \nsecurity of the American people. It also plays a role in the security \ncalculations of friends and allies around the world. Many of them have \nforegone potentially destabilizing arms build-ups and weapons \nprocurement programs because of the nuclear umbrella provided by the \nUnited States.\n  During the CTBT debate, I expressed my concern that the Senate was \nbeing asked to trust the reliability of our nuclear stockpile to a \nStockpile Stewardship Program that was both unproven and unlikely to be \nfully operational for a decade or more.\n  There remains strong disagreement among many nuclear experts and \nnational security leaders about the efficacy of maintaining a nuclear \nstockpile without testing. As Senators, we do not have the luxury of \ntaking a chance on the Stockpile Stewardship Program. The restrictions \nimposed by the CTBT could have harmed the national security of the \nUnited States if we could not ensure the safety and reliability of our \nnuclear weapons stockpile without testing. We cannot allow our nuclear \nweapons to fall into disrepair or permit their safety to be \njeopardized.\n  Now unfortunately, little progress in advancing the Stockpile \nStewardship Program appears to have occurred since the 1999 Senate \ndebate. Our new Secretary of Energy, Spencer Abraham, recently \ntestified before the Armed Services Committee that:\n\n       The Department of Energy has allowed its nuclear-weapons \n     production plants to degrade over time, leaving a tremendous \n     backlog of deferred maintenance and modernizations. The \n     deterioration of existing facilities is a very serious \n     threat.\n\n  Under the Stockpile Stewardship Program, the United States will \ndepend on these facilities to inspect our nuclear arsenal and to \nreplace degraded weapons.\n  I am particularly concerned by the uncertainty surrounding the \nconstruction of the National Ignition Facility, the NIF, which was \nprofiled in a recent episode of the ``Jim Lehrer Newshour.'' The NIF is \nintended to play a key role in the Stockpile Stewardship Program and \nthe annual certification of the U.S. nuclear stockpile. The National \nAcademy of Sciences and others recommended the construction of the NIF, \nwhich will simulate thermonuclear conditions. This facility would be \ncritical to evaluating our nuclear weapons arsenal in the absence of \ntesting. The Academy stated that such a facility was necessary because \nnearly all of the 6,000 parts of a nuclear weapon change with age.\n  Yet at present, the NIF is 4 years behind schedule and approximately \n$1 billion over budget. These are dismal omens. Even more disconcerting \nis that the National Science Foundation and others have estimated the \nNIF's chances of success at only about 50 percent. It is alarming to \nlearn that the possibility of success for a critical component of our \nStockpile Stewardship Program can only be characterized as 50/50.\n  Some supporters of the CTBT, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, have \nsuggested that the stockpile could be maintained without the NIF by \nreplacing old warheads with new warheads manufactured to the same \nspecifications as the originals. They also have posited that current \nwarheads could be rebuilt with fresh nuclear material.\n  Yet many nuclear experts regard these strategies as unreliable. This \nis why both the former Bush and Clinton administrations moved forward \non the Stockpile Stewardship Program. According to the Lawrence \nLivermore National Laboratory, it is impossible to guarantee that new \nwarheads manufactured to old specifications will work reliably. Neither \nis replacing the nuclear core of existing weapons a viable option. \nNuclear material contained within weapons changes with age. As the \nnuclear material changes, so does its effects on the other components \nof the warhead. If one attempted to maintain weapons by periodically \nreplacing their nuclear cores, the older warhead components around the \npits would not be matched to the new nuclear material. Under these \nconditions, the warheads would not necessarily function as originally \ndesigned.\n  Even many proponents of the CTBT do not believe that U.S. nuclear \nweapons can be maintained in the absence of an effective Stockpile \nStewardship Program. Most notably, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff, General John Shalikashvili, who conducted extensive review of \nthe CTBT following the Senate's rejection of the treaty, outlined the \nneed for an effective Stockpile Stewardship Program. His review \nemphasized that the program was needed to provide the people, \nknowledge, equipment, and facilities necessary to accomplish three \ntasks: First of all, to enhance surveillance of weapons in the \nstockpile to monitor for age-related changes and to identify other \ndefects; second, to deepen the scientific understanding of how nuclear \nweapons work and how they age so that we are better able to spot \npotential defects; and, third, to remanufacture components and \nrefurbish warheads using an updated nuclear weapons complex. General \nShalikashvili offered his strong support for the Stockpile Stewardship \nProgram and reiterated its necessity in the absence of testing.\n  But if we are going to depend on the Stockpile Stewardship Program, \nit must be reliable and accurate, Recently, the Panel to Assess the \nReliability, Safety and Security of the U.S. Nuclear Stockpile found:\n\n     . . . growing deficiencies in the nuclear weapons production \n     complex, deep morale and personnel problems, continued \n     slippage of program milestones, and unacceptably high risks \n     to the completion of needed weapons refurbishments.\n\n  The panel, established by Congress in the 1999 Defense authorization \nbill, was tasked with providing an assessment of the Stockpile \nStewardship Program. The panel's concerns led to numerous \nrecommendations, including: one, stopping the slippage in stockpile \nlife-extension programs; two, restoring missing production capabilities \nand refurbishing the production complex; three, stopping the slippage \nin development of tools needed to make future assessment of the \nstockpile's safety and reliability; and four, responding to the low \nmorale at the weapons laboratories. The panel concluded that the \nproblems within our nuclear weapons complex are ``unacceptable,'' and \nthey warned that the situation could decline further. The report states \nthat:\n\n       Worrisome deterioration of nuclear components has already \n     been found. Moreover, the history of the stockpile has \n     demonstrated many surprises, and weapons are entering an\n\n[[Page S2141]]\n\n     age regime for which we have no prior experience.\n\n  Furthermore, the Stockpile Stewardship Program simply will not be \nready in the near term, even if its deficiencies can be fixed. Dr. \nMichael Anastasio, the associate director of defense and nuclear \ntechnologies at the Livermore Lab, has stated that we will not know for \n``at least ten years'' whether the Stockpile Stewardship Program can be \na viable replacement for testing.\n  I am concerned that while our country's nuclear experts are still \ndebating the composition and efficacy of the Stockpile Stewardship \nProgram, we not rush into another ill-prepared attempt to ratify the \nCTBT. It is difficult to envision how the Senate could be asked to \nreverse its position of 2 years ago by placing its faith in a program \nthat not only is incomplete, but whose exact components are still a \nsource of debate.\n  Some proponents of the treaty have argued that the United States can \nratify the CTBT regardless of potential stockpile problems, because the \nUnited States has the ability to withdraw from the treaty should we \nlose confidence in our stockpile. I disagree. First, the Clinton \nadministration originally cited withdrawal as an emergency escape \nhatch, not an option on which to base nuclear policy. And \nsecond, withdrawing from the treaty would send a damaging signal to our \nallies and foes around the world on the status of our nuclear \nstockpile.\n\n  If the U.S. were to abrogate the CTBT, citing the safety and \nreliability of the stockpile, our friends and allies would question the \ncredibility of the nuclear umbrella itself that plays a vital role in \ntheir security. Enemies and foes would question America's strength and \nconfidence in the status of our nuclear arsenal.\n  Secretary of State Colin Powell stated during his confirmation \nhearing that the administration ``will not be asking for the Congress \nto ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in this next session.'' I \nbelieve this is a wise course of action. The United States may be in a \nposition to ratify the CTBT at some point in the future, but not today.\n  I understand the impulse of proponents of the CTBT to express United \nStates leadership in another area of arms control. Inevitably, arms \ncontrol treaties are accompanied by principles that envision a future \nin which international norms prevail over the threat of conflict \nbetween nations. However, while affirming our desire for international \npeace and stability, the U.S. Senate is charged with the constitutional \nresponsibility of making hard judgments about the likely outcomes of \ntreaties. This requires that we examine the treaties in close detail \nand calculate the consequences of ratification for the present and the \nfuture. Viewed in this context, I could not support the treaty's \nratification in 1999, nor for the reasons I have just expressed could I \nsupport ratification now.\n  The Bush administration's position not to request immediate Senate \nconsideration of this treaty is prudent. I am hopeful that proponents \nand opponents alike will not force the Senate into another \ncounterproductive debate, particularly when prospects for a different \noutcome in the Senate have not improved since 1999.\n  Instead, we should reinvigorate bipartisan efforts on the broader \nquestion of arms control and non-proliferation, as well as explore \nimprovements in technology. Even during the fractious CTBT debate in \nthe Senate, many of us on both sides of the issue, including Senators \nWarner, Levin, and Moynihan, were working together to delay treaty \nconsideration and build a consensus on arms policy for the short term.\n  Our goal now should be to achieve sufficient technological progress \nto permit confidence in the Stockpile Stewardship Program. Both \nproponents and opponents of the CTBT have a mutual interest in this \ngoal, because the safety and reliability of our weapons depend on it. I \nhave urged the Bush administration to maintain a strong commitment to \nthe program and support the funding necessary to correct problems.\n  In addition, the United States should work with allies to develop \ntechnological means through which we might improve verification \ntechniques and capabilities. The current shortcomings of the CTBT's \nverification regime are very serious, but we should remain open to \ndiplomatic or technological developments in the long run.\n  I am confident that there does exist within the Senate a strong \ndesire to work toward a consensus on arms policies. I urge my \ncolleagues to join in this effort.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the managers are not on the floor. I \nwill wait to offer my amendment until there is a manager on the other \nside. I want to speak for 10 minutes as in morning business. I ask \nunanimous consent that I be allowed to speak for 10 minutes as in \nmorning business and then be allowed to lay down my amendments.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Mr. President, I will return to the bankruptcy bill. \nWe marked up an education bill in the HELP Committee. There were a \nnumber of us who said we will vote for the bill out of committee in \npart because I do think Senator Jeffords, Senator Kennedy, and others \ndid yeoman work in trying to work together, and in part because there \nare some parts of this bill that are very important.\n  For my own part, for several years now, I have been trying to get us \nto adopt legislation which deals with children who witness violence in \ntheir homes. There has been, thank God, more of a focus on the violence \nagainst women--sometimes men, almost always women. Every 13 seconds \nduring the day, a woman is battered. Home should be a safe place.\n  There has not been a whole lot of focus on children who witness this \nviolence and the ways in which it affects their work in schools. All \ntoo often, these children fall between the cracks.\n  An amendment was adopted to bring together out of the schools some \ncritical support services for these children.\n  I want to repeat what I said during the committee markup, which is, \nif this bill, the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, comes to the floor before we have had an honest and \nthorough discussion of the budget and before we have some idea of the \ncontext of the tax cuts to the budget, then I will be in strong \nopposition. I hope Senators on our side and on the other side will be \nas well. Let me explain.\n  First, I find the President's tax cut proposal to be Robin Hood in \nreverse. Anytime over 40 percent of the benefits go to the top 1 \npercent and anytime one-third of the children in our country are living \nin homes that do not get a dime from this, and over 50 percent of \nAfrican American children live in families that do not get a dime, and \n56 percent of Hispanic children live in homes that do not receive one \ndime from this ``tax relief'' because it is not refundable, then \nsomething is terribly wrong with such a piece of legislation. I do not \nthink it meets any standard of fairness. That is part of the problem.\n  But there is another part of the problem. I hope Democrats will be \nstrong on this because the fact of the matter is, here is where you \ndraw the line: If you are saying that we are going to have Robin-Hood-\nin-reverse tax cuts with over 40 percent of the benefits going to the \ntop 1 percent, but we are not going to be able to afford prescription \ndrug costs for elderly and other families, then I think Democrats draw \na line there.\n  If we are going to have Robin Hood in reverse, with over 40 percent \nof the benefits going to the top 1 percent, but, as a matter of fact, \nwe are not going to realize the goal of leaving no child behind, and, \nas a matter of fact, we are going to have a tin-cup budget for \neducation, and, as a matter of fact, we are not going to expand the \ntitle I program where only 30 percent of low-income children are able \nto get any help right\n\n[[Page S2142]]\n\nnow, and we are not going to make the kind of commitment to the IDEA \nprogram, children with special needs, funded at only 14 percent when it \nshould be funded at the 40-percent level, or we are not going to make \nthe commitment to decent, affordable child care so children can come to \nschool, kindergarten ready, or we are not going to make a commitment to \nexpanding health care coverage for citizens in our country when so many \npeople go without health security, either because they have no coverage \nor they can't afford their coverage--it seems to me this is the place \nwhere Democrats can draw the line. We don't need to have acrimonious \ndebate, but we do need to have substantive debate, I argue passionate \ndebate.\n\n  Frankly, I put all of my faith in people in Minnesota and around the \ncountry, when it comes to the question of priorities. To me, what we \nhave is distorted priorities. We have a tax cut program, Robin Hood in \nreverse. Over 40 percent of the benefits are going to the top 1 \npercent. There is no standard of fairness when it comes to tax relief \nfor people, tax relief for families. Moreover, nobody should kid \nanybody; this will erode the revenue base and make it practically \nimpossible to make any of the investments that we say we are going to \nmake when it comes to children, when it comes to education, when it \ncomes to health care, when it comes to affordable prescription drug \ncosts.\n  The vast majority of the people in the country, if they understand \nthis is the choice, want to see us do more by way of investing in \neducation, investing in children, investing in health care, investing \nin their families, investing in our communities.\n  This will become the axis of the debate of the Senate and I think \nAmerican politics. I believe it is very important the Democrats draw \nthe line in a very firm way.\n  I say to my colleague, Senator Grassley, I have some amendments I am \nready to introduce to the bankruptcy bill. I asked unanimous consent I \nbe able to proceed. I assume that is all right with the manager.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I wonder if the Senator will provide copies of the \namendments.

Madam President, I will summarize these amendments \nbefore we get into whatever debate might take place. I say to the \nSenator from Iowa, as he looks over the amendments, one of the \namendments I am hoping will meet with his approval. Let me explain them \nvery quickly and then go into the payday loan amendment.\n  The first amendment is protecting the legal rights of retirees of \nbankrupt companies. This amendment simply clarifies companies in \nbankruptcy must fulfill their legal obligations as plan administrators \nand plan sponsors of employee and retirement benefit plans. I think \nSenator Sessions has some interest in this amendment, as well.\n  Companies occasionally stop administering benefit programs during \nbankruptcy. This means retiree benefit plans are left without anybody \nin charge, which results in the failure to pay out benefits to workers \nsuch as reimbursements for covered health care costs. This often occurs \ntoward the end of bankruptcy, either a 7 or 11, when there is not much \nleft of the business. The company's management and bankruptcy trustees \nare trying to wind up the business, and the benefit programs quite \noften end up falling between the cracks.\n  I have a specific situation in Minnesota but I know Senator Sessions \nand others can talk about this in their own States. In Minnesota, LTV \nCorporation shut down and 1,300 people are out of work. People have no \njobs. They are out of work. Those out of work, the younger workers, are \nterrified they will lose their health care coverage in 6 months. Those \nwho worked longer will lose coverage within a year. But the retirees \nare terrified they will not have their health care benefits any longer \nafter the bankruptcy proceeding. The persons ordinarily responsible for \nthe management of the benefits programs may have been laid off and \nthose who remained refuse to administer the plan. This can happen.\n  Or it may be a ``lights out bankruptcy'' where the power is shut off, \nthe doors are locked, and all functions of the company cease. However, \neven in these cases, the firm is required to either terminate any \nbenefit plans or to continue to administer them.\n  This is what our amendment does. We don't impose any new burdens on \nthe companies. The companies are already required by law to continue to \nadminister the plans that have not been terminated or to administer \nplans that are part of the trust. This amendment simply results in \ncompanies fulfilling their current legal obligations without any \nexpensive litigation on the part of the workers. We are just trying to \ncodify this into law.\n  Let me talk about how this helps LTV workers and retirees. Health \ncare and other benefits for retirees at LTV are guaranteed by a trust \nfund known as the Voluntary Employee Benefit Association Trust Fund, \nalso referred to as the VEBA trust funds. The trust cannot be wiped out \neven if LTV is liquidated in bankruptcy, but LTV must administer the \nVEBA for workers to get any of the benefits and guarantees. We have no \nreason to believe as of now that LTV will not fulfill its obligation to \nadminister the VEBA. This amendment simply provides added assurance in \ncase the worst happens. So it is an important amendment for a lot of \nretirees who are worried that somehow through the bankruptcy processes \ncompanies are not going to provide them with their retiree benefits.\n  I will give a real-world example of the worst case scenario. In \nAugust of 2000, Gulf States Steel in Alabama locked its doors after \nfailing to conclude a chapter 11 reorganization. Over 1,000 \nsteelworkers immediately, and with little warning, lost their jobs. The \nunion had ordered a VEBA trust as part of the workers' contract. That \ntrust, made up of employee contributions, is intended to cover the \ncosts of retiree health plans under just this scenario.\n  Gulf States still refuse to administer the trust so the assets and \nincome are not being used to cover the workers' health care costs.\n  Since September of last year, Gulf States retirees have effectively \nhad no health care coverage because they cannot access the resources of \ntheir own VEBA.\n  Absent the changes made in the bankruptcy law by this amendment, the \nunion will be forced to file an expensive and lengthy lawsuit to force \nthe company to comply with the law. The lawsuit could take months--for \nall I know, it could take years --to resolve and will do little to \naddress the immediate needs of the retirees. Again, as the several \nexamples I have given indicate, I think this is almost a fix.\n  I am hopeful there will be support for this amendment. It is \ncertainly the right thing to do. It is one of several amendments I want \nto lay down.\n  The second amendment is the payday loan amendment. I assume since we \nare talking about this today that there\n\n[[Page S2143]]\n\nmay be some time to talk about it. This is an amendment to protect the \nlegal rights of retirees of bankrupt companies which I hope fits in \nwith my colleague's definition of reform.\n  The second amendment I propose is an amendment that almost passed \nlast Congress. I hope it will pass this time. It will curb a form of \npredatory lending which targets low- and moderate-income families.\n  I apologize for having to read. Usually I don't do that. But I am not \na lawyer. I find some of these proposals and some of the language of \nbankruptcy to be technical and not all that easy.\n  This amendment would prevent claims in bankruptcy on high-cost credit \ntransactions in which the annual interest rate exceeds 100 percent.\n  I know my colleague from Iowa doesn't much like the payday loan \namendment. I know that. I have heard him speak about it. That is what I \nam talking about, these payday loans and car title pawns.\n  Payday loans are intended to extend small amounts of credit--\ntypically $100-500--for an extremely short period of time--usually a \nweek to two weeks. The loans are marketed as giving the borrower ``a \nlittle extra till payday,'' hence the term payday loan. The loans work \nlike this: the borrower writes a check for the loan amount plus a fee. \nThe lender agrees to hold the check until an agreed upon date and give \nthe borrower the cash. On the due date, the lender either cashes the \ncheck or allows the borrower to extend the loan by writing a new check \nfor the loan amount plus an additional fee. But calculated on an annual \nbasis, these fees are exorbitant. For example, a $15 fee on a two week \nloan of $100 is an annual interest rate of $391 percent. Rates as high \nas 2000 percent per year have been reported on these loans.\n  I am just saying I don't think that crowd ought to have claims under \nbankruptcy that are resolved for these high-cost transactions with the \nkind of exorbitant and outrageous interest they can charge.\n  Car title pawns are one month loans secured by the title to vehicles \nowned by the borrower. Typical title pawns cost 300 percent interest. \nConsumers who miss payments have their cars repossessed. In some \nStates, consumers do not receive the proceeds from the sale of \nrepossessed vehicles--even if the value of the car far exceeds the \namount of the loan! For example, a borrower might put up their $2000 \ncar as collateral for a $100 car title loan--at an outrageous interest \nrate--and if the borrower defaults, the lender can take the car, sell \nit, and keep the full $2,000 without returning the excess value back to \nthe borrower. Such schemes are almost more lucrative if the borrower \ndoes default! Often, the borrower is required to leave a set of keys to \nthe car with the lender, and if the borrower is even one day late with \na payment he might look out the window and find the car gone.\n  I don't think these kind of lenders ought to be given special \ntreatment. Nobody needs to charge this type of interest rate for a \nloan. Indeed, this industry is grossly profitable as a result. An \ninvestors report by Stephens Incorporated on the industry stated that \nan operator of a payday lending establishment could expect a return on \ninvestment of 48 percent in nine months to a year and could expect \nprofit margins to be in excess of 30 percent! As a result, the payday \nloan industry has exploded in growth in states with favorable \nregulatory systems and many more states have changed their laws to \nallow this type of lending. California has seen 1,600 payday loan store \nfronts spring up since the legislature made the business legal in 1997. \nWisconsin went from 17 store fronts in 1995 to 183 in early 1999. \nStephens Inc. reported that there were 6,000 storefronts making payday \nloans in 1999 across the country, but estimates the potential \n``mature'' market as being 24,000 stores nationwide generating $6 \nbillion in fees. With these kinds of profits, only your conscience will \nkeep you out of this business.\n  I say to my colleague, these sleazy debt merchants expanding their \ntentacles into our cities and towns is the mirror image of the retreat \nof mainstream financial institutions from these same communities.\n  Poor people are forced to get their loans from these loan sharks. As \nbanks merge and close branches, their former customers--often unable to \naccess the new, consolidated locations--have little choice but to deal \nwith the seamy underbelly of the financial services industry.\n  That is what I am talking about. And the Stephens report notes, that \neven with the market saturated, lenders need not expect losses in \nprofits which is further evidence that the payday lender truly has a \ncaptive customer base who has little market power to drive prices down.\n  We are talking about the exploitation of vulnerable citizens and poor \npeople who are charged outrageous interest rates, and we should do \nsomething about it.\n  This was a close vote last time. I expect to win the vote on this \namendment this time.\n  The worst part is that many borrowers are unable to pay the loan when \nit comes due. They then extend the loan, for another fee and then \nextend it again. Often such borrowers may end up carrying several \npayday loans and rolling them over from week to week as the fees \nskyrocket. Additionally, there is a perverse incentive for the lender \nto encourage the borrower to defer payment on the loan, because of the \nadditional fee that the lender can charge for deferring the loan for \nanother week or two weeks. It is fine for these unscrupulous loan \nsharks to extend the loan. According to an analysis by brokerage firm \nPiper Jaffrey as reported in the Washington Post, ``established \ncustomers'' of one payday lender engage in 11 transactions per year and \ncould end up paying $165 to $330 for a $100 loan.\n  The following from the June 18, 1999 New York Times is typical of the \nhorror stories associated with payday lending, quote:\n\n       Shari Harris who earns around $25,000 a year as an \n     information security analyst, was managing money well enough \n     until the father of her two children, 10 and 4, stopped \n     paying $1,200 in child support. ``And then,'' Ms. Harris \n     said, ``I learned about the payday loan places.'' She \n     qualified immediately for a two-week $150 loan at Check Into \n     Cash, handing it a check for $183 to include the $33 fee. ``I \n     started maneuvering my way around until I was with seven of \n     them,'' she said. In six months, she owed $1,900 and was \n     paying fees at a rate of $6,000 a year. ``That's the sickness \n     of it,'' Ms. Harris said. ``I was in a hole worse than when I \n     started. I had to figure a way to get out of it.''\n  Madam President, I could go on and on. I think my colleagues know \nwhat this is about. Let me just simply say, there is no question that \nthese high-interest-rate loans take advantage of low- and moderate-\nincome working people. On the face of it, paying 300 percent or 500 \npercent or 800 percent for a $100 loan or $200 loan is unconscionable, \nbut that is exactly the issue. These folks may not always have a \nchoice.\n  Often borrowers turn to payday lenders and car title pawns because \nthey cannot get credit any other place. So these borrowers are a \ncaptive audience, unable to shop around to seek the best rates, are \nuninformed about their choices, and unprotected from coercive \ncollection practices. There is no way the borrower can win. At best \nthey are robbed by high interest rates, and at worst their lives are \nruined by a $100 loan which spirals out of control.\n  These loans, I say to my colleague from Iowa, and others, are \npatently abusive. They should not be protected by the bankruptcy \nsystem. And because they are so expensive, they should be completely \ndischargeable in bankruptcy so debtors can get a true fresh start and \nso more responsible lenders' claims are not ``crowded out'' by these \nshifty operators.\n  Why should unscrupulous lenders have equal standing in bankruptcy \ncourt with a community banker or a credit union that tries to do right \nby their customers? Lenders should not be able to take advantage of \ntheir customers' vulnerability through harassment and coercion.\n  My amendment simply says, if you charge over 100 percent annual \ninterest on a loan, and the borrower goes bankrupt, you cannot make a \nclaim on that loan or the fees from that loan. In other words, the \nborrower's slate is wiped clean of your usurious loan, and he or she \ngets a fresh start. Additionally, such lenders will be penalized if \nthey try to collect on their loan using coercive tactics.\n  I say to Senators, I am going to repeat this one more time today. And \nI assume tomorrow, before the vote, I will have a chance to summarize.\n\n[[Page S2144]]\n\n  The amendment says, if you charge over 100 percent annual interest on \na loan, and the borrower goes bankrupt, you cannot make a claim on that \nloan or the fees from that loan. These borrowers are going to be wiped \nclean of the lender's usurious loan, and they get a fresh start. \nAdditionally, what this amendment says is that these lenders are going \nto be penalized if they try to collect by using coercive practices.\n  I do not know how anybody can vote against this amendment. But that \nhas happened to me before on the floor of the Senate. I have said that. \nAmendments do not always get adopted. This amendment should be adopted.\n  This amendment is a commonsense solution to the problem I have \ndescribed. It allows the Senate to send a message to loan sharks. We \nsay this to these loan sharks: If you charge an outrageous interest \nrate, if you profit from the misery and misfortune of others, if you \nstack the deck against the customers so they become virtual slaves to \ntheir indebtedness, you can get no protection in bankruptcy court for \nyour claims.\n  I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, and, as I have \nfound out, Democrats, you should support this amendment. If a lender \nwants to make these kinds of loans, under my amendment, the lender can \ndo it. But if he wants to be able to file claims in bankruptcy, he or \nshe could charge no more than 100 percent interest. I do not believe \nany of my colleagues would come to the floor to claim that 100 percent \ninterest is an unreasonable ceiling. This amendment is in the spirit of \nreducing bankruptcies. I believe it will significantly improve the \nbill, and I urge its adoption.\n\n  I have just one other amendment to discuss.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 35\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Madam President, again, I say to my friend from Iowa, \nthere are three amendments I have on the floor. I assume we will have \ndebate about payday loans. I say to my colleague from Iowa--I know what \nhe believes--I do not believe these loan sharks should get the same \nprotection under this bankruptcy bill, and I am hoping to get his \nsupport.\n  The first amendment that I talked about earlier, which clarifies that \nthe companies in bankruptcy must fulfill their legal obligations as \nplan administrators and plan sponsors, is an amendment that we may or \nmay not have to\n\n[[Page S2145]]\n\ndebate. I am hoping to get full support for it.\n  The third amendment I have offered is an amendment--and I say to my \ncolleagues, I think Senator Dayton will either be down here later today \nor tomorrow to speak about these amendments, both on the protection of \nretirees and also this trade adjustment assistance amendment to the \nbankruptcy bill.\n  Madam President, this is a hugely important amendment. Both Senators \nfrom Michigan are cosponsors of the bill, and they may want to speak on \nthis amendment. Again, I say to my colleague from Iowa, it may very \nwell be that Senator Baucus may come down, and we may have a colloquy \non this and talk about other ways of trying to accomplish the same \ngoal, but I offer the amendment today as a basis for the discussion \nthat we are going to have.\n  This amendment goes to why all too many people find themselves in \nbankruptcy. We have a situation where many taconite workers in \nMichigan, and certainly in northeast Minnesota, have now lost their \njobs, and some are losing their jobs. The problem is, when it comes to \ntrade adjustment assistance, which is a lifeline program, where these \nworkers, whether they are in their 30s or 40s or 50s, are provided with \nsome financial help, be it income, be it being able to go back to \nschool, be it money for relocation--we do not know yet, we are going to \nbe talking to the Secretary of Labor on Wednesday about this--but we \nare very concerned that the taconite workers are not included.\n  In other words, the flaw to trade policy right now, which affects \ntrade adjustment assistance, is that these taconite workers are not \nviewed as being in competition with slab steel or semifinished steel \nthat comes to the market. We have had an import surge of slab steel and \nsemifinished steel. And when it comes into this country, with this \nimport surge, all of the trade legislation will say to steel workers: \nYou will be eligible for trade adjustment assistance when you are \ncompeting with foreign steel and, for whatever reason, there is an \nimport surge. But in this highly integrated industry, the shame of it \nand the flaw to this is that taconite workers are not covered.\n  The reason I talk about this as an amendment to the bankruptcy bill \nis, look, if you lose your job--next to medical bills, the other two \nreasons most people file for bankruptcy is loss of job or divorce. In \nthe iron range in Minnesota there is a tremendous amount of economic \npain. Senator Dayton and I are in a rush to try to get as much help to \nthese workers as possible, just as any Senator, Democrat or Republican, \nwould be doing the same for people in their State.\n  I have introduced this amendment. There may come a time when I will \nhave a discussion with Senator Baucus as to other ways we can approach \nthis. There is a meeting with Secretary Chao on Wednesday. Senator \nDayton is very engaged in this as well. We are doing it together. This \nmay be an amendment on which we may not have an up-or-down vote because \nwe might be able to move it forward with some other way of getting at \nit.\n  It is a huge problem. These workers are out of work, and they are not \neligible for the trade adjustment assistance. The same import surge \nthat is affecting them affects other workers. We are just desperately \ntrying to work out a fix to get them some help. It may be that I could \ndo that with Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley and others in another \nway.\n  This is not some trump political thing I am doing. It is very painful \nto see people who are so desperate and who fall between the cracks and \nare not getting the help they need.\n  Those are the three amendments I have. I know there are other \ncolleagues who are coming to the floor. I will wait to see what kind of \nresponse there is from the other side. I am hopeful we can at least \nhave this one amendment incorporated into this bill that will provide \nretirees with some protection. I am hoping the amendment will be \naccepted. I believe Senator Sessions may also be engaged on this \nquestion. I am hopeful.\n  On the payday loan, I wait to hear from my colleagues from the other \nside.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, it is my understanding that three \namendments have been offered today by Senator Wellstone. Would the \nSenator clarify? Has he offered three amendments that are now pending \nfor discussion, or does he intend to do so? What is the status on his \namendments?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The majority leader is correct. I was here in the \nbeginning of the debate last week and I offered one. I have offered \nthree now. I have a number of other amendments to offer, but I have \noffered three; correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. I understand there are still some 80-plus amendments to be \ndisposed of just from the other side of the aisle. I guess there are \nprobably a dozen or more on this side of the aisle, not counting the \nrelevant amendments that were identified from the list that might be \noffered. So we still have a lot of work to do.\n  I do know that on Friday, and today, some work was accomplished. \nSenator Wellstone is certainly carrying through with his commitment to \noffer amendments dealing with bankruptcy. I know the staffs have been \nworking on both sides to see if we can find a way to complete this \nwithout the necessity of a cloture vote this week. However, we have to \ndispose of this bill this week.\n  As Senator Daschle and I discussed on the floor last Thursday, it is \nour intent to offer a cloture today or tomorrow, to make sure we have \nenough time to complete this very important legislation. It is my \nintent--and I see Senator Daschle here now--to file cloture in order to \nassure passage of the bill this week. If we can make substantial \nprogress by Wednesday, or if some agreement can be reached that would \nlimit the number of amendments, certainly I would be open to that.\n  I think the record is clear. I have repeatedly tried to move this \nlegislation and I have tried to be respectful of the committee process, \nwhich we have followed, and also to be respectful of the Senator from \nMinnesota, who feels strongly about this legislation, as others do. It \nis time that we make sure we get it completed this week.\n  I am prepared to send a cloture motion to the desk to the pending \nlegislation. Before I do that, I say to Senator Daschle I will be glad \nto yield for any comment he might have.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I appreciate Senator Lott's expression \nof intent here. As we said last week, there is a real hope that we can \nresolve whatever procedural difficulties we face in accommodating the \ndesire the majority leader has noted: that we schedule a vote for final \npassage sometime before the end of this week.\n  It is clear now we really do have a number of pieces of legislation \nthat have to be addressed, including campaign finance reform as early \nas next Monday or Tuesday. In order to accommodate that schedule, it \nwould be best if we could complete our work on this bill before Friday.\n  I will be supportive of whatever procedural arrangements we can make \nthat respect the rights of Senators on both sides to be heard. I want \nto accommodate those Senators who may have amendments that will fall if \ncloture is invoked, if we can address those amendments first early in \nthe week so we can make sure those who have other ideas and other \nproposals can be accommodated.\n  I will work with the majority leader to try to find a way to schedule \na vote on cloture, if it comes to that, perhaps later in the day on \nWednesday. Our preference is later in the day to accommodate those \nSenators, with an expectation that we can certainly finish the bill by \nFriday. I will work with our colleagues to see what arrangements best \nsuit their needs.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. May I ask a question of my colleagues?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am not clear, I may have yielded the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I appreciate that. That is very gracious of Senator \nDaschle.\n\n[[Page S2146]]\n\n  Just to clarify a couple of things, this is the third time we have \nreally had debate. On Monday and Friday, we know a lot of Senators are \nnot around. I came back. It seems to me, if I may express my dissent, \nthat the majority leader asked for a list of amendments prematurely. We \nall know that Senators, to protect themselves, list a number of \namendments they may not use, and now that is being used as an argument \nfor filing a cloture motion.\n  I work with the majority leader. We all disagree at times. I think it \nviolates the spirit of what we talked about. I remember coming to the \nSenate floor and having a discussion that we would have substantive \ndebate on the bankruptcy bill and Senators could offer those \namendments.\n  We are just now starting that process, and now we are talking about \nfiling for cloture. We have had 2 days on this bill. We all know on \nMonday and Friday people do not come. I am here, but a lot of people do \nnot come. The majority leader asked for a list, and people listed a lot \nof amendments to protect themselves. In my humble opinion, the majority \nleader is using that as a pretext for premature filing of cloture, \nwhich goes against what I thought we were going to do with this bill.\n  I will finish. I know both leaders look as if they are more than \nready to respond. We have a lot of amendments. People come out with \namendments, and we go at it. If it takes 2 weeks to do a bill, we have \ndone that on many bills. I do not understand why we are not doing that \non this bill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator perceives my stance correctly. I was \nprepared to respond. I must say I am not sympathetic to that argument, \nand I am very sympathetic oftentimes of the admonitions and suggestions \nof the Senator from Minnesota. Friday and Mondays are legitimate \nlegislative days.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. To be clear, I am not arguing they are not. I am just \nsaying----\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be happy to yield again in a moment. I have done \neverything to encourage Senators to come to the floor to offer their \namendments. For some reason, we have gotten into this habit of thinking \nany amendment offered after 6 in the evening is not really considered \nprime time, or it is not considered to be a legitimate time to offer an \namendment. Fridays and Mondays are considered, for some reason, not \nequal in quality to Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday as times to offer \namendments.\n  We have to break out of that mind set. We have done everything to \npetition Senators to come to the floor today to offer amendments. We \ndid it on Friday.\n  Those Senators who now express some concern they are going to be \nprecluded from offering amendments--when they passed up the opportunity \non Friday, they passed up the opportunity to offer amendments later in \nthe evening, they passed up the opportunity to come here on Monday--are \nnot going to get much sympathy.\n  I am very sympathetic to many of the substantive questions raised by \nSenators with their amendments, but procedurally, if they are concerned \nabout it, they ought to be here. They ought to come to the floor to \noffer these amendments.\n  I am hopeful we will get more reaction than we have so far, at least \nfor the remainder of the day and tonight.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will finish up. I say to our Democratic leader two \nthings: No. 1, it still does not speak to my point--we talk about \nsubstantive debate, which is the commitment we made on this bill. Quite \noften, we are talking about 2 weeks of amendments and debate going \nthrough those amendments. All of a sudden, with the bankruptcy bill, we \nare talking about Friday and Monday as litmus test days and people need \nto be here. I am all for that. I am here.\n  I find it interesting that in the haste to get through this bill--I \nunderstand a whole lot of folks and a whole lot of powerful folks are \nfor it--I think this violates what I heard stated last week. There are \na lot of important amendments that are going to be clotured out now, \nand I think that goes against the agreement. I am expressing my dissent \non it.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I appreciate that. If I may, before yielding the floor--\nand I will certainly yield so the majority leader can respond as well--\nI am told that we asked virtually every author on Friday if they could \nbe prepared to come to the floor on Friday to offer at least one \namendment, and not one of our colleagues responded to that.\n  Again, I want to use these days productively. We are not using them \nvery productively if we cannot even offer one amendment for \nconsideration and a vote at some point Friday or Monday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I appreciate Senator Daschle's efforts. He \nand I have worked very hard to be fair on this legislation. I have the \nsame problems he has. I do not want the burden to appear just to be on \nhis side of the aisle. We have difficulty getting our Senators to offer \namendments on Fridays and Mondays and even Thursday afternoons. Even \nthough there are often very legitimate reasons that we cannot proceed \nlate into the evening on Thursday, we are not able to do so.\n  I say to Senator Wellstone, yes, he was here I think on Friday and \nagain this morning. Back on January 22, Senator Daschle and I started \ntalking about trying to move this legislation. We have been trying to \nmove it ever since. Even though I filed cloture, that does not end it. \nAmendments can be debated, amendments can be voted on, and we still \nhave some opportunity to work through this, perhaps without cloture. I \nam not sure that is possible. It may not be.\n  The point Senator Daschle made was we have to go to campaign finance \nreform, and at some point we have to go to the budget resolution. The \nlaw requires we do it before April 15, so we are getting to the point \nwhere other things will overtake this bill.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk to the \npending legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to S. 420, an original bill to amend title II, United \n     States Code, and for other purposes:\n         Trent Lott, Robert F. Bennett, Chuck Grassley, Orrin G. \n           Hatch, Susan Collins, Pat Roberts, Lincoln Chafee, \n           Strom Thurmond, Frank H. Murkowski, Mitch McConnell, \n           Rick Santorum, Jeff Sessions, Richard G. Lugar, Gordon \n           Smith of Oregon, George V. Voinovich, and Bill Frist.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion is addressed to the motion \nto proceed, and I am advised we are on the bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, if I may make a parliamentary inquiry, in \nview of the revision, I believe the clerk will need to read the whole \ncloture motion again.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on S. 420, an \n     original bill to amend title II, United States Code, and for \n     other purposes:\n         Trent Lott, Robert F. Bennett, Chuck Grassley, Orrin G. \n           Hatch, Susan Collins, Pat Roberts, Lincoln Chafee, \n           Strom Thurmond, Frank H. Murkowski, Mitch McConnell, \n           Rick Santorum, Jeff Sessions, Richard G. Lugar, Gordon \n           Smith, George Voinovich, and Bill Frist.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, as just stated, this cloture vote will \noccur on Wednesday unless it is changed by consent. The Democratic \nleader and I will discuss the bill and make a determination as to the \ntiming. I am sure it will be in the afternoon, and we will see how late \nthat will need to be. It would be affected by what has been achieved.\n  I ask that the mandatory quorum under rule XXII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S2147]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If I might say to the majority leader, as I understand \nit, a number of amendments, in fact, over 20 amendments, have been \ncleared on our side. I guess we are awaiting some indication as to \nwhether or not those amendments might be cleared on the majority side. \nThat would move things along as well in terms of scheduling amendments. \nIf Senators know those amendments have been adopted, we would be in a \nbetter position to whittle down the list and determine which of those \namendments still need floor consideration.\n  Mr. LOTT. Keeping with full disclosure on this, I think our staffs \nhave been working on that, and I think we did clear a number of \namendments like this last time this bill was up. We were in hopes at \nsome point perhaps that this could be done in such a way that we would \nnot have to go to conference and the bill could be accepted by the \nHouse. It does not appear that will be possible.\n  We will try to clear as many of the amendments as possible. I will \ntake it up with the chairman when we complete our action.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, is it appropriate to ask consent to set \naside the pending amendment and proceed to other amendments to the \nbankruptcy bill?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, would the Senator tell us the content \nof the amendment, or is there a copy we can have?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It is an amendment dealing with health insurance \nbenefits for the debtor's monthly expenses permitted in the \nconsideration of the means test, the opportunity for those going \nthrough the process to be able to have included consideration for \npaying their health insurance and premiums.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I apologize. We have a copy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Massachusetts? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 38\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. This is an amendment that if we had a cloture motion we \nwould not have qualified, yet it is absolutely relevant.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], for himself, \n     Mr. Rockefeller, and Mrs. Clinton, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 38.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To allow for reasonable medical expenses, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n       On page 10 between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n       ``(V) In addition, if the debtor does not have health \n     insurance benefits, the debtor's monthly expenses shall \n     include an allowance to purchase a health insurance policy \n     for the debtor, the dependents of the debtor, and the spouse \n     of the debtor in a joint case if the spouse is not otherwise \n     a dependent.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2001 \nincludes a means test that determines whether debtors will be granted \nrelief under Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code or whether they must \nenter into a Chapter 13 repayment plan. Supporters of the bill believe \nit will prevent abuse in the bankruptcy system. I believe, as do the \nexperts, that it is problematic.\n  For better or worse, however, the means test is in the bill and it \nrequires a calculation of the debtor's monthly expenses based on the \nInternal Revenue Service collection standards. The IRS standards \nprovide for food, clothing, transportation, and some health care-\nrelated expenses. What the IRS standards don't provide for is the cost \nof health care insurance for many debtors, particularly those who \nrecently lost their insurance or may not have been able to afford it.\n  The amendment I'm offering today says that if a debtor doesn't have \nhealth care insurance, the bankruptcy court must include a reasonable \nallowance for health care insurance for the debtor, his or her \ndependents, and his or her spouse, when calculating the debtor's \nmonthly expenses.\n  This amendment is necessary because many Americans declare bankruptcy \nbecause of health care-related problems. A recent report tells us that \nnearly half of the 1.2 million Americans who file for bankruptcy do so \nbecause of medical problems. According to the report, in 1999, an \nestimated 326,000 families filed for bankruptcy because of an illness \nor injury to themselves or a family member and an additional 267,000 \nfamilies had substantial medical bills. That is extraordinary. Again, \nin 1999, an estimated 326,000 families filed for bankruptcy because of \nan illness or an injury to themselves or a family member and an \nadditional 267,000 families had substantial medical bills. Almost \n600,000--nearly half of all those who filed for bankruptcy--filed for \nmedical reasons.\n  During discussion of this legislation, we've found that there are \nthree major reasons why people are filing for bankruptcy. One is job \nrelated and that is triggered for the most part, not completely but for \nthe most part, because of the various mergers, downsizing and pink \nslipping effecting great numbers of Americans. Second, many women are \nfiling for bankruptcy after falling on hard times as a result of \ndivorce, lack of alimony, or lack of child support payments. And the \nthird reason is health related. The explosion of health care costs, \nparticularly in the area of prescription drugs, and the general cost of \nhealth insurance has led many to file for bankruptcy.\n  Close to 600,000 bankruptcies involve families or individuals--half \nof all of those who are going into bankruptcy --have health-related \nbankruptcies.\n  Two hundred and sixty-seven thousand of those who filed for \nbankruptcy in 1999 had no health insurance. A report published in \nNorton's Bankruptcy Adviser says:\n\n       The data reported here serve as a reminder that self-\n     funding medical treatment and loss of income during a bout of \n     illness or recovery from an accident make a substantial \n     number of middle class families vulnerable to financial \n     collapse.\n\n  Some families once had health insurance but, in an attempt to avoid \nbankruptcy, let their policy payments lapse so every penny could be \nused to buy food and pay the rent. Those families later find themselves \nin bankruptcy without an appropriate health insurance safety net.\n  Others never had health insurance because they simply could not \nafford it. And, others lost their insurance when they lost their job.\n\n  For example, one debtor tells us that he had a heart attack which led \nto quadruple bypass surgery. He amassed outrageous medical bills that \nhe could not pay because he didn't have medical insurance. He then had \nto declare bankruptcy. Another debtor told us that the loss of a job, \nwhich led to loss of health care, precipitated bankruptcy. She used \ncredit cards, credit cards, to pay for COBRA insurance and prescription \ndrugs. The COBRA insurance won't last for very long, and soon she will \nbe without any health insurance at all.\n  These families are now among the 43 million Americans who have no \nhealth insurance, and we must ask, what happens to them? The children \nfail to get a healthy start in life because their parents cannot afford \nthe eye glasses or hearing aids or doctors visits they need. Family \nincome and energy are sucked away by the high financial and emotional \ncost of uninsured illness. An older couple sees hope for a dignified \nretirement dashed when the savings of a lifetime are washed away by a \ntidal wave of medical debt.\n  Without health insurance, many families forgo health care. One-third \nof the uninsured go without needed medical care in any given year. \nEight million uninsured Americans fail to take the medication that \ntheir doctor prescribes, because they cannot afford to fill the \nprescription. 400,000 children suffer from asthma but never see a \ndoctor. 500,000 children with recurrent earaches never see a doctor. \nAnother 500,000 children with severe sore throats never see a doctor. \n32,000 Americans with heart disease go without life-saving and life-\nenhancing bypass surgery or angioplasty.\n  Overall, 83,000 Americans die each year because they have no \ninsurance. It is the seventh leading cause of death in America today.\n\n[[Page S2148]]\n\n  Given these facts, the Federal Government shouldn't be in the \nbusiness of telling people to repay their credit card debts rather than \npay for health care insurance. And, debtors shouldn't be forced to \nchoose between eating and purchasing health care insurance while being \nforced to repay creditors. To avoid this Hobson's choice, when \ndetermining whether a debtor can repay his creditors, the bankruptcy \ncourt must consider health insurance premiums part of the debtors' \nmonthly expenses.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment. It adds some \nfairness and balance to an unnecessarily harsh bill.\n  This is something that can be dealt with by the bankruptcy judges. \nObviously, the amount of repayment is going to depend to some extent on \nthe size of the family's health insurance premium, and perhaps to some \nextent on where they live and the cost of health insurance in that \narea. But all of those kinds of calculations are readily made by the \nbankruptcy court and by bankruptcy judges.\n  This does not mean an unreasonable additional kind of responsibility. \nAnd, beyond that, for those who are strong in terms of the bankruptcy \nreform, this makes sense from their point of view because what happens \nis the individual who is in bankruptcy will be kept healthier and their \nfamilies will be healthier and able to at least move towards meeting \ntheir responsibilities under the bankruptcy court, if they are able to \ngo ahead and afford those health insurance premiums.\n  It is a win-win situation. It is a win in terms of those who are \ngoing to have responsibility for meeting their debts because they won't \nfind additional kinds of drain on scarce resources, and it means they \nwill be healthier and be able to afford to repay. It also works to the \nadvantage of the individual and their families.\n  I believe this makes a good deal of sense. I look forward to my good \nfriend from Iowa enthusiastically embracing this amendment so that I \nmight get onto my second amendment which is equally commendable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. First of all, Mr. President, whether I enthusiastically \nendorse this or not, the Senator from Massachusetts knows that he can \nlay his amendment aside and move on to another amendment that he wants \nadopted since we will not be voting on these amendments until tomorrow.\n  The first thing I want everyone who has questions to know about this \nlegislation is that we want people who have health insurance to \nmaintain their health insurance when they go into bankruptcy because \nour legislation provides that health expenses, including health \ninsurance, under the IRS guidelines--which are used by the bankruptcy \ncourt in deciding the ability to repay debt under our means test--are \nfully accounted for.\n  Not only are health insurance premiums subtracted, but all health \ncare costs are subtracted out of a person's ability to pay in making a \ndetermination whether they go into chapter 7 where they get a \ncompletely fresh start, or whether they go into chapter 13 to make a \ndetermination of whether or not they have the ability to repay. If they \nare in chapter 13, then the extent to which they repay the final \njudgment is that those people in chapter 13 will not get off scot-free.\n  But in making that determination, all health costs are taken into \nconsideration.\n  The reason I take some time to emphasize that point is because we \nhave had several speeches on the floor of the Senate that say and imply \nwe do not want to take into consideration all those health care costs \nin making that determination. We even had the Time magazine article of \nlast spring in which there were several case studies done by Time \nmagazine with the implication that if this legislation passed, those \npeople would not be able to get into bankruptcy court for fair \nconsideration of whether or not they could repay their bills, and \nwhether or not they get a fresh start.\n  In a lot of those case studies, there was the implication that they \nwere going into bankruptcy court because of high health costs.\n  In every one of those instances, as I have said before on the floor \nof this Senate, those folks used in that magazine article would have \nbeen able to get a fresh start under our legislation.\n  Consequently, we still have this brought up as somehow a problem of \nour bill because we are not going to take into consideration people who \nare in bankruptcy being able to maintain their health costs and health \ninsurance.\n  I asked the question last week for those Senators who think we do not \ngive adequate consideration through the IRS guidelines of whether or \nnot somebody should be in chapter 7 or chapter 13: If we don't, do we \ngive credit for 100 percent of health cost? If 100 percent isn't \nenough, would 101, 102, or 110 percent be enough?\n  Now we get to this situation that Senator Kennedy has brought to our \nattention.\n  I give the prelude to this by saying our legislation takes into \nconsideration 100 percent of health care costs, including paying health \ninsurance.\n  If the person does not have health insurance before going into \nbankruptcy court, obviously the person does not have an expense out \nthere to claim in bankruptcy court.\n  It seems to me what Senator Kennedy is trying to do here--because we \nalready allow people who have health insurance to maintain that health \ninsurance as one of those legitimate costs--is raise the possibility \nthat a debtor who did not have health insurance before he went into \nbankruptcy court ought to be able to carve out a portion of the \ncreditor's claims, and would be able to get a fringe benefit, or a \nbenefit they did not have before they went into court.\n\n  I think we have a couple of questions to ask. Is there any provision \nin this amendment that requires the debtor to use this allowance for \nhealth insurance? And is there any provision to verify that the money \nis being used for health insurance if it is allowed?\n  Since the debtor wasn't using the allowance for health insurance \nbefore bankruptcy, it seems to me we need some guarantees on how the \nmoney will be spent.\n  I have those questions. If the Senator wants to respond to those, he \ncan. If he doesn't, there are questions out there that have to be \nanswered.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would be glad to work out the question \nas to how the debtors are going to make sure they are going to get an \nallocation in terms of health insurance--to make sure it would be used \nfor that particular purpose. I would be glad to work out over the \nnighttime those kinds of protections. But I say the answer would be the \nsame way that particular provision applies to food and rent. You do not \nhave the additional written in stone with regard to food and rent in \nthis particular proposal. But if you want additional kinds of \nprotections to ensure that it goes to insurance, I do not think that is \ngoing to be really a stumbling block.\n\n  Now let me just respond to the general theme my good friend from Iowa \ndiscussed.\n  This amendment simply ensures that while a debtor is repaying his \ncreditors, he has enough money to purchase health insurance for himself \nand his family. The supporters of the legislation assert that the other \nnecessary expense provisions in the IRS collection standards include \nhealth care insurance for all debtors. That simply is not true. The \nother necessary expense provision does say that other expenses, which \nmay meet the necessary expense test, includes health care. But if a \ndebtor has recently lost his health insurance or lost his job--and \ntherefore his health insurance--health care insurance premium expenses \nwill not be included in his monthly expense allowance. And the IRS \nstaff confirms that.\n  So a Senator says: Look, if they paid their health care insurance \npremium at the time, we will make sure they will be able, within the \nIRS means test, to pay their premium as well.\n  The point is, as we have seen with great numbers of people, almost \nhalf of those who have gone into bankruptcy have done so because of \nhealth-related expenses. The great majority of those are losing their \nhealth insurance, or they have health insurance and it does not cover \nthese catastrophic additional kinds of costs, or they have lost their \njob and lost their health insurance. They are not provided for.\n\n[[Page S2149]]\n\n  Here is somebody who has worked hard all their life, paid into their \nhealth insurance, then they lose their job, lose their health, and they \nrun into one of these catastrophic illnesses, and they had been paying \nthe premiums all of this time. But there is no provision for them, even \nthough they have conscientiously provided health insurance for \nthemselves and their families throughout their employment. They cannot \neven work that out with the restrictive language here.\n  There ought to be a reasonable way of ensuring that those people are \ngoing to get health insurance within the means test standard, which \nsupposedly looks at essential needs. I think getting health insurance \nis an essential need. It is as important for many people as food and a \nroof over their heads.\n  As we've seen, many people are unable to take the prescription drugs \nthey need. We find, from all the medical indicators, the number of \npeople who do not have health insurance and who end up actually dying.\n  So that is what the bill that is before the Senate fails to respond \nto; and those are the real facts out there in terms of these \nindividuals losing their jobs and losing their health insurance. They \nfind out that even though they paid into their health insurance over a \nlifetime, they run into these catastrophic kinds of additional \nillnesses--here they were, paying in, working hard--and, under the \nlanguage in the bill, there is virtually no kind of inclusion for them.\n  I think health insurance protection for their families makes an \nenormous amount of sense with regard to individuals, and it makes an \nenormous amount of sense in terms of the individual's ability to meet \ntheir responsibilities of payment under the Bankruptcy Act.\n  It just seems to me that those are the additional kinds of \nprotections we are talking about. It isn't that this individual is \ngoing to be able to set the sky as the limit, and try to walk out of \nthere with a good deal of free cash in their pockets.\n  We would be glad to include in the Record very extensive analyses of \nwhat the costs are for individual workers and for families, using GAO \nfigures. We could make that part of the Record. That could be a pretty \nclear indication of a reasonable standard that might be used or might \nbe followed. But that is why I believe this is so important.\n  In many ways, this amendment, as I mentioned, will improve the \ndebtor's chance of being able to repay his creditors while also \nensuring that he and his family have a decent--not luxurious but \ndecent--standard of living.\n  If the debtors are able to purchase health insurance, they will be \nable to withstand the predictable and unpredictable circumstances that \nare part of everyday living--the birth of a child, a previous \nundiagnosed illness, necessary trips to the doctor's office. Instead of \nscraping for pennies to pay those bills, the debtor and his family will \nhave the health insurance that every American needs. Instead of failing \nto meet the obligations of a chapter 13 repayment plan, all available \nresources must go to unexpected health care expenses. The debtor can \nmeet both obligations.\n  So I hope we can continue to visit this issue and see what we might \nbe able to work out.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 39\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If it is the desire of the floor manager, I ask \nunanimous consent that the existing amendment be temporarily laid aside \nand we go to the amendment which is what they call the cap on IRA \nassets.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I believe the Senator has that amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, \nbefore we go on to his next amendment and lay this one aside, I hope I \ncan continue a dialog between the staff of the Senator from \nMassachusetts and my staff to see if we can make arrangements, so that \nwe know the money that is set aside is used for health insurance, that \nit is verifiable, that it would not be used for some sort of Cadillac \ninsurance policy that maybe the person would not otherwise have had in \ntheir place of employment, and things of that nature. If we could talk \nabout that, we might be able to work something out.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Sure. I appreciate the attitude of the Senator. We would \nbe glad to try to follow through with that. I am grateful for the \nSenator's interest and sensitivity. I appreciate that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 39.\n\n    (Purpose: To remove the dollar limitation on retirement savings \n                        protected in bankruptcy)\n\n       Beginning on page 101, line 10, strike all through page \n     102, line 2.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this bankruptcy bill includes a provision \nthat would undermine existing pension law by allowing creditors to \nclaim workers' retirement savings in bankruptcy. One of the greatest \ndomestic policy challenges facing Congress is the challenge of ensuring \nthat elderly Americans do not live in poverty. After a lifetime of hard \nwork, senior citizens deserve a secure and comfortable retirement.\n\n  Clearly, we need to do more to improve the private pension system. \nNearly half of all working Americans--some 73 million men and women--do \nnot have pension coverage. The lack of pension security is a critical \nissue. It is a women's issue, because only 39 percent of working women \nare covered by a pension plan. It is a civil rights issue, because only \n26 percent of Hispanic workers and 38 percent of African-American \nworkers have pension coverage.\n  So it is imperative that Congress do all it can to expand pension \ncoverage and encourage retirement savings. We must work to improve our \nretirement savings system--not move backward. The provision in the \nbankruptcy bill that would cap the amount of retirement savings held in \nindividual retirement accounts that can be exempted from a debtor's \nbankruptcy estate is a step backward.\n  Federal pension laws are intended to protect workers by guaranteeing \nthat their retirement savings will be there when they retire. The \nentire pension community--worker groups, employers, mutual fund \ncompanies, and other pension service providers--are united in \nopposition to a cap on retirement savings for three reasons: one, it is \nunnecessary, two, it is unworkable, and three, it would discourage \nsavings and portability.\n  First, a cap on IRA savings is unnecessary because Federal tax law \nalready imposes strict limits on IRA contributions. The cap is aimed at \npreventing wealthy individuals from trying to stuff assets into their \nIRAs before declaring bankruptcy. But because IRA contributions are \nlimited to only $2,000 per year, wealthy individuals cannot stuff \nassets into an IRA before filing bankruptcy as a way to avoid paying \ndebts. At the rate of $2,000 per year, it would take about 40 years to \naccumulate retirement savings of $1 million.\n  Second, the cap is unworkable. It will be extremely difficult--if not \nimpossible in many cases--to administer. There are thousands of IRA \naccounts with balances in excess of $1 million due to rollovers from \n401(k) plans and other retirement vehicles. Under the current bill, \nthose rollover amounts (and the earnings on them) would not be \navailable to creditors. However, a bankruptcy court will need to sort \nthrough those accounts to determine how much of the account came from \ndirect IRA contributions and how much came from rollovers.\n  The court will also be forced to calculate how much of the earnings \nin the account should be attributed to the IRA contributions and how \nmuch should be attributed to the rollovers amounts. That will be a time \nconsuming administrative burden with no benefit to creditors.\n  Third, the cap will discourage retirement savings and portability. \nUsing retirement savings in IRAs to satisfy personal debts is \nunprecedented, and collides head-on with efforts by Congress to \nencourage individuals to save for retirement. Already, more than 60 \npercent of workers who change jobs take their retirement savings and \nspend the money rather than rolling the money into another retirement \nvehicle.\n  The cap will undermine the trust that over 35 million American \nhouseholds have placed in the IRA as a safe and secure retirement \nsavings vehicle,\n\n[[Page S2150]]\n\nand will discourage workers from rolling money into their IRAs when \nthey change jobs.\n  I believe this provision would jeopardize the retirement security of \nAmerican workers. This is simply the wrong message for Congress to \nsend, particularly at a time when we are trying to encourage additional \nprivate-sector retirement savings to ensure retirement income security \nfor the aging baby boom generation.\n  Mr. President, I hope this amendment will be accepted. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to tell my \ncolleagues why the amendment offered by the Senator from Massachusetts \nis a very bad amendment.\n  First, I want to make clear that this amendment applies just to IRAs; \nit does not apply to pensions. In addition, I would like to have people \nreflect on the position of the Senator from Massachusetts on this \namendment and the position on the previous amendment. It seems to me \nthe Senator from Massachusetts is very much in character with his \namendment on making sure there is a preservation for the ability of \npeople in bankruptcy to keep health insurance. That, for a long time, \nhas been a concern of his for people who have needed health insurance, \nmaybe couldn't afford it--how to be able to get it to the people. Of \ncourse, when bankruptcy steps in, it is very appropriate for him to \noffer an amendment that would preserve health insurance for people. \nThat would most often fall into the category of his protecting those \npeople who have lesser incomes.\n  So it is quite out of character for me to respond to the Senator from \nMassachusetts about an amendment about a provision in this bill where \nwe have a $1 million cap that protects retirement accounts and that you \nwould have to have resources over that $1 million in determining the \nability to repay.\n  As the author of this legislation, I am very embarrassed that I would \nhave in my own legislation a $1 million cap that would say people could \nprotect $1 million from their creditors as they went into bankruptcy. \nThat $1 million cap is in here because I didn't want any cap \nwhatsoever. I had to make an arrangement with Senator Kennedy last year \nto reach compromise on this matter, and we compromised on $1 million.\n  In addition, for the Senator from Massachusetts, who never is very \noften found defending the economic needs of those over $1 million a \nyear in savings and wanting to protect that $1 million from bankruptcy, \nit seems to me somewhat out of character for him. It makes it a lot \neasier for me to oppose his amendment that would eliminate the cap on \nIRA savings.\n\n  He argues that the $1 million cap would be difficult to administer \nbecause 401(k)s and other retirement rollovers are excepted from this \ncap. He argues that the cap will be an administrative hassle with no \nbenefit to creditors. I argue that the bankruptcy bill is all about \nhaving people who can repay their debts do just that--in other words, \npay their debts.\n  How many times have you heard me say the purpose of this bankruptcy \nlegislation is, for those who are gaming the system, those who are \nusing the bankruptcy laws for financial planning, that if you have the \nability to repay, you are no longer going to get off scot-free.\n  People who have the ability to repay their debts should not be \nprotected just because they have stashed away an IRA account. That is \nwhy we have this $1 million cap. I don't even think the cap should be \nthere, but it was part of the compromise last year. We need to have a \ncap on these savings so that people who can pay will be required to pay \na portion of their debts.\n  I don't think the super-rich should have additional protections just \nbecause they can squirrel away their money in a retirement account. The \n$1 million cap is consistent with our policy of encouraging people to \nput away money for retirement, but we also need to balance this with a \npolicy that people who buy goods and other merchandise should pay for \nthem if they can. We can't allow deadbeats to get away with stiffing \ncreditors. That is why our bankruptcy bill is here. That is what it is \nall about: Imposing some responsibility on people who can pay their \ndebts.\n  I would like to give you an example about abuse of the system. This \nis from a press report. Dr. Neil Solomon declared bankruptcy after \nthree female patients sued him for sexual misconduct and sought $160 \nmillion in damages. Dr. Solomon paid these women less than $100,000, \nwhile keeping a home in Baltimore, MD, valued at $323,000, a Mercedes \nBenz, valued at $42,000, and $2.2 million in a retirement savings \naccount.\n  Congress should place reasonable limits on the ability of highly \ncompensated persons, such as Dr. Solomon, to shield millions of dollars \nfrom creditors simply because the assets are deposited in retirement \naccounts.\n  Clearly, Congress never intended for savings in retirement accounts \nto become safe havens for the wealthy who seek to avoid paying their \nbills by declaring bankruptcy.\n  I also point out to my friend from Massachusetts his position is much \ncontrary to his position in regard to the homestead exemption. He says \npeople who can pay their debts should not be able to shelter their \nassets in a million-dollar homestead. But at the same time, he seems to \nbe saying that people should be able to shelter their assets in $1 \nmillion IRA accounts. That is what he is doing right now by lifting \nthat $1 million cap.\n  Moreover, I don't think the provision in our bill will impose an \nadministrative burden, particularly because the amount of the cap is so \nhigh. I don't think it is unworkable, and I doubt that the \nadministrative burden charge will ever materialize.\n  In addition, I remind my colleagues this is an agreement that was \nagreed to in the compromise pension bill last year. I didn't want this \ncap in here, but I took it in the process of doing what I could to \nalleviate some fears so this legislation could get passed. In other \nwords, we cut a deal, and I hope we stick by this deal. We need to \nretain the hard limit of $1 million on the amount of IRA money that any \nperson who declares bankruptcy can shield from his or her creditors. \nJust because it is a retirement account does not mean you can get away \nfrom paying your debts with it. This is just plain wrong because this \nis anti fraud and abuse reform, and it is badly needed. I strongly urge \nmy colleagues to reject the amendment.\n  I wish to point out that we put the exclusion of rollovers in the \nbill at the request of the Senator from Massachusetts. So if the \nSenator is concerned about administrative burdens, we would be happy to \ntake out the exclusion of rollovers. But my point to the Senator from \nMassachusetts is that we cannot have this both ways.\n  I also suggest that I was lobbied against any restriction. I was \nlobbied on the protection of pensions and IRAs from being a source of \nrepayment to creditors--not by individuals going into bankruptcy or \npeople who had strongly felt views as individuals that this money \nshould be protected from the creditors.\n  The source of interest in this legislation came from the pension and \ninsurance industries of my State who felt they did not want to be \nbothered by the bankruptcy courts, so they wanted to retain protection \nfor pensions and for IRAs. They tried to make this historical claim \nthat it had always been this way. It is one thing to work on the floor \nof the Senate to protect the interests of the little guy who is going \ninto bankruptcy; it is also OK to work on the Senate floor to make sure \nwe do preserve the ability of people to retire with dignity. It is \nquite another thing to protect the interests of those who want to \nretain a high lifestyle after they have gone into bankruptcy and, at \nthe same time, be in retirement. But it is quite another thing to \nprotect the interests of all the big business companies of America that \nare writing this business and don't somehow want to deal with the \nbankruptcy courts.\n  I ask my colleagues to oppose the amendment by the Senator from \nMassachusetts. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n[[Page S2151]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I hope my friend from Iowa will continue \nto reason with us a little bit about this particular provision. I point \nout to him that for a long time in the Senate I have been interested in \nchampioning the interests of working families and the interests that \ndeal not only with the basic issues of education, health, and housing, \nbut also retirement programs. That is a key element. The Senator knows, \nas a member of the Finance Committee, how much of the tax expenditures \ngo to individuals making over $100,000, what the general taxpayers are \npaying under tax expenditures at the present time that are being \ndeducted. Those are the higher income groups. There is very little for \nworking families, and he understands that very well as a member of the \nFinance Committee.\n  I don't retreat a single step in terms of my desire to make sure we \nare going to have sound retirement programs for working families, \nschoolteachers, and other workers. The illustration that the Senator \nfrom Iowa gave us about some doctor who had all of these savings is not \napplicable. It doesn't even relate to what we are talking about because \nthere is only a $2,000 contribution that one can make to an IRA. Who \nuses the IRAs? Basically, it is the working families. The Senator \nunderstands that. Who uses the 401(k)? They are basically the more \naffluent individuals in our society. Those are the facts.\n  But it is interesting that the bill the Senator has introduced \nprotects the 401(k), but not the IRA. So I don't want to have any \nmisunderstanding. The Senator's position is protecting the 401(k)--\n$10,500 a year can be put in an 401(k), but only $2,000 in IRAs. This \nis a millionaire's loophole? The Senator knows as well as I that you \nhaven't even got anybody who qualifies for the cap on IRAs at $2,000 a \nyear because the IRAs haven't been around long enough. You have tens of \nthousands, hundreds of thousands of people in 401(k)s. But 401(k)s are \nnot going to be touched by the bankruptcy court. Oh, no, just the IRAs, \nwhich serve whom? Working families--with limits of $2,000.\n  The more we get into this, the more difficulty we have in \nunderstanding what the logic is in terms of defending 401(k)s. The fact \nhas been, historically, that it has been the opinion of the Congress--\nwith the exception of this Congress and this bill--that retirement \nmoneys would not be included in terms of the bankruptcy provisions. \nThey earned it and set it aside as retirement funds, and it would not \nbe included. In the course of our hearings on bankruptcy, there were \nvery few that would allege this kind of circumvention in terms of IRAs.\n  If the Senator is able to give me examples, or hearings, or testimony \non where we had all of these abuses in the IRAs--we are talking about a \nschoolteacher making $40,000 a year who puts aside $2,000 in order that \nthey can retire and have substantially similar kinds of income when \nthey retire. They would have to do it probably for 35 years in order to \nbe able to get the kinds of resources allocated so that they are going \nto be able to do it. Those are not the people we are talking about in \nterms of gypping the credit card companies and the banks. The Senator \nknows that.\n  The Senator knows that. I do not understand why we treat these \nretirement funds differently: One way for 401(k)s and another for the \nIRAs, which is the appropriate device working families have used and \nwith which they are increasingly developing some confidence.\n  We are going to be debating, we hope, Social Security. The average \nSocial Security is $13,000. That is the average Social Security check. \nEighty percent of those on Social Security live below $25,000. We have \nto ask: What are we going to do to encourage individuals to save, \nparticularly working families? We have not done a very good job of it \nas a matter of public policy. We have done a very poor job.\n  We do a very good job with respect to the most affluent members of \nour society. We have all kinds of tax support in the Internal Revenue \nCode, but for working families, we do a very poor job.\n  This is one of those small areas, the IRAs, that is open to working \nfamilies and on which we do not mind putting on the additional cap. On \nthe other side, we have serious reservations putting a cap on the \n401(k). I do not think that is fair.\n  Also, undermining retirement money that has been paid in over a \nlifetime, which may very well be a lifeline for that family, can be \neliminated, wiped out, in 4 days of catastrophic illness in a hospital. \nThat is what we are talking about. Four days of a catastrophic illness \nfor themselves, a wife or child, and it is wiped out. That is what the \ncurrent bill will do.\n  We encourage people to work hard, play by the rules all their lives, \nand put something aside with which to retire in peace and dignity. I \ncaught myself getting choked up when the Senator talked about a \nmillionaire's tax loophole because it is not; it is $2,000 a year. One \nhas to contribute for an awful long time to use this as a gimmick. \nThere are a whole lot of other gimmicks in this bill, such as the \nhomestead provision and other provisions that can be used a lot easier \nthan this one.\n  For these reasons, I hope we prevail.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, the Senator from Massachusetts is \ndigging a hole for himself. No. 1, he talks about the difference \nbetween 401(k)s and IRAs. He can mention $2,000, he can mention \n$10,000, but there is a cap of $1 million. That means up to $1 million \nis not subject to bankruptcy.\n  Then he mentioned IRAs and 401(k)s. I remind the Senator from \nMassachusetts that 401(k)s are not covered because he objected to their \nbeing covered, and we took them out. They are not part of it, not \nbecause that is the way I want it. I think 401(k)s ought to be capped \nat $1 million as well, if there is a cap at all. Madam President, \n401(k)s are different than the individual retirement accounts capped at \n$1 million, because that is what Senator Kennedy requested we do.\n  The other thing mentioned was about my being chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee and tax expenditures. First of all, I do not buy the \nphilosophy of tax expenditures because that implies every penny working \nmen and women in America earn belongs to the Federal Government and we \nare going to let them keep some of their own money. I start from the \npremise that the hard-working men and women of America, every penny \nthey earn is their money, and we tax them for part of it.\n  Just in case there is some injustice under present pension laws--I \nadmit there are injustices in present pension laws. The Senator from \nFlorida, Mr. Graham, and I have introduced legislation to correct some \nof those inequities and particularly to correct some of those \ninequities to benefit the very low-income wage earners to whom Senator \nKennedy is saying we do not give enough credit.\n  Before this Congress is done, hopefully even before the first bill \ngets to the President of the United States, we will have passed some \ntax legislation to take care of some of those inequities in the pension \nlaws of the United States, plus the fact that we had legislation out of \nour committee last year that increased the $2,000 IRA limit to a $5,000 \nIRA limit.\n  I want to get back to the reason for having this $1 million cap on \nindividual retirement accounts, that anything over that is not \nprotected from the creditors.\n  Let's get it clear: Below $1 million is protected from the creditors \nin bankruptcy court. I quote from President Clinton's administration in \ntheir support of the concept of the cap. This is last year's \nlegislation as we were discussing this issue then. The Department of \nJustice said:\n\n       A debtor should not be able to shield abundant resources \n     from creditors, including Federal, State, and local \n     governments, in the form of retirement savings.\n\n  I quote from the Securities and Exchange Commission:\n\n       We have seen insider traders do their trading through IRAs \n     and fraud participants stash their profits in their IRAs. The \n     State law exemptions have not defeated our Federal statutory \n     claims to date, but a new Federal exemption could do so. I am \n     concerned about the grave potential abuse that the exemption \n     for all retirement assets from bankruptcy estates poses.\n\n  That is a letter from Judith R. Starr, assistant chief litigation \ncounsel, Securities and Exchange Commission, to members of my staff.\n  The Department of Labor:\n\n\n[[Page S2152]]\n\n\n       A fresh start is not meaningful if it requires a debtor to \n     accept an impoverished retirement. However, a debtor should \n     not be able to inappropriately shield resources from \n     creditors, including Federal, State, and local governments in \n     the forms of retirement savings.\n\n  That is a letter from the Secretary of Labor to Senator Hatch, April \n14, 1999.\n  On the other hand, there are those among my colleagues across the \naisle who oppose the $1 million IRA cap that would prevent, to some \ndegree, the rich from shielding wealth from creditors in an IRA. In my \nview, a wealthy debtor should not be able to shield large amounts of \nwealth from creditors in an IRA or in a home.\n  The compromise provisions in the bill that we worked out with members \nof the other party last year make important improvements over current \nlaw and should be retained.\n  Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to oppose the effort to strip out \nthe individual retirement account cap. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, there may be others who want to speak \non other matters. As I mentioned earlier, the IRA was developed as a \nretirement account basically for working families. The majority of \nthose who contribute are individuals who earn less than $30,000 a year. \nThese are the people who are putting in only a couple thousand dollars. \nThey are limited over a lifetime. You put the cap there. The retirement \nprogram has historically been out of the reach of the credit card \ncompanies and the bankruptcy courts, the retirement savings.\n\n  Now for the first time we are seeing an intrusion on that. There is a \ncap. It is not being put in for the 401(k), basically the high rollers. \nIf you are not going to put it in for the 401(k)'s, you should not put \nit in for the retirements for the working families. We will have a \ncommingling of the funding and there is a good chance there will be an \nadditional burden and cost in terms of the IRA. It doesn't make a great \ndeal of sense.\n  I thank my friend from Iowa. As always, he is a friend and I enjoy \nworking with him on many different matters. I will study more closely \nhis pension legislation this evening and give it a good deal of \nadditional thought.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I make crystal clear when we talk \nabout $2,000 and $10,000 and $30,000, as the Senator from Massachusetts \nhas, it sounds as if we are just clamping down on people who should be \ngetting a fresh start in chapter 7 instead of being chapter 13 with \nability to repay.\n  I make very clear the first $1 million is exempted. That causes a \nproblem for the Senator from Massachusetts. I am embarrassed to present \na bill to the Senate of the United States that says a millionaire is \ngoing to be protected from bankruptcy court if he can pay his bills.\n  Now the Senator from Massachusetts raises a very legitimate point. \nThere could be a catastrophic illness that could eat up a lot of the \nmoney, even $1 million, presumably. We have even taken that into \nconsideration; that is, we have an interest of justice exception that \nwould be applicable in this case. So something over $1 million could be \nexempted. I hope the Senator from Massachusetts realizes we have gone \nthrough this last year. We tried to accommodate the Senator from \nMassachusetts. We had a compromise I was embarrassed to accept in the \nsense that a $1 million exemption is way too high for my background. \nBut I did it because I thought it was important we move this \nlegislation along. We are talking about just preserving in the bill \nbefore the Senate a compromise worked out last year that would be law \ntoday except for a pocket veto by President Clinton. Otherwise, this \nSenator from Massachusetts wants to strike that compromise, and he was \npart of that compromise. I guess I beg him to stick by his compromise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Domenici pertaining to the introduction of S. 515 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/12/senate-section/article/S2152-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2152-S2153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE TAX CUT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I speak of the size of the tax cut the \nPresident of the United States has asked us to adopt. The occupant of \nthe chair knows the Senator from New Mexico is lucky in that I have a \nwonderful person at home who asks me a lot of questions about what I am \ndoing. It is a great sounding board. I think the occupant knows that is \nmy wife.\n  My wife spoke to me about 10 days ago as an average citizen because \nshe and four friends, all of whom were women, stopped by after getting \ntogether to have a cup of coffee. There were questions raised by these \nnonpolitical women--not necessarily Republicans--as to why such a big \ntax cut? Why can't we wait? She addressed the question to me.\n  I said I think it is time the American people deserve to be told the \nsize of this tax cut. I have a chart. I don't know if it has been seen \non the Senate floor, but it is interesting. The red area indicates $1.6 \ntrillion as the entire tax cut alongside what we select in taxes during \nthe same period of time. It is most interesting. During the same time \nwe are asking the American people be given back $1.6 trillion, we will \ncollect $28 trillion in taxes. Maybe that puts it a little bit more in \nperspective, that it is not such a giant tax cut in proportion to the \ntaxes America collects.\n  The green portion of the chart is broken into two. The bottom is \nindividual income taxes, and we have corporate income taxes, and other \ntaxes.\n  This is what we collect. This from individuals--14, and 28 total. \nOver 10 years, it isn't such a very large tax reduction.\n  We might also suggest by way of words that both President Kennedy and \nPresident Reagan cut taxes.\n  Incidentally, both of them--one Democrat and one Republican--cut \nmarginal rates. They reduced the top rates. They reduced both the \nmiddle rates and the low rates for the same reason.\n  President Kennedy was advised that he ought to do it because of the \nfact the American economy had to be built up and grow and prosper, and \none of the things he ought to do as a Federal official was lower the \nmarginal tax rates. Lo and behold, that is what a Democrat President \ndid. He did that without the surplus we have.\n  Isn't it amazing? We are talking about being sure of everything that \nis going to happen; that we are going to have enough money to pay down \nthe debt. There were deficits in each year of the tax cut of President \nKennedy.\n  We have a predicted surplus of $5.6 trillion.\n  Second, the size of the Kennedy tax cut was twice the size in \nproportion to the American economy.\n  Then Ronald Reagan did marginal rate cuts also along with some other \nthings. Congress loaded it up, so to speak. But marginal rates were \nreduced substantially. That was three times the size of this tax cut.\n  Our President, with reference to asking for a tax reduction for the \nAmerican people, has been certainly modest in what he is asking for in \ncomparison to the total taxes.\n  Second, some people wonder why we do this over 10 years. We want to \nsuggest to the American people that it is permanent, and at the same \ntime, we want to suggest to ourselves the money is not even going to be \ncollected in the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth years. It is \njust staying with the American people. So it won't be around here. It \nwon't be in the budget of the United States. It would have already \ndisappeared from our grasp. We will not have it to spend. The American \npeople will have it in their paychecks, in their profits of small \nbusiness, which they distribute as individuals. It will go to them.\n  There is nothing better than doing this, and I say do it as quickly \nas we can to send a signal to at least the part of the American economy \nthat is not doing well, and a few States aren't doing well. My friend \nfrom Ohio, Senator Voinovich, was telling me today about Ohio having \nsome real economic problems. It is far different than New Mexico's \nproblems. They need a signal from the Congress and the President\n\n[[Page S2153]]\n\nthat we care about them, that we are concerned about them, and that we \nare cutting marginal rates so as to give some credibility to our \nconcern about the economic future in many parts of the United States, \nand, generally speaking, over the next decade, the status of our \neconomy in general so people and families will have a better chance. It \nwill be an important 10 years in terms of job opportunities and \nconsistent paychecks. That is what that is. I hope everybody knows this \nis a reasonable way to do it.\n  Maybe we will get around soon to satisfying some who have a little \nbit of concern about whether we are paying down the debt, and whether \nwe will continue paying it down over time. They are asking for some \nkind of trigger mechanism. Obviously, this Senator hasn't seen one that \nwill be in place. Yet that will leave the effectiveness of the tax in \nplace. Clearly, I say to those who want a trigger that you can't do a \ntrigger that triggers every year because then the people won't be \ngetting the benefit of this tax cut. They can't buy a car and pay \nbecause you only get the tax cut for one year, and that is a ``maybe'' \ntax cut. It is not a real tax cut. One year at a time won't work, \nespecially if you want the effect of marginal rates, which means \nlowering at every level a significant amount, though the lower level is \ngetting a bigger percentage of the reduction.\n\n  While I haven't seen any that leave the effectiveness of the tax in \nplace, I am willing to work with Members, the distinguished Senator, \nMs. Snowe, the occupant of the chair, many others, and Democrats \nworking on this issue. I say let's continue working on it. There may be \nsome way to do some collections, but certainly it should not be every \nyear. There should be a broad-based look at this so we look at spending \nalso. We should look at the debt if we are going to be doing it.\n  That is the conversation I wanted to have about the budget and tax \ncut.\n  I want to add to that. It is pretty obvious the Committee on Budget \nof the Senate, which now has 11 Democrats and 11 Republicans--it should \nbe pretty obvious to everyone that we can't get a bill out of that \ncommittee that gives the President an opportunity to have his tax \nmeasure considered by the Finance Committee. You understand that the \nbudget resolution just permits it. This makes room for it. In this \ncase, up to $1.6 billion. It doesn't say you have to pass $1.6 billion. \nBut we can't do it in the committee because we are tied. On every \nmatter of real substance regarding this budget we are going to be tied.\n  The taxes are well known by those who have worked with us. If it is \nin the Budget Committee for a long time, come a certain date--I believe \nit is April 1--statute of law says if you haven't produced a budget, \nthen you can call one up here. The Parliamentarian is familiar with \nthat as is the occupant of the chair. I haven't given up on the \ncommittee doing it. I want to have more conversations. But if we can't \ncome in closer than we are now, I don't intend to have a week's worth \nof votes pro and con, each one being 11-11, and then pass one 12-10. It \nisn't going to be very meaningful. I may let everybody talk for one \nday, let April 1 arrive, and then call up the budget. We will be \nworking with a number of people on that premise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/12/senate-section/article/S2153-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2153-S2159]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                BANKRUPTCY REFORM ACT OF 2001--Continued\n\n\n                      amendment No. 29 as Modified\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Now let's get down to tomorrow afternoon and vote \nbecause on the bankruptcy bill, the distinguished Senator, Mr. Kent \nConrad, ranking member, put an amendment on with reference to the \nMedicare trust fund and the Medicare program. This is side by side. \nThere will be another amendment offered by Senator Sessions. I believe \nmy staff helped put it together. I was in another meeting. Senator \nSessions introduced it. I want everybody to know it is, indeed, what I \nwould recommend.\n  I would like very much tomorrow to make sure all Senators understand \nthat we helped prepare it and are very pleased Senator Sessions was on \nthe floor. We will call it the Sessions-Domenici amendment. I want \neveryone to know, just as a matter of fairness to the distinguished \nSenator on the Democrat side, Mr. Kent Conrad, that, in fact, the point \nof order will be raised. It is not being raised now, but I believe a \npoint of order will be agreed to. That amendment will take 60 votes.\n  Obviously, on the Sessions-Domenici amendment, it is 60 votes. The \nDemocrat amendment hasn't changed that much. The point of order \nwouldn't lie against ours, but on ours it would be subject to the same.\n  I hope the bankruptcy bill will pass--either of them--because they do \nnot belong on the bankruptcy bill.\n  But, first, let me emphasize that President Bush has made it very \nclear--I am not quoting, I am paraphrasing--no moneys from the Medicare \ntrust fund will be spent on anything other than Medicare. He said that. \nHe has had various Members testify. There have been serious questions \nmade of the Secretary of Health and Human Services about this trust \nfund concept that is being raised by Senator Kent Conrad's amendment.\n  I asked him clearly: Did the President change his mind? Is there \nanything new?\n  No. It is just what it was, and now he looked at hundreds of millions \nof Americans and said none of the Medicare trust fund money will be \nused for anything other than Medicare.\n  As everybody knows, I don't have any intention of bringing a budget \nresolution to the floor that spends any Medicare money, or on anything \nother than Medicare. As a matter of fact, Medicare will be fully \nfunded, as it is by the President of the United States.\n\n  Having said that, we should be clear on one thing: The Conrad \namendment is not about protecting Medicare. That amendment is about \nusing scare tactics to prevent a tax cut. That always happens every \ntime we have something significant where we say, let's give the \nAmerican people back some of their money, or even better, let's not \neven collect it. Let's leave it with them, never bring it up here so we \nhave to cut taxes; just let them keep it.\n  Every time that happens, it becomes obvious the arguments against it \nwilt; they are not strong enough. So along comes the typical argument: \nThe Republicans and the President must be doing something about \nMedicare, something to harm it, hurt it.\n  The American people, in the last election, did not buy that argument \nbecause seniors, it seems like from at least what little we know, voted \nfor George Bush in pretty large numbers. They did not believe the scare \ntactics that the Social Security trust fund was going to be harmed by \nthe President's idea in relation to the individual accounts. They did \nnot believe the idea that Medicare was going to be hurt.\n  The same thing here. Senator Conrad has taken out the traditional \ntactic, and now he is making it an early issue with reference to the \nbudget by trying to attach it here on a bankruptcy bill that is moving \nthrough the Senate, and because it is the third or fourth time we have \nconsidered it, it has to get passed.\n  As I see it, things are certainly not going the way of those on the \nother side of the aisle. The President has proposed returning a small \nportion of the non-Social Security, non-Medicare surplus to the \nAmerican taxpayers, and the momentum is moving with the President. On \nthe chart I have here, that is this small red amount that he has \nproposed we give back to the American people, or never collect from \nthem.\n  But some on the other side are happy to still be against this \nPresident's tax proposal. So out comes the Medicare card, and suddenly \nit becomes a question of tax cuts versus Medicare. But Senator Breaux, \nfrom the other side of the aisle, was correct when he said:\n\n       Medicare must not be used as a wedge issue any longer. The \n     question before this Congress is not whether to cut taxes or \n     whether to save Medicare. That's not the choice we're facing.\n\n  The choice is something different than that. And he continued:\n\n       I support a tax cut, targeted, and I'm dedicated to saving \n     Medicare. It's not an either/or proposition.\n\n  Now, that is a true statement, whether or not you choose to have a \ntargeted tax cut or the President's notion--and the notion I support--\nof cutting everybody's income tax rate as described here on the chart.\n  The Breaux statement is:\n\n       I support a tax cut, targeted, and I'm dedicated to saving \n     Medicare. It's not an either/or proposition.\n\n\n[[Page S2154]]\n\n\n  Frankly, the amendment I am talking about really attempts to make it \nan either/or proposition.\n  I know for seniors, and for those who are worried about the seniors' \nfutures, and making sure we take care of Medicare, this business of \nPart A and Part B is not nice to talk about, but the Part A part of \nMedicare is essentially the hospital care program of Medicare; it is \nthe hospital care part. The assets of that trust fund are depleted in \n2026. At that point, Part A of Medicare will start running an overall \ndeficit.\n\n  As we look at the entire Medicare program, instead of just Part A, \nwhat is the rest of it? The rest of it, Part B, are all the other \nservices that many senior citizens get under the collar and title of \nMedicare. All of those programs are Part B, except essentially the \nhospital ones which are hospital bills and are Part A.\n  So if we look at this program instead of just Part A, we see that \nMedicare is already running a deficit. Let's look at it. There is a $58 \nbillion total Medicare deficit--$58 billion--in the year 2002. Very \nsimple. It is shown right there on the graph. There will be a nearly $1 \ntrillion Medicare deficit over the next 10 years. It is shown right \nthere on the graph.\n  So what do we need to do? Everybody knows what we have to do. We have \nto reform Medicare, not just shuffle money around. We have to reform \nit. But this amendment I am talking about, that I oppose, will make \nreforming Medicare more difficult.\n  The amendment wants to take half the Medicare program off budget \nwhile leaving the other half on budget. How can we reform a program \nthat is half on budget and half off budget when we need to reform the \nwhole package?\n  I want to point out, the amendment is not the same one that was \noffered last session by the same Senator. Under his current amendment, \nthe Part A surplus cannot be reduced for any reason, even for \nadditional Part A spending. At least last year, his similar amendment \nwould allow Part A surpluses to be spent on Part A Medicare expenses.\n  So while President Bush has promised that Medicare funds will be \nspent only on Medicare, the amendment I am opposing does not allow \nMedicare funds spent at all, even for Medicare. They are off budget. \nAnd I assume they are expecting us to use all of them to buy down debt. \nNow, maybe I am mistaken, but that is the way I read it.\n  We believe, if we are reducing the deficit of the United States by $2 \ntrillion, as the budget resolution and the President request, which is \nwhat we are doing--we are going to leave $1.2 trillion there for \nremaining debt--that you cannot reduce the debt any more. What are you \ngoing to do with this Medicare trust fund taking it off budget? Where \nare you going to invest it?\n  It seems to me we have to invent a whole new way to permit it to be \ninvested. Frankly, I do not know what that would be. And I do not think \nthat helps. I do not think that helps save the Medicare program.\n  I want to show my colleagues, on this graph, the red is income to the \ntrust fund, the green is spending, and the blue is assets. Look at \nthis. Look what has happened. The trust fund will be depleted by the \nyear 2026. Spending will exceed income plus interest in 2018. And \nspending will exceed income in 2010.\n  But if you were to adopt the Conrad amendment, ``spending exceeding \nincome plus interest'' would not be changed one nickel. And the year \n2026 event would not change at all. So what is the purpose of this? I \nbelieve it is to attempt to frustrate our ability to give back to the \nAmerican people $1.6 trillion, which I have just alluded to and have \nshown you in the previous chart, which ought to be done.\n  Tomorrow, we will have another opportunity to discuss this. I am not \nclamoring to adopt, unless the Senate really wants to, the Sessions-\nDomenici amendment, but it was actually passed by the House by an \noverwhelming margin. It permits you to reform Medicare. It permits you \nto do the proposal that we want to do with reference to prescription \ndrugs. It permits that to occur. And if, in fact, the reform is within \nthat Medicare fund, it is OK to be there. Under the Conrad amendment \nyou could do neither of those things with this trust fund, which I do \nnot think the Senate really wants to do. We will have a chance to refer \nto it further tomorrow.\n\n  I point out that the amendment Senator Conrad has offered is not the \nsame as the one he offered in the last session. Under his current \namendment, the Part A surpluses cannot be reduced for any reason--even \nfor additional Part A spending.\n  At least last year, Senator Conrad would allow Part A surpluses to be \nspent on Part A Medicare expenses.\n  So while President Bush has promised that Medicare funds will be \nspent only for Medicare, Senator Conrad doesn't want Medicare funds \nspent at all, even for Medicare.\n  This amendment will also encourage more of the accounting gimmicks we \nhave seen in the past. We are all aware that the current Part A \nsurpluses were generated because we shifted home health services from \nPart A to Part B back in 1997.\n  This change did nothing to improve the overall state of the Medicare \nprogram--it just made Part A look better.\n  So let's not be lulled into a false state of complacency in thinking \nthat playing political games with the Medicare trust fund will in any \nway protect Medicare.\n  Only reform of the program can truly protect Medicare for future \ngenerations.\n  Senator Conrad claims that his amendment is the fiscally responsible \nthing to do. But in fact, the fiscally responsible thing to do is to \nreform the entire Medicare program.\n  Senator Conrad's amendment will set back the cause of reform by \nsplitting Medicare permanently in two.\n  If Senators truly care about Medicare reform and they believe, as I \ndo, that the time has come to take serious action to save this program \nfor the future, then they should not support Senator Conrad's \namendment.\n  Once again, I say to my friend, and ranking member, Senator Conrad, a \npoint of order will be made tomorrow in a timely manner. Obviously, we \nwill do that when somebody is around on the other side of the aisle so \nthey can ask that it be waived and we can vote on it. There will be a \n60-vote requirement.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grassley).

I thank the Presiding Officer for replacing me as the \nChair so I could offer the amendment to the bill he is managing so \neffectively on the Senate floor. I appreciate his courtesy.\n  I rise to offer an amendment to the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2001. I \nam very pleased to be joined by Senators Kerry, Stevens, and Kennedy. \nOur amendment provides the family fisherman with the same kind of \nprotections and terms as granted family farmers under chapter 12 of our \nbankruptcy laws. It was passed by the Senate last year as part of \nbankruptcy reform legislation, but I rise, once again, to briefly take \nthe opportunity to explain the amendment and its importance to \ncommercial fishermen in coastal States.\n  I do not condone those who use the bankruptcy code as a tool to cure \ntheir self-induced financial woes. I have supported and will continue \nto support reasonable reforms to the bankruptcy laws that ensure the \nresponsible use of its provisions.\n  All consumers bear the burden of irresponsible debtors who abuse the \nsystem. At the same time, there are those who legitimately need the \nprotection of our bankruptcy laws and who do not abuse it. I commend \nthe Presiding Officer for striking the right balance in the legislation \nhe has brought before the Senate.\n  I believe bankruptcy should remain a tool of last resort for those in \nsevere financial distress. As those familiar with the bankruptcy code \nknow, however, a business reorganization in bankruptcy is very \ndifferent from a business dissolution. Reorganization embodies the hope \nthat by providing a business with some relief and allowing debt to be \nadjusted, the business will have the opportunity to get back on sound \nfinancial footing and thrive. In that vein, chapter 12 was added to the \nbankruptcy code in 1986 by the Presiding Officer, the distinguished \nSenator from Iowa, to provide for bankruptcy reorganization of the \nfamily farm and to give family farmers ``a fighting chance to \nreorganize their debts and keep their lands.''\n  To provide the fighting chance envisioned by the authors of chapter \n12, Congress provided a distinctive set of rules to govern the \nreorganization of a family farm. In essence, chapter 12 recognized the \nunique situation of family-owned businesses and the enormous value of \nthe family farmer to the American economy and to our American heritage. \nChapter 12 provides, for example, significant advantages over the \nstandard chapter 13 proceeding, including a longer time period in which \nto file a plan for relief, greater flexibility for the debtor to modify \nthe debts secured by their assets, and the alteration of the statutory \ntime limit to repay secured debt. The chapter 12 debtor is also given \nthe freedom to sell off parts of his or her property as part of a \nreorganization plan.\n  As the Chair well knows, chapter 12 has been a considerable success \nin the farm community. According to a recent University of Iowa study, \n74 percent of family farmers who file chapter 12 bankruptcy are still \nfarming, and 61 percent of the farmers who went through chapter 12 \nbelieve the law was very helpful in getting them back on their feet.\n  Recognizing the effectiveness of this law for farmers, I have \nsupported making chapter 12 a permanent part of the bankruptcy code. \nNow I am proposing to extend its protections to the family fisherman as \nwell as the family farmer.\n  In the State of Maine, fishing is a vital part of our economy and our \nway of life. The commercial fishing industry is made up of proud and \nfiercely independent individuals whose goal is to simply preserve their \nbusiness, family income, and community. My legislation would afford \nfishermen the same protection of business reorganization as is provided \nto family farmers.\n\n  There are many similarities between the family farmer and the \nfisherman.\n\n[[Page S2156]]\n\n Like the family farmer, the fisherman should be valued not only for \nhis contributions to our economy and to our food supply, but also for \nhis contributions to our heritage and our precious way of life. Like \nfarmers, fishermen face perennial threats from nature and the elements, \nas well as from the laws and regulations that, unfortunately, can at \ntimes threaten their very existence.\n  Like family farmers, fishermen are not seeking special treatment or a \nhandout from the Federal Government. They seek only the fighting chance \nto remain afloat so they can continue their way of life.\n  Recently I attended the Maine Fishermen's Forum, an annual event \nwhich provides the opportunity for policymakers to meet and discuss \nissues affecting our fishing communities. I spoke with many fishermen, \nand they told me they believe they need and deserve the protections \ngranted under the bankruptcy code to others who face similar, often \nunavoidable problems. Fishermen should not be denied the special \nbankruptcy protections accorded to farmers solely because they harvest \nthe sea and not the land.\n  Our amendment tracks closely how chapter 12 applies to family \nfarmers. Its protections are restricted to those fishermen with a \nregular income who have total debt of less than $1.5 million, most of \nwhich, 80 percent, must stem from commercial fishing. Moreover, \nfamilies must rely on fishing income for these provisions to apply.\n  The same protections and flexibility we grant to farmers should also \nbe granted to fishermen. By making this modest but important change to \nour bankruptcy laws, we will express our respect for the business of \nfishing and our shared wish that this unique way of life, which so \nembodies the State of Maine, should continue.\n  I ask that at the appropriate time my amendment be considered. I am \nhopeful it will be accepted by the Presiding Officer and the \ncommittee's ranking majority member, and that it will be adopted as we \ncontinue the debate on the bankruptcy legislation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Susan Collins for her work \nin developing this important amendment, which will extend chapter 12 \nbankruptcy protections to our family fishermen. I believe we should do \neverything possible to protect and preserve the small family-owned \nfishing businesses in this country.\n  In 1999, American fishermen harvested 9.3 billion pounds of seafood \nvalued at $3.5 billion dockside. The commercial marine fishing industry \ncontributed more than $27 billion to the Gross National Product in \n1999. In 1999, Massachusetts fishermen landed more than 198,000 pounds \nof seafood worth more than $260 million. The fishing port of New \nBedford, Massachusetts ranks second nationally in terms of the value of \nthe fishery landings in 1999 with nearly $130 million in seafood \nlanded.\n  These numbers sound great, but small, family-owned fishing businesses \nare in serious trouble. In Gloucester, America's oldest fishing port, \nlandings declined by 9 percent in 1999 to just less than $26 million. \nThis once proud fishing community, along with several other New England \ncommunities that borders the Gulf of Maine, have been rocked by the \ndramatic decline in inshore cod stocks. Gulf of Maine fishermen are \nfeeling the pain caused by low trip limits and closed fishing areas. \nMassachusetts Bay, the prime fishing grounds for much of the inshore \nfleet, is currently closed six months of the year to allow the cod fish \nto rebuild. Think of the effect that closing a family farm for six \nmonths each year would have on its profitability.\n  Decreasing fish stocks coupled with severe environmental factors such \nas coastal pollution and warmer oceans with changing currents has \nresulted in severely depleted fish stocks around the country. We are \nmaking progress in rebuilding stocks, however, the cost of this \nprogress has been a steep decline in the amount of fishing allowed in \nGeorges Bank and the Gulf of Maine. This in turn has made it much more \ndifficult for fishermen in Massachusetts and Maine to maintain \nprofitable businesses. That is why the Collins amendment is so \nimportant. It will ensure that fishermen have the flexibility under \nchapter 12 of the bankruptcy code to wait out the rebuilding of our \ncommercial fish stocks without back tracking on our conservation gains \nto date.\n  We are making progress rebuilding our fish stocks, but the social and \neconomic costs have been enormous. I strongly believe we must do \neverything we can to preserve the rich New England fishing heritage in \nMassachusetts without wiping out the fiercely independent small-boat \nfishermen.\n  In their annual report to the Congress released last month on the \nhealth of our Nation's fisheries, the National Marine Fisheries Service \nreported that there was no overfishing in 210 fish stocks in 2000 as \ncompared to 159 stocks in 1999, a significant improvement. This means \nthat we have reduced fishing pressure on many stocks to the point where \nwe can continue harvesting on a sustainable basis. Additionally, the \nnumber of stocks that are fully rebuilt has increased to 145 in 2000 \nfrom 122 stocks in 1999. Another significant improvement. My point is \nthat we are making real progress, however, the temptation will always \nexist to forgo what is in the long-term best interest of our fisheries, \nto relieve some of the short term pains that the fishing industry is \ngoing through.\n  The same protections and flexibility afforded the farming community \nshould be made available to family fishermen. By adopting this modest \nbut important change to the bankruptcy laws, we will not only preserve \nand protect a very important industry but a cherished way of life as \nwell.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 29, as Modified\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I will speak to one of the pending \namendments. I rise today to offer my support for a pending amendment \noffered by Senator Conrad, the Social Security and Medicare Off-Budget \nLockbox Act of 2001.\n  This legislation would protect Social Security and Medicare trust \nfunds from being raided to pay for tax cuts or programs and would \nensure our continuing commitment of the surpluses to debt reduction. I \nam pleased that similar legislation has had broad, bipartisan support \nin both the Senate and the House over the past years, as I believe it \nis the responsible step that we should take to ensure these vital \nbenefits remain available, with the paying down of the debt, with \nassuring that we have affordable tax cuts, and with the investments \nthat we need to make to ensure our country is stronger in the future.\n  Now, I know that the chairman of the Budget Committee, for whom I \nhave the greatest respect, suggests this amendment is more of a scare \ntactic than a real effort to protect Medicare and Social Security. But \nI have to respectfully disagree. This amendment is nearly identical to \nthe amendment for which 60 Senators, including 16 of our colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle, voted in favor of last year as an \namendment to the Labor/HHS appropriations bill, but it was \nunfortunately dropped in conference. It is important to raise it again \nnow because, much to my disappointment, President Bush's budget \nblueprint does appear to raid the Social Security and Medicare trust \nfunds to pay for his tax cut proposal.\n  Over the past several weeks, members of the administration have come \nbefore the Budget Committee, on which I serve, and argued that \nPresident Bush's blueprint protects the Social Security and Medicare \ntrust funds. But you can look at the numbers and see that is not the \ncase. A table in the blueprint entitled ``The President's 10-year \nPlan,'' for example, refers to a contingency reserve of over $840 \nbillion, of which over $500 billion of that comes from the Medicare \ntrust fund.\n  Since other parts of the administration's budget seriously underfund \nmany important priorities, such as a\n\n[[Page S2157]]\n\nprescription drug benefit for our seniors on Medicare, national \ndefense, investments in our schools and our children, our teachers, and \nother significant areas for which there is broad bipartisan support, it \nalso proposes hundreds of billions of dollars in unspecified cuts \nacross programs. And there isn't any mystery. There can't be any \nmystery that if you combine a very large tax cut with underfunding \nimportant programs and leaving out many others, then there will not be \nthe money in this reserve, and it is money taken out of the Medicare \ntrust fund that will be available to cover the priorities that we would \ndetermine are in our national interest.\n  During the time of projected surpluses, I have to ask, is this really \nthe choice that we want to be making? Madam President, I know most New \nYorkers would agree that it would be both unfair and wrong to \nshortchange either our seniors or our children when it comes to \nprescription drug benefits, or investments in smaller class sizes, \nschool construction, and other important programs that will improve the \nquality of education.\n  The real choice we face should be between a very large tax cut from \nwhich millions of working Americans would receive little to no tax \nrelief and the three priorities which I think we can agree on in this \nbody--a priority for affordable tax cuts, a priority to continue to pay \ndown the debt, and a priority of the kind of investment that we need to \nmake.\n\n  For example, I believe we should invest in a real prescription drug \nbenefit. The President's immediate helping hand proposal denies \neligibility for prescription drugs to nearly 25 million Medicare \nbeneficiaries, most of whom today lack affordable, dependable \nprescription drug coverage.\n  Republican and Democratic Governors have also raised concerns with \nthis proposal, noting that it fails to meet the immediate prescription \ndrug needs of their elderly and disabled residents.\n  The challenge should be not deciding to shortchange our seniors on \nprescription drugs in order to give a very large tax cut to people at \nthe upper end of the income scale, but it should be between how do we \nkeep all of our priorities in order and how do we provide prudent tax \nrelief, continue to pay down the debt, and invest in what will make us \na healthier, better-educated, stronger Nation.\n  I believe Senator Conrad's amendment to lock away the Social Security \nand Medicare trust funds sets the right balance. It clearly takes off \nbudget what should be off budget. It should not be used for a \ncontingency, for tax cuts, or for spending; it should be used for what \nit was intended to be used for: to meet the Social Security and \nMedicare needs of our seniors.\n  I ask that I be added as a cosponsor, and I urge my colleagues, as \nthey did once before on an appropriations measure, to ensure the \nsolvency of the important programs, such as Medicare, and to ensure the \nprovision of a prescription drug benefit to our seniors on Medicare, \nand to deal with the other important priorities that we face.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 39\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent it be in order to \nask for the yeas and nays on the Kennedy-Jeffords amendment on the \nbankruptcy bill, amendment number 39, with the vote to occur at \nwhatever appropriate time the votes are being stacked.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Is there \na sufficient second? There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 16\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I commend the Presiding Officer for her \namendment to protect family fishermen. I know the distinguished Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry, also strongly supports it. It is the \ntype of bipartisan amendment that can be agreed to on this side of the \naisle.\n  I have been checking around, and I do not find anyone over here who \ndisagrees with it. I hope on the other side it can also be agreed to. \nIf so, that is one we can move quickly to accept.\n  I want the distinguished Presiding Officer to know I checked on this \nside and there are no objections to her amendment, which is a good one.\n  However, I am disappointed that my good friend, the majority leader, \nhas filed cloture on this bill. The Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, \nSenator Reid, and I have been working to get amendments offered, filed, \nagreed to, if possible, and modified, if needed. We presented a good-\nfaith list of about 15 amendments on our side of the aisle as of last \nFriday. We are awaiting a response. I know a number of amendments have \nbeen filed by Republican Senators, and we are trying to quickly clear \nthem on our side if we can. I will continue to work to move forward on \nthis.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 41\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nto send to the desk an amendment on the prohibition and disclosure of \nthe identity of minor children.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment will \nbe set aside. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 41.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To protect the identity of minor children in bankruptcy \n                              proceedings)\n\n       On page 124, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 233. PROHIBITION ON DISCLOSURE OF IDENTITY OF MINOR \n                   CHILDREN.\n\n       (a) Prohibition.--Chapter 1 of title 11, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding after section 111, as added by \n     this Act, the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 112. Prohibition on disclosure of identity of minor \n       children\n\n       ``In a case under this title, the debtor may be required to \n     provide information regarding a minor child involved in \n     matters under this title, but may not be required to disclose \n     in the public records in the case the name of such minor \n     child.''.\n       (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections for chapter \n     1 of title 11, United States Code, is amended by adding at \n     the end the following:\n\n``112. Prohibition on disclosure of identity of minor children.''.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, this is an amendment to protect the \nidentity of minor children in bankruptcy court records. My amendment \npermits a debtor to withhold the name of a minor child in the public \nrecords of the bankruptcy case.\n  I submit this out of a sense of child safety. There is an unintended \nloophole, as the bill is written, in child safety. Sometimes \nbankruptcies occur when there have been a great deal of problems \nbetween parents. With that, nobody should know the name of the minor \nchildren.\n  The closing loophole does not restrict the necessary flow of \ninformation regarding a debtor's financial records. The House of \nRepresentatives adopted a similar amendment authored by Congressman \nMark Green during its debate on bankruptcy reform legislation.\n  The amendment is a modest but important first step to protecting \npersonal privacy and preventing criminal activity through the \nunnecessary disclosure of personal information in the public domain.\n  When individuals file for bankruptcy, of course, they are required to \ndisclose information regarding themselves and also their dependents. \nMost of this information is vital to ensuring the integrity of the \nbankruptcy process, but if you look at these forms, you realize a lot \nof this information is very personal, very detailed.\n  Indeed, bankruptcy records contain all kinds of highly sensitive \npersonal, financial, and medical information. I didn't realize how much \ninformation was in there while preparing for the bill. I was amazed at \nthe amount of personal, financial, and medical information. More and \nmore, Federal courts are making these court records that contain the \nvery highly sensitive personal, financial, and medical information \navailable for all to see, without\n\n[[Page S2158]]\n\nany privacy safeguards, and are available on the Internet.\n  Each Member can go on the Internet and get medical, personal, and \nprivacy records on bankruptcy debtors. For example, schedule 1 has a \ndocument entitled ``The Current Income of Individual Debtors'' that \nrequires a debtor to list his or her dependents' names, ages, and \nrelationship to the debtor. Some of this information is very important \nto creditors. I don't have any question about that.\n  It is also the type of information that some dangerous people could \nuse to seek out and contact children. We have seen predators of \nchildren who have sought this information over the Internet. Any \nparent, any grandparent, or any Senator should worry about someone \ngetting this information on children. My amendment simply protects \nminor children to unnecessary exposure from harm.\n  The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, has \nagreed to future hearings in the Judiciary Committee to consider the \nissue of personal information in paper and electronic court records and \nother governmental records. The manner in which all three branches of \nthe Federal Government, Federal agencies, the Congress, and the \njudiciary protect the privacy and personal information that Americans \nare required to divulge is an important area that needs our attention.\n  Earlier, we had a Leahy-Hatch amendment regarding protection of \ncustomer databases and consumer lists to prevent future ToySmart.com \ncases. We created omnibus bankruptcy proceedings as part of that Leahy-\nHatch amendment, the first consumer privacy advocate in consumer law. \nWorking together, we have proven that Republicans and Democrats can \ncome together in commonsense matters.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair. I thank my friend from Iowa.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for his \nkind words about the amendment I offered to extend the protections of \nchapter 12 of our bankruptcy code to our fishermen so that a fisherman \ncan be treated the same way as a farmer is treated. I appreciate his \nefforts to clear the amendment, which is a bipartisan amendment, on his \nside of the aisle.\n  I also commend the Senator from Vermont for the amendment he just \nproposed that safeguards the names of minor children in bankruptcy \nproceedings.\n  Last weekend, I had a discussion with a member of my staff who is \nresponsible for Cumberland and York Counties. He told me of our \noffice's attempts to assist women who are legally establishing new \nidentities in order to avoid being pursued by a violent ex-spouse or \nformer boyfriend. He told me the Social Security Administration, for \nexample, is very helpful once these women have gone to court and \nlegally changed their names for these very good reasons and helping \nthem to get new Social Security numbers. But he mentioned to me that \noftentimes the violent former spouse or boyfriend pursues these women \nusing other public records. For example, when they get a new driver's \nlicense in the State of Maine, Maine has the requirement that the State \nwhere they previously held a driver's license be notified. That creates \na paper trail by which the former spouse can pursue the woman who is \ntrying to get a fresh start for herself.\n  It occurs to me while listening to the comments of the Senator from \nVermont that the bankruptcy proceedings could also be a way that this \ninformation is disclosed, and that in cases where parental rights have \nbeen terminated this would be a means of a former spouse tracing the \nchildren to which he no longer has any parental rights.\n  There are a number of other examples where children can be preyed on \nby predators who gain access to this information. But I wanted to share \nthe experience that I had this last weekend with my staff's efforts to \nassist abused women in starting new lives through legally assuming a \nnew identity.\n  I commend the Senator from Vermont for his efforts. I look forward to \nworking further with him on this issue.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and neighbor from \nMaine. I appreciate her willingness to work together on this.\n  The Senator from Iowa is off the floor at the moment. He is in a \nmeeting. But while we wait for the Senator from Iowa, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 27, As Modified\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nto modify, on behalf of the Senator from California, Senator Feinstein, \nher amendment. I send that amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment will \nbe set aside.\n  Is there objection to the modification?\n  Without objection, the amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 27), as modified, is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To make an amendment with respect to extensions of credit to \n                          underage consumers)\n\n       At the end of Title XIII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1311.

Mr. President, it is an unfortunate irony that the \nimportant things in life are often left unsaid. It may surprise some to \nknow that, of all things, congressional legislation cannot escape this \ntruism.\n  In fact, the most important piece of education legislation Congress \nconsiders this year will not mention schools or students. The most \nimportant law enforcement legislation we consider this year will not \nrecognize the officers that safeguard our streets. And, the most \nimportant piece of emergency services legislation we address this year \nwill not reference the firefighters and paramedics who keep our \ncommunities safe.\n  In 1998, Congress passed the Internet Tax Freedom Act. That bill \nimposed a three year moratorium on specific State taxes applicable to \nthe Internet. The legislation didn't affect the States' ability to \nimpose sales tax on Internet purchases, nor did it fix the unfair \nadvantage ``e-tailers'' currently have over their main street \ncompetitors with respect to their responsibility to collect sales and \nuse taxes.\n  As a result of two Supreme Court rulings, a State is prohibited from \nrequiring out-of-State retailers from collecting sales tax on purchases \nmade by its residents if the business has no presence in the State. The \nsales tax still applies, it just has to be collected directly from the \npurchaser. For a variety of reasons, very little of this tax is ever \ncollected.\n  The Internet Tax Freedom Act created the Advisory Commission on \nElectronic Commerce which was supposed to come up with a solution to \nthis problem. Instead the Commission was hijacked by a small group who \nopted to demagogue this issue to further their ``anti-tax'' agenda. The \nresult was a year-long study of an issue with little in the form of \nuseful recommendations.\n  The game plan of the forces supporting the status quo is clear: \ndelay, delay, delay. Keep extending the moratorium until there is a \nsufficiently large political constituency to permanently block the \ncollection of sales taxes on purchases made over the Internet.\n  This is not a hidden agenda. Governor Gilmore, Chairman of the \nAdvisory Commission on Electronic Commerce stated it clearly when he \nsaid that ``I believe America should ban sales and use taxes on the \nInternet permanently, for all time. If we secure tax freedom on the \nInternet through 2006, tax freedom on the Internet will become an \nentitlement for the American people and a political inevitability. No \ntax collector will be welcome on the Internet after 2006.''\n  Let me be clear: this is not about whether purchases made over the \nInternet are subject to sales tax. They already are. The question is \nwhether Internet sellers should have the same responsibility to collect \nthe sales tax as their Main Street competitors.\n  If we answer this question with a ``no,'' funding for education, law \nenforcement and emergency services will suffer. Why? Because States \nhave the fundamental responsibility of financing public education in \nour country. Patrolling our streets, safeguarding the health and safety \nof our citizens--these tasks could not be accomplished without our \nState and local governments.\n  For most States, sales tax revenue is the primary means by which \nStates fulfill these responsibilities. Because many States rely on \nsales taxes for their general revenue, the equation is simple--no \ncollection of sales tax on the Internet means less money for new \nschools, police officers, and rapid response equipment. Six States--\nFlorida, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and Washington rely on \nsales taxes for more than half of their total tax revenue.\n  According to the General Accounting Office, by 2003 losses to State \nand local government revenues from uncollected sales taxes on Internet \nsales could climb as high as $12.5 billion. Florida's share of that \nlost revenue could be as much as $1 billion. When asked why he robbed \nbanks, Willie Sutton replied, ``that's where the money is.'' Today, the \nmoney is increasingly on the Internet.\n  There is another reason to fix this issue: fairness. No one would \nseriously consider a proposal that barred State and local governments \nfrom collecting sales and use taxes from retailers who operate in green \nbuildings. That would be unfair to those businesses that aren't located \nin green buildings. Yet that is fundamentally what proponents of the \nstatus quo argue for Internet retailers.\n  Our position should be clear: no more delays. No more moratoriums \nuntil Congress agrees to a process whereby States are directed to \nsimplify their sales tax systems in exchange for the authority they \nneed to require remote sellers to collect their sales taxes.\n  The legislation introduced last Friday takes the first positive step \nin this direction. That bill extends the current moratorium on Internet \naccess taxes and multiple or discriminatory taxes on the Internet, a \nprohibition that virtually all agree should be imposed.\n  More importantly, however, it establishes a process whereby States \ncan cooperatively unify and simplify their sales and use tax systems. \nSales tax laws must be made significantly more uniform across the \nstates and the administration of the tax must be substantially \noverhauled and simplified. The goal of this legislation is to develop a \nsimple, uniform and fair system of sales tax collection. It will reduce \nthe burden on remote sellers while protecting State and local \nsovereignty.\n  Once States have adopted this simplified system, they would then have \nthe authority to require remote sellers to collect and remit sales and \nuse taxes to the State.\n  Previous attempts to require remote sellers to collect sales and use \ntaxes have been criticized on the grounds that it was unreasonable to \nrequire businesses to keep track of the nearly 7,500 separate \njurisdictions levying sales and use taxes. This bill addresses that \ncriticism by requiring the states to dramatically simplify their sales \nand use tax systems by establishing uniform definitions and fewer \nrates.\n  The streamlined sales and use tax system envisioned by this \nlegislation follows the guidance offered by the Advisory Commission on \nElectronic Commerce. The attributes of this streamlined system include: \na centralized, one-stop, multi-state registration system for sellers; \nuniform definitions for goods or services that would be included in the \ntax base; uniform and simple rules for attributing transactions to \nparticular taxing jurisdictions; uniform rules for the designation of \nand identification of purchasers exempt from tax; uniform certification \nprocedures for software that sellers may rely on to determine State and\n\n[[Page S2160]]\n\nlocal taxes; uniform returns and remittance forms; consistent \nelectronic filing and remittance methods; State administration of State \nand local sales taxes; uniform audit procedures; reasonable \ncompensation for tax collection by remote sellers; exemption for remote \nsellers with less than $5 million in annual sales for the previous \nyear; appropriate protections for consumer privacy; and such other \nfeatures that a member states deem warranted to promote simplicity.\n  Critics of this legislation argue that it is anti-technology, and \nthat the Internet must be protected from this threat. That is not true. \nThe sponsors of this bill yield to no one in their support and \nenthusiasm for a vibrant information technology industry. But that \nsupport does not necessitate special breaks for companies doing \nbusiness over the Internet.\n  This legislation is more appropriately characterized with one word: \nfairness. It promotes fair treatment for all retailers. In addition it \nprotects States' abilities to collect the resources necessary to make \nthe education investments that will pave the way for the next \ntechnological breakthrough--the next Internet. I hope my colleagues \nwill join the sponsors of this bill and support this approach.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/12/senate-section/article/S2160-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JOAN FINNEY\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the \nfirst woman ever elected governor of the great State of Kansas, and my \ngood friend, Joan Finney.\n  Unfortunately, Governor Finney is currently in a serious battle with \nliver cancer.\n  Governor Finney served 16 years as State treasurer before becoming \nthe first woman elected to the State's highest office, where she served \nas governor from 1991 through 1994. She did not seek a second term.\n  A resolution adopted by the State Democratic party describes her as \nsomeone who ``gave tirelessly and selflessly to the people of Kansas, \ndedicating her energy, optimism, openness and faith to serving the \npeople of Kansas.''\n  I had the honor and privilege to serve with Governor Finney when I \nwas Secretary of Agriculture for the State of Kansas.\n  It was a true honor to serve with someone who believed so much in \npublic service. Particularly in a country that is marked by a growing \nskepticism about public service in general, and some of our public \nservants in particular, Governor Finney was a breath of fresh air in \nour capitol.\n  She embodied bipartisanship in so many ways; often working in a \nbipartisan way to advance the causes for which she so deeply believed. \nHer service to the State of Kansas will not soon be forgotten.\n  The Democrats at their annual meeting in Topeka this year adopted a \nresolution describing Governor Finney as ``truly one of Kansas' most \nadored native daughters'', and she is.\n  I extend my best wishes to Governor Finney as she faces this \ndifficult period in her life.

ROBERT GODDARD\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize \nthe contributions of a man who helped pave the way for the American \nspace flight program. Seventy-five years ago, on a cool morning in \nAuburn, MA, Dr. Goddard and his small group of students and assistants \nhuddled around a nine-pound, awkward looking structure and began the \nfirst of many, now familiar countdowns. Seconds later the small vehicle \nrose forty-one feet into the air and fell to the ground amid the cheers \nof those below. The age of modern rocketry was begun. Today, Doctor \nGoddard is recognized around the world as the father of modern rocket \npropulsion.\n  Goddard's dreams began, like thousands of other young children, with \nstories from his childhood. He was born in 1882, in Worcester, MA, as \nthe only child of a bookkeeper. In 1899, at age 17, young Robert dozed \noff in a cherry tree after having read H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds. \nHe dreamt he had ascended to Mars in a machine driven by centrifugal \nforce. When he awoke he devoted his life to making his dream of \nspaceflight a reality.\n  His aspiration of devising a system for propelling men away from the \nEarth led him to pursue an education in physics. In 1908, he earned his \nBachelor's of Science degree from Worcester Polytechnic Institute. He \nwent on to receive his Master's in Physics from Clark University in \n1910 and his doctorate in 1911. His early efforts in rocket propulsion \nmathematically explored various ideas including solar power, electric \nion propulsion, and explosive firing from a large cannon as narrated in \nJules Verne's classic 1865 novel From the Earth to the Moon. His work \neventually rejected all of these ideas as for lack of efficiency or \npower.\n  In 1914, Doctor Goddard patented a system for using liquid propellant \nto lift rockets into the cosmos. That same year he also received a \npatent for a multiple stage system. Goddard devoted his life to the \nideas and concepts of rocket propulsion that he first demonstrated in \n1926. Forty-three years later these two patents were put into practice \nto propel Neil Armstrong and his fellow astronauts to their historic \nmoon landing in 1969.\n  From 1920 to 1929 his work was sponsored primarily by the Smithsonian \nInstitution. During this period, Goddard wrote four unsolicited reports \nin which he revealed his visions of space exploration. He foretold of \nmanned vehicles exploring the moon and the planets, solar power, ion \npropulsion, and even journeys to other star systems. Goddard requested \nthat these reports be kept confidential because these lofty concepts \nwere completely unacceptable to the scientific community of the 1920s. \nIn 1932, in a letter to H.G. Wells, Goddard wrote, ``[A]iming at the \nstars, both literally and figuratively, is a problem to occupy \ngenerations, so that no matter how much progress one makes, there is \nalways the thrill of just beginning. . . .'' His visionary ideas were \nthe spark that ignited the passions of hundreds of young men and women \nto transform his idealistic dreams into reality.\n  But he wasn't just a dreamer. His practical solutions led to 214 \ntotal patents. In the early 1920s, Goddard began a series of rocket \ntests of which the 1926 launch was the hallmark. One of the key \ntheories proven by Goddard's experimentation was that a rocket will \nfunction in the vacuum of space. Before Goddard's meticulous tests, it \nwas widely believed in the scientific community that rockets moved by \npushing against the air. Goddard proved that rockets functioned on the \nreaction principle and that they would perform in a vacuum. On this \nfoundation, the path was laid for scientists and engineers to build on \nDoctor Goddard's work and lead the United States to the forefront of \nthe space race.\n  At his namesake, the Goddard Space Flight Center, in Greenbelt, MD, \nthe tremendous NASA scientists and engineers recently celebrated forty \nyears of continuing Dr. Goddard's legacy of discovery and exploration. \nSo, on this day, we should remember the efforts of this courageous \nvisionary and his successors as the finest example of American \nperseverance and ingenuity. Without Robert Goddard's enterprise, our \nrace to the stars would have faltered. His historic launch is truly one \nof the great mileposts on the road to the modern space age.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/12/senate-section/article/S2160-3", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2160-S2161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ELIAS ``SKIP'' ASHOOH\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

Skip \nwas surprised to see his exuberant mother and six siblings who reunited \nto share in this joyous occasion.\n  Upon completion of his bachelors degree from Saint Anselm College in \n1973, Skip pursued a career as a junior high social studies teacher in \nManchester where he shared his love of American history with his \nstudents.\n  After many years of teaching, Skip launched a new career as a \nlicensed\n\n[[Page S2161]]\n\nstock broker.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the \nachievements of a true friend of American agriculture, Grant B. \nBuntrock, a native of my home State of South Dakota. Grant died at his \nhome on Friday, March 9, 2001.\n  Grant made his mark on American agriculture all throughout his 38 \nyears of service. He was honored to be selected by President Clinton as \nthe administrator of the Department of Agriculture's Agricultural \nStabilization and Conservation Service, ASCS. Through reorganization, \nhe later became the first administrator of the Farm Service Agency, \nwhere he served until his retirement in 1997.\n  His training to be the agency's administrator came through his many \nASCS positions. From 1977 through 1980, he served as Assistant Deputy \nAdministrator, State and County Operations, DASCO. In 1981, he became \nthe director of the Cotton, Grain and Rice Price Support Division, \nwhere he administered all support programs. His other assignments \nincluded Director, Price Support and Loan Division and DASCO staff \nassistant, as well as assignments to the Programs Operations Division \nand the Bin Storage Division.\n  But perhaps the most important position of all was his tenure as a \nprogram specialist in the Brown County ASCS office and his position as \ncounty office manager in the Day County ASCS office. He was on the \nfront line, dealing directly with South Dakota's farmers and ranchers. \nHis friends are confident that is what guided him in making his daily \ndecisions on how our farm programs should function. While working day-\nto-day in the Department of Agriculture, he never forgot for whom he \nworked. The American farmer.\n  In the spring of 1995, Secretary Glickman came to South Dakota to see \nfirst hand the devastation our State experienced with severe flooding, \nthe likes of which our State has never seen. The Secretary gave Grant \nthe marching orders and he fulfilled those orders. Streamline disaster \nassistance, and get the help to those in need. Again, the American \nfarmer.\n  He is going back to his roots, in Columbia, South Dakota. He was born \nand raised on a wheat and cattle farm in Columbia, where he graduated \nfrom high school and later attended South Dakota State University in \nBrookings. He served his country in the U.S. Navy from 1955 to 1957.\n  I offer my condolences to his wife, Donna, his mother, Marietta, and \nhis children, LeAnn, Janelle, Gregory, his stepsons, Stephen, and \nGregory, and his seven grandchildren. They truly can be proud of \nGrant's service to his country.\n  South Dakota and the Nation has lost a true friend of agriculture. \nBut a friend of agriculture who has left many a mark for years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/12/senate-section/article/S2161-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BERNIE WRIGHT\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS.

LINDSAY\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nlate John V. Lindsay, a talented public servant and a remarkable man.\n  John Lindsay served in public office, first as a Member of the United \nStates House of Representatives, then as Mayor of New York City, during \nthe 1960's and early 1970's, a tumultuous period in our Nation's \nhistory. In ways both large and small, he demonstrated an unswerving \ncommitment to reason, to compassion and to progress for all Americans.\n  As a Republican, he recalled that he belonged to the party of \nLincoln. While many in the 1960's and 1970's walked the streets of \nAmerica's cities, he walked the streets of Harlem, jacket flung over \nhis shoulder, to promote understanding and harmony. While many \ncounseled caution and hesitation, he urged reconciliation among the \nraces and attention to the needs of the less fortunate. And while many \nfled our cities for suburbia, he stayed and worked tirelessly to make \nurban America safer and more culturally enriching for residents and \nvisitors alike.\n  John Lindsay made the fate of America's cities an urgent national \nconcern. He believed that the Nation's future rested on the health and \nvibrancy of its urban centers. He supported the arts, affordable \nhousing, school reforms and other initiatives to provide a better \nquality of life for both residents of and visitors to America's cities. \nToday, the renaissance being experienced in cities like New York, \nPhiladelphia, Chicago, and Los Angeles suggest that John Lindsay's \nhopeful vision for our cities has been realized at least in part.\n  Upon graduating from Yale University in 1943, he joined the Naval \nReserve as an ensign, serving as a gunnery officer during World War II. \nHe participated in the invasion of Sicily and in the American landings \nin Hollandia, the Admiralty Islands and the Philippines. He won five \nbattle stars and was a lieutenant when he was discharged in 1946.\n  Twelve years later, in 1958, John ran for Congress in New York's 17th \nCongressional District, which extended from Harlem to Greenwich Village \non the East Side. Though ethnically and culturally diverse, he \nrepresented all of the people of his district with understanding, \nempathy, and a keen sense of their varied needs. He would represent \nthem for eight years, re-elected three times by successively larger \nmargins. Thereafter, he would represent all of the people of New York \nas Mayor from 1966 to 1974.\n  In 1972, John ran for President. As we all know, he did not prevail \nin that endeavor, at least at the ballot box. But in another sense, he \nsucceeded in showing many in America what the people of New York City \nalready knew; that he was a man of uncommon intelligence, charisma, and \nvision.\n  On a personal note, let me say that I had the great good fortune to \nknow John not only as an elected leader, but as a friend. I will always \ncherish his warmth, his wit, and the wisdom he brought to all he did \nand said.\n  Our Nation has lost a public servant of rare gifts and broad vision. \nI extend my deepest sympathies to his wife, Mary Lindsay, to his \nchildren Katherine Lake, Margaret Picotte, Anne Lindsay, John Jr., \ntheir spouses and his five grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/12/senate-section/article/S2161-4", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2161-S2162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:32 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that pursuant to \nsection 5(a) of the James Madison Commemoration Commission Act (Public \nLaw\n\n[[Page S2162]]\n\n106-550), the Speaker appoints the following Members of the House of \nRepresentatives to the James Madison Commemoration Commission: Mr. \nGoodlatte of Virginia and Mr. Cantor of Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/12/senate-section/article/S2162-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-975.

A bill to amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act by designating \na segment of the Eightmile River in Connecticut for potential addition \nto the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to introduce the \nEightmile River Wild and Scenic River Study Act of 2001, along with my \ncolleague Senator Lieberman. Representative Simmons of Connecticut \nintroduced similar legislation in the House. The Eightmile River system \nis an important water resource within the Lower Connecticut River \nwatershed.\n  For more than 30 years, the Wild and Scenic River program has been a \nsuccessful public-private partnership to preserve certain select rivers \nin a free-flowing state. Designation as a Wild and Scenic River would \nensure that the river and surrounding watershed are protected from \ndevelopment projects under the locally controlled Conservation \nManagement Plan, which works to preserve a river's natural and \nsignificant resources.\n  But before a river receives Designation status as Wild and Scenic, a \ncomprehensive study must be undertaken to determine whether a river \npossesses recreational, ecological, and scenic significance. Further, \nit must be demonstrated that there is a strong local and long-term \ncommitment to preserving a river.\n  I am confident of the Eightmile River's significance and community \nsupport. Five years ago, the Connecticut towns of Salem, East Haddam \nand Lyme joined with educational and environmental groups to form the \nEightmile River Watershed Committee and signed a Conservation Compact \nto preserve the river. Another local group, the Connecticut River \nWatershed Council, has been working with local, state, and federal \nagencies to restore migratory fish to the Eightmile River. The building \nof fish ladders means that the area can now serve as a restored \nspawning area for Blue-backed Herring and Atlantic Salmon. Finally, \nproperty owners support designation for the Eightmile River in order to \npreserve the natural resource that flows by and near their property. \nClearly, there is a grassroots commitment to retain the integrity of \nthis river.\n  The State of Connecticut has recognized the Eightmile River as a \n``River of Importance.'' Eighty-five percent of the Eightmile River \nWatershed is forested and more than 180 species of birds, fish, plants \nand reptiles live there. It is truly one of the most diverse and \nthriving ecosystems in the lower Connecticut River Valley.\n  Connecticut is a small state, less than 5,000 square miles, and is \ndensely populated. While the State is actively working to preserve open \nspace, the state consistently ranks near the bottom in the amount of \nFederal land. Our citizens are committed to balancing conservation and \ngrowth. That is why this designation is so important. While the state \nand local groups have done exceptional work so far, this designation \nwould bring in federal technical assistance and foster coordination \namong the many concerned groups. It is time to get the formal process \nstarted.\n  For all of these reasons, I am pleased to introduce the Eightmile \nRiver Wild and Scenic River Study Act of 2001.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Frist, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. \n        Bayh):\n  S. 515. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nestablish a permanent tax incentive for research and development, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I am joining my co-sponsors, \nSenators Bingaman, Frist, Lieberman, Snowe, Kennedy and Bayh in \nintroducing the ``Private Sector Research and Development Investment \nAct of 2001'' This bill makes the Research Tax Credit permanent and \nsignificantly improves the structure of the Credit.\n  I am very pleased that President Bush has already endorsed a \npermanent Credit in his Agenda for Tax Relief. In the discussion of his \ntax package, President Bush notes that:\n\n       The credit encourages the technological developments that \n     are an important component of economic growth. . . . This \n     should help spur the sustained, long-term investment in R \n     that America needs to develop the next generation of critical \n     technologies.\n\n  I wholeheartedly agree.\n  I am also pleased to join with Senator Hatch and many cosponsors in \nhis bill to permanently extend the research credit and to increase the \nrates of the alternative incremental credit.\n  Today I want to suggest that we go a little further than both of \nthese proposals in revising the Research Tax Credit. We should use the \nenthusiasm toward making the credit permanent to also improve it. In \nthe process, we can significantly help the innovation process in our \nnation at the same time that we strengthen our universities and small \nbusinesses.\n  Advanced technologies drive a significant part of our nation's \neconomic strength. Our economy and our standard of living depend on a \nconstant influx of new technologies, processes, and products from our \nindustries. Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan has frequently \nreinforced the critical dependence between advanced technology and our \neconomic strength.\n  Many countries provide labor at lower costs than the United States. \nThus, as any new product matures, competitors using overseas labor \nfrequently find ways to undercut our production costs. We maintain our \neconomic strength only by constantly improving our products through \ninnovation. Maintaining and improving our national ability to innovate \nis critically important to the nation.\n  Today, we are introducing legislation to improve the Research Tax \nCredit. The single most important change in our bill is to make the \nCredit permanent, as the President proposes. But other parts of the \nCredit would benefit from improvements.\n  For example, the current Credit references a company's research in \n1984-88. That leads to situations where two companies doing the same \nresearch today receive different credits, depending on what they did in \n1984.\n  As another example, now there is a ``Basic Research Credit'' allowed, \nbut rarely used because of the way it is written. We could be using \nthis section to encourage unversity research, as I have done in this \nbill. We also provide incentives for research to be done with research \nconsortia.\n  In summary, this bill incorporates the improvements suggested by the \nPresident and in other current bills, and it goes further to strengthen \nthe Credit.\n  With this new bill, we will significantly strengthen incentives for \nprivate companies to undertake research that leads to new processes, \nnew services, and new products. The result will be stronger companies \nthat are better positioned for global competition. Those stronger \ncompanies will hire more people at higher salaries with real benefits \nto our national economy and workforce.\n  Madam President, I will speak on the subject of the credit that \nAmerican businesses get for research which is part of the Tax Code. I \nhope the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee is aware this \nyear the research tax credit has different\n\n[[Page S2165]]\n\nsupport this year because the President of the United States has asked \nwe make permanent this very important part of our Tax Code that gives \nAmerican companies, large and small, an opportunity to take part of \ntheir research and apply for a research tax credit.\n  I am introducing a bill today that improves the tax credit. The \nPresident asked us to extend it so businesses will know where they are, \nwhich has been your position for years. I am sure the Senator will do \nthat. Today I introduce a bill for 8 Senators on both sides of the \naisle. We think it has to be improved in two or three ways. We want to \nmake sure in America today that research by businesses, being done with \nuniversities, with laboratories, with a consortia of two or three \ncompanies and universities, two or three companies and laboratories, we \nwant to make sure that research fits the definition of a research tax \ncredit. That is what the big change has been.\n  Companies are not doing everything in house. They are doing it with \nuniversities, with other companies. They do not all get the tax credit, \nalthough it is part of the American marketplace, unless we modify the \ncurrent tax credit. This bill we introduce does that and six or seven \nother things to make it more functional. We will be calling it to the \nattention of your staff as a separate item. Although we support Senator \nHatch's bill that says continue it, make it permanent, we think it \nought to be improved to fit what is truly the way American businesses \nare doing business today in the marketplace of science.\n  I ask the bill for myself, Senator Bingaman, and seven other Senators \nbe sent to the desk and appropriately referred.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and referred.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/12/senate-section/article/S2165-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 58--TO AUTHORIZE THE PRINTING OF A COLLECTION OF THE \n                 RULES OF THE COMMITTEES OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, the amendment before us is the \ncontinuation of a debate that began in 1999. The bankruptcy bill \ncontains a provision that would place a $1 million cap on voluntary \ncontributions in an IRA owned by a bankrupt debtor. While this \nprovision is aimed at the same problem as the ``homestead exemption \ncap,'' it misses the mark. IRAs already have a cap on voluntary \ncontributions of $2,000 per year so it is impossible to ``stuff'' \nsignificant funds into an IRA in advance of filing for bankruptcy. In \nfact, the annual $2,000 contribution limits are generally viewed as \nbeing too low. In order to accumulate $1 million in voluntary $2,000 \ncontributions, it would take roughly 40 years, even with a 10% rate of \nreturn.\n  I believe that this $1 million cap is practically impossible to \nadminister. The cap does not apply to rollover funds from a pension \nplan. There are thousands of rollover IRAs in excess of $1 million. As \nBaby Boomers retire and take lump sum distributions from retirement \nplans, the number of $1 million IRAs will skyrocket.\n  However, tax law does not require that IRA rollover accounts be \nseparated from voluntary tax-deductible IRA contributions. The \nprincipal and interest in these accounts is also co-mingled. But, in \norder satisfy orders from Bankruptcy Courts to disgorge assets in co-\nmingled accounts, IRA Administrators will be forced to engage in costly \nand time consuming audits of the accounts to distinguish the funds.\n  I am most concerned, however, about the impact of this amendment on \nrollovers from retirement plans. Last year, we were successful in \npreventing the bankruptcy bill from the unprecedented breaching of the \nanti-alienation provisions of ERISA. The $1 million cap on IRAs will \ndiscourage retirement savings and pension portability by introducing \nuncertainty in the system. It will encourage individuals who change \njobs to simply take the cash and spend it, rather than roll their funds \ninto an IRA that would no longer be completely inviolate.\n  For all the potential harm that this provision of the bill would do, \nits benefits are only theoretical at some point in the future. I \nbelieve that the cost of this provision is too high and I urge my \ncolleagues to support the amendment to strike Section 224(e) of the \nbill\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 40.
