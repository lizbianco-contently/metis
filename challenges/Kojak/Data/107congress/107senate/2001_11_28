Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nmajority leader, following consultation with the Republican leader, may \nproceed to consideration of Calendar No. 161, S. 1214, the Port, \nMaritime, and Rail Security Act; that when the measure is considered, \nit be under the following limitations:\n  That a managers' substitute amendment be in order; that the \nsubstitute amendment be considered and agreed to and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table; that the bill, as thus amended, be \nconsidered as original text for the purpose of further amendment, with \nno points of order waived by this agreement; that all first-degree \namendments must be transportation-related; that the second-degree \namendments must be relevant to the first-degree amendment to which it \nis offered; that upon the disposition of all amendments, the bill be \nread the third time, and the Senate vote on passage of the bill, with \nthis action occurring with no further intervening action or debate.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, reserving the right to object, will the \nSenator explain the purpose of this legislation?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The purpose of this legislation, as we have now \nprovided for airport and airline security, is to provide for port \nsecurity and rail security. I want to make some comments about it. If \nthat is permitted, we will go into debate, and if the Chair will \nrecognize me, if they will allow it, I will explain in detail. This is \nwhat I want to do.\n  Mr. REID. I withdraw any reservation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. THOMAS. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, as requested by our leader, this \nmatter of port security is really a very serious concern. Very few \npeople realize this. The Financial Times and the Times of London, \nreported back in early October, almost 2 months ago, and I quote:\n\n       Intelligence actions across the world are examining Osama \n     bin Laden's multimillion dollar shipping interests. He \n     maintains a secret fleet, under a variety of flags of \n     convenience, allowing him to hide his ownership and transport \n     goods, arms, drugs, and recruits with little official \n     scrutiny.\n       Three years ago, nobody paid much attention to a crew \n     unloading cargo from a rusting freighter tied up on the \n     quayside in Mombasa, Kenya. The freighter was part of Osama \n     bin Laden's merchant fleet and the crew were delivering \n     supplies for the team of suicide bombers who weeks later \n     would blow up the United States embassies in Kenya and \n     Tanzania. Bin Laden's covert shipping interests were revealed \n     at the trial of the bombers, but until now security services \n     have been slow to track down how many vessels he operates.\n\n  Going further, Madam President, we heard that a suspected member of \nthe al-Qaida terrorist network in October tried to stow away in a \nshipping container heading to Toronto, Canada. The container was \nfurnished with a bed, a toilet, its own power source to operate the \nheater and recharge batteries.\n  According to the Toronto Sun, the man also had a global satellite \ntelephone, a regular cell phone, a laptop computer, cameras, identity \ndocuments, airport maps, security passes for airports in Canada, \nThailand, and Egypt, and he also had an airline mechanic's certificate. \nHe is being held now as a suspected member of the al-Qaida group and \nbin Laden's movement.\n  The threat is real, there is not any question about it. Let me \nemphasize, when the FBI said there was no threat to the Golden Gate \nBridge, that was nonsense. It has been reported in the news that four \nof these so-called martyrs can operate an oil tanker and run it right \ninto the bridge. So we have to be on the lookout for terrorist attacks \nwith respect to the ports of the United States.\n  Fortunately, my distinguished colleague from Florida, Senator Graham, \nhas led the fight to institute seaport security. In 1999, Senator \nGraham got President Clinton to appoint a commission, and they did a \nstudy on this issue.\n  At the local level, this bill will mandate that all ports and \nwaterfront facilities promulgate a comprehensive security plan approved \nby the Secretary of Transportation.\n  That is going to be a difficult task. There is not any question we \nhave some 361 entities rated as ports. Some are privately operated, \nsome are semi-privately operated and leased like in New York. Other \nports are operated entirely by the State like in my own hometown of \nCharleston, SC. None of them has any security plan. Fifty of these \nthree hundred and sixty-one ports account for 90 percent of all tonnage \ngoing to and from the United States.\n  The bill requires that the Customs Service, the port authorities, the \nCoast Guard, the controllers of ports, whether it be a private lessee \nor publicly run by the State or otherwise, get together and start \ncoordinating and promulgating a security plan approved by the Secretary \nof Transportation.\n  The bill for the first time will require that we know more in advance \nabout the cargo and crew members coming into the United States. The \nmore we know about a ship's cargo and where it originated, the better \nour Customs agents and other law enforcement officers can target \nsuspicious containers and passengers.\n  In fact, I heard from one port official that these measures would \ncause a delay. No, it is going to be delayed at the port if they do not \nknow ahead of time what to look for. It is going to take more time.\n  The bill requires that ships electronically send their cargo manifest \nto the port before gaining clearance to enter. Since it is going to \ntake money to enforce the provisions of this bill, the bill provides \n$390 million for grants to upgrade security infrastructure, another \n$166 million to back the issuing of $3.3 billion in loans and loan \nguarantees over 4 years for port security and infrastructure upgrades, \nanother $168 million to purchase nonintrusive screening and detection \nequipment for the U.S. Customs Service, $145 million to increase the \nnumber of Customs personnel screening the cargo and to update the \nCustoms computer systems, and $75 million to develop weapons screening \ntechnologies for use at the seaports.\n  Talk about money; we spend billions and billions for an anti-\nballistic missile defense system, and a cargo container can be \ndelivered anywhere in the United States for $5,000. The enemies of the \nUnited States can easily afford $5,000 to import a container which \ncould contain up to 60,000 pounds, 30 tons of materials. They could \nbring in a container of that size uninspected at Bayonne, NJ, full of \nanthrax, take it on up to Times Square, and blow it there. We talk \nabout the thousands who were lost at Ground Zero in New York. The \nnumber will go into the millions with an attack like this.\n\n  At Tijuana, agents will actually tear apart car seats searching for \ndrugs and other items, but thousands of truck-size cargo containers are \nbeing dumped on to the docks of the United States without any \ninspection whatsoever.\n  We are not playing games. The threat is serious, and it has to be \npaid for.\n  I particularly thank Senator Graham for his leadership in this \nregard. It was the year before last that we introduced a bill. We had \nhearings last October. Following the hearings last October, we \nreintroduced the bill. It is a bipartisan bill.\n  I thank my ranking member, Senator McCain, and particularly Rob \nFreeman of Senator McCain's staff who worked very hard on this \nlegislation.\n  I think the bill is in very good shape. We have coordinated time and \nagain with the White House on this measure. They know the contents of \nit. I do not know their disposition at the present time, but I do not \nthink we ought to adjourn this year without passing this well-\nconsidered bill, which has been developed over the past 3 years. We \nought to get moving on this bill.\n\n[[Page S12067]]\n\n  I again thank Senator McCain and Senator Graham. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, we are on the railroad retirement bill; \nis that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. We are on the motion to proceed.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I may \nproceed as in morning business for 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. What was the request, Madam President?\n  Mr. BURNS. To proceed as in morning business for 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             Energy Policy\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, we are in the closing weeks of the 1st \nsession of the 107th Congress. We are in a defined recession and at \nwar, and we seem to be talking about everything except those two items, \nand we are not doing anything about them.\n  As we talk about the security of the country, we have to consider how \nenergy and energy security play a role in the survival of this country, \nespecially in rebuilding the economy.\n  On Wednesday, November 14, the Energy Information Administration, \nwhich is a part of the Department of Energy, released a report that \nconcludes that our dependence on foreign sources of energy is going to \nincrease dramatically by the year 2020 because energy consumption will \nincrease more rapidly than increased domestic production. So our need \nfor new sources of energy continues.\n  Energy should be one of the highest priorities in the Senate. In \nterms of energy, there are two major reasons why the Senate should act \nthis year on an energy bill as part of a stimulus package, if it is to \nbe. First of all, for national security. Second, the economy needs the \nhelp right now. Energy costs hurt economic recovery as much as any \nother segment of our economy.\n  I see the Senator from Florida. I had the opportunity to spend some \nof the Thanksgiving break in his State. One would never think we were \nin an energy crisis with the price of gasoline up and down the road \nnow, but nonetheless I think that is a short-lived situation.\n  I have a couple of examples on what we should be doing and why we \nshould be doing it. Long before the terrorist attacks of September 11, \nPresident Bush recognized the vital role that energy plays in the \neconomy and, of course, our national security. Shortly after taking \noffice, he established a national energy policy development group under \nVice President Dick Cheney to take on the task of examining America's \nneeds for developing a balanced and comprehensive energy policy to \nassure reliable, affordable, efficient, and environmentally sound \nenergy for the future. This does not pertain to our fuels of \ntransportation. It does not deal with the transportation fuels such as \ngasoline or, in some cases, natural gas.\n  It deals with what we are going to do with electrical power in rural \nareas and how we restructure the power industry to address those needs \nof industry and, of course, our quality of life.\n  On May 17 of this year, Vice President Cheney's task force announced \ntheir comprehensive plan for energy, dealing not only with the cost of \nenergy but also a sustainable supply. On August 2, a bipartisan \ncoalition of Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives \npassed the Securing America's Future Energy Act, the SAFE Act, of 2001, \nwhich is basically H.R. 4, a comprehensive energy bill that \nincorporates many of the President's proposals.\n  In the Senate, led by Senator Murkowski of Alaska, this side of the \naisle has put forth numerous plans but they have all refused even to \nlet us debate our plans. They are comprehensive. They are bipartisan. \nIn fact, the major portions of organized labor, including Teamsters, \nback what Senator Murkowski has proposed.\n  We are asking: Where do we go from here? Are we being remiss if we do \nnot seize the moment of bipartisanship and pass a comprehensive energy \nbill?\n  Despite such timely steps to help lessen U.S. dependence on foreign \noil and promote energy development and production, progress has \nstalled. We began hearings on this legislation last March but have \nfailed to act. In fact, Majority Leader Daschle specifically instructed \nthe Energy Committee to stop action for the rest of the year.\n  In a time of crisis, and it could be a time of crisis and we are in \nthis crisis of war, we should be trying to find some sort of answers to \nthese situations. So I am asking today that we reconsider our agenda \nand look at security, both economic and energy security, for this \ncountry.\n\n\n                          The Civil Air Patrol\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, today I recognize the Civil Air Patrol as \nthey celebrate their 60th anniversary this year.\n  I rise to commend the many men and women serving in our armed forces. \nThese brave souls are stationed around the world and on the front \nlines, defending freedom, liberty and our way of life. Today, I \nspecifically want to acknowledge the individuals of the Civil Air \nPatrol, CAP, and celebrate their service to our nation because of the \nupcoming 60th anniversary of their fellowship and support as defenders \nof security for our country.\n  The Civil Air Patrol was founded December 1, 1941, one week before \nthe Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, by over 150,000 citizens concerned \nabout the defense of America. Flying under the jurisdiction of the Army \nAir Forces, CAP pilots flew over one-half million hours, were credited \nwith sinking 2 enemy submarines, and rescued hundreds of crash \nsurvivors during WWII. On July 1, 1946, President Truman established \nthe Civil Air Patrol as a federally chartered benevolent civilian \ncorporation. Congress passed Public Law 557 on May 26, 1948, which made \nthe Civil Air Patrol the auxiliary of the new United States Air Force. \nThe Civil Air Patrol was charged with three primary missions: Cadet \nPrograms, Aerospace Education and Emergency Services.\n  Today there are almost 1800 units of the Civil Air Patrol nationwide, \nwith approximately 60,000 members. All of these members are volunteers. \nEach year they provide countless acts of community service in the form \nof educational workshops, cadet training, and emergency support that in \nmy opinion are the highest level of good citizenship.\n  When I learned of the 60th anniversary of the inception of the Civil \nAir Patrol, I thought it necessary to speak on their behalf. This \ngroup, formed during another time when America felt the need for \nhomeland defense measures, has grown, flourished, and now is a vital \nservice group during the resurgence of a need for the citizenry to \nbecome involved in the fight to protect what is the lifeblood of \nAmerica. All of the men and women serving in the Armed Forces deserve \nour praise. Whether active duty, guard, or reserve, this is one Senator \nwho sincerely appreciates the sacrifices these men and women make daily \nto defend this great nation. They are truly patriots.\n  I can't say enough about how community involvement, whether it be as \nsimple as providing educational tools or as critical as giving manpower \nin an environmental crisis, works to harness the fiber of a society. In \nwartime, this fiber is tested, and the work of these individuals goes a \nlong way to ensure that it remains strong.\n  Montana has over 400 members of the Civil Air Patrol, and I thank \nthem for their efforts in helping Montana communities. Examples of \ntheir work can be seen in many areas. The Montana branch of the Civil \nAir Patrol is active in searching for lost persons. During times of \nflood, or other disasters, the Montana Wing can transmit aerial real-\ntime photographs to disaster services personnel to help them evaluate \nthe situation. The Montana Wing was involved a great deal during the \nfires of 2000, flying over areas to be evacuated, taking aerial \nphotographs, to help Disaster Emergency Services personnel create \nevacuation routes. In addition, The Montana Wing holds regular Search \nand Rescue Exercises throughout the state to enable members to prepare \nfor an actual search and familiarize themselves with the variety of \ntopography the state has.\n  The Montana Wing has an active cadet program teaching youth \nleadership skills, moral ethics, military discipline, aerospace \neducation and disaster relief skills. This year, Montana sent one of 8 \nteams, representing the\n\n[[Page S12068]]\n\nCivil Air Patrol's 8 national regions, to the National Color Guard \nCompetition at the Air Force Academy.\n  As you can see, this group is deserving of acknowledgment for its \nefforts to produce good citizens and to aid in the community when there \nis need. I applaud their 60 years of hard work, and I hope that we'll \nsee them continue in their service for another 60 years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on the motion to proceed on H.R. 10.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent that I be granted 10 minutes as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Port, Maritime, and Rail Security Act\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I commend my friend and colleague Senator \nHollings for the effort he made a few moments ago to secure the \nunanimous consent agreement to take up the legislation which passed out \nof his Commerce Committee, which he, as well as the ranking member, \nSenator McCain, and a number of other Members of the Senate, have \ncosponsored to strengthen the security in and around affected \ncommunities of our seaports.\n  The question to me, with the denial of that motion for unanimous \nconsent to take up this very critical legislation for Senate \nconsideration, is: Are we committed to the proposition that the only \ntime we will provide for security for the people of America is after we \nhave been attacked? Will we wait until another equivalent of the use of \nhijacked airplanes to strike major icons of American commerce and \nsecurity such as the World Trade Center and the Pentagon? Will we wait \nuntil the equivalent of using the mail as a means of distributing \nanthrax? Will we wait until we are attacked on our railways, in our \nseaports, through the containers that cover virtually every community \nin America, before we respond to enhanced security of those areas? It \nwould be a sad commentary if we were so brain dead we had to wait until \nwe had the alarm of an actual use of one of those techniques before we \nbegan to be concerned about enhancing our security.\n  I commend Senator Hollings for bringing this matter so forcefully \nbefore us, and I ask whoever it might have been who objected to \nbringing this matter up to reconsider. This is not controversial \nlegislation as, for instance, the legislation that was discussed by our \ncolleague from Montana. This is legislation which has the broadest \nbipartisan support--support in the executive branch as well as in the \nCongress--and it increases the understanding of the American people.\n  In recent discussions concerning our security vulnerabilities, almost \nevery discussion now includes seaports as one of those areas to which \nwe need to be giving priority attention. I hope there will be some \nsober reconsideration of whether those who have objected wish to assume \nthe responsibility that when we have a terrorist use of our seaports, \nor one of the many containers that come into our seaports every day, as \nthe means of assaulting the people of America, they are prepared to \naccept the responsibility that they decided there was something \npolitically or otherwise of higher priority than providing this \npreventive form of security for the American people.\n  Let me supplement the very able remarks of my colleague from South \nCarolina with two observations about why this issue is so important and \ntimely. First, unlike airports, which are a product of the 20th \ncentury, where there was a strong Federal Government involvement from \nthe very beginning, seaports are a colonial institution. They grew up \nas a highly localized institution. The city of New York developed its \nport; the city of Boston, its port; the city of Charleston, its port, \nlargely independent of each other. That tradition of a high degree of \nlocalism persists today. There are many benefits in ports being able to \naccommodate the particular economic and social circumstances of the \ncommunity in which they happen to reside, but they have also created a \nmajor vulnerability.\n  There are 361 seaports in the United States. The tendency for those \nwho are involved in the illicit use of seaports is to find the seaport \nthat has the weakest security and then use that as the basis of their \noperation.\n  In my State of Florida we have 14 deepwater seaports. We have had a \nlong and unfortunate history of persons who want to use seaports as the \nmeans of carrying out their criminal deeds by determining which of \nthose 14 has the most lax security and then using that seaport for \ntheir evil deeds.\n\n  I suggest the same thing is likely to happen with terrorists. While \nwe respect the tradition of localism in our seaports, we also need to \nhave a strengthened Federal role, as the Senator from South Carolina \nhas described, including consistency in security standards port to port \nso we will not be creating these pockets of soft vulnerability for \ncriminal and terrorist activity.\n  Second, some of our colleagues from the interior of the country might \nthink this is an issue that does not affect them: If I don't have a \nseaport in my State--unlike the Presiding Officer who comes from a \ncoastal State with a major seaport in Savannah--if I am not from such a \nState as Georgia or South Carolina or Florida, this does not affect me \nand I will not get particularly exercised about strengthening seaports. \nMr. President, it is not the seaport that is the principal threat. It \nis those 16,000 containers every day, every 24 hours, which are \ndelivered to an American seaport and then placed on a truck or railroad \ncar and moved to virtually every community in America as a critical \npart of our national commerce. The 16,000 containers are the containers \nthat come from noncontiguous nations. They do not come from Canada, \nthey do not come from Mexico, but they come from everyplace else in the \nworld and arrive at one of our 361 seaports in America.\n  Less than 3 percent of those 16,000 are inspected. Therefore, 97 \npercent plus are released into America without any determination of \nwhat is inside that container. With the creativity terrorists have \nshown, the use of one of those containers from a port far away, with \nvery little prospect that it will be inspected and interdicted before \nit arrives at its ultimate destination, is an attractive means of mass \ndestruction for terrorists, as it has been in the past a very \nattractive means of more traditional criminal activity.\n  One of the most important provisions of this legislation is going to \nbe to rapidly accelerate the technology of x-raying and other scanning \nof containers so we will get that percentage above 3 percent and have a \ngreater assurance that containers are not used as weapons of mass \ndestruction. That, in conjunction with increased intelligence which \nwill identify from what ports and with what bills of lading what \ncontainers are likely to be arriving in the United States that would be \nused for terrorists or other illegal activities in conjunction with \nincreased technology, will give us a greater chance to secure the \nAmerican people from the illicit use of the containers which emanate \nfrom our seaports.\n  I urge Members who have objected to taking up this bill, which I \nsuggest will pass this Senate by close to a unanimous vote, where there \nis strong support, to remove their objection. This legislation is \nlargely based, as Senator Hollings has already noted, on work of a \ncommission established over 2 years ago. It was headed by the then-head \nof U.S. Customs, Ray Kelly, who now happens to be the new chief of \npolice of New York City, the admiral in charge of the U.S. Coast Guard, \nAdmiral Lloyd, and other Federal executive officials with \nresponsibilities for seaports. It was a solid, well-developed report \nwhich has been implemented to the extent possible through \nadministrative actions. Now the burden is on us to provide the \nresources and the law changes necessary to fully implement this report. \nIt is an urgent matter, a matter which we should take pride in the \nopportunity to act preventively, preemptively, before the American \npeople are attacked at a seaport or through a container which emanated \nfrom a seaport.\n  I urge reconsideration of denial of the motion for unanimous consent, \nbring this matter up, have a debate, which I suggest will likely be \nshort and very one-sided in terms of the support this legislation will \nreceive. We should pass this legislation, send it to our colleagues in \nthe House, and hope they\n\n[[Page S12069]]\n\nwill act expeditiously so we can provide this protection to the people \nof America.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Hollings.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           National Security\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will comment on a couple of issues, one \nof which was raised yesterday by the majority leader and commented upon \nthis morning by our colleague from Montana--the issue of energy policy.\n  Yesterday, the majority leader came to the floor and said we would be \ntaking up a comprehensive energy bill in the Senate, the first work \nperiod after we reconvene in January. I appreciated that. I think it is \nthe right thing to do. Energy policy is much more than just finding \nenergy or conserving energy. It is also a matter of national security \nand energy security. It is the right thing to do.\n  We are trying to form an energy policy for this country that is \nbalanced. Some believe this country's future energy needs are simply \ngoing to be satisfied by digging and drilling. That will not be the \ncase. We should produce more--yes, oil, gas, and coal--and do so in an \nenvironmentally sensitive way. There is no question about that. I \nsupport that.\n  However, if that is our only policy--digging and drilling--our energy \npolicy is consigned to be ``yesterday forever.'' That is not what I \nwant for an energy policy.\n  I discussed this with the energy policy experts at a hearing. We \ntalked about Social Security 50 years from now. I asked: Do you have a \nnotion of what we want for an energy policy 25 and 50 years from now, \nand if so, can you state what it is? The answer they gave me was: We \nwill have to get back to you.\n  I think as a country, we ought to have a policy that, 50 years from \nnow, aspires to do certain things. Let me describe why.\n  My first car was a 1924 Model T Ford. I bought it as an antique and \nrestored it. As a young 14-year-old boy, I spent a lot of time with \nthat old Model T Ford. A man named Tony owned it. I come from a town of \n300 people, and Tony had it in the 1920s. A Model T Ford, for those who \ndon't know, is like a little red wagon. When you turn the wheels too \nsharply on one of the red wagons, the front tips over because the wheel \nturns too far. The Model T Ford used to do that. It would jackknife if \nyou turned too quickly.\n  This Model T was driven home from the bar one evening, I am told, and \nthe driver apparently had a lot to drink. He thought he saw a group of \nchickens in the road. So he took the wheel of the Model T, turned it \nall the way over, and jackknifed the front wheels. He was pinned \nunderneath the car, and hot water from the radiator dripped on his ear. \nHe lost part of the ear. After the Model T was fixed, he drove it home, \nput it in a granary, and there it sat for four decades. He never drove \nit again and never intended to drive again, all because of the phantom \nchickens.\n  My dad said I ought to write this fellow, who lived in Wisconsin. I \nwas 14; I wrote to him and asked if he wanted to sell the Model T. Rats \nhad taken the wires and the seat cushion, but there was the frame. He \nsent a letter back and he said: Not only will I sell it, but here is \nthe key and the owner's manual. I want $25.\n  So I bought a Model T Ford for $25, and I restored it. It was a labor \nof love.\n\n  But the interesting thing about that 1920 Model T Ford is that you \nput gas in it the same way that you put gas in a car today. Mr. \nPresident, 75, 80 years later, automobiles are fueled exactly the same \nway: Go up to a gas pump, pull out a hose, stick it in, and fill it \nwith gas. Nothing has changed. Everything else about our lives has \nchanged, but nothing has changed about how we fuel our automobiles.\n  If you look at energy usage in this country, the most significant \nincrease is in transportation. When we look forward 50 years, let's \naspire to do things differently. What kind of energy use do we want? \nWhat do we aspire to do in conservation? What do we aspire to do in \nproduction? Do we believe we can have fuel cells? I drove a fuel cell \ncar on the grounds of the Capitol awhile back. Can an automobile using \na fuel cell be part of our future? If so, how much? How about ethanol? \nHow about taking a drop of alcohol from a kernel of corn, with the \nprotein feed stock left over, and using that drop of alcohol to extend \nour country's energy supply?\n  We are trying to write an energy bill that makes sense. The majority \nleader said, I commit, we are going to bring it to the floor during the \nfirst two months of the year--the first work period of the year, \nfollowing our return in January. That energy bill is going to be about \nproduction--yes, environmentally sensible production with certain \nsafeguards--conservation, which is important; efficiencies, which are \nalso important; and in addition to that, we are going to talk about \nlimitless, renewable energy sources, which can also contribute a great \ndeal to our country's energy future, both with respect to petroleum and \nalso with respect to electricity and the production of electricity.\n  So what the majority leader has said makes good sense. He understands \nthat energy is a matter of national security. He is committed to \nbringing an energy bill to the floor. It is going to be an energy bill \nthat is much more balanced than that which came out of the House, and \nit is not going to be ``yesterday forever,'' it is going to be a \nforward-looking, balanced plan. That is the way it ought to be. That is \nwhat this Congress owes to the people in this country.\n  Let me turn to the issue of aviation just for a moment.\n  Yesterday, the Secretary of Transportation said he cannot meet the \n60-day requirement of baggage screening that was in the legislation we \njust passed to try to promote safety with respect to air travel. I \nregret that. I am really not very interested in hearing a Secretary or \nanyone else telling us what they can't do. I am much more interested in \nfinding out what they are doing to try to meet these goals.\n  We put in this legislation, which was coauthored by my colleague, \nSenator Hollings, and Senator McCain, and the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Commerce Committee--we put in four alternatives how they \nmight meet their obligations in the first 60 days. There are four \ndifferent approaches that can be used.\n  I was mightily disappointed yesterday to hear the Secretary say we \ncannot meet those time deadlines. I am just not interested in hearing \nwhat cannot be done. We are at war at this point. We are told almost \nweekly that there are credible threats of additional terrorist acts in \nthis country. We have soldiers in the field abroad, and we have, \nsupposedly, terrorist threats here at home. The issue of this aviation \nsecurity is a matter of homeland security and homeland defense. We \ncannot be talking about what can't be done. We have to talk about what \nwe are aspiring to achieve and how we are going to try to meet \ndeadlines.\n\n  That is very important. I hope the Secretary and others will \nunderstand our impatience with that kind of talk. I understand none of \nthis is easy. It is not easy for anybody. Those young marines landing \nin Afghanistan, it is not easy for them or their families. None of this \nis easy for anybody. But we passed an aviation security bill because we \nmust address this issue of safety in the air. God forbid that there be \nan explosion that will bring down an airliner in the coming weeks; God \nforbid that would happen. We must do everything we can, all of us, \ntogether, to assure safety in this country in a range of areas and \nespecially safety with respect to airport security and aviation safety.\n  Finally, I wish to comment about a bill that is going to be brought \nto the floor, we hope, tomorrow, and that is the farm bill. I have \ntalked to some of my colleagues who have hinted in recent weeks that \nthey may hold up that farm bill, that they may block the motion to \nproceed. I encourage them not to do that. We have a farm law called the \nFreedom to Farm law that doesn't work at all. It is a terrible piece of \nlegislation. Its premise was, let's not have a farm program and let's \nwean ourselves off it over 7 years, declining price supports over 7 \nyears. During that period of time, what has happened is commodity \nprices have collapsed, family farmers are hanging on by their\n\n[[Page S12070]]\n\nfinancial fingertips, and we must, it seems to me, write a better farm \nbill.\n  The House of Representatives has done that. The Senate Agriculture \nCommittee has done that. Now we have an opportunity to get it to the \nfloor of the Senate late this week, perhaps tomorrow, and then pass the \nfarm bill, get it into conference. I do not think it will be too hard \nto conference because it is not too different from the House of \nRepresentatives' bill. Different but not radically different. They are \nboth a U-turn from the present Freedom to Farm law; they both recognize \nthe need for countercyclical help for family farmers. It is very \nimportant to put a bill on the President's desk for signature to \nimprove the farm law in this country and give family farmers a chance \nto make a living. It is very important that we have cooperation.\n  I am not here to point fingers or say anything bad about anything or \nanybody. I am just asking everyone in the Senate to work with us. Let's \nnot filibuster this. Let's not take ourselves down a blind alley with \namendments that have nothing to do with it. Join us to stand up for \nfamily farmers. Join us to stand up for those farm families who have \nstruggled so hard in this country to make it.\n  When talking about security, food security is also part of our \ncountry's needs--the need for a secure food supply. Europe has \nunderstood that, and as a result of that they decided they would have a \nnetwork of family producers across the land in Europe. They would \nstimulate the ability to retain family farms in Europe. That is good \npublic policy. That promotes food security. We ought to embrace the \nsame, in my judgment.\n  My fervent hope is that by the end of this week we will have enlisted \nthe cooperation of all of our colleagues so we can debate a farm bill, \nput it into conference, and next week we can have a conference with the \nHouse and hopefully put a bill on the President's desk for signing as \nsoon as possible.\n  I wanted to comment about those three items. All are timely and very \nimportant--energy, agriculture, and a farm bill. My hope is we will \nmake progress on all of them in the times we have discussed, and I \nappreciate the cooperation of my colleagues as we begin to turn to this \nfarm legislation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I guess I will be in morning business \nbecause I wish to talk about a number of different items, if I may, for \n10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, what my friend from North Dakota just \ntalked about describes where we are. We are down to the end of this \nyear's activities. We are down to the end of this session. Yet we do \nnot seem to have established for ourselves the priorities collectively \nthat we should handle before we leave. I understand everyone has a \nlittle different point of view. Everyone has interests of their own. \nEveryone has things they have pursued and find most interesting. But \nthe fact is, we have some things that have to be done. We have some \nthings that I think most people would agree are priorities. But we have \nseemingly not been able to establish how we are going to spend our \ntime.\n  For example, now on the floor is this railroad retirement bill. It is \na bill most people would be happy to talk about. It should be talked \nabout. But it doesn't need to be talked about now.\n  There are many items. Senators were already talking about, of course, \nthe security of ships and docks, and so on. It is very important stuff. \nIs that where we are at the moment?\n  There is no doubt these issues are important, but there are lots of \nthings we need to talk about. We have not finished our appropriations, \nwhich should have been done in August. They are still not done. We are \nhaving great debates over Defense appropriations, which of course is \nhighly important. We ought to be doing that. We have some conference \ncommittee reports now that are available. We are not talking about \nthose. So I have to suggest some of the things that have been brought \nup here are totally political and have to do more with posturing than \nthey do with doing what we need to do.\n  We need to do appropriations.\n  I don't think anybody resists the idea that we need to do a stimulus \nbill. We don't have one we can agree on because we haven't been able to \nget together to do that. We ought to be able to do that.\n  I happen to think we need an energy bill. Again, it is not only a \npart of the economy but it is also certainly a part of our war on \nterrorism. As we get involved in the Middle East, we certainly have to \ntake a look at what we do about energy.\n  It seems to me that one of the things we ought to do among ourselves \nis determine what our priorities are, and go about getting those things \nfinished.\n  The longer we are here, of course, all of these ideas come up for \nspending. We ought to take a good look at where we are.\n  I happen to be on the Agriculture Committee, as does the Presiding \nOfficer. I would look forward to an Agriculture bill. We don't even \nknow what it costs. It has not been scored. It is a little unusual to \nbe bringing something up that probably costs $90 billion over 10 years \nand not having it scored to know what it costs when you bring it to the \nfloor.\n  The current farm bill continues until August of 2002. If we did it in \nJanuary, it probably wouldn't make a great deal of difference to the \nagricultural community then.\n  I think those are some of the issues which need to be talked about. \nWe spent $20 billion immediately after September 11. We spent an \nadditional $10 billion shortly thereafter. We spent an additional $15 \nbillion, $10 billion of which was guaranteed loans for airport \nstability. We had a budget that we agreed upon of $6.6 trillion for \nthis year. That now has been increased to $6.86, about a $25 billion \nexpansion of the budget which was requested. We have done that.\n  We have additional spending in line for defense of $18 billion. \nEducation will be up soon, I am sure, with another $4 billion to $5 \nbillion increase. We have to take a look at that.\n  One of the things that is holding up the current bill is the idea of \nputting on $15 billion more for internal security. The President said \nwe have the money now, and he will let us know when we need more out of \nthis original allocation. I hope we can come to grips with this idea of \nwhere we go and make some adjustments.\n  The railroad workers bill is an interesting one. Certainly everybody, \nincluding myself, supports railroad workers. This is an interesting \none. I also happen to be on the Finance Committee. The Finance \nCommittee has had no hearings on this bill. It is a bill that is \ninteresting. It combines Social Security with private retirement funds. \nIt has to do with moving that money out of the Government. The \nGovernment is responsible for this now under the Railroad Retirement \nAct. There is some great concern that if it moves, as has been \nsuggested--and I don't think anyone knows exactly what the answer is \ngoing to be if the benefits are increased and the contributions are \nreduced over a period of time--railroad workers are in a situation \nwhere you have three people drawing retirement for everyone who is \nworking. I think there has to be some assurance that if we do this and \nlet this retirement program change, the taxpayers aren't going to pick \nup the tab.\n  I would very much like to see this be a private opportunity for the \nrailroads and the workers to do whatever they would like to agree to \nbut not ending up with the taxpayers picking up the tab. This bill adds \nbenefits and reduces contributions.\n  Those are the kinds of questions we have to resolve, at least in my \nmind. Certainly, all of us are for doing all we can for railroad \nworkers' retirement. But I think there are some real questions that \nhave to be resolved.\n\n  In terms of the economic stimulus package, we have worked with that \nfor a good long time now. Again, it has come out of the Finance \nCommittee. There are different views as to what a stimulus is. We have \ntalked to many\n\n[[Page S12071]]\n\nfamous economists in the United States, and they are not sure exactly \nwhat is the best route.\n  Obviously, we have to do something to help people who are unemployed. \nI think there is a willingness to do that. On the other hand, what we \nare seeking to do is provide people with jobs. We do that by assisting \nbusiness. We do that by accelerated depreciation. I believe we can come \nup with an answer to that and get that job done in a fairly short time. \nHowever, each side puts on conditions. So we have not done that.\n  I urge that we take the responsibility of determining what it is we \nneed to do before we leave in this session and then decide what our \nsecond priorities are and put a definite time for next year and move \nforward with those. But we do not seem to yet be able to set that level \nof priority.\n  I urge we do that and be sure we give ourselves time to take a look \nat these bills--whether they be farm bills, whether they be retirement \nbills--and make sure we understand that they meet the vision of where \nwe want to go.\n  We ought to think through agriculture. Where do we want to be on \nagriculture in 10 years? What kinds of things can we do in terms of \nconservation, research, and marketability, and in terms of having some \nkind of support mechanism for agriculture to keep it healthy and yet \nlet it respond to the market.\n  Those are the things I think we want to accomplish over time. I think \nwe have a great challenge and a short time to do it. I look forward to \nbeing a part of that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, the distinguished \nSenator from Wyoming, that, first of all, we are not wasting time \nbecause of anything we are doing. My friend referred to conference \nreports. We could do conference reports in a second if they were \ncompleted. The conferences have not been completed. There are four \nappropriations bills in conference--DC, foreign operations, \nTransportation, and Labor-HHS--which are simply not completed. We would \ntake them up an hour after we got them if we could. We are not wasting \ntime by not doing conference reports because there are no conference \nreports to do.\n  Also, we are not causing the delay. We have 74 cosponsors of the \nlegislation that is now before the Senate. It is not something we \ndreamed up to take up a lot of time. You would think that 74 Senators \nwould be an ample number to have a bill brought before the Senate and \nstart talking about it a little bit. We think this bill should be \npassed very quickly. It is a very simple piece of legislation. All it \nsays is that the widows of railroad retirees can invest money in the \nstock market. It seems to me that is what Members have been saying \nshould be done with Social Security benefits. Why should widows be any \ndifferent? I hope we will work together to try to resolve this issue.\n  I also say to my friend from Wyoming that Senator Daschle announced \nthis morning that Senator Byrd decided to withdraw his homeland \nsecurity amendment and work with it on the Defense appropriations bill. \nSenator Byrd and I held the first press conference on his piece of \nlegislation. I am an avid supporter of what Senator Byrd is going to \naccomplish--not trying to accomplish. He is going to accomplish it one \nway or the other. I am an avid supporter of that. But for all the \nMembers who are saying we would be happy to sit down and negotiate on \nhomeland security, we are rid of that. Senator Byrd is going to take \ncare of that in the Defense appropriations bill.\n  It is going to take care of issues that are so important to this \ncountry--issues that I think are long overdue. It deals with protecting \nagainst bioterrorism and law enforcement and border security. For \nexample, $2 billion will go to help State and local law enforcement \ndepartments across the Nation to prevent terrorist attacks. There is \nmoney for FEMA to give grants to States and local communities to \nstrengthen their firefighting capabilities and capacities. There is \nmoney for funding the FBI, Customs Service, Coast Guard, FAA, and other \nFederal law enforcement agencies to support antiterrorism activities. \nThere is money to strengthen and secure our Nation's borders, and to \nbeef up the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and the Customs \nService.\n  We know terrorists can come over the Canadian border. We need to give \nour Border Patrol more help.\n  In our bill, Senator Byrd and I are talking about the ``outlandish'' \nproposal to have a database to monitor foreign student visas. That does \nnot seem too out of line to me. We are going to do that. We should do \nit in the economic stimulus package, but that is OK. We believe the \neconomic stimulus package is so important that Senator Byrd has agreed \nto take it off of it. I repeat, his legislation--which will become \nreality--will be put in the Defense bill.\n  We are going to help airports increase law enforcement protection. We \nare going to fund the FAA research on improved security equipment. We \nare going to fund closed-circuit television systems and surveillance, \nwhich is so important, especially in our transit systems. We are going \nto improve surveillance. And we are going to take care of safety \nvulnerabilities at Amtrak stations.\n  We are going to have security for our Nation's ports, railroads, and \nferries. Senator Hollings and Senator Graham were in the Chamber today \ntalking about how important this is. It is important. We are going to \ntake care of part of that in the Defense bill because it is part of the \ndefense of this country. We are also going to make sure the mail, \nFederal computer systems, and other security systems are protected.\n  I say this because the time has passed. If we are going to do \nsomething that is going to stimulate the economy, we need to do it now. \nOne way that we can certainly stimulate the economy is to make sure the \npeople who were displaced because of the September 11 tragedy--there \nare people there who have not qualified for unemployment benefits. When \nI say ``there,'' I don't just mean in New York. For example, we have a \ngreat welfare-to-work program in Nevada. Most programs work great when \ntimes are good, but when times are not so good, they do not work very \nwell. We have people who have gone from welfare to work who do not \nqualify for unemployment benefits. We want them to become part of the \nworkforce. We want them to qualify for unemployment insurance.\n  That is what our legislation does in our economic stimulus. We want \nto make sure these people are part of the workforce of America. There \nis no better way of doing that than making them feel part of it.\n  We also believe we should do the same thing President Bush's father \ndid on four separate occasions, which is to extend unemployment \nbenefits for 13 additional weeks. President Bush, Sr., did that. We \nbelieve this would stimulate the economy.\n  Workers need assistance now. The economy needs stimulus now. The best \nway to accomplish both of these goals is to give relief to workers who \nneed it the most. People who are out of work need it the most.\n  Economists across the country agree that providing relief to low- and \nmoderate-income families is one of the most effective ways to stimulate \nthe economy. We believe in stimulating the economy right away by \nputting money in the hands of the people who most likely will spend it: \ndislocated workers and their families.\n  Studies have shown that for every dollar invested in unemployment \ninsurance, we generate $2.15 in gross domestic product. This comes from \nthe Department of Labor study that was conducted less than 2 years ago.\n  A 1990 study by the Department of Labor estimated that unemployment \ninsurance mitigated the real loss in GDP by 15 percent in the last 5 \nrecessions, and the average peak number of jobs saved was 131,000.\n  Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel Prize winner in economics, has stated:\n\n       We should extend the duration and magnitude of the benefits \n     we provide to our unemployed. This is not only the fairest \n     proposal but also the most effective. People who become \n     unemployed cut back on their expenditures. Giving them more \n     money will directly increase expenditures.\n\n  This isn't a statement from some radical. It is from Joseph Stiglitz, \nNobel Prize winner in economics, who said the best way to help the slow \neconomy is to give people who are out of work money.\n\n[[Page S12072]]\n\n  The Congressional Research Service concurs with Stiglitz. They say:\n\n       Extending unemployment compensation is in fact likely to be \n     more successful for stimulating aggregate demand than any \n     other tax or transfer charges.\n\n  America's working families must not be left behind when Congress acts \non an economic recovery package. Providing unemployment benefits is the \nbest way to provide relief to workers and to stimulate the economy.\n  In August of this year, more than 800,000 workers had exhausted their \nunemployment benefits yet remained unemployed. And it has only gotten \nworse. The current unemployment insurance program must be supplemented \nto help dislocated workers and their families through these difficult \ntimes.\n  Currently, States provide up to 26 weeks of unemployment insurance \nbenefits. The weakening economy has made it harder for workers to find \nnew jobs.\n  Larry Lawrence, the President's chief economic adviser, said \nunemployment benefits only keep people from looking for a job. That is \npretty mean. That is unfair. And it is wrong.\n  For the week following September 11, the Department of Labor reported \nthat unemployment insurance claims reached a 9-year high.\n  In October, the month after the September 11 incident, the \nunemployment rate jumped to 5.4 percent, the largest 1-month increase \nin more than 20 years.\n  Next year, approximately 5 million people will use all of their 26 \nweeks of benefits and will still be without a job. Business tax cuts \nand income rate reductions will provide little relief for these \nworkers.\n  Even Congressman Dick Armey, the majority leader in the House of \nRepresentatives, predicts the House-passed stimulus bill would increase \nemployment by only a few thousand jobs.\n  I remind everyone of what Mr. Armey said. I pulled this piece of \npaper out of my wallet. Here is what he said:\n\n       Medicare has no place in a free world. Social Security is a \n     rotten trick. I think we're going to have to bite the bullet \n     on Social Security and phase it out over time.\n\n  This is what we are faced with in the House, and it is just not fair.\n  We believe we propose genuine recovery assistance. The Senate \nDemocratic proposal would provide 13 weeks of extended benefits to \nanyone with benefits expiring after September 11 and extend coverage to \npart-time and low-wage workers--those are people I talked about \nearlier--and supplement monthly unemployment insurance benefits by 15 \npercent or $25--that is how much money we are talking about--whichever \nis greater.\n  So our worker relief plan would provide assistance to millions of \nAmerican workers and their families. We know that rhetoric alone will \nnot help these people. American workers deserve real relief, and they \ndeserve it soon.\n\n  I am happy to see the majority leader in the Chamber. I say to the \nmajority leader, as he comes to the floor, I am happy to have you in \nthe Chamber because we were just told by the other side that we are \nwasting time, that we should be doing conference reports.\n  I have just announced we have no conference reports to do. The \nappropriations conference committees are still working on those. I \nindicated to everyone here assembled, if we received a conference \nreport, the majority leader would move to that conference report within \nhours.\n  So I am glad to see the majority leader in the Chamber. The fact is, \nwe are moving as quickly as we can. I was happy to hear the Senator \nannounce today to the press that Senator Byrd decided to allow us to \nmove forward with the stimulus package, and he is going to work on the \nDefense bill. That is my understanding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time to make a \ncouple of comments.\n  First, I again thank the assistant Democratic leader, and my \ncolleague from Illinois, and other Senators who participated in the \ncolloquy this morning. I am disappointed that somebody would suggest we \nare wasting time when it is, of course, the fact that our Republican \ncolleagues have chosen to filibuster the railroad retirement bill. We \ncould have had a vote on it with amendments related to it yesterday and \ntoday. Because we were forced to file cloture on a motion to proceed, \nwe are not able to bring up the railroad retirement bill. Therefore, we \nhave to wait until tomorrow for us to have the opportunity to vote just \nto be able to take up the Railroad Retirement Act.\n\n  It is disappointing. I hoped that somehow we could have reached some \naccommodation schedule-wise. So far, that has not been possible on \nrailroad retirement.\n  Senator Lott and I have been discussing matters relating to the \neconomic security package over the last couple of days. We had a very \ngood meeting again this morning with the President and the Speaker and \nthe Democratic leader in the House. I offered a proposal at that time \non which we have been working since that breakfast. Basically, the \nproposal could only be made as a result of tremendous work done by our \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Byrd.\n  Senator Byrd has made the decision to offer his piece, the homeland \nsecurity piece of our economic stimulus package, to the Defense \nappropriations bill in the Committee on Appropriations, and that will \noccur, of course, just as soon as the House sends us the Defense \nappropriations bill. It has not been sent over yet. It is my \nunderstanding that they may actually send it over today or tomorrow. \nThat will then give us an opportunity to consider the Defense \nappropriations bill. At that time, it is Senator Byrd's intention to \noffer homeland security to the Defense appropriations bill. It is also \nmy understanding that he will pare back the overall cost of the \nproposal in an effort further to reach consensus and compromise.\n  I don't know how Senator Byrd can go much further than he has. We \nhave now divorced it from the revenue package offered on the Senate \nfloor. He has pared it back substantially from what it was originally. \nHe has now suggested using it as an amendment to another vehicle so \nthat we can move forward on the economic security piece proposed to us \nby the Senate Finance Committee.\n  Those are three very critical steps. I hope our Republican colleagues \nmight reciprocate in working with us now on the homeland security piece \nas well.\n  What that does do is allow us now to work in concert with our \nRepublican colleagues, both in the Senate as well as in the House, to \narrive at perhaps an agreement, a compromise on the non-homeland-\nsecurity-related part of our economic stimulus package.\n  I have called a meeting for this evening at 6:30. I have just now \nspoken to both the Republican leader in the Senate and the Speaker. My \nstaff and others have talked to Senator Baucus, chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, and to Congressman Gephardt. We will hope tonight to sit \ndown and begin the deliberations that might allow us some way to break \nthe impasse that has existed for a couple of weeks.\n  It is my sincere hope we can do that. I urge my colleagues to work in \ngood faith to arrive at a consensus sometime this week so we can \ncomplete our work on the economic stimulus bill next week.\n  I yield to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the majority leader has completed his remarks, I would \nlike to comment to say I think what he has said this morning is further \nevidence of the efforts that have been made on this side of the aisle \nto try to enact an economic stimulus package that is balanced and fair \nand really will help America move forward.\n  Whether we live in South Dakota or Illinois or in the State of \nGeorgia, we know we have faced a downturn in the economy which has cost \nus thousands of jobs across America. I have met with some of these \nworkers. Since August 21, more than 800,000 of them have exhausted \ntheir unemployment insurance benefits. They still remain unemployed. In \nthe week following September 11, the Department of Labor reported that \nunemployment insurance claims reached a 9-year high. So the economy was \nsoft going into the tragedy of September 11 and certainly aggravated by \nthat terrible event.\n  We have seen a dramatic loss of jobs across America in so many \ndifferent industries. As to the airline industry, where we tried to \nmake an heroic effort to provide a lifeline to that industry to keep \nthe planes flying, we may have given them some hope, but certainly\n\n[[Page S12073]]\n\nthey have had to lay off employees and cut back schedules. That is one \nof the most serious problems we face in terms of our domestic economy.\n  For the unemployed workers across America, the Democratic stimulus \npackage proposes that we give them additional coverage for at least 13 \nweeks so they will be able to have some way of feeding their family, \nkeeping them together, paying the rent, and paying the utility bills \nduring the winter months. I don't think that is unreasonable. We know \nthese people are going to spend the money given to them because they \nare trying to struggle to survive under the most difficult, if not \nimpossible, circumstances.\n  We have also tried in our bill to expand health insurance coverage \nfor the unemployed. Can you think of any worse situation, as the head \nof a household or head of a family, than to not have health insurance \nfor yourself, your wife, or your children? Imagine if you are \nunemployed on top of it. That is what is going on for thousands of \nAmericans.\n  On the Democratic side, we have tried to say that part of any \neconomic stimulus package should remember these workers, these working \nfamilies, and not forget them.\n  Sadly, the contrast is so obvious with the Republican approach: In \nthe House the Republicans, proposed massive tax cuts not for working \nfamilies or average Americans but for the biggest corporations in \nAmerica. Some $25 billion goes to just a handful of corporations. They \nare corporations that paid an alternative minimum tax over the last 15 \nyears. The Republicans have said, let's refund the money they paid. The \nHouse Republicans passed that package.\n  It would give to one corporation $1.4 billion. We don't know if that \ncorporation would take the money and give it to the corporate officers \nin terms of salary or income or whether they would pass it along in \nterms of dividends. We frankly don't know that it would encourage any \ngrowth in the economy.\n  On the Senate Republican side, the stimulus bill accelerates the tax \ncut rates for the highest income earners in America. Again, the \nRepublicans have forgotten the average working family, the person \nstruggling to survive.\n  What Senator Daschle, the majority leader, has said to us this \nmorning is that our door is still open, the table is still there for us \nto come together with Republicans. If we are going to do something for \nthe economy, let's do it now. Let's do it in a timely fashion. Let's do \nsomething that truly will help and won't hurt us in the long run. The \nRepublican proposals which we have seen don't meet that test. The \nDemocratic proposals do.\n\n  I salute Senator Byrd from West Virginia. He is now going to add to \nthe Defense appropriations bill an amendment to provide homeland \ndefense funds for counties and cities and States across America that \nare trying to deal with the issue of security. We are happy to read the \nmorning reports that we are winning the war in Afghanistan, but \nAmericans want to know that they are safe. Their safety depends on the \nvery best law enforcement in Washington and in the communities, the \nbest public health facilities in their local communities. That means we \nhave to help them. We have to provide the resources to give peace of \nmind and safety to families and communities across America.\n  Senator Byrd's proposal moves in that direction, for law enforcement, \nfirst responders, for public health, for infrastructure security, for \nsecurity in transportation, such as Amtrak. All are essential to make \nAmerica safe and give us peace of mind.\n  I see the minority leader on the floor. I don't want to take any \nadditional time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. If Senator Daschle will allow me to comment on the remarks \nhe made before I came to the Chamber, I think it is a wise agreement or \ndecision to move the homeland issue over to the appropriations area and \nallow us to go forward to see if we can find a way to come to agreement \non the stimulus package. I didn't hear exactly what was said, but I \nthink this is a good thing to do. We need to do it sooner, not later. \nIf we didn't get started communicating bicamerally and bipartisanly \nuntil next week, it would make it even more difficult to get our work \ndone in a reasonable period of time.\n  I believe the parameters of the agreement are out there and pretty \nobvious. We don't want it to be just a spending program that doesn't \ncontribute in a stimulative way to the economy. You can argue that some \nspending would have more effect than others. Some of the program is \ngoing to have to be aimed at the unemployed and the health needs of the \nunemployed. We have to also make sure we have provisions in there, \nwhether they are tax or even spending, that will have a quick effect on \nthe economy and a positive effect in encouraging growth.\n  So I think within those parameters, which we all seem to be saying in \nthe same way--although we are accused of not caring about the working \nfamilies; that is clearly not our intent--we want to make sure people \nwho lost their jobs have the help they need. More importantly, we want \nto help them get a job. So I think to get started is a positive thing. \nI am pleased we have found a way to do that.\n  I would be glad to yield for a comment or question to Senator Baucus, \nbut I don't want to delay the majority leader.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I think this is a very good development. I \ncompliment the majority leader, as well as Senator Lott from \nMississippi, for working together. I particularly compliment Senator \nByrd for being very helpful in helping to break this impasse.\n  I feel strongly that the outlines of putting together an agreement on \nan economic stimulus package are there. We need it. The White House \nknows we need it. Democrats know it and Republicans know it. The basic \noutlines are pretty clear, and I pledge my effort to work toward an \nagreed-upon solution that will pass both the House and Senate quite \neasily. I thank the leaders for the efforts.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I had intended to make a unanimous \nconsent request, but at the request of the Republican leader, I will \nwithhold that at this time.\n  We have 7 business days left before the hopeful deadline we have \nattempted to impose upon ourselves. I say ``hopeful'' because there are \nso many outstanding questions that it may simply be impossible to \ncomplete our work by a week this coming Friday. I noted yesterday my \nintent was that we would be in conferences after that and come back for \nwhatever votes on conference reports would be required, subject to \nnotification of all Senators. But that would require two things. First, \nit is going to require we maximize the use of every day between now and \nnext Friday, a week from this coming Friday.\n  Secondly, it is important to have as much cooperation as possible. In \norder for that to occur, we have to make use of every day. We can't \nsimply wait around for an economic stimulus package, or a conference \nreport, or whatever else we may find the need to address prior to the \ntime we finish our work in this session of Congress.\n  So it will be my intention to ask unanimous consent that the economic \nstimulus package be the pending issue, subject to our ability to bring \nup other bills as we wait for our negotiated agreement on the economic \nstimulus package.\n  Right now, of course, we have the railroad retirement bill pending. I \nwould like to take up the farm bill. There will be the terrorism \ninsurance bill that we will have to take up. We will have nominations \nto take up. That doesn't mean we displace the economic stimulus package \nor lessen in any way its priority. What it simply means is that, to the \nmaximum degree possible, we are going to use every hour of the days \nremaining so we can accommodate this maybe-too-idealistic goal we have \nfor completing our work.\n  I will make that request, but I certainly will accommodate all \nSenators before I make it. I will return to the floor this afternoon at \na time that Senator Lott and I can agree upon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n\n                          Women in Afghanistan\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the issue of the \nplight of women in Afghanistan. I am very pleased that the Senate-\npassed\n\n[[Page S12074]]\n\nbill has now passed the House of Representatives and it is on its way \nto the President.\n  The bill makes sure any aid the United States gives to Afghanistan \nafter the fall of the Taliban--and we hope that is very shortly--will \nalso be available to women and children--especially to women and \nchildren--because they have suffered so greatly under the Taliban.\n  We passed the bill the week before Thanksgiving. The House passed it \nyesterday. What we are saying to the world is that we are going to come \ntogether to make sure girls are not excluded from education in a \ncountry where we have anything to say. Of course, we do have something \nto say because we are trying to help liberate the people of Afghanistan \nfrom the Taliban regime, as part of our effort to go after Osama bin \nLaden and the al-Qaida network.\n  We didn't really know how the women were being treated until it was \nbrought out in the news accounts. For 5 years, girls have been denied \neducation in that country. Afghanistan is a country that, before the \nTaliban took over, had women doctors and teachers, and women were very \nmuch a part of the society. They were Members of Parliament. When the \nTaliban took over, they went back to an extreme position, far beyond \nwhat is just holding women back--beating them on the streets if their \nburqas were in any way allowed to flap open in the wind.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the Senator coming here and lending her \nleadership on this issue. The Senator and I are circulating a letter \nthat will call for the new government, whatever it is, to make sure it \nincludes women.\n  In the form of a question, I say to my friend, it is very clear that \nfor the last 6 years girls have not been able to go to school. But in \nAfghanistan, there are a lot of educated women--doctors, engineers, \ncivil servants. I hope all the men meeting in Germany now will take \ninto consideration some of these women who have been forced, because of \nthe burqas and all this other radical movement toward causing women to \nbecome nonentities--that they will bring those women out of obscurity \nand back into the forefront where they should be and be part of this \nnew government.\n  Would the Senator agree that is the way it should be?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I appreciate so much what the Senator from Nevada has \nsaid because, of course, it is true. I think bringing this point home \nis important while they are meeting in Germany to try to form a \ngovernment that is inclusive of the different tribes.\n  Certainly, we respect that there is a different culture there. But \nthere is no culture in the world that can be acceptable if women are \nbeaten on the streets because they wear high-heeled shoes, or if they \nare beaten because they go outside without a male escort, and even to \ntake their son to the doctor, when there is no male escort to help \nthem. That is the kind of treatment these women have received.\n  I thank the Senator from Nevada for working with us, along with all \nthe women of the Senate, and Senator Brownback as well, to speak out as \na country and say that not educating girls, not allowing women to have \nhealth care--which is exactly what has happened under the Taliban; they \nwould not allow women doctors to treat women who were sick. That is why \nthe rate of death in Afghanistan is one of the highest in the world. \nThe rate of death of children is outrageous. One in four children in \nAfghanistan will die from bad food and water and other causes. One in \nfour, that is a stunning statistic; 25 percent of every child in a \ncountry dying?\n\n  We have to speak out. We can do something, and that is what gives me \ngreat hope. We are going to be able to put our money, the generosity of \nthe American people, to work to rectify a terrible tragedy and bring \nthe girls into an educational system. We can make up for those 5 years, \nand we can show the girls they have a future, too; that they can be a \npart of the rebuilding the country they love.\n  I was struck by the stories of the two American missionaries who were \nprisoners and who were bravely rescued by the U.S. military and by the \nNorthern Alliance military. They are quite devoted to Afghanistan. They \nsee the greatness in the Afghan people, but they saw the treatment of \nthe women. Even though they were treated well--thank goodness they \nwere--they saw the beatings of Afghan women by the Taliban prison \nguards.\n  This is something that is beyond politics; it is beyond any \ndisagreement one might have: That people be treated with decency and \nthat women, who are most vulnerable, not be beaten; that they would not \nbe kept from receiving health care for afflictions that will shorten \ntheir lifespans, if not kill them directly; that they would not be \nassassinated in the public arena while people are cheering, which we \nsaw on television. This is a matter of human decency, and it is a \nmatter about which all of us are coming together to speak against.\n  I was very touched by our First Lady, Laura Bush, speaking out for \nthe women of Afghanistan and making it an issue of great priority for \nher, and saying the United States is going to be there to rectify this \nterrible situation.\n  We did not go in to take over Afghanistan. We went in to get the al-\nQaida network that has killed thousands of Americans to make sure that \nnetwork cannot operate ever again to harm freedom-loving people in the \nworld.\n  As part of the education we have all received, we have learned of the \natrocities that have been endured by the women of Afghanistan, and our \nFirst Lady led the way, along with Cherie Blair, the wife of the Prime \nMinister of Great Britain, who have said: We are in this together, and \nwe are going to speak out to make sure that women are part of the \ngovernment, that women are part of the solution and a part of the \nrebuilding of a country that can, once again, live in peace and \nprosperity.\n  I appreciate the leadership of our First Lady, Laura Bush. I \nappreciate the leadership of the women in the House and Senate coming \ntogether to pass a bill that I feel sure the President will sign \nquickly. I am proud that Republicans and Democrats are coming together, \nthat Americans, British, and people from all of the countries that are \nhelping us in this quest to wipe out terrorism are coming together to \nsay we will not forget the women of Afghanistan, and we want them to be \na part of a country that prospers, where children are happy, educated, \nand safe.\n  I thank that Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my understanding is that we are on a \nmotion to proceed to the Railroad Retirement and Survivors' Improvement \nAct and tomorrow we will have a cloture vote. It is a vote on whether \nor not we will proceed to the bill.\n  At the moment, this legislation is being blocked. This legislation \npassed overwhelmingly in the House. The vote was 384 to 33. There are \n75 cosponsors in the Senate. It was not hard for many of us to become \noriginal cosponsors. It just seems to be the right thing to do: \nExpansion of benefits to widows and widowers--I am not going to go \nthrough the specifics because others have spoken about the bill--\nliberalized early retirement, and liberalized vesting.\n  The best politics I know--I think I can get a smile from the Senator \nfrom Georgia who is presiding--is at the Minnesota State Fair. It is \nincredible; in 2 weeks, half the State's population comes. It is very \nserious politics. Nobody has a lobbyist with them. Everybody counsels \none, and no more than one. People come up to wherever you are and talk \nabout issues that are important to them, calls they have made to your \noffice, letters they have written, whether you responded, whether you \nhelped. It is very personal and very important. It is the very best \npolitics I know. It is ``grassroots'' politics at its best.\n  At the last Minnesota State Fair, did I ever hear from some of these \nretired railroad workers and their families. This is important to them. \nThey made a very poignant appeal. This is important to their financial \nlives from their point of view, and from my point of view it is a \nmatter of fairness.\n  I do not believe they understand--by the way, I am not putting them \ndown for this. I do not think most people understand Senate rules and \nhow things can be blocked or filibustered. Other\n\n[[Page S12075]]\n\nSenators would wonder about me if I were to say: How dare you block \nthis. I have done a fair amount of blocking during my time in the \nSenate.\n  Frankly, unlimited debate and unlimited amendments is what makes this \nbody unique. It means any one Senator, if they know the rules and know \nthe leverage, if they want to change the topic of conversation, if they \nwant to focus on a different issue, if they feel strongly about \nsomething, can speak out for what they believe and what they think is \nbest for the people they represent. They can fight hard.\n  Every Senator has a right to use their rights. That is what is \nhappening with this bill. I appeal to colleagues to let this \nlegislation go through. This is important to many hard-working families \nas they move into their sixties, seventies, and hopefully eighties and \nnineties. It is important to them.\n  I appeal to my colleagues to let us proceed. I say to my colleagues--\nif they want to amend this bill, go ahead, but I appeal to colleagues \nnot to add on different legislation which will then create a quagmire \nand snarl everything up. We should push this legislation forward and \npass it. It is the right thing to do for these families.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n           harsh penalties for breach of security at airports\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to announce my intention to \nintroduce a bill to provide Federal criminal penalties for security \nbreaches at American airports. I make this announcement on the heels of \nmy own experience with a security breach at Hartsfield International \nAirport. I have no way of knowing the reasons behind the security \nbreach at Hartsfield, but the results of it were startling. The event \ntriggered the total evacuation of the Atlanta airport and a temporary \nhalt of incoming and outgoing air traffic. I might say I have been \nmarooned on the tarmac at Hartsfield many times, but never with 60 \nother aircraft. I spent 4 hours on the tarmac, and many more hours \nwaiting for my connecting flight, which I basically rendezvoused with \nand arrived at my destination the next day. Thousands of other \ntravelers were also stranded while the ripple effects were felt across \nthe country.\n  Thankfully, nobody was hurt in this instance, and people's worst \nfears of another terrorist attack were not realized. But a loophole in \nexisting law has been revealed in the days since the incident, and has \nshown that breaches at airport security checkpoints are currently \npunishable by local criminal penalties and Federal civil penalties, but \nnot Federal criminal penalties. Incidentally, the current Federal civil \npenalty for such a breach currently carries a fine of $1,100.\n  In an incident that probably cost the State of Georgia, the airlines, \nand this country about $10 million in economic impact, that is a small \npittance to pay--$1,100.\n  As we have learned in the most painful way possible, airport security \nis a matter of national security, and for there to be no Federal \ncriminal penalty for such a breach is appalling. It was relieving to \nfind that there appeared to be no nefarious intent in the Atlanta \ninstance, but it was very disconcerting to learn the shortcomings of \nour Federal laws in a situation like this.\n  While a Federal criminal penalty does cover security violations \naboard airplanes themselves, I believe similar penalties should be \navailable for violations before a person actually boards a plane. I \nwould like to stress that I do intend to include provisions to make \ndistinctions between deliberate and unintentional breaches. The \nlegislation is currently being drafted and vetted, and will be \nintroduced in the near future.\n  The two main intentions of this bill are to provide uniformity and \naccountability for breaches of security across the Nation. Congress and \nthe President have agreed that it is the responsibility of the Federal \nGovernment to protect our airports, and the laws should reflect that. \nIt should also provide the same penalty for breaches in New York City, \nColumbus, OH, and Columbus, GA. The offense is the same, and the laws \nshould be too.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/28/senate-section/article/S12075-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. CLELAND.

Madam President, I support the motion to take up H.R. 10 \nso we can consider the retirement bill as an amendment. Let me explain \nwhy this bill is necessary and then I will respond to some of the \ncriticisms that were made yesterday.\n  By way of background, the Federal railroad retirement system has \nserved railroaders and their families for 65 years. Its roots reach \nback to the 1930s, in a struggle to find answers to the hardships that \nresulted from the Great Depression. Today, the system provides benefit \npayments to more than 673,000 retirees and other beneficiaries.\n  The railroad retirement system actually has two components. Tier 1 is \nlargely equivalent to Social Security. Tier 2 provides additional \nbenefits and is equivalent to a private pension plan. Both are funded \nby taxes that are paid entirely by railroad companies and railroad \nworkers.\n  Let me stop here and stress a critical point. Every single change \nthat we make in this bill applies only to tier 2. Again, tier 2 is \nequivalent to a private pension program. In other words, we are only \naddressing how railroad retirement operates as a private pension plan. \nWe are not making any changes to the part of the program that is \nlargely equivalent to Social Security.\n  So where do things stand? At one point, the Railroad Retirement \nsystem was in deep trouble. Just like the Social Security system. In \nfact, in 1983, we had to permanently cut benefits and increase taxes, \nin order to get the system back on its financial feet.\n  But there's good news. Today, the Railroad Retirement system is \nfiscally strong. There's a surplus, of $19 billion.\n  On top of that, the most recent report by the Chief Actuary concludes \nthat no cash-flow problems are expected to arise over next 75 years. In \nother words, the system is solvent. I'll say it again. The system is \nsolvent. Over the short term, and over the long term.\n  That's good news.\n  Among other things, it gives us the opportunity to consider some \nbasic improvements in the operation of the railroad retirement program. \nThat's what this bill is all about.\n  After years of careful deliberations between railroad companies and \nrailroad unions, the bill is designed to make two basic reforms.\n  First, the bill improves the investment returns of the Railroad \nRetirement Account. Currently, the taxes collected in the Railroad \nRetirement Account can only be invested in U.S. government securities. \nActuarial projections assume an annual return of 6 percent on these \ninvestments.\n  This bill would allow a portion of the assets to be invested in a \ndiversified investment portfolio that includes private-sector \nsecurities. In other words, the portion of assets attributable to \nprivate industry contributions could be invested in the same way that \nthe assets of private sector retirement plans can be invested.\n  Over the long run, this would increase the rate of return on the \ninvestment of railroad retirement assets. I grant that this proposal \nmay have\n\n[[Page S12076]]\n\nseemed like an even better idea a year or two ago, when the stock \nmarket was on a roll.\n  But that's short-sighted. As we all know, equity investments result \nin higher returns over the long term. In this case, the shift from \nTreasury bills to a mixed portfolio is estimated to increase the long \nterm rate of return from six percent to eight percent.\n  That's not some pie-in-the sky projection. That's the estimate of the \nchief actuary, who is charged by law with making objective estimates of \nthese matters.\n\n  In any event, I note that this provision would apply only to the \nportion of the program that is similar to a private pension plan, and \nthat is funded entirely from industry sources.\n  That's the first change that we make. Over the long run, it will put \nthe system in even better shape than it is today.\n  The second change is a needed adjustment in benefits and taxes. We \nhave room to make these changes, because the system now is taking in \nsignificantly more in taxes than is necessary to pay current and \nprojected benefits.\n  Let me describe each set of changes, in turn.\n  With respect to benefits, we reform survivor benefits, the retirement \nage, and vesting. With respect to survivor benefits, each month, about \n700 new widows and widowers begin receiving Railroad Retirement \nsurvivor benefits. That's an average of one every hour, day and night. \nAs it now stands, while a retired employee is alive, a couple receives \na tier 2 benefit equal to 145 percent of the benefit for a single \nretiree. When the retiree dies, the spouse is left with a tier 2 \nbenefit of only 50 percent of the retiree's benefit. That's a reduction \nof almost two-thirds.\n  Under the bill, the surviving spouse would receive a tier 2 benefit \nequal to the benefit received by a single retiree. As a result, we \nwould avoid a drastic reduction in the income of the survivor.\n  Next, we lower the minimum retirement age, at which employees with 30 \nyears of service are eligible for full tier 2 benefits, from age 62 to \n60. This would return the age at which a railroad employee can retire \nwith full benefits to what it was prior to 1984.\n  It also moves the railroad retirement system closer into line with \nmany private sector pension plans, particularly those in hazardous or \nphysically demanding occupations. Even with this change, many private \nplans will still have earlier retirement ages than the railroad \nretirement system.\n  Finally, we lower the vesting requirement for employees from 10 to 5 \nyears. This aligns Railroad Retirement with current private industry \npension practices.\n  Those are the reforms to railroad retirement benefits. We also \naddress the taxes paid by railroad companies.\n  To put this in perspective, tier 1 and tier 2 benefits are funded \nprimarily through payroll taxes on employers and employees. Taken \ntogether, the payroll tax rate is more than 36 percent. As a result, \nrailroads and railroad workers pay disproportionate costs, compared to \nother industries, for retirement benefits. This, in turn, imposes a \nmajor financial burden and discourages employers from hiring new \nemployees.\n  In the bill, we reduce the taxes on railroad employers, over three \nyears, to bring them a little closer to comparable private pension \nplans and bring them more in line with the actuarial needs of the \nsystem.\n  Now, I understand that some have criticized the changes. They argue \nthat the system will not be secure. Therefore, they continue, by \nimproving benefits and reducing taxes, we reduce the overall surplus \nand increase the chances that the system will eventually go broke. \nThere are two simple responses.\n  First, again, the system is solvent, over both the short and the long \nterms. We have a $19 billion surplus right now, and the chief actuary \nprojects that the system will take in more than it pays out, under both \ncurrent law and this bill, over the next 75 years.\n  But what if the projection is wrong? What if there are unforseen \ndevelopments that increase benefit payments, reduce revenue, and drain \naway the surplus? Won't taxpayers, in effect, be left holding the bag?\n  No, they won't. Under the explicit terms of the bill, employer taxes \nwill be automatically adjusted in the future so that always will they \nfully cover benefits. In effect, the taxpayers are not put at risk.\n  Pulling all of this together, we have a carefully balanced package \nthat makes straightforward reforms. We allow the private portion of the \nfund to be invested the same way a private pension plan can be \ninvested. We modernize benefits and we reduce taxes. We do this within \nthe framework of a fully solvent system.\n  One final point. Some colleagues may question why we are seeking to \ntake up the railroad bill as an amendment to a House bill. In the first \nplace, the majority leader sought consent to discharge the House bill \nfrom the Senate Finance Committee. There was an objection. In the \nsecond place, we need to move quickly. Passage of this legislation is \nlong overdue.\n  It has extraordinary support. Last Congress, the bill passed the \nHouse and was reported by the Senate Finance Committee. This Congress, \nthe House bill received 384 votes. The Senate bill has 74 cosponsors.\n  In light of this overwhelming bipartisan support, railroad retirees \nacross the country are wondering why we don't get our act together, \npass this bill, and get it to the President. They are right. In fact, \nevery time I return home to Montana--I was there just a couple of days \nago--I am asked: When is the Senate going to take up the railroad \nretirement bill?\n  At this point, late in the session, there is only one good answer. \nLet's put all of the procedural maneuvering aside. Let's take up the \nbill. If Senators have serious amendments related to this bill, let's \nconsider them. But let's vote. Let's do the people's business. They \nwant us to work through these measures, take votes, and come up with \nthe result, because that is what this process is all about. That is \nwhat people want.\n  I will have some further comments in response to arguments that have \nbeen made against the specific provisions of the bill as this debate \ngoes on. But at this point, I urge my colleagues to support cloture so \nthat we can debate this important bill. Let's get going. The 10,000 \nrailroad employees, retirees, widows, and survivors in Montana, and \ntens of thousands more across the country, are counting on us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, you would think that in a proposal where \nyou have had government bonds mandated as the basis for your retirement \nprogram--and, quite frankly, we have this in railroad retirement \nbecause railroad retirement has never been self-sustaining. It has \nreceived and does receive today huge Federal subsidies. You would \nthink, taking $15 billion out of that trust fund and investing it in \ninterest-earning assets, that the value of the trust fund would rise \nover time; wouldn't you? You have $15 billion you are going to invest. \nYou are investing it right now in government bonds. They are really \nIOUs to the same people who are paying the interest. They are not even \nreal assets. It is like an IOU that you put in one pocket and count it \nas an asset.\n  But in any case, you would think since they are assuming an 8 percent \nrate of return after inflation, that this wonderful idea--in fact, I \nwill read the quote from the chief executive of the Association of \nAmerican Railroads.\n  He says:\n\n       What we hope to get out of it--That is this bill--is what \n     any pension plan has, a more flexible approach to investment.\n\n  Who is against that? Who is against getting a higher rate of return?\n  But remarkably, almost unbelievably, if you grant that they are going \nto go from virtually a zero rate of return under the current program to \n8 percent plus inflation, their own Railroad Retirement Board looks at \nthe bill that is before us and concludes that in 17 years, after \nearning these interests payments, you have $15 billion less in the \ntrust fund than you would have under the current system.\n  That is pretty startling. You are going to invest at interest, and \nyou are going to have $15 billion less in 17 years than you would have \nwithout having any earnings whatsoever.\n  How is that possible? How it is possible that what we are about here \nis not investment but pilferage?\n\n[[Page S12077]]\n\n  Let me outline how all of this came about. At least I can theorize \nhow it came about.\n  Today, as a result of a bill we passed, when Social Security is going \nbroke, we remarkably have $19.2 billion in the railroad retirement \ntrust fund. If you calculated the present value of the liability of the \nrailroad retirement trust fund, it would be huge as compared to $19.2 \nbillion. Madam President, $19.2 billion is a lot of money, but it is \nnot a lot of money to a system which has three retirees for every one \nworker.\n  We are worried about Social Security when we have 3.3 workers per \nretiree. In railroad retirement, you have one worker for every three \nretirees. This $19.2 billion is a fairly small amount of money given \nthe liability of the system and when its financial security is very \nmuch in doubt. If that is the case--nobody disputes that it is the \ncase--why are we taking $15 billion out of it over the next 17 years?\n  Let me tell you what I think has happened. I would have to say in my \n24 years of debating issues such as this, this is the most remarkable \none I have seen. I am sure there is something comparable, but it \ndoesn't jump to my mind. Here is what I would say happened a couple of \nyears ago.\n  The railroads are having tough times, similar to many other \nindustries. They looked at this $19.2 billion, and they said: This is \nsomebody else's money. This is the money that is supposed to at least \npartially back up the retirement program. But wouldn't it be great if \nwe could have $7.5 billion of it? We would just like to pilfer $7.5 \nbillion out of railroad retirement.\n  I am sure they hired some brilliant lobbyist lawyer and paid him \nseveral million dollars. He was worth every single penny of it.\n  Here is the idea they came up with which is embodied in this bill: \nThe railroads went to the unions and said: We want to steal $7.5 \nbillion out of your retirement program. Needless to say, I am sure the \nunions must have said: Are you crazy? They said: What about this? At \nthe very moment when the retirement age for every other worker in \nAmerica to get full Social Security benefits is rising from 65 to age \n67 where you get the full benefit--a big jump this year--what we will \ndo is lower the retirement age for railway workers at the same time it \nis being raised for everybody else. In fact, we will cut it from 62, \nwhich is already 3 full years below Social Security; we will reduce it \nto 60. We will add a handful of new benefits, and we will raise the \nmaximum benefit we will give. The net result is that over the next 17 \nyears we will get $7.5 billion, and we will give retirees $7.5 billion. \nWe will take the $15 billion out of the railroad retirement program.\n  In fact, sure enough, the Railroad Retirement Board, in looking at \nthis data over the next 17 years, despite ``investing'' their money, \nthe trust fund will be $15 billion smaller 17 years from now than it \nwould be under the current system.\n  I think you have a problem. They say: OK, we get $7.5 billion, you \nget $7.5 billion, but what about our retirement program? It is just too \ngood to be true.\n  They said: Oh, it's not too good to be true. We will put the Federal \ntaxpayer on the hook for the $15 billion. You get $7.5 billion and we \nget $7.5 billion, and the taxpayer will guarantee the money will be \nthere.\n  Let me go over what the railroads get. Currently, for their tier 2 \nretirement--which is just part of the retirement; it is not essential \nthat people understand that to understand what is happening--today, \nthey are paying 16.1 percent of payroll into this retirement program.\n  They say: OK, look, next year, before any money is invested, before \nany returns could possibly be had, let's drop that from 16.1 percent to \n14.75 percent. And then the next year, let's drop it from 14.75 to 14.2 \npercent. Then they say: If, in the future, when this $15 billion has \nbeen pilfered--they did not really say that; they just do it--if there \nis a problem, then you can raise the tax on railroads. But there is a \ncap on the amount you can raise it.\n  So who is taking on this liability? What makes this whole deal work? \nHow this whole deal works is, basically, the unions get $7.5 billion, \nthe railroads get $7.5 billion, the taxpayer assumes another $15 \nbillion liability, and the trust fund actually goes down by $15 \nbillion.\n  The final point was: Gosh, but how are you going to convince Congress \nof it? This is where it really gets brilliant. They said: OK, look, \nunions will get $7.5 billion, the railroads will get $7.5 billion, but \nwhat we will say is we are investing the money. Then Congress will say \nit is OK because they are investing the money. People are for investing \nthe money. It makes good sense.\n  The bottom line is, we have before us a bill that basically says we \nhave a trust fund which now has $19.2 billion in it and has a \nprojection, over the next 25 years, as to where it will be in terms of \nhow much in assets it will have, given the money coming in, being paid \nin by railroad workers, and the amount of benefits that are being paid.\n  Under the bill before us, because we are cutting taxes on railroads, \neven though the program has real actuarial solvency problems--no \nprivate pension fund in America could run a program like railroad \nretirement and not go to prison, but even though it has these problems, \nthe bill before us, over 17 years, will take $15 billion out of the \ntrust fund and will pay it out to the railroads and to the unions and \nto their members.\n  Over 25 years, it takes out $28.7 billion that would have been in the \ntrust fund, that will not be, even though the trust fund, under the \ncurrent system, is earning a very small rate of return. And they are \nassuming a 8-percent rate of return plus inflation.\n  I am sure people would look at these numbers and say it is not \npossible you could increase the rate of return severalfold and yet have \nthe trust fund decline by $15 billion over 17 years. Yes, because the \nhigher rate of return is really a smokescreen.\n  What is going on here is pilferage. What is going on here is we are \ngiving the railroads $7.5 billion and we are giving railway workers \n$7.5 billion and we are putting the American taxpayer in harm's way. \nThat is what this bill is about.\n  The House of Representatives passed it, and they passed it by a huge \nnumber. Why did it happen? How did it happen? It happened because the \nunions and the railroads are for it. You have a nice, catchy theme, \n``investing in a higher rate of return.'' Nobody paid any attention to \nthe details and, quite frankly, when business and labor get together, \nmore often than not, society and the taxpayer are losers.\n\n  Paradoxically, these kinds of consensus measures are generally \nharmful, not helpful. The public may hate contention, but it is checks \nand balances that basically make for good government.\n  The House of Representatives passed this bill by a huge number \nbecause every railroad--last year, I must have had 50 lobbyists come to \nsee me. I have a huge number of railroad retirees. I am blessed to have \nlots of railroads. I have one that runs right through the middle of my \nhometown with seven big-time trains a day. The lobbyists came to see me \nand said: Boy, you can help the railroads. You can help the railroad \nretirees. Everybody is better off.\n  In fact, I am sure that somebody would say: We can't refute the \nnumbers. That $15 billion is coming out of the trust fund, but it is a \nvictimless crime. Railroads are better off; unions are better off; they \nreceived $15 billion. But who is worse off? The taxpayer is worse off. \nThat is who is worse off.\n  But in any case, all of these lobbyists, all this letter writing and \ne-mail converged on the House, and they passed this bill. It has now \ncome to the Senate. It seems to me that we could stand to be reminded \nof what the Senate is supposed to do.\n  Some of you will remember the story that Jefferson had been in France \nwhen the Constitution was written. When he came back from France, he \nwas suspicious of the Constitution. He met at Mount Vernon with George \nWashington. They were having tea. He was asking Washington what the \nSenate was for. He understood what the House of Representatives was \nfor. But what was the Senate for?\n  So Washington, as many southerners, had this habit, which some people \nstill have now with coffee that they had with tea, of pouring the tea \ninto the saucer to let it cool, and then pouring it back into the cup \nand drinking it. Washington said, in a very famous story, the House of \nRepresentatives\n\n[[Page S12078]]\n\nwill respond to the passions of the moment; they will respond to \npopular clamor. But the Senate will be as the saucer, where there will \nbe a cooling of reason, and the result will be a stronger, more stable, \nmore responsible government.\n  I understand that 74 people cosponsored this bill. I am not short on \narithmetic. And I understand that, in the end, 51 Members in the Senate \ncould pass a bill. Thank God we do have procedures where people who \nbelieve strongly can object and delay and cause debate. And I am going \nto do that. But I want to urge my colleagues, we can fix this bill. We \ncan make this a good bill. I am totally supportive of letting railroad \nretirement invest the $15 billion.\n  I would like to build a firewall where the people who are doing the \ninvesting have fiduciary responsibility, where they cannot promote some \nsocial agenda with railroad retirement money and, indirectly, with the \nGovernment's money.\n  I would like to have some safety and soundness standards on the \ninvestment. Investing the money is one thing, but lowering the \nretirement age, expanding benefits, and cutting the taxes and the money \ngoing into the program is quite another thing.\n  My proposal is, let's take this bill, let's go to the Finance \nCommittee--we have never held a hearing on it; we have never had a \nmarkup on it--let's go to the Finance Committee, and let's agree to a \nprogram to invest the money, and then let's set up an actuarial system \nwhere we will look at the benefits of the investment, and to the extent \nthat the system becomes actuarially sound, then--and after we have the \nmoney in hand--we could lower taxes, and then we could look at \nbenefits.\n  I do believe there is something innately unfair about raising the \nretirement age for 95 percent of the workers in America and cutting it \nfor other people. How can that make any sense? How could any Member of \nthe Senate go back to Iowa or Texas or Nevada and look their \nconstituents in the face and say, we are getting ready to make you work \n2 additional years to get full Social Security benefits, but we have \nlowered the retirement age from 62 to 60 for railroad retirement? How \ncan you possibly justify that?\n  I have plenty of railroad towns in my State. I had a lot of them in \nmy old district. I don't think I could sell this in Inez, TX, which is \na big railroad town. I don't think I could sell, at the same period we \nare raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 on everybody else, that \nsuddenly we are going to cut it from 62 to 60 for railroad retirees.\n  I am perfectly willing to support--I wanted to come over today and \npledge--a bill that sets up the investment of the $15 billion with a \nfirewall to keep politics out of the investment, assess actuarially \nwhere we are, let the Railroad Retirement Board assess it, and when it \nis clear that we have more money than we need, if, God willing, that \never happened, then we could lower taxes on the railroads; then we \ncould raise benefits for the retirees. But should we not get the return \nfirst?\n  How can it make sense in this bill to lower the retirement age, \nexpand benefits, and cut taxes before one penny is invested? How can \nthat possibly make any sense? How can you spend money you don't have? \nHow can it make any sense whatsoever to have a program that, to quote \nthe representative of the American railroads who said, ``what we hope \nto get out of it is what any pension plan has, a more flexible approach \nto investment''? If that is all they want to get out of it--I assume he \nsaid this with a straight face--if that is all they want to get out of \nit, I am for that. In fact, I am very much in favor of investing \npension funds. But should we let them take $15 billion out of the fund \nover and above the interest they would gain from the investment, and \nshould we let them do it before they have earned a single penny?\n  I don't see how in the world you could justify being for this bill in \nits current form. I make a plea: I know 74 people have signed onto this \nbill. It is not the same bill they signed onto because this bill is now \nscored as raising the deficit by $15 billion. And there has been a new \nprovision added. If you cosponsored this bill, you haven't cosponsored \nthe bill that is before us because it has a special provision that \nsays, while the deficit of the Federal Government under this bill goes \nup by $15 billion, we are going to pretend as if it doesn't.\n  It actually says to the Congressional Budget Office and to the Office \nof Management and Budget, we want you to certify something that is \nfalse. We want you to, in essence, look the other way, and even though \nyou have scored this as costing $15 billion, we want you to certify \nthat it doesn't cost $15 billion.\n  I believe most of the 73 people who cosponsored them did not \nunderstand it. They were for investing the money. Why not help workers; \nwhy not help the railroads? I don't think they understood the $15 \nbillion of pilferage. But they didn't sign onto the bill that is before \nus because it has this provision that forces OMB and CBO by law to \ncertify something that is not so.\n  My point is, we could do this right, even at this late hour. We could \ntake this bill to the Finance Committee. We could set up an investment \nprogram. We could put an actuarial program into effect as we earn these \ninvestment returns in the future. We could look, as the system becomes \nstronger, at cutting taxes on railroads, giving benefits to workers. \nBut under the current bill, we cut taxes before any money is ever \ninvested. We raise benefits before any money is ever invested.\n\n  Despite the rate of return over 10 years, the value of the trust fund \nis $5 billion less than the current trust fund would be under the \ncurrent system. Over 17 years, it is $15 billion less; over 25 years, \nit is $28.7 billion less. How do you earn more and have less? \nPilferage, that is how you do it. That is our problem.\n  We have two choices. One, we can look the other way and respond to \nthe political pressure coming from two powerful political interests--\ninterests to which we are sympathetic. Who is hostile to railroad \nretirees? I am not. I can't justify having their retirement age 60 and \nSocial Security 67. And theirs is already lower; it is already 62. We \nare going from 65 to 67, and they want to go down to 60. I can't \njustify that. But I am not hostile. I am not hostile to anybody who \nwould want it. Who wouldn't want full benefits at 60?\n  The point is, much of this program is paid for by Social Security \nmoney. Why should people who work for one industry be treated \ndifferently than people who work for other industries? I don't \nunderstand it. I don't know how you justify it. I don't guess people \nwant to justify it.\n  I am not unsympathetic to railroads. God knows, we want our railroads \nto be strong. We want to modernize our tracks. We want better \nequipment. I want railroads to make money. I want them to be \nsuccessful. I have no hostility to them. We can't have a great and \npowerful economy without having successful railroads. But do we really \nwant to pass a bill that pilfers $15 billion out of a pension fund and \nleaves the taxpayer liable for the great bulk of the $15 billion?\n  We can avoid it. We can write a responsible bill. We could do it very \nquickly. The way we would do it is invest the money but don't start \ngiving it away until we earn it. Don't start raising benefits and \nlowering taxes until we have gotten the return. And don't cut taxes and \nraise benefits more than the return grows. Those are just sound, simple \nprinciples.\n  I want people to understand what is in this bill. It is true the \nrailroads are for it. It is true the unions are for it. You might ask, \nwell, if they can get together, if they think it is a good idea, isn't \nit a good idea? Well, when you read the fine print, why they are for it \nis they are dividing up $15 billion. Why I am against it is the \ntaxpayer is becoming liable for the $15 billion.\n  My colleagues on the other side will point out there is a provision \nthat would allow the tax on railroads to rise when the pension fund \ngets into trouble. But it caps the amount that they can rise. We are \ncutting the amount they are paying in right now. Doesn't somebody \nsuspect that when the roof falls in on this retirement program the \nrailroads are going to come up here and say: If you make us pay all \nthis, we are not going to be able to invest in railroads; it is going \nto hurt the economy, so let the taxpayer pay it?\n  If what I am saying is not valid, I hope someone will stand up and \nsay it is not valid. But if it is valid, I plead\n\n[[Page S12079]]\n\nwith my colleagues, let's fix it. We can do what people say they want \nto do--invest the money. And we can do it responsibly. But the current \nbill before us is not good policy. It is obviously good politics, \nespecially to people who signed onto an earlier version of it some \nmonths or years before.\n  To sum up, because I know other people are here who want to speak, we \nhave a bill before us that is not the same bill people have \ncosponsored. As far as I am aware, no one is a cosponsor of the bill \nthat is before us because the bill that was cosponsored by 74 of my \ncolleagues did not have a provision in it that directs OMB and CBO to \nturn and look the other way and not score the $15 billion that would be \nscored as an increase in the deficit, some of which is coming out of \nthe Social Security trust fund. No one signed onto that as a cosponsor. \nSo it is not true to say that 74 people cosponsored this bill. They \ndidn't. They cosponsored something close to it, but not to mandate that \nOMB, the Office of Management and Budget, and the Congressional Budget \nOffice simply certify something they know is false.\n\n  We can fix the bill by investing the money first, and then when \nincome is earned, we can have a formula or procedure for the \ndistribution of the money. This bill distributes the money before any \ninvestment is made.\n  Finally, and most remarkably, even with the assumption that 8 percent \nis earned on the investment after inflation--and I am not disputing \nthat you could not earn that today, I believe over the future that is a \nfairly conservative estimate. But even with that assumption, over 17 \nyears, under the bill before us, the trust fund actually goes down by \n$15 billion compared to the current program. Over 25 years, it goes \ndown by $28.7 billion. How do you get less by earning more? Pilferage. \nBy simply taking the money out and giving half of it to labor and \ngiving half of it to the railroads. That may be popular, but it is not \ngood policy. It is not right. It puts the taxpayer on the hook, and I \nurge my colleagues to give us a chance to fix it.\n  Let us go to the Finance Committee, where we can debate these issues \nand report back in 2 or 3 days a bill, which I think we could do. We \ncan pass it and we can be proud of it. As it is now, we are in a \nsituation where we are going to have a cloture vote on Thursday. I \nassume that it will pass. This is a cloture vote to move to the bill. \nThen we are going to have a cloture vote on the bill. Then we will have \na cloture vote on a substitute. And we are simply going to be in a \nprocess that may or may not produce a result in this year. It is not so \nimportant when we do this, but it is very important what we do and that \nwe do it right. I just want people to know that I am willing to work to \ntry to do it right. I hope someone will take me up on it. I am a member \nof the Finance Committee. We have the chairman and ranking member here \nin the Chamber. I would like for us to have a markup on this bill and \ndiscuss these issues and see if we can find a way to do this that will \nwork better and that we can be proud of. I think we could, and I wanted \nto be on record saying that today.\n  I appreciate our distinguished floor leader for his patience. He is \nmuch beloved around here for that characteristic.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. REID). The Senator from Nevada is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                              Nominations\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is easy to always listen to the \nstatements of the Senator from Texas. I may not always agree with them, \nbut I do a lot of the time. They are always articulate, well-reasoned. \nWe have another year of listening to these statements, and he will go \noff and do something else. He will be missed not only by the people in \nthe State of Texas but by those of us in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, the Las Vegas Sun newspaper, on Sunday, November 25, \nwrote a major editorial saying, ``Tough Talk, But Bereft of the \nFacts.''\n  The purpose of the editorial is to point out what a great job the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee has done in the 6 months he has \nbeen chairman of the committee. Senator Leahy has moved major \nlegislation. In addition to that, the editorial goes on to report that \nhe has been able to do many things with judges that haven't been done \nbefore, in spite of the fact his committee has been, in effect, under \nsiege because of the September 11 events. Senator Leahy has had to work \non the terrorism legislation and many other pieces of legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Las Vegas Sun editorial entitled \n``Tough Talk, But Bereft of the Facts'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Las Vegas Sun, Nov. 25, 2001]\n\n                  Tough Talk, But Bereft of the Facts\n\n       Republicans are complaining that President Bush's nominees \n     for federal judgeships haven't received a fair shake from the \n     Democratic-controlled Senate. The Republicans say that Sen. \n     Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \n     isn't holding hearings promptly and isn't taking votes fast \n     enough on the nominations.\n       ``It's purely partisan politics,'' Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., \n     said two weeks ago. ``They don't want conservative judges on \n     the court.'' Just over a week ago Vice President Dick Cheney \n     chimed in as well. ``The deliberate slowing of the \n     confirmation process is unworthy of the United States Senate \n     and an injustice to the men and women whose names have been \n     presented,'' Cheney said in a speech to Federalist Society, \n     an ultra-conservative legal group.\n       Some serious accusations and harsh words from Republicans, \n     but they simply don't stand up to the facts. As of mid-\n     November in the first year of Bush's presidency, 17 of his \n     nominees had been approved. At the same point in the first \n     year of Clinton's presidency, the Senate had confirmed only \n     eight judges. By mid-November of 1989, the first year of the \n     elder Bush's presidency, only 10 judges had been confirmed by \n     the Senate. So Leahy actually is ahead of the pace when \n     comparing the Senate's speed in handling nominees from \n     previous administrations' first year in office.\n       Leahy also has had to overcome obstacles not of his making. \n     After Sen. Jim Jeffords left the Republican Party earlier \n     this year and put the Democrats in control of the Senate, the \n     Republicans tied up the reorganization process for a month, \n     which meant that no hearings could take place on Bush's \n     nominations. In addition, the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks \n     delayed the process as the Judiciary Committee had to devote \n     time to holding hearings on the administration's anti-\n     terrorism legislation, which obviously took priority over \n     judicial confirmation hearings. The anthrax mail scare also \n     has taken its toll on all of Congress' operations, but even \n     on Oct. 18, when all of the Senate office buildings were \n     closed due to the investigation, the Judiciary Committee met \n     in a borrowed room in the Capitol to approve four nominees. \n     That day the committee also held a hearing on five of the \n     nominees, including Reno lawyer Larry Hicks, who eventually \n     was confirmed as a U.S. district judge in Nevada by the \n     Senate earlier this month on an 83-0 vote.\n       Numbers supplied by the People for the American Way \n     demonstrate that it is the Republicans, not the Democrats, \n     who have engaged in excessive partisanship. In the six years \n     that the Democrats were in the majority in the Senate, just \n     25 percent of Presidents Reagan and Bush's nominations were \n     blocked. But later, in the six years that the Republicans \n     were the majority in the Senate, 35 percent of President \n     Clinton's nominees were blocked, a substantial increase. In \n     1998 Sen. Majority Leader Trent Lott had no qualms about the \n     delays. ``Should we take our time on these federal judges? \n     Yes. Do I have any apologies? Only one: I probably moved too \n     many already.''\n       Republicans have made a cold, brutal calculation to pack \n     the judiciary with conservatives. So when a Democrat controls \n     the White House, Republicans work overtime to derail the \n     nominations. But when a Republican is in the White House, the \n     GOP partisans kick and scream about perceived delays in an \n     attempt to get the Democrats to back down on their opposition \n     so that right-wing conservatives can push through as many of \n     their ideological soul mates as possible.\n       President Bush is enjoying extraordinary high popularity \n     right now, but that is no reason why the Democrats should \n     roll over and let him appoint members to the federal \n     judiciary who hold extreme views and aren't qualified. The \n     Democrats should promptly, but carefully, weigh the nominees \n     who, if confirmed, receive lifetime appointments.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 3090\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, during the past couple of days, there has \nbeen some talk about this railroad retirement bill and the reason \npeople are not going to allow us to move forward with this is because \nit would return to the calendar this important stimulus legislation on \nwhich we are working. I have heard other statements that maybe the \nreason we are not going to move to it is because it should go to the \nJudiciary Committee and have hearings, or the Finance Committee.\n  I personally believe these are only excuses. We are having no votes \ntoday. We should get to this legislation. If\n\n[[Page S12080]]\n\nthere is a problem with it, have them offer an amendment and debate it \non the floor as to whether the amendment is in order. We have 74 or 75 \ncosponsors. It is important legislation not only to management but to \nlabor, and it is not often that they agree on anything. They agree on \nthis legislation. I think it is something that would improve this \ncountry.\n  So based upon that, on behalf of Senator Daschle, I ask unanimous \nconsent the stimulus bill, H.R. 3090, recur as the pending business \nimmediately upon the disposition of the railroad retirement bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Reserving the right to object, when I go to the shopping \nmall, I am already hearing Christmas carols. We are closing in on \nChristmas. If we get off into extraneous matters, we are not going to \ncomplete our business. We need to pass a stimulus package, the \nappropriations bills, and deal with the insurance problem we have with \nterrorism. On that basis, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, very briefly, I want to share my thoughts \non the urgency and the merit of the railroad retirement legislation. \nThis is legislation that ought to be a slam dunk for this body. It is \nlegislation which passed in the House by an overwhelming 384-33 vote--\nlegislation sponsored and supported by three-quarters of the Senate.\n  We have an opportunity this afternoon to bring this bill up and to \nhave adequate debate. I don't think it needs much greater debate. \nPeople who want to offer amendments could do so, and we could get this \nfinished up after years of negotiation. This legislation has the \nsupport of both railroad management and labor and has broad-based, \nbipartisan support in both Chambers of Congress. There simply is no \nreason this bill cannot be expedited and taken care of today.\n  I am disappointed we are having as much resistance as we have. It \nappears to me that with the 74 sponsors we have in the Senate this is \nan opportune time to find out who, in fact, is really supportive and \nwhose sponsorship is, in fact, not meaningful. We will have a vote on \nbreaking the gridlock and bringing this legislation to the floor.\n  It is timely, meritorious, and it deals with a railroad retirement \nsystem that is solvent and will continue to be solvent to the end of \nthe horizon for budget accounting. It is badly needed to update the \nsurvivor benefits. We all largely agree to that. I think it is a sad \ncommentary that we can have that level of bipartisan support in both \nChambers of Congress and still find ourselves being held up during \nthese closing days by a few who, it would seem, are hopeful that this \nwill somehow be discarded in the rush of closing legislation.\n  I think there is a time when the will of the majority needs to \nprevail, particularly when it is an overwhelming majority and when it \nis bipartisan in nature.\n  I cannot express my support for this legislation more strongly. We \ncannot wait for next year. This has been around for too long. It has \nbeen negotiated, painfully brought together over a course of years by \nmanagement and labor, and it is time. Its time has come. There is no \nexcuse for not passing this legislation this Congress and getting it to \nthe President's desk for his signature. It will significantly enhance \nthe quality of life and retirement prospects of thousands of Americans \nwho are relying on us to do the responsible thing--the responsible \nthing in terms of retirement policy, the responsible thing in terms of \nbudgeting. That is what this legislation does.\n  Again I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting every effort to \nbreak the gridlock, to bring this up for full and fair consideration \nand then final passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 2505\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the issue I brought \nbefore the body yesterday, which is what is taking place in \nMassachusetts and probably other places across the country, and that is \nhuman cloning.\n  I am seeking to get H.R. 2505, to ban human cloning, heard. It has \nalready been passed by the House of Representatives with a 100-vote \nmargin. If we cannot get a ban through, I would like to put forward a \nproposal which I presented to the leadership, to Senator Daschle, for a \n6-month or even 3-month moratorium on human cloning until we have time \nfor this body to consider the overall issue of human cloning.\n  To date, we have not been able to have a full vote taking place on \nthis issue. We know that one company has developed two human clones, \nand they lived for a week. It is a matter of time before we see \nannouncements--and we could see announcements anytime--about one being \nimplanted into a woman. We have no rules or regulations dealing with \nthis issue--none at all. We have far more rules and regulations dealing \nwith endangered species and the bald eagle's egg than a human embryo \nbeing developed by cloning mechanisms.\n  This is being banned around the world, and yet it is happening here. \nLook at the front cover of Newsweek. I held up this magazine, U.S. News \n& World Report, yesterday: ``The First Human Clone.'' In Europe, the \nFrench and Germans have banned human cloning altogether. The Brits have \ntaken up the issue. It is in the courts in Britain, and it is in front \nof the United Nations. Yet it is happening in the United States.\n  I know my colleagues may grow weary, but I think it is an urgent time \nfor humanity and we should take this up, imposing a moratorium for 3 \nmonths, 6 months. I was talking yesterday about a 6-month moratorium. \nEven 3 months would get us to a time next year when we could fully \ndebate the issue, the body could speak on it, and get a result. It is \nhappening now.\n\n  I will continue to plead with the leadership to allow us to bring it \nup before the Senate. Let us limit the amount of time in the debate. We \ncan limit it to an hour if people want. We can have a vote on it so we \ncan get this to conference with the House of Representatives and so the \nPresident can sign the legislation.\n  Other people see fit to bring up other legislation. I respect their \nright to do that. I believe as a society this is one of the most urgent \nmatters we can address at this point in time. I wish we could put it \noff. I wish we did not have private companies creating human embryos, \nsomething which we would not allow with a bald eagle or any endangered \nspecies, or with livestock. This is treating humans as livestock.\n  People can say I have different viewpoints about the status of a \nhuman embryo. I think everybody will agree it has some moral \nsignificance, the thought they would treat a human embryo as livestock, \nwithout regard for it. And this body is sitting here saying: We are not \nready to take it up. I can respect that because this is an issue which \nwill require lengthy debate. The issue of whether we should have a \nmoratorium is important.\n  Mr. President, I renew the request I put forward yesterday, that we \nbring up H.R. 2505, a bill to ban human cloning, that has passed the \nHouse of Representatives. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to that legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, as I stated \nyesterday, no one can question in good conscience the sincerity of the \nSenator from Kansas in his attempt to do what he believes is so \ncorrect.\n  We had a Democratic policy luncheon today on this subject. We had \nthree eminent scientists, two of whom are in favor of going forward, \nanother who is totally opposed.\n  I am not for human cloning. Therapeutic cloning is something we need \nto take a close look at. There is great potential for solving the \nquestions scientists have had for generations about Parkinson's, \nAlzheimer's, and diabetes. I would never attempt to get into a public \ndebate with the Senator from Kansas on the technicalities of this \nissue. I know he has worked hard on it. Nor would I attempt to get into \na debate with Dr. Frist, Senator Harkin, or Senator Specter, who have \nspent so much time on this.\n  This is an issue on which we need to spend some time. I do not think \nit is as easy as the Senator from Kansas has indicated, to simply put a \nmoratorium\n\n[[Page S12081]]\n\non it. As I said yesterday, there are people who have contacted me who \nbelieve a moratorium of any kind would be a setback to the medical \nmovement to cure some of these diseases.\n  I respectfully suggest to my friend, the distinguished Senator from \nKansas, there are other places in the world that are going to be doing \nthis research. They may not have the refinement that we in the United \nStates have, but there are certainly countries that are very close.\n  For all these reasons and others, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I respect my colleague from Nevada and \nhis views. We have had several dialogs on the floor about this. I \nrespect his thoughts and his comments. I am glad to hear about the \nreview of this issue in the Democratic caucus.\n\n  I have a very strong sense that we should be pausing at this point in \ntime, and that is why I respectfully continue to bring this forward. \nThis is one of those times in humanity when we ought to be stepping \nback and thinking this through clearly and we will come out with a \ndecision. Fine. We will let the body work its will. I am very troubled \nabout this bill proceeding forward with private sector individuals, \nprobably with all the best of intentions, but the only regulation they \nhave is their own bioethical board, which they hire and put in place, \ndeciding these issues for humanity.\n  Once they are out there, they are there. It would be the same as if \nwe allowed biotechnology of a fish, a chicken, or a cow without any \nregulation or consideration, just saying we are going to release it and \nhave it out in the wild. I think people would be very uncomfortable \nwith that notion. Even if this might be the most wonderful thing in the \nworld to do, they would want us to think about it.\n  I deeply respect the Senator from Nevada and his views on this issue \nof human cloning, but this is a troubling time for humanity. We ought \nto hit the pause button.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wish to address some of the remarks made \nby my good friend from Texas, Senator Gramm, with respect to railroad \nretirement. He is a great speaker. He uses words well, and I respect \nwhat he said.\n  I think it is important to bring this issue down to its basics, to \nthe essence of what this bill is, and what this bill is not. I will \nattempt to address that, and then in a few minutes I will answer some \nof the specific points the Senator made.\n  Essentially, the situation is this: We have a railroad retirement \nsystem that pays benefits to railroad retirees and their widows. The \namount of dollars in the railroad retirement trust fund is accumulating \nat a very rapid rate. I think it is about $19 billion now. Over time, \nif the law does not change, the trust fund balance is going to keep \nrising to a very high level. I think over the next 15 years it will be \n$32 billion. That is what the actuaries predict. That is not a \npolitician. That is not a railroader. That is not a railroad executive \nmaking that projection. That is what our Federal actuaries project.\n  Why is that? Why is that balance projected to go up to such a high \nlevel? Well, it is pretty simple. The reason is because the taxes the \nemployers and the employees of the railroad pay are so high. The taxes \nare 21 percent total: 4.9 percent paid by the employees, and the \nbalance paid by the employers. Now that is in addition to the 15 \npercent tax which is similar to Social Security payroll taxes.\n  I think it totals out to about 36 percent total taxes paid by the \nemployers and employees of the railroad industry. Some goes to Social \nSecurity, but I am talking about tier 2. Tier 2 is the private pension \npart of the railroad retirement.\n  The tier 2 trust fund balance is going up at such a rapid rate \nbecause the benefits paid to widows is so meager, so paltry. It is an \nembarrassment. It is a tragedy. It is also going up at a rapid rate \nbecause railroaders must retire at a later age to get the full vesting.\n  So this bill is very simple. It says take some of that money that is \nin the trust fund and invest it in private securities. Lower the taxes \nthe railroaders pay into that trust fund while, at the same time, \nincrease the benefits so a widower would not receive only 50 percent of \nwhat a single retiree would receive, but rather 100 percent of what a \nsingle retiree would receive, and lower the retirement age to 60.\n  There are many industries where the retirement age actually is lower \nthan 60, particularly in industries where the work is so demanding and \nthe work is so physical. It only makes sense to have this retirement \nage at 60, which is comparable with the work that railroaders do.\n  The Senator from Texas makes the point that this is pilfering. He \nlikes that word, ``pilfer.'' He says by reducing the taxes railroaders \npay under the trust fund and by increasing the benefits that would be \npaid, which lowers the trust fund balance by $15 billion over 17 years, \nthat is pilfering. Then he goes on to say: Who is going to pay for the \npilfering? He says the American taxpayer will.\n  It is very clear, the trust fund balance is being lowered because it \nis too high. It is because too many dollars are going into it. The \ntaxes are very burdensome to the companies and to the employees. That \nis why the trust fund balance is at such a high level. The actuaries at \nOMB and CBO agree with this. The actuaries say when this bill passes, \nwhen this bill becomes law, there will be more than enough money in the \ntrust fund to make it actuarially sound for the next 75 years. That is \nnot my judgment. That is the chief actuary's assessment, confirmed by \nCBO. So there is no pilfering. Taxpayers will not have to pay more. \nThere is also a provision in this bill which says if by chance the \nprojections are wrong, if by chance the actuaries are wrong, if by \nchance there is not enough money in the railroad retirement tier 2 \ntrust fund, the taxes that are scheduled to come down under this bill \nwill automatically go back up to their current level, if needed. That \nis in the law. The taxes which are to go up are those paid by the \nrailroaders; not by other taxpayers, not by the rail employees, but by \nthe railroad companies. The railroad companies and railroad workers \nagreed to this while developing the legislation. The railroad companies \nand the railroad employees want this bill. The railroad companies want \nit because, obviously, it looks like lower taxes at first, and it will \nprobably always be lower taxes, but if it is not, they agree to let the \ntaxes go back up. Clearly, the employees want it because the benefits \nare better.\n\n  In addition, even if the projections are wrong, the taxes will go \nback up again and the railroad companies say that is fine. Now, why \nwould they agree to that? Because there is another provision in this \nbill that says that in the private pension part of railroad retirement, \nthat is tier 2, the investments do not have to be government \nsecurities. The railroad retirement investment board--it has a \nfiduciary duty to the railroad retirement system--could invest those \nsecurities in private securities, under a diversified mix, which is \nexactly what every other company pension plan allows and what trustees \nof company pension plans do in the private sector.\n  This bill says what is good for most of the private sector ought to \nbe at least as good for the railroad industry. Again, the actuaries say \nboth under current law and under this bill, the fund will be solid for \nthe next 75 years.\n  There has been some confusion between Social Security, which is tier \n1, and the private pension plan, which is tier 2. The argument has been \nmade: Why lower the retirement age to 60 from 62, when the Social \nSecurity retirement age is increasing?\n  The answer is, we are doing the same thing as is the case in the \nprivate sector. In the private sector, people pay Social Security. They \nmay also pay into their company pension plan and/or their employer pays \ninto the plan on their behalf. In many industries, the retirement age \nfor the company pension is lower than 65. It can be lower than 62.\n  Seventy-four percent of the eighty-five retirement plans studied by \nthe Retirement Research Committee in the State of Wisconsin contain a \nsimilar provision that allowed for retirement with full benefits after \nachieving a certain number of service years. In fact, 30 years of \nservice and reaching age 55--\n\n[[Page S12082]]\n\nnot age 60--was the most common structure for retirement with full \nbenefits.\n  So how does the legislation make this adjustment? Social Security's \nretirement age is rising to 67, and the private pension plan part of \nrailroad retirement is lowering the retirement age to 60. How do you \nmesh the two?\n  In this bill, early retirement is handled the same way as in the \nprivate sector. How is that? It is called a ``social security'' bridge. \nIn the private sector, additional benefits from the private pension \nplan may supplement the standard pension benefits until the beneficiary \nis eligible for their Social Security benefit. That is what the \nrailroad retirement reform legislation does for railroad retirement.\n  Tier 2 benefits provide the bridge. Tier 2 provides additional \nbenefits to the railroad retiree so he or she can retire at age 60 \ninstead of 62. The tier 1 portion of railroad retirement, which is \nsimilar to Social Security, is not touched. The Social Security system \nis not changed at all. The railroad retirement reform legislation does \nnothing to Social Security. Rather, the additional dollars come over \nfrom the private pension part, tier 2.\n\n  Over the years, the Congress has not been fair to railroad \nretirement. Some railroad retirees could draw pensions from both Social \nSecurity and railroad retirement, a ``dual benefit,'' and the railroad \nretirement fund got stuck paying the cost of this extra entitlement. It \nwas such a problem that Congress, in 1974, eliminated dual benefits for \nnew retirees and agreed to pay for the post-1974 cost for all grand \nfathered employees.\n  Guess what. Congress never reimbursed the railroad retirement fund \nfor the $3.5 billion that had been paid out to dual entitlement \nbeneficiaries before 1974. Had this reimbursement been made in full in \n1974, the railroad retirement fund would have more than $31 billion in \nadditional funds today.\n  If you add it together, there is no pilfering or theft. We are making \nrailroad retirement essentially the same as the private sector. It is \nactuarially sound. CBO agrees it is sound for the next 75 years. If we \nare wrong, there will be a scheduled tax increase, which the companies \nagree to. They say that is fine. The statement has been made that they \nmay change their minds and will not accept the tax increase. That is \npossible. But the burden is on the Congress to undue this. The \nscheduled tax increase, if there is one, is in this bill and will be in \nthe law. Again, the railroad companies agree.\n  A final point that needs to be addressed is the scoring issue. The \nHouse of Representatives directed the scoring of this legislation to be \nnot $15 billion, but zero. The reason is today the railroad retirement \ntier 2 has assets. They are Government securities as required by \ncurrent law. For years, the usual rule of thumb under OMB scoring: When \nthe Government purchases an asset, it is scored as an outlay. In this \ncase, when converting the federal treasury securities to private sector \nsecurities, OMB also scores this an outlay because it would be \npurchasing a private asset.\n  This is a grey area. There is no bright-line test. The railroad \nretirement system will still own the same amount of securities, \nalthough it will be a mix of government securities and private sector \nsecurities. Is the railroad retirement system less better off? Is the \npurchase of private sector securities an outlay or not? Because of the \nrules, it is called an outlay, so it is technically a $15 billion cost. \nBut that is 1 year and does not affect future years.\n  The question is: should the rule we have had on scorekeeping be \napplicable in all cases, including this one, or not? That is clearly a \njudgment call for the Senate. My view is that it is something we should \ndebate and make a decision about. However, I do not think that this \nscoring issue alone should stop Congress from passing railroad \nretirement reform this year. Regardless of how it is scored, the \nlegislation reforms the system in a way that is actuarially sound and \ndoes not pilfer one thin dime from the taxpayers. This carefully \nbalanced legislation has been developed over several years. The bill \nhas twice passed the House by a large margin and the Senate bill \ncurrently has 74 cosponsors. It is time to act.\n  If any Senator has any amendment to offer, now is the time. We are \ndebating whether to go to the bill. That takes a lot of time, and we \ndon't have a lot of time left before we adjourn. Rather than preventing \nthe offering of amendments, I urge my colleagues, if they have problems \nwith the bill--offer amendments of their own. We can debate, count the \nvotes, and proceed. That is far, far better than trying to stop this \nbill with the parliamentary maneuvers, claiming we can go back to the \nFinance Committee and rewrite this bill. There is not a lot of time \nleft. This bill has been worked on for a long time. Going back to the \nFinance Committee will not help.\n  Let me correct myself. The $3.5 billion I mentioned earlier as a \nconsequence of changing the dual-benefit system was for years before \n1974 and for pre-1974 retirees. For years after 1974, general revenues \nreimbursed tier 2. That was, again, the consequence of a mistake \nCongress made in earlier years by mandating dual benefits. So in 1974, \nCongress had to put money in the system to correct the mistake made \nearlier.\n  We are now asking ourselves, given where we are today, what makes the \nmost sense. I submit this bill makes the most sense. It is not perfect, \nbut it is certainly very good. If Senators want to make changes, I urge \nthem to offer amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS. What is the rationale for combining Social Security and a \nprivate annuity program?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. This is not a Social Security private annuity program.\n  Mr. THOMAS. These people don't have Social Security other than what \nis here.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. They pay Social Security-like taxes and receive benefits \nsimilar to Social Security, both employees and employers.\n  Mr. THOMAS. But if this happens, you will start getting Social \nSecurity benefits at age 60?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If this happens, you get tier 2 benefits at age 60. Part \nof that may eventually be like Social Security, but only the Social \nSecurity benefit allowed under current law. We don't change any law \nregarding tier 1, which is similar to Social Security. The additional \nbenefit for early retirement is paid with additional funds from tier 2.\n  Mr. THOMAS. You won't be eligible until you are 67; why are they \neligible at 60?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is the practice in the private sector with private \npensions.\n  Mr. THOMAS. But this is Social Security, not the private sector.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. For those who do not have pension plans, and many \nAmericans do not have any pension retirement benefits, what you say is \ntrue. But many Americans do have private pension plans where they \nreceive retirement income in addition to Social Security.\n  Mr. THOMAS. That is not my question.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Let me explain.\n  So in that case, whereas the Social Security retirement age is 65 and \nscheduled to go up over time, those same people who work for a company, \nor did work for a company and have retirement benefits under their \npension plan, receive earlier benefits and more benefits when the \npension plan so provides.\n  Is the Senator asking, what is the interchange between Social \nSecurity and the private pension plan? In the private sector, when a \nretirement plan provides for an earlier retirement age than age 65, a \nperson receives benefits provided by the private pension. For the \nbenefits the person does not receive from Social Security, those \nbenefits are also paid for by the private pension part of the plan. \nThat is what the railroad retirement reform legislation provides for \nrailroad workers.\n  Mr. THOMAS. So in this program, if you start to get benefits at 60, \nthey would be tier 2 benefits, and none of the Social Security would \ncommence until you were 65?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Then is there any specific language that says that the \ntaxpayers will never have to pick up part of this tier 2?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The language is, if the parameters for the trust fund are \nenacted--we are only talking tier 2--if they are enacted, the scheduled \nreductions in taxes that the railroad companies pay would have to go \nback up if\n\n[[Page S12083]]\n\nthe trust fund investments are not performing well.\n  If, on the other hand, the economy is doing so well that the taxes \ncan go down, under this bill both employee and employer taxes will be \nreduced.\n  Mr. THOMAS. But under the private annuity programs, they can't fall \nback on the Government. They are private. This is a mixture, and it is \nsort of confusing for most of us.\n  The Social Security, of course, has supplemented this substantially, \nlargely because there are three beneficiaries to every earner, I \nunderstand.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. No, no, not substantially.\n  Mr. THOMAS. It is $30 billion.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. My colleague is pointing out the differences between \nSocial Security and the railroad retirement. Under Social Security \nthere are three or four employees for every retiree, and it is the \nopposite with the railroad retirement system.\n  Mr. THOMAS. It is the opposite. I understand.\n  I thank the Senator. I would love to see them do whatever they would \nlike. They can do the best they can. But I think a lot of people are \nanxious, as you look at these other charts--I am sorry I can't tell you \nwho proposed this chart, but it shows over time the contributions would \nhave to go up substantially and the trust fund goes down substantially \nover a period of time. If that happens, I guess I am just concerned so \nthe taxpayers are not going to be asked to fill that gap.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If I may respond to that chart, if the current law is not \nchanged, the tier 2 balances will keep rising from the current $15 \nbillion, $16 billion, up to $20 billion, $27 billion; it will just keep \ngoing up, according to actuaries.\n  Under the reform proposal, the railroad retirement account balance \ncomes down, but there is a provision written in this bill which says \nthere must be a certain level of reserves maintained in the tier 2 \nportion. The actuaries certify the investment and tax changes in the \nrailroad retirement legislation will produce a system that achieves \nsolvency over the next 75 years. CBO has looked at it, and they agree.\n  The reason it is coming down is that so much excess payroll taxes \nhave been paid in, the balances have been going up more than they need \nto. They are coming down because taxes are going to be reduced a \nlittle--I assume the Senator from Wyoming likes lower taxes; this \nSenator certainly does--and also because the benefits are increased to \nconform with the modern era and with other industries.\n  One example is retirement age. This is tough work, that of a railroad \nworker. In industries where there is physical danger and demanding \nphysical work, the age to retire with full benefits is usually earlier \nthan age 65. The reform legislation makes that change for railroad \nretirement.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Wouldn't it be simpler over time if you just separated \nSocial Security from a private retirement annuity program? Then you \nwould have the same Social Security benefits as everyone else, and then \nyou could add to it in the private sector and do whatever you chose.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is an idea. The trouble is now, given where we are \ntoday, it would require too much money to make the switch. It is our \njudgment now that we need this legislation. It is $40 billion, frankly. \nWe would need 40 billion extra dollars, and I don't think we have 40 \nbillion extra dollars.\n  Mr. THOMAS. We are dealing differently with a relatively small \nsegment of folks here than we do with others.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. What do you have in mind? Like what?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Pardon?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. What others?\n  Mr. THOMAS. You and me and the gentleman who is giving you all the \nanswers there. He doesn't get Social Security until he reaches 65.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. You did raise a good issue. We have to somehow modernize \nretirement in this country. We have a patchwork system; but we have to \nsomehow work with it.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I appreciate the Senator's answers.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be \nallowed to speak for 20 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n\n\n                             An Energy Bill\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of a significant group \nof Americans who feel that an energy bill should be a priority for this \nCongress. That has been expressed uniformly by many organizations. We \nhave heard from organized labor. For example, we have heard from \nAmerica's veterans, and we have heard from America's Hispanic \ncommunity. They suggest that an energy bill is way overdue. For the \nrecord, I will have a list of many of the organizations that \nparticipated in the debate, expressing themselves on the issue through \nstatements and press conferences and so forth.\n\n  It is important to recognize the current stalemate. It is my \nunderstanding that the current pending business is the stimulus bill. \nNevertheless, we are being asked to set the stimulus bill aside and \nmove to the railroad retirement bill. In context with this, I will \nrefer to some comments that the majority leader made today with regard \nto the energy bill coming before this body.\n  The statement came out of the majority leader's press office, \nindicating that the Republicans have two basic points: One, that energy \nshould be debated this year and, two, that bringing it up in January \nwill not allow the ANWR issue to be debated in the way they would like; \ntherefore, they feel that the majority leader is being unfair.\n  The majority leader, Senator Daschle, responded. He indicated:\n\n       First of all, I guess I would invite them\n\n  Meaning the Republicans--\n\n     to tell me when before Christmas that they want to bring up \n     the energy bill. Why don't you ask them? Is it the 23rd, the \n     24th of December, because that is about the time we will \n     finish all the other things we've got to do. If they want to \n     bring it up between Christmas and New Year's, I would be \n     happy to entertain that possibility as well.\n\n  Well, I don't want to be the Grinch that stole Christmas, but if I \nhave to be, I will. If we have to be here on December 23 or Christmas \nEve to pass an energy bill, so be it. We have procedural options. One \nperson can object to a motion to take up legislation. I am prepared to \ndo that. This is no threat. This is a reality. We have fooled around \nwith this issue long enough.\n  The majority leader has indicated to his members that he will respond \nto their wishes and ensure we don't take the energy bill up and ensure \nthat we don't have a vote.\n  The majority leader further said:\n\n       Ask them what days in particular they have in mind in this \n     energy debate.\n\n  And then he goes on to say:\n\n       With regard to ANWR, what I am simply suggesting is that \n     the Senate work its will.\n\n  Well, I am, too. The majority leader has a vote. I have a vote. We \nhave debated this issue extensively. We passed a bill out of the Senate \nEnergy Committee when I was still chairman. That was early this year. \nWe have had hearings on it. But let's look at fairness. What has \nhappened is tactics that I am very surprised the majority leader and \nsome of my friends from the other side of the aisle would support.\n  As the current ranking member and former chairman of the Energy \nCommittee, even in a minority position, I resent the fact that the \nmajority leader has directed the chairman of the Energy Committee, the \nSenator from New Mexico, not to take up any matters in committee in a \nbusiness session that would give us the chance to report out an energy \nbill, an energy bill that would, of course, contain the ANWR issue.\n  As a consequence, for the last 3 months, we have not had a business \nsession. Now they are proposing to try and leverage that. They are \nsaying: We have four or five nominees pending. The majority on the \ncommittee has indicated that they will give us a hearing\n\n[[Page S12084]]\n\non the nominees and agree to a business session for reporting them out \nonly--only--if the minority ensures that nothing will come up in an \nenergy bill associated with ANWR.\n\n  What are they afraid of? What is wrong with the committee process? \nThe majority leader has simply taken away the authority from the \nauthorizing committee. As a consequence, we can't even take the energy \nbill up in the Energy Committee.\n  Let me revert a little bit to something that happened in 1995. We \npassed an ANWR bill. It was in the omnibus package. It was vetoed by \nPresident Clinton. What were the concerns at the time? At that time, we \nwere about 56 percent dependent on imported oil. We were also concerned \nabout our increased dependence on Iraq because, obviously, Saddam \nHussein had been up to no good since the Persian Gulf War. The same \narguments occurred at that time that are being used today. However, in \n1995 we didn't quite have the litany from certain Senators, because \nsince that time the extreme environmental community has put the \npressure on those Senators.\n  We have had a close Presidential election. There is a great movement \non the other side to try and have Members with Presidential aspirations \nline themselves up to try and pick up the base support that Al Gore \nhad. That is the raw politics in this. That is where the pressure is \ncoming from.\n  We have Senators from Massachusetts who are opposed to opening ANWR. \nI think we probably have enough oil in ANWR to keep Massachusetts going \nfor about 85 years. That is what it would mean to Massachusetts.\n  In any event, it is a significant amount of oil. But the point I make \nis that had the President not vetoed that bill in 1995, we would have \nANWR opened by now. We would have the oil flowing. What may not have \nhappened was the drowning of two U.S. Navy sailors the other day in the \nline of duty boarding a rust bucket tanker out of a port in Iraq to \ninspect and see whether Saddam Hussein is cheating.\n  They found he was cheating, alright. The vessel was overloaded. It \nhad illegal oil going out, smuggled out of Iraq, smuggled out over the \neyes of the U.N. inspectors. We are importing over one million barrels \na day from Iraq.\n  Now, I will revert to July 25, 2001. At that time I proposed an \namendment. The amendment was on the Iran-Libya sanctions bill. I was \nquestioning why Iraq was not included in these sanctions. In response, \nthe Democratic leader, Mr. Daschle, indicated that he was sensitive to \nmy point of view.\n  As a consequence, we entered into a colloquy. That colloquy \nspecifically addressed an opportunity for an up-or-down vote on the \nissue of eliminating oil imports from Iraq, as we have done in Iran and \nLibya in the sanctions act which was passed by this body.\n  I will read from the Record the statement of the leadership: I ask \nunanimous consent after the vote on the Libya sanctions that there be a \ntime limitation of 60 minutes--of 60 minutes, think about that, 60 \nminutes--for debate on the bill equally divided and controlled between \nthe chairman and ranking member or their designees and that the only \nfirst-degree amendments in order to the bill be a Murkowski amendment \nregarding Iraq's oil; and that there be 90 minutes for debate with the \ntime divided as follows: 60 minutes under the control of Senator \nMurkowski, 30 minutes under the control of the chairman and ranking \nmember or their designees; that upon the use or yielding back of the \ntime on the amendment the amendment be withdrawn; that upon the use or \nyielding back of all time, the bill be read a third time and the Senate \nproceed to a vote on passage of the bill with no intervening action.\n  This is directed to the majority leader. I am going to take him up on \nhis offer. Let's do it. Let's do it now. There is only 90 minutes in \nthe agreement. Don't we have 90 minutes around here? We have 90 minutes \nright now. Should we debate Iraq on this floor? It is pretty obvious we \nhave reason to. We just lost two American lives defending, if you will, \nthe U.N.'s proposal to ensure that Saddam Hussein isn't cheating.\n  What are we going to do after Afghanistan? We don't know, but we \ncertainly know there is some significant momentum to look at Saddam \nHussein's role in terrorism. How in good conscience can a Member of \nthis body go to sleep at night, recognizing we are importing over one \nmillion barrels of oil from Iraq, and recognizing we have just lost two \nAmerican lives that, had President Clinton allowed this bill to pass in \n1995, would not have been lost?\n  On September 11, we had the largest single importation of Iraq, over \none million barrels--1.1 million barrels. Whose passports were involved \nin the tragic action that took place in September? Saudi Arabia. We \nhave a problem over there. Every Member of this body should recognize \nthe significance of it. The voice is loud, the voice is clear: Reduce \nour dependence.\n  How do you do it? You don't do it overnight. But you start. I am \nsomewhat amused at the remarks made by my colleague from Massachusetts \nafter a statement I made in the Chamber yesterday. His remarks were \nvery brief, but I will make reference to them. He says:\n\n       What is really interesting about the debate on the Arctic \n     wildlife refuge is that not a drop of oil is going to come in \n     the near term and answer any of the immediate needs of \n     national security with respect to dependence.\n\n  That is a pretty weak statement. When do you start? Do you start when \nyou have a crisis, a calamity, when you have American soldiers and \nsailors whose lives are at stake, or when some have already lost their \nlives?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts--as I indicated, ANWR probably has oil \nthat would supply Massachusetts for 85 years. Moreover, he says:\n\n       We love the 90 percent of the oil shelf that is available \n     for drilling.\n\n  Of course, the junior Senator from Massachusetts has never been up \nthere in ANWR. He doesn't know one side of ANWR from the other. Here is \na chart. Do you know what size ANWR is? It is about 30 times the size \nof Rhode Island. There it is--19 million acres. It is a big hunk of \nU.S. real estate. Eight and a half million acres are in wilderness in \nperpetuity; 9 million are in refuge, leaving the Coastal Plain 1\\1/2\\ \nmillion acres.\n  H.R. 4, the House bill, provides for a footprint of 2,000 acres. At a \npress conference before Thanksgiving we had many Members who had agreed \nto supporting the opening of ANWR, including an energy bill. The other \nside had a press conference with Robert Redford. He was proclaiming \nthat somehow opening ANWR would do irreparable damage. But the House \nauthorizes only 2,000 acres. Do you know how big Robert Redford's ranch \nis in Utah? It is more than 5,000 acres. He has every right to have \nthat ranch and do what he wants on it. But to come here and suggest \nthat the people who live in Kaktovic, can't address the ownership on \ntheir own land is absolutely incomprehensible to me.\n  Here is a photo of the village of Kaktovic. Real people live there. \nThey have title to 95,000 acres of land there. They can't drill on that \nland for gas to heat their homes because there is no authorization \nopening ANWR. Here is the area in question. This is the 1002 area. This \nis the native land--95,000 acres.\n\n  I am asking the majority leader to reconsider this. The Senator from \nMassachusetts suggests there is no difference in the outcome, whether \nthe debate takes place in December, or in January, or whenever. We \ndon't have any commitment from the majority leader. He talks about next \nyear. Well, I am asking him for a vote, as he promised, on terminating \nour importation of oil from Iraq.\n  I want to read the specifics that were in this agreement, which binds \nthe majority leader of the Senate. I indicated:\n\n       Reserving the right to object, Mr. President . . . It had \n     been my request of both leaderships that the condition on \n     withdrawing the amendment would be the assurance that I would \n     have an opportunity for an up-or-down vote at a future time \n     on the issue of oil imports from Iraq. I request \n     consideration, if indeed the leadership will consider that, \n     associated with the appropriate opportunity--maybe on one of \n     our trade agreements that will come before this body--that I \n     would be allowed at least not more than an hour and a half or \n     2 hours to debate that and have the assurance of an up-or-\n     down vote. I ask the leadership for that consideration.\n\n  The leader replied:\n\n       If I may respond, Senator Murkowski has reiterated the \n     understanding we have on both sides of the aisle with regard \n     to his offering an amendment at a later date on Iraq oil on \n     another bill. I will certainly provide\n\n[[Page S12085]]\n\n     him with a vote in relation to that amendment when that time \n     comes.\n\n  I said:\n\n       Reserving the right to object, just for clarification from \n     the leader, the Senator from Alaska requested specifically \n     the assurance of an up-or-down vote, and I believe the \n     majority leader indicated a reference ``in relation to.'' I \n     don't want to mischaracterize the intent. I wanted to have an \n     understanding I would be afforded an opportunity for an up-\n     or-down vote.\n\n  Senator Daschle responded:\n\n       I will have no objection to an up-or-down vote.\n\n  Mr. President, let's start the 90 minutes, let's vote on it. This \nisn't going to take long, until Christmas Eve. We will be resolving \nsomething here that badly needs resolving--the inconsistency of \nincreased dependence on an enemy. How that fails to cause anybody an \nulcer is beyond me. Over one million barrels a day coming into this \ncountry, and we are paying Saddam Hussein for it. Saddam Hussein takes \nthe money, pays it to the Republican Guards to keep them alive, and \ndevelops a missile capability because we haven't had any inspectors \nover there for several years, a missile capability, a biological \ncapability. Who does he aim it at? Our ally, Israel. That is the \nreality, and we take his oil. We put it in our airplanes and take out \nhis targets. We put the lives of American men and women at risk.\n\n  Those on the other side of the aisle who believe otherwise about this \nissue, if we have a catastrophe over there, will rue the day. They will \nprobably put a spin on it. But this is inconsistent, it is un-American \nand it is contrary to the national interests to not act on an energy \nbill.\n  Make no mistake about it, by my presence on the floor today, I am \nputting the majority leader on notice that I want him to live up to the \ncommitment he made to me that we would have an up-or-down vote on the \nissue of Iraqi oil importation into this country, and I will follow \nthat up with a formal letter to the majority leader as well.\n  Can Tom Daschle be the only one who is right and everybody else is \nwrong?\n  Mr. President, I see no other Senator seeking recognition, so I ask \nthe clerk how much time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has no time remaining. Would the \nSenator like additional time?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I request an additional 20 minutes, Mr. President. I \nwill be able to yield some of that time back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I do not know how much politics is mixed up from the \nstandpoint of this being a win or a loss for the President. It is a win \nor a loss for the American people. The President has indicated on five \noccasions that he wants an energy bill--it has been publicized at great \nlength--including that he wants to open ANWR.\n  We have heard from the Secretary of the Interior, Gale Norton, saying \nhow important it is, how we can open up this area safely.\n  We heard from the Secretary of Energy, Spence Abraham, about how \nimportant it is from the standpoint of our energy security.\n  We have heard from the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Tony Principi, \nabout sending more Americans to fight a war over oil on foreign lands.\n  We have heard from our Secretary of Labor, Elaine Chao.\n  We have heard from America's veterans. We have heard from the \nAmerican Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, the AMVETS, the Catholic War \nVeterans of America, the Vietnam Veterans Institute, and the Veterans \nof Foreign Wars.\n  We have heard from organized labor: The Brotherhood of Teamsters, the \nMaritime Labor Union, the Seafarers Union, the Operating Engineers \nUnion, the Plumbers and Pipefitters Union, and the Carpenters, Joiners, \nand Builders Union.\n  Why are these groups interested in this issue? Organized labor is \ninterested in jobs. Talk about the stimulus of opening up this area--\nand I have an additional chart that shows what we are opening, 1.5 \nmillion acres for exploration and development, but the development is \n2,000 acres--it means jobs for Americans, at least 250,000 direct jobs. \nThe Federal Government would realize almost $3 billion in revenue from \nlease sales of this area because this is Federal land. That would meet \nour obligations for environmental oversight, for fish and wildlife \nmanagement, and it could offset some of the deficit, perhaps the cost \nof this war, to some extent. It is very meaningful.\n  We would have two major contributors to the stimulus bill: 250,000 \njobs, and approximately $3 billion in revenue.\n  The bottom line is it would not cost this country one red cent. The \ntaxpayers would not have to pay for it. The oil industry would bid on \nthe leases, and the Federal Government would generate the revenue.\n  We have organized labor saying it is a jobs issue. America's veterans \nare saying:\n\n       Keeping in mind the events of September 11 and mindful of \n     the threats we are facing, we strongly believe that the \n     development of America's domestic energy resources is a vital \n     national security priority.\n\n  They sent that letter to Tom Daschle. These are the people we sent \noff to war in the past. I ask unanimous consent that the remarks of \nthese organizations be printed in the Record as part of my \npresentation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Groups That Support an Energy Policy for America\n\n\n                    president bush's administration\n\n       Secretary of Interior Gale Norton: ``We need the energy, we \n     need the jobs, we need a comprehensive energy bill from the \n     Senate. This plan increases our energy independence and \n     therefore our national security.''\n       Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham: ``We need an energy-\n     security policy and we need it soon.''\n       Secretary of Veteran's Affairs Anthony Principi: ``We are \n     engaged in mortal combat with an enemy who wants to see us \n     fail in securing an energy policy.''\n       Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao: ``The president's plan will \n     create literally thousands of new jobs that will be needed to \n     dramatically expand America's capacity for energy \n     production.''\n\n\n                           america's veterans\n\n       The American Legion: ``The development of America's \n     domestic energy resources is vital to our national \n     security.''--Letter to Senator Daschle.\n       Veterans of Foreign Wars: ``Keeping in mind the horrific \n     events of September 11 and mindful of the threats we are \n     facing, we strongly believe that the development of America's \n     domestic energy resources is a vital national security \n     priority.''--Letter to Senator Daschle.\n       AMVETS: ``As you know, our current reliance on foreign oil \n     leaves the Untied States vulnerable to the whim of individual \n     oil-exporting countries, many existing in the unpredictable \n     and highly dangerous Persian Gulf . . .

Mr. President, moving from veterans and organized \nlabor, we have the Hispanic community, the Latin American Management \nAssociation, the Latino Coalition, the U.S.-Mexico Chamber of Commerce. \nThey have testified. They have spoken at press conferences. What does \nit mean to them? It means prosperity, opportunity, and jobs.\n  We have heard from 60-plus senior organizations: the Seniors \nCoalition, United Seniors Association.\n  We have heard from the American Business Group, the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the \nAlliance for Energy and Economic Growth that represents about 1,100 \nbusinesses, large and small. This is a wide group.\n  We have heard from the Jewish organizations which have a direct \ninterest in the survival of Israel. That is something we have supported \ntime and again.\n  We have heard from the Conference of Presidents of Major American \nJewish Organizations, Mortimer Zuckerman, Chairman, and Malcolm \nHoenlein, Executive Vice Chairman. It reads as follows:\n\n       The Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish \n     Organizations at its general meeting on November 14th \n     unanimously supported a resolution calling on Congress to act \n     expeditiously--\n\n  That means before Christmas, Mr. President--\n\n     to pass the energy bill that will serve to lessen our \n     dependence on foreign sources of oil. We believe that this \n     important legislation has, in addition to the economic \n     impact, significant security implications. We hope that \n     Congress will move quickly to pass this vital measure.\n       We look forward to continuing to work with you and your \n     colleagues on this and other matters of importance to your \n     country.\n\n  Signed Mortimer Zuckerman, Chairman, and Malcolm Hoenlein, Executive \nVice Chairman.\n  I have a letter from the Zionist Organization of America dated \nNovember 26:\n\n       Dear Senator Murkowski: On behalf of the Zionist \n     Organization of America--\n\n  Not just Washington--\n\n     the oldest, and one of the largest, Zionist movements in the \n     United States--we are writing to express our strong support \n     for your efforts to make our country less dependent on \n     foreign oil sources, by developing the oil resources in \n     Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n       At a time when our nation is at war--\n\n  Is at war, Mr. President--\n\n       against international terrorism, it is more important than \n     ever that we work quickly to free ourselves of dependence on \n     oil produced by extremist dictators. Such dependence leaves \n     the United States dangerously vulnerable.\n       Your initiative to develop the vast oil resources of Alaska \n     will make it possible to rid America of this dependence and \n     thereby strengthen our nation's security.\n\n  Signed by Morton Klein, National President, Dr. Alan Mazurek, \nChairman of the Board, Dr. Michael Goldblatt, Chairman, National \nExecutive Committee, and Sarah Stern, National Policy Coordinator.\n  That is an overview of America's organizations with regard to the \nissue of energy security from seniors organizations, the Jewish groups, \nthe Latino Council, the U.S.-Mexico Chamber of Commerce, American \nbusinesses, the National Black Chamber of Commerce, the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, and National Association of Manufacturers.\n  Michael Baroody, Executive Vice President, Alliance for Energy and \neconomic Growth, writes:\n\n       I strongly urge Senator Daschle to move an energy bill to \n     the floor without further delay.\n\n  And we have the attitude of our leader who says: No. He is going to \ndisregard these organizations. He is going to put off indefinitely, \nuntil next year sometime--he does not give us a time; he does not say \nwhen we get back from the January recess we are going to take up energy \nand we are going to finish it in a week or two or finish it before the \nFebruary recess with up-or-down votes and amendments.\n  That is all we want, Mr. President. We want an opportunity to vote on \nthis. They are ducking this. They are under water. They do not want to \nvote on it. They have made their commitments to America's extreme \nenvironmental community. The tide is up, and they are hiding in the \nsand. But some say when the tide is out and we have to vote, they are \ngoing to think twice.\n  The reason they are going to think twice is they are going to have to \nmake a decision on what is best for the extreme environmental \ncommunity, from their point of view, or what is best for America, while \nensuring that we do not lose any more lives as we did the other day \nwhen the tanker sank and we lost the two American Navy men who were \ndoing their job to stop the smuggling of oil from Iraq.\n  I am asking the leader today for 90 minutes to take up the issue he \nmade available back in July when we had what was, in my mind, the \nequivalent to an unanimous consent agreement and he indicated he would \ngive us the 90 minutes for an up-or-down vote.\n  I find it rather distressing that the leader continues to duck this \nissue. The leader was asked what he meant when he said no on an up-or-\ndown vote on ANWR. He said when he anticipated extended debate, and he \nanticipated there would be efforts made to invoke cloture on the \ndebate. We have never before had cloture during a crisis on an energy \nbill. They are threatening cloture. They do not want a straight 50/50 \nvote. They are afraid they will lose. So they want to obtain cloture. \nSo he said there would be votes on the ANWR\n\n[[Page S12087]]\n\namendment, but I do not think it will be on an up-or-down vote. So he \nis saying we cannot have an up-or-down vote on ANWR.\n  Why can we not have an up-or-down vote? That is the name of the game, \nis not it? Cloture obviously has a place in the Senate, but it does not \nhave a place on an energy bill. It has never been invoked when our \nnational security interests have been at stake, and this is about \nnational security. This is about energy security.\n  Furthermore, the majority leader says, I do not think there will be \nan up-or-down vote because I do not think we will ever get to that. He \nsays that he thinks it will be a good cloture vote, but not a definite \nvote.\n  I am not buying that explanation. So what are we going to do about \nit? Well, one Member can tie this body up. One Member can be the Grinch \nthat stole Christmas. If it is Christmas Eve, if it is New Year's Eve, \nwe are going to address the energy security issue. I want to address it \nin a responsible manner. I simply want the opportunity to offer the \nHouse bill, H.R. 4. On stimulus, on railroad retirement, on the \nagriculture bill, I am going to be objecting to moving of anything. I \ndo not know if the leadership or the rest of the Senate want to go \nthrough six or so cloture votes on each one of these things, but I \nguess the only way to get attention is to start ringing the bell when \nattention is needed.\n  I am not going to read into the Record again the statements of the \nPresident, but on November 9, October 31, October 26, October 17, \nOctober 4, and on numerous other occasions, he said he wants an energy \nbill. It is in the national security interest of our country.\n  I am sure some people in this body perhaps saw the list. These are \nthe organizations--there are over 1,000 of them--that believe we have \nto take up an energy bill before we leave. When I listen to the debate \non the other side, and the points that were brought up by my good \nfriend, the junior Senator from Massachusetts, I have to reflect on \nwhat he means.\n  He says on the one hand he wants a good debate, and then he implies \nwe are going to have a filibuster. I guess he too is afraid of a 50/50 \nvote. He also says the supply of oil is somewhat insignificant, and \ntherefore it cannot go on for an extended period of time. I have \nalready addressed that in one sense, because the oil will start to flow \nas soon as we authorize it.\n  Make no mistake about it, the extreme environmental groups have a \nposition on this. They know they are going to lose. They just do not \nknow when. They are playing this as a cash cow, and they are milking it \nfor all it is worth. They will continue to do so until they lose, and \nthen they are going to move to another issue, perhaps in somebody \nelse's State, perhaps in a more populous State. We have one House \nMember. Think about it. That is the pattern.\n  It is interesting for me to reflect on some of the commentators such \nas Charles Krauthammer who wrote a column very recently in the \nWashington Post. It was called ``War on the Polar Bear.'' He says he \nlikes polar bears as much as the next guy. He likes pandas, and he \nlikes caribou and all the furry, cuddly things of God's good Earth, but \nhe also likes people, particularly Americans and particularly American \nsoldiers, and he does not like seeing them shot and killed in wars that \nwould be both more avoidable and more winnable were we not so \ndisastrously dependent on energy supplies from a nasty part of the \nworld, with nasty people who use oil for nasty purposes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       [From the Washington Post]\n\n                         War and the Polar Bear\n\n                        (By Charles Krauthammer)\n\n       So you thought that Sept. 11 changed everything, that the \n     era of game-show frivolity, ``Survivor'' silliness and \n     general self-indulgence had given way to an era of \n     seriousness. Well, not quite.\n       Here we are, for the second time in a decade, risking \n     American lives in a war against an enemy fueled and fed by \n     oil money. Here we are again decrying our dependence on oil \n     from a particularly unstable, unfriendly part of the world. \n     Here we are in desperate need of both energy conservation and \n     new energy production.\n       And here we see (in the Oct. 30 Post) that we may be \n     prevented from drilling in the single most promising area on \n     this continent because of a . . . polar bear treaty: ``New \n     Species Enters Debate on Artic Oil; Polar Bear Agreement \n     Cited by Drilling Foes.''\n       Now, I like polar bears as much as the next guy. I like \n     pandas and caribou and all the furry cuddlies on God's good \n     earth. But I also like people, particularly Americans, and \n     particularly American soldiers. And I do not like seeing them \n     shot and killed in wars that would be both more avoidable and \n     more winnable were we not so disastrously dependent on energy \n     supplies from a nasty part of the world with nasty people who \n     use our oil money for nasty purposes.\n       At a time when Washington should be working on a crash \n     program of conservation and new drilling, a six-year-old \n     report from the Fish and Wildlife Service is leaked in the \n     hope that a 28-year-old polar bear treaty might derail \n     drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n       The outrage! ``This is a classic Bush administration \n     strategy of running roughshod over international \n     agreements,'' charged Kieran Suckling, executive director of \n     the center for Biological Diversity and leaker of the report.\n       The Interior Department stoutly maintains that the polar \n     bear agreement does not prohibit oil exploration. Alaska's \n     Sen. Frank Murkowski points out that the 25,000 or so Arctic \n     polar bears that he represents seem to be quite happily \n     lolling around the existing oil drilling in Alaska.\n       I too have little doubt that the polar bears will do fine, \n     just as the caribou have thrived around the Prudhoe Bay \n     field. But the whole debate is surreal. We are at war, are we \n     not? Americans are fighting. In Washington and New York, \n     nearly 5,000 have already been killed. Fifteen of the 19 \n     murderers were Saudi. Their leader is Saudi. Most of their \n     money is Saudi. And that same Saudi money funds the \n     madrassas, the fundamentalist religious schools where poor \n     Pakistani, Afghan and Arab children are inducted into the \n     world of radical Islam and war against the American infidel.\n       And yet we bow and scrape to the Saudis. We beg and borrow. \n     We tolerate their deflecting onto America the popular hatred \n     that would otherwise be directed at their own corruption. \n     Why? Because we need their oil.\n       The war on terrorism will be fought in many places. Alaska \n     is one. We have known since 1973 that we need to reduce our \n     dependence on Persian Gulf oil. But we have never been \n     serious. It was assumed that Sept 11 would make us serious. \n     Instead, we are engaged in exegeses on polar bear mating \n     habits and a ridiculous debate that pits conservation vs. \n     drilling. Why one and not the other is beyond me.\n       Of course we need conservation. I have been an advocate of \n     a dollar-a-gallon gasoline tax for 20 years. Whatever it \n     takes: auto efficiency standards, higher taxes, incentives \n     for new fuels.\n       But why stop there? We need more oil still. Every \n     additional barrel that substitutes domestic oil for foreign \n     oil is a victory. Drilling in the Arctic will involve less \n     than 1 percent of the Arctic Refuge. It might produce an \n     additional million barrels a day. The sea of natural gas \n     beneath could be the largest in North America.\n       And yet the Luddites stand firm, as if Sept. 11 never \n     happened. Sen. John Kerry vows a filibuster if anyone dares \n     legislate Arctic drilling.\n       Imagine where we would be if those railing against Arctic \n     drilling today had prevailed 30 years ago and stopped Prudhoe \n     Bay. The million barrels a day we now get from Alaska would \n     be coming from Saudi Arabia. We would be even more in their \n     debt and under their thumb.\n       A concerned citizenry is yearning to do something \n     significant for the war effort on the home front. But this is \n     not World war II. We do not need rubber. We do not need war \n     bonds. We do not need Rosie riveting.\n       We desperately do need energy independence. And that is a \n     home-front battle: conservation--and a willingness to disturb \n     a few acres of snow in a vast wilderness as remote as \n     Afghanistan.\n       There's a war on, senators. Let's get serious.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Referring to my good friend again, the junior Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, who says the supply is insignificant, if the supply \nis insignificant, what has Prudhoe Bay done to this country? This is \nPrudhoe Bay. It was developed 27 years ago. It has supplied the Nation \nwith 20 percent of the total crude oil. If we had not developed Prudhoe \nBay, we would not have the oil. We would be importing more from Iraq, \nmore from Saudi Arabia. Maybe we would be importing from Libya and \nIran, very possibly. So do not say it does not contribute something, \nbecause it does.\n  The area of Kaktovik is said to contain 5.7 to 16 billion barrels. \nPrudhoe Bay was only supposed to contain 10 billion barrels. It is now \nat 13 billion barrels.\n  I am continually frustrated by people who speak on this who have \nnever been to ANWR's Coastal Plain. They refuse to go. They do not want \nto take the time to talk to the people in Kaktovik\n\n[[Page S12088]]\n\nabout their hopes and aspirations or see the kids in Kaktovik who want \na better life going to school. They will not do that.\n  So I have to come to this Chamber and explain why I have expertise to \ntalk about something because of my background, because it is in my \nState, because of the fact I have been there. And yet, my critics do \nnot have to justify their generalities.\n  This is a picture of some kids of Kaktovik going to school, three \nhappy Eskimo kids in a village of fewer than 400. They cannot drill for \ngas on their own land. Now think of that. That is an injustice, and yet \nwe have those who say it is insignificant, those who say we are ready \nfor the debate.\n  I do not see them ready for the debate. I will debate them in a \nmoment because there is no question we can develop ANWR safely. We have \nthe technology. In Prudhoe Bay, we drill in the wintertime, the long \nwinter, which runs roughly October through May. We have our drilling \nrigs. We have our various ice roads. We do it right. We do it safely. \nWe can do it quickly.\n  This next photo is a classic example of the Arctic. It looks exactly \nthe same as the 1002 area in ANWR. There are no trees in this area. \nThis is an oil rig drilling in the Prudhoe Bay area. This is an ice \nroad, there is no gravel. When this oil well is done--and I will show a \npicture in the summertime --that is what is seen in the tundra. There \nit is, the same rig.\n  We know how to take care of our environment. We can show a few other \nStates how to take care of their environment because we directionally \ndrill. This is the technology. These are 16 miles apart. My opponents \nsay it cannot be done safely. There is no evidence to suggest we cannot \ndo it safely. My opponents say it is insignificant because it will not \nstart for a few years. It is significant.\n  It is as if we are in a drought to some extent in Washington, D.C. I \nsuppose we could just pray for rain like praying we will not use any \nmore oil and then we will not have to increase our dependence on oil. \nBut, what we do about it is we water our lawn or we look to the \nimmediate relief we can get. We had that opportunity in 1995 when the \nbill passed this body.\n  It was vetoed by President Clinton. Had that veto not occurred, we \nmight not have had to board that ship. I know how that goes around \nhere. That is not a fair accusation but is a reference on reality.\n  Tom Daschle, tell me why all the organizations are wrong and you \nrefuse to bring up an energy bill? Tom Daschle, you owe it to the \nCongress, you owe it to the House, you owe it to the Nation and you owe \nit to me. What we will do is ask you to live by your commitment for 90 \nminutes of debate on the Iraqi sanctions.\n  The other issue promulgated is the attitude of the Gwich'in people. \nSome of the arguments used are in regard to ensuring the Gwich'in \npeople of Alaska that somehow this does not have any detrimental \naffect. The Gwich'in area is, of course, both in Canada and Alaska. \nThis map has a better view. This is Gwich'in territory, Old Crow. This \narea on this side is also Gwich'in territory.\n  My point is, in Canada, the Gwich'ins have entered into leasing. A \nnew Native-controlled oil and gas company has been found in the McEnzie \ndelta. The Gwich'in Oil Field Service owns 51 percent; owned by \nGwich'in drilling company. The Gwich'ins estimate they have an area of \n22,000 square miles. We are talking about leasing, on the United States \nside, 1.5 million acres, and the footprint will be 2,000 acres. The \nGwich'in Development Corporation, wholly owned by the tribal counsel, \nhas a mission to build an investment portfolio offering business \nopportunities, employment and training to Gwich'in residents. The chief \nexecutive officer of the operation said that the deal with the company \ngives the community a chance to participate in oil and gas development. \nHe says in his company's experience, the development of local workforce \nand infrastructure is the key to continued development of the gas \nresources of the Canadian Arctic.\n  There is a mixed message. The mixed message is very clear. The \nenvironmentalists have been funding the Alaskan Gwich'in steering \ncommittee for their own purposes. Their purpose is to ensure that ANWR \ndoes not come about. As a consequence, I think that argument can be put \naside now; most of the population are Canadian Gwich'ins, as far as the \nnumber of tribal members; three-quarters happen to reside in Canada. \nThat is their business. But let's not use these people as a scapegoat \nto a position that somehow it is not in their interests. It is in the \ninterests of the environmental community that funds them.\n  Here is the issue in a nutshell. The argument is superficial. It is \nan argument associated with having an issue which the environmental \ncommunity has to add to their membership and to raise money. They are \nplaying it for what it is worth. It is a significant contribution. If \nit is halfway between the estimate of 6 and 16 billion barrels, as big \nas Prudhoe Bay.\n  Is the issue equity to the Native people? Clearly, they don't want to \ntalk about the fact that the 95,000 acres owned by the Gwich'ins cannot \nbe drilled on for natural gas to heat their homes. They don't want to \ntalk abut the job opportunities.\n  The junior Senator said we have all kinds of job potential with \nregard to energy. Well, none were named. I am all for wind power. I am \nall for solar power. I am for greater mileage with gas. But we will not \nget there because America still relies on energy, whether in the \nairplanes, on the trains, or the ships. And so does the rest of the \nworld. We have coal. But we don't move an airplane on coal. We don't \nmove it on hot air from the Senate. Somebody has to produce oil \nsomewhere. The question is reducing our dependence. How can we \nsleep, again, relying on Saddam Hussein and knowing what Saddam Hussein \nis up to?\n\n  We will proceed. I have hopes that we can have cooperation. I will \nhave hopes that I can go to the chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, Senator Bingaman, and try to address this in an \napproach we can handle in the Senate, but don't buy the excuse that we \ncannot take up an energy bill and pass it. We can take up H.R. 4; the \nHouse passed its bill. We can pass this out of committee and still have \na very significant debate on the ANWR issue. But everyone is hiding on \nthis issue. They are deathly afraid of it.\n  All I can do is try and sort out fact from fiction. That is what I \nhave attempted. I recall the statement of the chairman of the Energy \nCommittee, my friend, Senator Bingaman, hoping there will be broad \nbipartisan support on the committee for dealing with urgent \ninfrastructure issues and take a more comprehensive support to the \nremaining issues. I am ready to do that.\n  When the leader took away the authority of the chairman of the Energy \nCommittee and said he cannot bring anything up in committee if it \ninvolves an energy bill or involves ANWR--I hope other committee \nchairmen are concerned about that. If Republicans had control of this \nSenate and Senator Lott asked me to do it, I would tell him to go take \na hike; I am the chairman. I work with the leadership. But after all, \nyou take my authority totally and leave it in a nebulous state around \nthe cloud of majority leader. That is not right.\n  We have heard the organizations that support this. I guess the leader \ncan assume, from his point, they are wrong and the leader is right. It \ndepends on what the leadership wants and what they want to move. \nSomehow they are prepared to fight this out. We are going to address \nenergy in one form or another before we leave. If I have to object to \nevery unanimous consent agreement, if I have to object to moving to the \nnext bill, we can go through the cloture, but enough is enough. We want \neither a commitment to take it up, put it on as an amendment to one of \nthe bills, or a firm determination on when to take it up and when to \nconclude it.\n  I have been in the Senate for 21 years. I am not buying the argument \nwe will take it up at the 1st of the year. We start taking it up and it \nis set aside and we will never see it again. That will not work this \ntime. We have a few people that feel very strongly about this, \nincluding the other side of the aisle. I hope the White House is \nobserving this process. I am putting them on notice, too. Nothing \nmoves.\n  I hope you will join with me. This picture shows what is going on on \nthe Canadian side of the Arctic. Those are all offshore and onshore \nwells. We see\n\n[[Page S12089]]\n\nthe maple leaf, a Canadian symbol. This is the Alaska area, and this is \nthe 1002 area. This is, again, 35 times the size of Rhode Island.\n  Here is the pipeline. Remember the pipeline? We argued about it. It \nis 800 miles and is running at half capacity. It can take the existing \noil from ANWR, run it laterally over here, and we are in business. No \nbig thing. It is no big thing at all.\n\n  Do you remember what they said about this? They said you are putting \na fence across Alaska, 800 miles. The animals are not going to be able \nto traverse it. This is in permafrost. The ground is frozen, so when \nyou put a hot pipeline in, it is going to melt and crack the pipeline.\n  Here are the animals, three bears. They are walking the pipeline. \nWhy? It is easier on the feet, you don't have to walk in the snow, and \nit is nice and warm. I don't know whether it is a papa bear and mother \nbear and baby bear, but that is a true story of the three bears.\n  We are going to keep these coming until somebody comes or I will get \ntired of talking, either one.\n  The Arctic, as a whole, is an extraordinary area. While some areas of \nthe Arctic may have some pristineness, it also has a tough, long \nwinter. This is the Arctic and this is what it is like this time of \nyear. This is what it will be like in April. This is what it will be \nlike until May.\n  In the summertime there are a few mosquitos there and these are the \nPorcupine caribou. From here to here is more than 60 miles. Senator \nBoxer and I got into some discussion about just where this picture was \ntaken from. This was taken from the roof of one of the windows in \nKaktovik. We have the authentication of the photographer behind it. \nThis is taken from the sea. These are 50 to 60 miles away. These are \nthe caribou moving through.\n  What happens with caribou is kind of interesting. They are protected \nin Prudhoe Bay. You cannot bring a gun into Prudhoe Bay. What we have \nseen in the Prudhoe Bay area--and this is fact, not fiction--is the \ntremendous growth of the caribou herd. It shows Prudhoe Bay and the \noilfields and the caribou. I assure you, they are not stuffed.\n  This is kind of interesting. It shows where we are likely to find oil \nand gas in this country that we put off limits. For the entire west \ncoast--Washington, Oregon, California--there is a moratorium on any oil \nor gas exploration. I respect these States. They don't want it so they \nshould not have it. This is Wyoming, and Colorado, Utah, New Mexico. \nBut, we have also taken the east coast and put that off limits. Then \ndown here, in the gulf--remember we just had a debate on reducing that \nleasing area.\n  What happened here happened under the previous administration under \nthe forest application, closing this to any interests for oil and gas \nas well as timber cutting. So we are excluding areas where we are most \nlikely to find oil. We, however, happen to support the drilling for oil \nin Alaska and we want it.\n  This next photo isn't Prudhoe Bay but this happens to be the caribou \nthat are wandering through. The reason they are wandering through is \nbecause nobody bothers them. You and I can't just take a gun and shoot \nthem.\n  The same is true of the polar bear. If you want to shoot a polar bear \nfor a trophy, go to Canada or go to Russia. You can't do it in Alaska, \nbecause they are marine mammals and they are protected--only the Native \npeople can take them. These are the things that I live with.\n  This is a photo of Kaktovik. This is one of the elders with, \nprobably, his grandson. This is their community center. These are real \npeople with real dreams and aspirations.\n  I know the Presiding Officer was up there and viewed that. He kind of \nlooked around and agreed there was some snow on the ground.\n  This is Kaktovik. They just removed from here the Army's radar site. \nNative Eskimos have lived there for generations. This is a tough, \ntough, bleak country but it is their country and they love it and they \nsimply want an opportunity, like everybody here has, of a better \nlifestyle, a job, better health conditions, and so forth.\n  There has been much made about refuges. Some people have been saying: \n``Good heavens, you are going to drill in a refuge.'' Here is a map \nwhere there has been oil production in national refuges--wildlife \nmanagement areas. Texas has nine; New Mexico has one; Montana has four. \nOil production has also been in refuges in the following states: Texas, \nOklahoma, North Dakota, New Mexico, Montana, Mississippi, Alabama, \nArkansas, Alaska--we only have one in Alaska--California has four, \nKansas and Louisiana. They are doing all kinds of drilling in refuges, \nand they always have. We have better technology now and we know how to \ndo it safely.\n  We listen to the arguments from the other side. Many of them have \nnever been to ANWR. They don't have to give an explanation for their \nbackground or expertise, but we do. Here is a chart on reliance. In \n1973, we were 36-percent dependent on foreign oil, and some of us are \nold enough to remember when there were gas lines around the block. We \nwere outraged. We said we would create a Strategic Oil Reserve so this \nwill never happen and never be dependent on imported oil. In 2001, we \nare 56 percent dependent; in 2010, we will be 66 percent. Shouldn't we \ndo something about that to try to take some steps? We want to conserve \nmore. Granted, we are going to conserve more. But we are still going to \nuse oil. And it is just not us; it is the rest of the world that is \ngoing to use oil. What about China and the developing nations?\n  Here is what is happening to crude oil production in the United \nStates. From 1990 to 2000, it is down. It is down from 7.6 million \nbarrels a day to 6 million barrels a day. We can turn that around, turn \nit around for American jobs, turn it around for American veterans.\n  Why are we deliberating this late in the session? We have tried to \nget this bill up. If you look around at the Chamber you wonder what the \nrest of us are doing today, other than me speaking. Here is where we \nget our oil: Venezuela, Nigeria, Libya, Algeria, Saudi Arabia.\n  Let me tell you something about Saudi Arabia. Am I out of time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous consent for another 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. We are seeing some very dangerous signs coming from \nSaudi Arabia. There is a lot of corruption over there, signs relative \nto the stability of the Royal Family. And there is concern over Bin \nLaden. There is concern that he could get into their oilfields and \ndisrupt them through terrorist activities, or even sink a couple of \nships in the Straits of Hormuz, or even try to overthrow the Royal \nFamily.\n  Remember what happened in Iran? Iran and the Shah were our best of \nfriends, but the Shah did not believe that charity began at home. In \nother words, he was not taking care of his people. That has happened \nover the decades in Saudi Arabia. If that happened, we would pass this \nbill tomorrow because we react to the squeaky wheel and that is the \ncrisis. There is absolutely no question about it.\n  Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait--here is our friend Iraq, \nSaddam Hussein, Bahrain, and a little from Indonesia.\n  We are dependent. I am not standing here and saying if you pass ANWR \nyou will not be dependent, but we will be less dependent and we will \nsend a message that we are doing something positive to relieve our \ndependence.\n  There is an article here in the New Yorker called ``Kings Ransom'' by \nSeymour Hersh, and he talks about the true threat associated with Saudi \nArabia and the plight of the people and the instability of the Royal \nFamily. When we see these things, it behooves us to initiate some \naction.\n  Here is a chart on the crisis as it exists. Foreign oil dependence \nhas been increased to 56 percent. What happens to our leverage with \nthese people when that happens?\n  We see natural gas prices soar. We have not had a new nuclear plant \nlicensed in 10 years. We have not had a new refinery in this country \nbuilt in 25 years. No new coal plants--no new major plants in 10 years. \nThe transmission capacity is overloaded. We saw what happened in \nCalifornia earlier this year. We have to do something\n\n[[Page S12090]]\n\nabout it. We have to pass an energy bill. The House passed their energy \nbill.\n  What about military uses? They are using barrels and barrels each day \nin peacetime.\n  You have been very gracious with me, Mr. President. I see another \nSenator wishing recognition.\n  But I am going to summarize again my intent in asking the majority \nleader to give us an up-down vote on terminating importation of oil \nfrom Iraq as he agreed to do on July 25 where he agreed by saying, ``I \nwill have no objection to an up-down vote.'' I am sure he can find a \nway to dodge that, too. But we are only asking for 90 minutes. I have \ntalked for almost 90 minutes today.\n  This agreement says there shall be 90 minutes, and it will be divided \nbetween the two sides. OK. He is going to have an opportunity to say: \nNo. We don't have 90 minutes; or, This isn't the right time.\n  We just lost two American Navy seamen who boarded an Iraqi tanker \nwhich sank.\n  We will have to see whether the influence of the extreme \nenvironmental community still exists to the point that the leadership \nwill apparently do anything they ask.\n  The leader is my friend. We have had conversations about this. He \nsaid: I realize how strongly you feel about it.\n  It is not just me. It is what is right for America when we have the \nleading Jewish organizations totally in support of this, and the \nveterans groups, and labor. I think he is taking on a big issue here. \nEvidently, the environmental community, in his view, is a lot stronger \nthan the veterans groups, the Hispanic groups, the Mexican groups, the \nJewish groups, and the other groups, on and on--senior citizens, and \nthe Bush administration.\n  I hope it is not for the reason of handing the President a victory. \nThis isn't a victory for the President. This is what is right for \nAmerica. Let's put politics aside.\n  Finally, if we can't work something out, all of us had better find a \nplace up there to hang our Christmas stockings because we will be here. \nI will be here.\n  I am ready to sit down and discuss, negotiate, or whatever, whether \nit be the railroad retirement bill we are trying to get up, to which we \nobjected--I will object to the next one that comes up, whether it be \nthe bill pending stimulus bill, we are going to address it on each one \nof these. It will take time. I have big files. I can talk for a long \ntime. I don't want to do that to each Member. I want to resolve this. I \nwant to find a way to work it out, and the sooner the better.\n  I will be sending a letter to the leader today asking him to provide \n90 minutes for us to take up the issue of terminating our imports from \nIraq because Iraq is an enemy and we are at war.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, before the Senator from Alaska yields the \nfloor, I would like to ask a question.\n  Because of news reports today and yesterday, I believe, that Saddam \nHussein made an absolutely firm statement that under no circumstances \nwould he comply with the U.N. resolution which required that he submit \nhis country to U.N. inspectors looking for evidence of weapons of mass \ndestruction, and because of the strong reaction here in the United \nStates and, I think, in the West generally about the possibility of \nbeginning much more aggressive action against Saddam Hussein, I have \ntwo questions for the Senator from Alaska.\n  First, is it likely if we were to take such action that our ability \nto continue to buy oil from Saddam Hussein would evaporate?\n  Secondly, my recollection is that if we were to develop the oil \nresources available in the ANWR area that it could be a complete \nsubstitute for the Iraqi oil. I have forgotten over what period of time \nthat would be. Can the Senator from Alaska respond?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am very happy to respond to my friend \nfrom Arizona. Perhaps I can highlight a little bit about the specific \ndependence.\n  Here is where we get our oil currently: Nigeria, Libya, Saudi Arabia, \nand here is Iraq--862,000 barrels. It is over a million barrels now. So \nwe have increased that.\n  If we were to terminate our dependence, we would have to find it \nsomeplace else. We would like to think that we could initiate more \nconservation. You can buy a small, fuel-efficient car. Some people do. \nMost people prefer not to for their comfort and for economic reasons. \nBut, nevertheless, the choice is theirs.\n\n  To suggest that somehow we would terminate purchasing oil from Iraq, \nthe results are somewhat predictable. The price of crude oil to the \nAmerican public would go up because there would be a shortage of \nsupply.\n  I assume Saudi Arabia, which has excess capacities, would try to use \ntheir leverage to pick up some of that oil. But it would certainly cost \nmore.\n  The Senator from Arizona makes a very significant point--that we have \nevidence that Saddam is up to no good.\n  Remember that just last week there was a tanker leaving an Iraqi \nport, and it was intercepted by the U.S. Navy. They went aboard that \nship. In the process, the ship sank. We lost two American sailors. We \nhad to do that. He was smuggling oil. That is how he generates the \ncash-flow above and beyond that which is overseen by the U.N. \ninspectors.\n  We had an incident about a month ago where there was a little payoff. \nThe inspectors went aboard. They loaded a tanker half full. The \ninspectors signed off and left. After they left, they would fill up the \ntanker, and away they would go.\n  The worst thing about that is: What does he do with his money? We \ncan't get U.N. inspectors in there, as the Senator from Arizona said. \nThey haven't been in there for well over a year. I think it is probably \n2 years now that we have had no inspectors. He is not passing it out \nfor the betterment of his people. We know what he is doing. He is \ndeveloping a missile and biological capability, and he is aiming it at \nIsrael. That is why you have all of the organizations now aboard the \nIsraeli lobby, so to speak.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, my second question is: If we needed to find \nan alternative source, and if we could find a source that is right here \nin the good, old U.S.A., if the exploration in the ANWR area turned out \nas people think it would, what is the relationship between that part of \nthe oil that might be produced and the amount of oil that we currently \nimport from the country of Iraq?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It would eliminate Iraq's contribution. We would not \nhave to depend on Iraq for 70 years. That is the harsh reality. That is \nwhat ANWR is estimated to contain. The range goes from 5.6 billion \nbarrels to 16 billion barrels. As the Senator from Arizona knows, when \nyou look for minerals or anything underground, it is the best \nscientific evaluation from the geologists. But even if it were in the \nmiddle--10 billion barrels--it would equal what we produce from Prudhoe \nBay, which is 20 to 25 percent of all of our crude oil. It is a lot of \noil. It would send a real signal to the Mideast that we are going to \nrelieve our dependence on you folks over there. We are not going to \nincrease it.\n  The Senator from Arizona is a businessman. He knows. We lose our \nleverage when we become more dependent.\n  Back to the chart, it shows the crude oil prices and percentages. \nHere is where we were in 1973: 36 percent dependent.\n  Remember the Yom Kippur war. We had gas lines around the block. We \nsaid we would never again be dependent to that point. We created SPR. \nYet in the meantime we are up to 56 percent dependence, and we are \ngoing to go up to 66 percent dependence in the year 2010.\n  The other chart, of course, shows Iraqi oil exports. He has been \ndoing very well considering he is our enemy.\n  Mr. KYL. A final comment: Of all the reasons the Senator from Alaska \nhas articulated today, I would put first among them the fact that we \ncould well be at war to a much greater degree than we have been with \nIraq in the very near future.\n  We are going to have to have an alternate supply. If this bill could \nbe passed, the exploration of that oil could occur in ANWR which would \nmore than replace that Iraqi oil and begin to relieve our dependence on \nMiddle East oil.\n\n[[Page S12091]]\n\n  It seems to me, not just as a matter of national energy policy but as \na matter of national security, we ought to get on with the debate on \nthe energy bill.\n  I firmly support the effort of the Senator from Alaska to do so. I \nlook forward to being able to debate it in the very near future.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Senator. It is important to recognize that \nthe Senator from Arizona has been up to ANWR. So I can honestly say, he \nknows what he is talking about, as opposed to some who are ``experts'' \non the subject who refuse to go up ANWR, who will not take the time.\n  I advise my friend from Arizona that we sent a little over $5 billion \nto Saddam Hussein last year for the purchase of his oil. And that does \nnot produce one job in America. What does he do with that money? That \nis a concern we should have.\n  I thank my friend from Arizona for the colloquy and wish he and the \nChair a very good day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am glad I had the opportunity to join in a \nbrief colloquy with the Senator from Alaska because the point he has \nmade is a very important one, and it ties directly into what I came to \nthis Chamber to speak of today; and that is, an effort on the part of \nthe majority leader to insert into the debate a subject extraneous to \nthe effort the President is attempting to make to get an economic \nstimulus package, which includes an energy component to it, to ensure \nthat our economy will remain strong so that we can continue to execute \nthe war on terrorism and know that in the end we will have all of the \nresources we need to do that, as well as for the benefit of all \nAmericans who deserve to have a growing and vibrant economy.\n  There is something very wrong with the process we are engaged in \nright now, which takes us away from the consideration of the stimulus \nlegislation the President would like to have us act upon, to begin to \ntake up extraneous matters.\n  We are almost at the end of our legislative session. We should have \nended in October or November. It is now obviously going to be in \nDecember. The way it looks right now, it will be close to Christmas Eve \nwhen we adjourn for the year.\n  I am happy to stay all year here in Washington doing business, if it \nis productive and we have our priorities straight. But the fact is, the \nNo. 1 priority is fighting the war. Closely related to that is keeping \nour economy strong, and, frankly, stimulating the economy to be \nstronger because right now we are either in or very close to being in a \nrecession. That is why the President has called upon us, as our first \npriority, to support his efforts to stimulate the economy.\n  About a week ago, the majority leader brought forth to the Senate \nfloor a bill--a very bad bill, in my view, the bill that came out of \nthe Finance Committee on a partisan, party-line vote--but at least a \nbill that enabled us to begin to debate the stimulus package. The hope \nwas we would all make our speeches and get our partisanship out of the \nway and then get down to trying to compromise and come up with a good \npackage of tax breaks and support for those who are unemployed right \nnow in order to be sure our economy could continue to grow rapidly.\n\n  But after some initial posturing, rather than sitting down to work \nout a bill or debating further on the floor the merits of different \nproposals, and perhaps attempting to amend one or the other, we find \nourselves in the situation where the leadership has decided to call a \ntimeout on the stimulus package and go to other legislation. If this \nwere June or July, that would be a perfectly appropriate legislative \ntactic. But we are almost at the end of the session.\n  We have two things we have to do before we adjourn and very little \ntime to do them. First, we have to finish the appropriations conference \nreports. They are about half done. They take time. We have to get them \ndown. They fund the Departments of the Government for next year, not \nthe least of which, of course, is the Defense Department appropriations \nbill. There is a separate bill there that will ensure we have the money \nwe need to conduct our military operations in this war on terrorism.\n  The second thing the President has asked us to do before we leave is \nto get this stimulus package passed so its effect can begin to be felt \nearly in the next year, in time to do some good for our economic \nrecovery.\n  What we do not need to be doing is taking a timeout and beginning an \nexcursion off into partisan politics, politics that have to do with a \nbill that railroad labor unions want. There are some people in this \ncountry to whom this is a very vital issue. Some of them are in my home \nState of Arizona. There is plenty of time to deal with the railroad \nretirement issue. Whatever we do with that, it is not going to go away. \nWe can do it next year. We can do it whenever. But we do not need to \ntake time away from our first priority in this war we are fighting to \ncall a timeout to deal with this political issue of the railroad \nretirement fund.\n  And we are told when we are done with that, the next thing is a farm \nbill. We do not need to take up a farm bill until next year either, but \nwe are told that the leader would like to bring up a farm bill.\n  My point for coming to this Chamber today is to say, wait a minute, \nwhere are our priorities? Let's get back on the President's agenda. If \nwe are going to be bipartisan in this body, then let's support what the \nPresident is attempting to do.\n  Certainly my colleagues on the other side of the aisle do not have to \nagree with everything the President wants to do. I would never expect \nthem to do that. But, on the other hand, we ought to at least act in \nenough of a bipartisan way to begin compromising, to reach a conclusion \non a bill we can pass before we recess this year. That means we have to \ncontinue to focus on the stimulus package and not go off riding to the \nhounds on some railroad retirement legislation.\n  So we are going to vote tomorrow. The question is going to be: Should \nwe leave the discussion of the stimulus package and begin consideration \nof a railroad retirement bill?\n  I say no. Let's stick with the stimulus package. Let's get it done. \nAnd then let's go home for Christmas. Let's support the President.\n  I hear a lot of talk of bipartisanship. What does bipartisanship \nreally mean? I have to commend several of my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle for the public statements they have made in support of the \nPresident's conduct of this war. Frankly, the majority leader has been \none of the people who has been the strongest in his enunciation of \nideals, with whom every American can agree who supports the President, \neven though the President is not from the majority leader's party. I \ncommend him for that.\n  The problem is there seems to be a division between the war effort on \nthe one hand and domestic politics on the other. So some of my \ncolleagues are saying, but it is OK if we are not bipartisan on matters \nthat deal with the domestic side of things. The problem with that is, \nthe primary issue on the domestic side is the state of the economy, and \nthe state of the economy has a direct bearing on our ability to fight \nthe war on terrorism. It is also the most important problem facing the \nAmerican people.\n  So bipartisanship, it seems to me, would be an effort to work \ntogether, not necessarily to agree out of the box, but to try to \ndevelop a procedure under which we would eventually come to some kind \nof an agreement on a stimulus package that we could support, that the \nPresident could sign, that would benefit the American people.\n  We can get there by continuing to focus on the stimulus package. We \nwill never get there if we take time out to take up the railroad \nretirement bill. If we take the farm bill up, that is a black hole of \nsignificant magnitude, I must say. If you get into a farm bill, you get \ninto the dairy compacts and you get into many other subjects. The year \nwill, in fact, end before we ever get through that bill.\n  Meanwhile, the appropriations bills languish, most especially the \nDefense appropriations bill, of all things. We have to get the Defense \nappropriations bill passed.\n  So I am asking my colleagues to say no. Vote no. Do not invoke \ncloture to take up the railroad retirement legislation and leave the \nstimulus package.\n  Mr. President, let me make one more point. There is another issue I \nhave\n\n[[Page S12092]]\n\ntalked about while addressing subjects in this Chamber over the last \nseveral months, and that is nominations of the President. It may not be \nknown, but this Senate, now about to enter the month of December, has \nstill not completed its work on the consideration of the President's \nnominees for his Cabinet.\n  He has been President for almost a year now, and the Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy nominee, John Walters, has not been acted \nupon by the Senate. I am very hopeful that this week the Senate can \ndebate, if we need to, and then vote on the nomination of John Walters. \nOtto Reich, Gene Scalia, and other nominations to important positions \nin this administration are not scheduled for consideration on the \nSenate floor.\n  I would suggest this: If we have time to take a timeout from \nconsideration of the stimulus package to do other things, then our \nfirst priority should be--again, if we are going to be bipartisan now--\nto act on the President's nominees. He has asked us repeatedly to do \nthat.\n  Of course, this is not to mention his judicial nominations. We now \nhave over 100 nominations pending for vacancies on our courts, 40 of \nwhich are denominated emergencies, yet we take up no judges. Again, if \nwe have time to call time-out from our consideration of the stimulus \npackage, we sure as heck have time to take up some of these judicial \nnominations.\n  Back in May, the President nominated a group of people to either \nFederal district judgeships or to circuit judgeships. Two of those \npeople have never had a hearing in the committee. There is no \nindication that the leadership ever has in mind taking them up. These \nare superbly qualified nominees for the District of Columbia Court of \nAppeals: Miguel Estrada and John Roberts.\n  And yesterday's Wall Street Journal had an editorial which speculated \nthat the reason was because these are two noted conservative jurists, \nboth of whom will be well qualified to be nominated for the U.S. \nSupreme Court if a vacancy were to occur there, and that knowing this, \nthe people on the other side of the aisle responsible for these things \nare loath to bring them up because, if confirmed, they would then be in \na good position to be nominated by the President for a Supreme Court \nposition.\n  One of them is Miguel Estrada. It is no secret that Miguel Estrada is \nHispanic, and if confirmed and elevated to the High Court would become \nthe first Hispanic Justice. I suspect that President Bush would very \nmuch like to appoint someone like Miguel Estrada--or John Roberts--to \nthe U.S. Supreme Court. What does the Democratic leadership's \nunwillingness to even bring these two people up for a vote suggest?\n  It seems to me that there is a lot of politics being played here and \nthat we ought to get back to bipartisanship in this body which \ncharacterized the mood at the very beginning of this year and was \ncertainly the mood right after September 11.\n  Insofar as the President is concerned, it should still be the order \nof the day; that at a minimum, before we leave here, we should consider \nhis nominees for the Cabinet and for these judicial posts. We should \ntry to finish work on the appropriations bills. We should conclude the \nwork on the stimulus package. And if we do those things, I suggest that \nwe will, in fact, be about ready to be singing ``Jingle Bells.'' We \ndon't have time to be taking up the Railroad Retirement Act.\n  I said I would talk a little about the substance of this. My \ncolleagues from Texas and Oklahoma have outlined some of the problems \nwith the legislation. Contrary to some of the statements made on the \nfloor, it is really not a question of the rail employers and employees \nrunning their own pension plan.\n  The reason that this is being discussed on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate, the Federal Government, is because the United States of America \nhas become a major stakeholder in this process on behalf of the \ntaxpayers of the United States of America who, in fact, subsidize this \npension plan\n  By the way, I believe that is the case only with this private \nindustry's pension plan. We are not talking about the home builders and \ntheir union employees or the airline companies and their employees, \njust the railroads. A decision was made some time ago that the U.S. \nGovernment should get involved in the funding and the guarantee of the \npension for these particular people. That is why the pension plan for \nrailroad retirees is on the floor of the Senate.\n  The first question one could ask is: Is that good policy? Should we \nbe doing that? And then: Should we be debating a bill which would \nexpand the obligation of the taxpayers of the United States to fund \nthis pension as well as to expand the benefits under the pension? My \nview, you can guess, is, no, we should not be doing that.\n\n  This boils down to a question of two special interests--and there is \nnothing wrong with that per se; we all represent the many special \ninterests that comprise our body politic, but these are special \ninterests--the railroad employees and their employers, who have \ndesigned a plan that gives them benefits provided by the American \ntaxpayers.\n  I don't think we need to be interrupting the business of the entire \nNation for the benefit of these particular special interests at this \ntime.\n  If these railroad stakeholders insist on maintaining a retirement \nsystem that is a Federal responsibility, then I submit their claims \nshould be scrutinized by those of us who are supposedly looking out for \nthe interests of all of the people. And for starters, we should ask if \nthe claimed benefits justify an immediate $15 billion reduction in the \nbudget surplus.\n  Actually, of course, the budget surplus is probably a misnomer by now \nbecause we have spent the budget surplus. There is no more budget \nsurplus. So this will have to be borrowed money, and taxpayers will \nhave to pay the associated interest costs.\n  It will not do to pretend, as the House-passed bill does, that the \nfiscal impact can be wished away. I marvel at the audacity of the \nbill's sponsors in resorting to a device of legal legerdemain to say \nthat something that is so isn't really so and because we are the \nCongress, we can say that and that becomes the law.\n  Here is what they said. I am directly quoting from the House-passed \nbill. They are instructing the CBO and OMB, the Congressional Budget \nOffice and the Office of Management and Budget that notwithstanding \nbudget law or OMB scoring conventions, ``the purchase or sale of non-\nFederal assets''--which is what is involved in this pension fund--\n``shall be treated as a means of financing'' rather than an outlay. \nWith that clever language, what they have said is: We are going to \nspend $15.6 billion, but we hereby direct the CBO and OMB to say that \nit doesn't count. We are really not spending it as an outlay. It is a \nmeans of finance.\n  That is pretty good. I have to take my hat off to them. It reminds me \nof an old story that Abe Lincoln used to tell. He would ask this riddle \nof people. He would say: If you call a tail a leg, how many legs does a \ndog have? And his students would ponder that. He would say, of course, \nthe answer is four; calling the tail a leg doesn't make it a leg.\n  Well, calling $15.6 billion in spending a means of financing rather \nthan an outlay--it clearly is a means of financing but that doesn't \nmean that it is not an outlay, which, of course, it clearly is--doesn't \nmean that that is what it is. It is an expenditure of $15.6 billion. It \nis money that the U.S. Government is going to have to borrow. \nTherefore, it ought to be counted as an outlay.\n  There are three interesting aspects to that besides the audacity of \nit. The first is, of course, that the proponents here are obviously \nembarrassed by the fact that they are asking the American taxpayers to \nexpend over $15 billion immediately to aid this private industry's \npension fund. I would be embarrassed, too. I would want to call it \nsomething else.\n  Secondly, however, for those of my colleagues who signed onto this \nlegislation in its original form--there are reasons for having done \nthat and reasons for not doing it, but for those who found good reason \nto do it, I make the point that what they are going to be asked to vote \non tomorrow is not what they signed onto. They signed onto a bill that \ndid not have this magical language in it.\n  When we are voting tomorrow, they are clearly going to be able to say \nto supporters of this bill, look, I still support your bill and we can \ntake it up next year, but I am not going to support a fraud on the \nAmerican people claiming that the $15.6 billion is not an outlay. We \nare going to have to account for that one way or the other. Let's be \nhonest about it.\n  I hope that my colleagues who are still committed to the legislation \nwould acknowledge that what they are being asked to vote for tomorrow \nis not what they signed onto.\n  Second--this is an important point--anybody who believes that we \nshould\n\n[[Page S12093]]\n\nreform Social Security has to look at this very carefully for the \nprecedential effect. If the precedent stands, this will prevent us from \nreforming Social Security as the President has suggested and many of us \ndesire to do by allowing a portion of the Social Security funding \nthrough the payroll tax to be put into an investment account managed by \neach individual Social Security stakeholder.\n  Instead, it will cause us to move toward what President Clinton \nproposed and was rejected, fortunately, which was a scheme in which the \nU.S. Government would actually invest money, would invest people's \nSocial Security money in the equities market.\n  So you would have the Government buying stock in companies. That is a \nbad idea. But because of this language that we would now be permitted \nto say that the purchase or sale of nonfederal assets shall be treated \nas a means of financing rather than an outlay, the kind of scheme \nPresident Clinton proposed would not have any costs associated with it; \nwhereas, the proposal to establish worker-owned personal accounts would \npresumably be scored in the traditional fashion, as a cost, making it \nmuch more difficult to accomplish. I doubt that was the intent of the \npeople who wrote this language. But it is, unfortunately, the effect of \nit. As a result, it is not language that this body should adopt.\n  Mr. President, there is another problem. At a time when we have seen \nthe great surplus in the Federal Government now disappear, and we are \nnow aware that we are going to have to be borrowing money to fund every \nnew program that we pass, we have to look very carefully at any \nspending proposals. I think most of us would say we should look \ncarefully anyway, but clearly when you are borrowing money in order to \nfund programs, there is an extra obligation to be sure we are spending \nwisely. We are not taking on new obligations that just as well could be \nperformed by someone else, if they are good ideas.\n  It seems to me that when we are talking about taxpayer responsibility \nfor a railroad retirement system, with its massive unfunded \nliabilities, that, A, we are buying a pig in a poke and, B, likely \nputting taxpayers into a situation of having to fund something with \ndeficit financing because this bill puts the Government deeper and \ndeeper into this pension and deeper into debt.\n  If the projections offered by the system's own actuaries are borne \nout, the scheme will reduce the trust fund's reserve by more than 50 \npercent. That is because of the lowered retirement age incorporated \ninto the bill, as well as the other increased benefits, combined with \nthe reduction in payroll taxes. Who can doubt that when this happens, \nthese industries who lobbied for this bill will lobby for another \ntaxpayer bailout? No private sector pension plan could get away with \nengaging in such practices and calling it reform.\n  Shame on us if we allow, through a very truncated debate here, the \nsaddling of taxpayers with the bill for such a scheme at the behest of \nthese vested interests.\n  As I said, this is the time for us rather to address our real \npriorities, and to the extent that people are interested in trying to \nfind the best way to reform the taxpayer-subsidized railroad retirement \nsystem, that should be given the deliberation it really requires in \nthis new time. Obviously, that could not occur over the next 24, 48 \nhours. We should not be taking up that legislation at this time--not \nonly because it is bad legislation, but, as I said, because it diverts \nour attention from more pressing problems; namely, a stimulus package \nand getting that done, getting the appropriations bills done, and \ngetting nominations done. I am sure if we can accomplish all of those \nthings with great speed, that would put us right up to Christmas Eve \ntime.\n  I hope tomorrow my colleagues will join me in voting to stay on the \nsubject here, the stimulus package. Let's work through it and get it \ndone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been listening closely to the \narguments made by the other side. I have the greatest respect for the \njunior Senator from Arizona, but, boy, I will tell you that it is \nreally hard to follow his argument. Based upon his statement asking why \nwe are taking time out for extraneous material, the fact is, I was on \nthe floor earlier today and offered a unanimous consent request. It was \nclear that there were some who came to the floor and said what the \nSenator from Arizona said: Why are we not on the stimulus bill?\n  As the Senator from North Dakota, who is on the floor, so adequately \nprojected yesterday in his statement, we are not on the stimulus bill \nbecause a point of order was raised by the Republicans. We would be \ntotally off the bill if we played their game.\n  We could have raised a point of order against the House bill. Then we \nwould have nothing. We decided not to do that because we wanted the \nstimulus to be here because we believe it is important. But now the \nunanimous consent request--and I will offer it again--has been objected \nto. I will offer it again while the Senator from Arizona is here.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 3090\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the stimulus bill, H.R. 3090, recur as \npending business immediately upon the disposition of the railroad \nretirement bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes, Mr. President. I object because what the Senator is \nasking for is the right to take up the railroad retirement bill.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, objection has been heard and I have the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. I respect that, Mr. President.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I also say there has been a question raised \nas to why we are not on the Railroad Retirement Act. In the words of my \ndistinguished friend from Arizona, ``the audacity of the bill's \nsponsors.'' There are 74 of them, and 26 of them are Republicans. So \nthe ``audacity'' of the 26 Republicans should be spread all over this \nrecord. The reason they were concerned when they sponsored this bill is \nthat maybe they were concerned about the widows of the railroad workers \nand how they feel. This is important legislation, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator yield for clarification?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, also, there is a riddle about the \nlegislation not being as it was when it was signed onto. This happens \nall the time here. That is why we have debate on the floor. If somebody \ndoesn't like part of the bill, don't filibuster it; let us go forward \nand offer amendments. We would have been off this a long time ago.\n  Then there was talk about why would we go to the farm bill. Well, Mr. \nPresident, 22 farm organizations believe that we should be on the farm \nbill as soon as we can. We are going to try to do that procedurally as \nsoon as the minority lets us. I guess we should ask the Nation's \nfarmers about the importance of this farm bill this year. They need \nthis. That is why we want to go to it.\n  Also, there has been some talk as to why we aren't on the stimulus \npackage. I have already talked about that. The fact of the matter is, \nin less than 45 minutes, the majority leader is meeting with the \nminority leader, the Speaker, the majority leader of the House, and the \neight top leaders of this Congress, including the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Finance Committee to talk about a stimulus package. \nSenator Byrd decided he is going to worry about homeland security; he \nis going to do that on the Defense bill. The majority leader is doing \neverything he can, and that will be amplified at 6:30 tonight.\n\n  Earlier today, we were criticized: Why are we not doing conference \nreports? Well, the reason is there aren't any. There are none to do. We \nwould be on the stimulus package right now if a point of order hadn't \nbeen raised by the Republicans. I repeat that the reason we still have \nthe bill is we decided we wanted to do something with the conference \nreport.\n  My friend from North Dakota is present. He does a great job. But \ntalking about nominations, how they can do that with a straight face is \nbeyond my ability to comprehend. Mr. President, 14 judicial nominees \nhave been approved. Senator Leahy is going to report out 9 or 10 more \ntomorrow. He will have hearings next week on 4 or 5 more. This will be \nfar more than anybody could imagine he could do with\n\n[[Page S12094]]\n\nthe September 11 incident, with the antiterrorism legislation, which \ntook weeks. We have approved 4 top-ranking officials from the State \nDepartment, 10 nominees who represent the United States before the U.N. \nWe have approved 45 ambassadors.\n  We have said time and again this isn't payback time. But look what \nthey did to President Clinton's nominations to be ambassadors. It was \nembarrassing. Senator Daschle and I went to Brazil. We didn't have an \nambassador there for 2 years. It is one of the largest countries, not \nonly physically but in the number of people, in the whole world. They \nwould not bring the nomination up so we could have a vote. We have \napproved 45. We have approved 49 U.S. attorneys. We would approve more, \nbut they haven't submitted them to us. There is also the Commissioner \nof Customs and the representative of the United States to the European \nUnion. And they complain about Walters. We are going to do that next.\n  Now they have the theory that the reason Senator Leahy is not moving \nforward is we don't want people to go to the Supreme Court. There is a \nbasic rule we have that you don't have to be a district court judge or \nappellate judge to become a member of the Supreme Court; Rehnquist \nwasn't, the Chief Justice, for whom I have great respect. I think he is \na great guy. He said the reason we are not moving forward is that a \nHispanic judge is going to be promoted. I thought Judge Gonzalez, the \nPresident's chief lawyer at the White House, was going to be the next \nnominee to the Supreme Court. They should get their stories straight.\n\n  In short, rather than coming over here trying to confuse the American \npeople, remember, we are not on the economic stimulus bill because they \nraised a point of order. We would be on the bill today. Instead, \nSenator Daschle is having to do some things in his office to work \nsomething out with the leadership--Senator Baucus, Senator Grassley, \nand our counterparts in the House.\n  I am terribly disappointed that we have the minority coming here \nmaking excuses for their own delay. We are not delaying anything. We \nhave not had a vote all day. It is not our fault.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I, too, was inspired by the remarks of a \ncouple of colleagues. My colleague from Nevada just described a rather \ncurious circumstance. We had colleagues come to the Chamber of the \nSenate and ask the question: Where is the stimulus package? Where is \nthe legislation designed to provide economic recovery and lift to the \nAmerican economy? It is as if they have forgotten the last couple of \nweeks.\n  That stimulus package, or the economic recovery package, was before \nthe Senate. We had debate on it. I was here and began debate on that. \nWe were discussing it. Then the other side decided they would make a \npoint of order against that stimulus package.\n  A point of order was valid against it, as there is against the \nRepublican package authored by Senator Grassley, as there will be \nagainst the House package. All of them violate the Budget Act. We \nunderstand that. This is an emergency, and all of us understand that \npassing a stimulus package to provide for economic recovery is outside \nof the Budget Act. But they are the ones who decided to make a point of \norder and take it off the floor of the Senate, and they did.\n  Now they are asking: Where is it? They know where it is. It was \nbefore the Senate, it is now on the calendar, but it is not before us \nfor debate because they made a point of order against the bill.\n  There is a certain genius in being able to ignore facts, but it must \ncertainly be uncomfortable in the long run to do that. This is not \nabout he said, we said, she said, they said. This is about: what do we \ndo to help the American economy recover, how do we do it, and when do \nwe do it? That is what it is about. It is not about pointing fingers.\n  We have had people come to the Chamber to talk about the majority \nleader this, the majority leader that. We had a discussion for an hour \nabout energy and the majority leader. The majority leader came to the \nSenate Chamber today and said we are going to take up energy. He said \nexactly when we are going to do it, and how we are going to do it, and \nhe is doing exactly the right thing because energy is important for \nthis country. Part of America's security is energy security, that is \ntrue. But providing energy security is not developing policies that \nrepresent ``yesterday forever;'' developing policies that say our \nenergy strategy is just dig and drill, and that is our energy strategy \nfor the future. That is not an excuse for an energy strategy.\n  Yes, we should produce more oil and gas. Yes, we should use more \ncoal. We should do it in an environmentally acceptable way. There is \nmuch more to do, as the majority leader knows, to promote strong \nconservation measures, better efficiency of appliances, and incentives \nto produce both limitless energy and renewable energy.\n  As the majority leader knows and some have forgotten, there is more \nto energy than just supply and conservation. Energy is also about \nnational security and energy security--providing security for nuclear \npowerplants, providing security for transmission lines, and providing \nsecurity for pipelines. All of that exists as well, and ought to be \npart of an energy bill.\n  That is why the majority leader has waited just a bit to bring all of \nthese things together from all of the committees, so that when we \ndebate energy in the Senate, we are debating a comprehensive energy \nbill that deals with energy security for this country. It is not just a \n``yesterday forever'' policy.\n  I mentioned ``yesterday forever.'' I will not repeat the story, but \nmy first car was a 1924 Model T Ford that I restored. When I got my \nModel T Ford restored when I was 14 or 15 years old, my father had a \ngas station, and I put gas in that 1924 car exactly the same way you \nput gas in a 2001 model car. Nothing has changed. You go to a gas pump, \ntake the hose, stick it in your tank, and pump gas. Nothing has changed \nwith respect to the way you fuel an automobile.\n  Everything else in life has changed. Don't you think maybe when we \ntalk about an energy policy 40 and 50 years from now, we might aspire \nto have a change?\n  I drove a car out on the lot of the Capitol Building that was a fuel \ncell car operating on water and air, oxygen. The fact is, there are \ntechnologies, applications, and opportunities for us in a good energy \npolicy dealing with not only transportation and automobiles, but with \nelectricity and the transmission of electricity; with composite \nconductors, and tripling the efficiency of transmission lines.\n  There is so much more we can do and should do. That is why the \nmajority leader says: Let's do this. I pledge to do it, here is when we \nare going to do it, but let's do it right. Let's have it be much more \nthan just the same-old policies.\n  I asked those who run our energy policy one day--and I could have \nasked this question of any of the last four administrations, and gotten \nthe same answer--I asked them: What are your plans? Do you have plans \nfor 50 years from now, because we talk about Social Security--is Social \nSecurity funded for the next 30 to 50 years? Everybody is gnashing \ntheir teeth about that. I asked: What are our energy plans for 25, 35, \nand 50 years? Do we have any? If so, what are they? Do we aspire to \nwean ourselves just a bit from fossil fuels, and perhaps go to some \nother technologies and some renewable, limitless fuels? What is it that \nwe aspire to do?\n  The answer was: We do not have plans for 25 or 50 years with respect \nto an energy future. We really do not think in those terms. We ought \nto. That is why the majority leader says: Let's do an energy bill and \nlet's do it right. Let's do it in a way that says to this country our \nenergy policy for the future is not yesterday forever. Senator Daschle \nmakes good sense when he commits to do this, and to do it the right \nway.\n  I know one of my colleagues brought out several dozen charts today. I \ndo not need any charts to simply say that we need an energy policy that \nis balanced, that represents production, conservation, efficiency, and \nrenewable and limitless energy sources, and one that represents energy \nsecurity for our country. I do not need charts to say that. We need to \ndo that.\n  The House of Representatives wrote an energy bill that almost drops \noff the\n\n[[Page S12095]]\n\none side of the page, it is so overweighted with ``yesterday forever'' \npolicies.\n  To those who talk about the energy issues at such great length, I say \nwe are heading toward a real debate on real energy policies that will \nstrengthen this country. The reason we are going to do that is Majority \nLeader Daschle says he is committed to do that in the first work period \nwhen we come back in January. We are going to bring the work from all \nof these committees to the floor of the Senate, and talk about all the \nfacets of energy that we need to employ to give this country some \nassurance of energy security for the future.\n  Mr. President, let me get back to the stimulus package. We cannot \nleave town without passing a stimulus or economic recovery package. We \ncannot do that. This country is at war. The economy of this country has \nbeen in a steep decline. We are in a war and a recession, and we must \npass a package that tries to provide economic recovery. There is not a \nRepublican way to do that or a Democratic way to do that.\n  There are plenty of good ideas in this Chamber. The trick, it seems \nto me, is for us to discard the bad ones, and embrace the good ones \nfrom every part of this Chamber--to come up with a bill that says: \nAmerica first. We want this country to succeed. We want our economy to \ngrow. We want to provide opportunity for the American people.\n  We have been in a situation where there was a call for an economic \nrecovery program by virtually everyone, and the House of \nRepresentatives wrote one. It is not really worth much. I will just \ndescribe a couple of things.\n  The Ways and Means Committee on which I served for 10 years and was \nvery proud to do that--it is a great committee--wrote an economic \nrecovery plan. God bless them, they just went back to the same old \nsuitcase of tired ideas. One that they trotted out was: Oh, by the way, \nfor economic recovery, let's do this: Let's provide a tax rebate for \nalternative minimum taxes paid back between now and 1988 for the \nbiggest companies in this country.\n  What does that mean? Well, Ford Motor Company gets a $1 billion \nrebate check. IBM gets a $1.4 billion rebate check. Is that going to \npromote economic recovery in our country? I do not think so. It is the \nsame old tired thing, giving the big the most in a way that does not \nnecessarily address the question of economic recovery. That is one \nexample.\n  The point is the House wrote a bill. It has some good provisions in \nit; it has some awful provisions. In the Senate, we had a bill that \ncame out of the Finance Committee. I thought it was a good bill, though \nnot perfect. I would have done some things differently, but we brought \nit before the Senate. The Republican side of the aisle decided they \nwould offer a point of order against it. They made a point of order \nthat it violated the Budget Act, and they took it down. Now they stand \naround wondering what happened to it.\n  If a bill is taken down, it seems to me that if one's memory is not \ninfinitesimally short, one should remember what happened to it when it \nwas taken down. So maybe we need to get some mirrors for useful \nreminders to people when they say: Where is the stimulus package? Those \nwho voted to take it off the floor of the Senate really dispatched the \nstimulus package from a debate we were having, which I thought was a \npretty constructive debate.\n  Senator Daschle has convened a meeting that is going to happen in 30 \nminutes. I hope that meeting bears some fruit, because I do not think \nthis is about Republicans and Democrats. It is about trying to get the \nbest ideas we can to figure out what approaches--in spending and tax \nchanges, tax cuts and expenditures, approaches that are both temporary \nand immediate--can help this country's economy. Whatever they are, \nwherever they come from, we ought to employ them in a way that \ncooperates with the President's interests, employ them to try to help \nthis economy. That is what we should be doing at this point.\n  We had a discussion about judges. I happen to be one who believes we \nought to move judges quickly to a vote. We ought to know all there is \nto know about them, as is the case in any lifetime confirmation. It is \na lifetime appointment. When we confirm someone for life, we ought to \nknow everything there is to know to make a judgment. I do not think we \nought to hold judges. Let us move them to a vote. I am for that.\n  The people who are complaining these days were silent for 6 and 8 \nyears when the then-majority party held the Democratic President's \njudges in a deep prison, and they never saw the light of day. We never \nheard a peep from these people.\n  Notwithstanding all the history, it seems to me this country is best \nserved by moving judges after we have determined through hearings what \ntheir backgrounds are. My understanding is Senator Leahy is holding a \nhearing, and about to report either eight or nine judges this week. So \nI think we are moving on judges. I think it is important for us to work \ntogether to do that.\n  What we have is a situation where Senator Daschle brings forward the \nRailroad Retirement Act. It has 74 cosponsors. In a 100-Member Chamber \nof the Senate, 74 Senators have cosponsored this Railroad Retirement \nAct, and yet we have a filibuster. Next we will try to bring the farm \nprogram. That came out of the Agriculture Committee. I am told by some \nthere may be a filibuster on the motion to proceed to the farm bill. I \nhope very much that is not true. I hope we can get that legislation \nbefore the Senate.\n  With respect to the Railroad Retirement Act, I do not think this \nought to be a cause for a filibuster. I know that has happened in the \nlast day and a half, but the Railroad Retirement Act has 74 cosponsors, \nyears of discussion between the railroads themselves, rail labor, and \nmanagement, and the principles of those discussions have been \nincorporated into legislation that has been worked on for a long time. \nThis has a very long gestation period. This has been around a long \ntime. The bill is sufficiently good that it attracts 74 cosponsors. How \nmany times does legislation in the Senate have 74 cosponsors? Not very \nmany. So why does this have 74 cosponsors? Because this has been worked \non a long time. It represents a sound compromise that will do a lot of \nimportant things.\n\n  I very much hope those who take a good look at this, especially those \nwho cosponsored it, will vote to break this filibuster so we can move \nthis bill and pass it through the Senate. But this provides for an \nexpansion of the widow and widower benefits. It deals with important \nvesting provisions, early retirement provisions. It represents a \ncompromise with respect to investment of funds. It is a compromise that \nis a good compromise, and has been developed over a long period of \ntime, and one that the Senate really ought to embrace.\n  I realize when we come to the end of a session, as we have \nexperienced now with probably a week and a half or two left, there are \nsome who do not like the agenda. They say: this bill is brought up, but \nthat is not what they want. They wanted a different bill. The problem \nis, someone has to be in charge. Our side did not like it when the \nother side was in charge. I understand that. That goes way beyond, in \nmy judgment, the question of trying to get a couple of very important \nthings done in the next week or week and a half. One is the stimulus \npackage. That, by far, is the most important.\n  Our economy took a huge hole in its belly on September 11, and it was \nvery weak going in. Economists now say we have been in a recession for \nsome months. This economy is an economy that no one quite understands. \nIt is a global economy. It is safe for me to say that Mr. Greenspan, \nthe Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, does not understand it. \nMitch Daniels, Director of OMB, does not understand it, despite the \nfact that today he was talking about what might or might not happen \nwith respect to deficits in the years 2002, 2003, 2005, in the \noutyears.\n  None of us understands it. I do not understand it. It is a global \neconomy. The modeling does not work. It is a new economy. So what does \nthis mean, this slowdown, this recession? When will it end? What can we \ndo to help it?\n  It is quite clear to me the most important element by far is consumer \nconfidence. If the American people are confident about the future, they \ndo things that manifest that confidence. They buy a house, buy a car, \nor take a trip. They do things that represent\n\n[[Page S12096]]\n\nconfidence and security in their future. If they are not confident \nabout the future, they do exactly the opposite.\n  From those two reactions, of either being confident or not confident, \nwe have both a contraction or an expansion of the American economy. In \nthis global economy, that is even much different than we used to teach \nit in college. That expansion or contraction has other elements \nattached to it as well.\n  So it is our responsibility, in my judgment, to pass a stimulus \npackage. The sooner, the better. My hope is the meeting at 6:30 this \nevening will give us an opportunity to reach a compromise between the \ntwo parties--to be able to create a package of economic recovery \nproposals that will really give confidence to the American people that \nthis economy can begin to strengthen, can begin to expand and provide \njobs and opportunity once again.\n\n  In the month of October, some 415,000 people had to go home one night \nafter work and tell their family they lost their jobs. That is a pretty \ntough thing to do. These are people who lost their jobs through no \nfault of their own, people often at the bottom of the economic ladder \nbeing told that they no longer have a job. Then on the other side of \nthe coin, about half of them, when they see if they can qualify for \nunemployment compensation, are told, no, they do not qualify. If they \ndo qualify, they qualify for a rather insignificant quantity of \nunemployment compensation for a limited time.\n  That is why I hope when we pass this stimulus package one of the \nthings we will do is recognize, as every economist who has talked to us \nrecognizes, that one of the important elements of every economic \nslowdown to stimulate the economy and to do the right thing for people \nwho have lost their jobs is to extend unemployment benefits. That money \nimmediately goes into the economy and immediately helps the economy. So \nthat is one of the things I hope will come out of the meeting this \nevening. I hope Senator Daschle, working with the other leaders in the \nHouse and with the White House, can reach agreement on a stimulus \npackage that really will help this country.\n  Let me make one final point that I think some people will wonder \nabout. There is no disagreement or dispute in the Senate about support \nfor the President in prosecuting this war against terror. President \nBush called on this Congress to support his prosecution of the war \nagainst terrorists. We support him. I think he has done an \nextraordinary job. I commend him. I commend the Secretary of State and \nthe Secretary of Defense. My heart goes out to all of the men and women \nin uniform who are risking their lives for this country. We have some \ndisagreements on domestic policy--on how we might put a stimulus \npackage together, or whether there should be a filibuster on the \nRailroad Retirement Act--but people should understand there is no \ndisagreement about this prosecution of the war against terrorism by \nthis administration.\n  We support this administration. We applaud them for their efforts and \nstand behind them and do everything we can to see they succeed. It does \nnot disserve this country's interests to have a discussion and debate \nabout other issues--railroad retirement, farm policy, a stimulus \npackage. It doesn't disserve anyone's interests to have disagreements \nabout that. The best solution will be devised if we have disagreements \nand come up with all of the ideas, have a competition and select the \nbest from that competition. That is what this Congress, in my judgment, \nowes the American people. From time to time people will be concerned \nabout what the majority leader did or did not do; we ought not be \nconcerned that this is broken down into some sort of a debate that is \nunhealthy.\n  Once in the Washington Post a Member of Congress was quoted as \nsaying: This issue has really degraded into a discussion about \nprinciple. I thought: Well, I hope so. That is why we are all here, to \ndebate policies and principles. No one should feel aggrieved because \nthere is debate breaking out in Congress on some of the domestic \npolicies; but no one should be mistaken about the war against terrorism \nand terrorists and the support this Congress has for this President in \nthe prosecution of that war.\n  It is my hope we will be able to make some significant progress on \nthese issues in the coming days. Despite the agreements we have had in \nrecent days, I think we will see that progress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/28/senate-section/article/S12096-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12096-S12098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PASSAGE OF S. 1684\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Last evening the Senate passed S. 1684, my legislation to \nprovide 1 additional year that was much needed for States, health \nplans, and health care providers to comply with the transactions and \ncode sets regulation of the Health Insurance Portability and \nAccountability Act, or HIPAA. We needed an additional year in order to \nimplement that. This legislation has been difficult to get passed, but \nI thank my colleague, Senator Craig, especially, and Senators Baucus, \nGrassley, and Kennedy, for working with me to reach a compromise on \nthis legislation.\n  Senator Craig and I would prefer this bill go further in providing a \nbit more time in coordination with the effected entities, but we \nrecognize others would have preferred no action at all. We worked for \nmany months to try to reach a compromise. This compromise is \nappropriate.\n  I am still a strong supporter of the Administrative Simplification \nAct, which is the concept of what is called HIPAA. Ultimately having \nall the regulations in place will allow our health care system to be \nbetter coordinated and much more efficient. This bill provides an extra \nyear to comply with part of these requirements with which we needed to \nhave time to comply. It doesn't in any way affect the implementation of \nthe medical privacy regulations by April 2003.\n  Now that it has passed the Senate, I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues in the House to pass the legislation so we can provide for \nthe States, for the health plans, and the providers the certainty they \nneed to plan to implement the important health regulations.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Remember New York\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I rise today, as I did yesterday, to \nspeak again about the destruction and devastation that took place on \nSeptember 11 in New York City and with which we are still living, 11 \nweeks and 2 days later.\n  Madam President, 79 days after the attacks on our Nation, thousands \nof businesses and residents who were physically displaced by the \ndestruction, who suffered from the loss of power and telephone access, \nwho have been overwhelmed and hindered by the debris removal efforts, \nwho have breathed the poor air, who have tried to cope with the crime \nscene designation, who are worried about returning to their homes in \nand near ground zero, who have lost their jobs, who are worrying \nwhether they can keep the doors of their businesses open, thousands \nupon thousands of New Yorkers are still awaiting some help, any help \nfrom the Federal Government.\n  As I said yesterday, the U.S. Constitution guarantees to protect \nevery State against invasion. The President said in his joint address \nto Congress just 10 days after the attacks ``we will rebuild New York \nCity.'' That same day, my colleague, Senator Lott, said while visiting \nNew York, ``We are here to commit to the people'' of New York City, \n``that we will stand with you.''\n  Congressman Gephardt, the House minority leader, said in his weekly \nradio address: ``We will work to make the broken places right again. We \nwill rebuild New York.''\n  They were in good company. As this chart shows, so many of our \nleaders who spoke out made tremendous commitments of help and related \nto the suffering that was going on and still persists to this day.\n  Madam President, 79 days have passed since the terrorist attacks on \nour Nation took over 3,500 innocent lives. Those are lives that, \ntragically, we cannot get back. But the attacks also took livelihoods. \nWe can do something about that. Not only were 15 to 20\n\n[[Page S12097]]\n\nmillion square feet of office space, nearly one-third of all space in \nLower Manhattan, either completely destroyed or damaged, but thousands \nof more smaller businesses remain without physical or telephone access, \nwithout power or with limited access to their places of business--and \nthrough no fault of their own.\n  On September 10, they were running thriving businesses; on September \n12, they were no longer open, and in too many instances still all these \ndays later they are not.\n  This is a before-and-after comparison. This is what the World Trade \nCenter area looked like when we woke up on the morning of September \n11--on that glorious, beautiful, late summer day. This is what it \nlooked like after the terrorists wreaked their evil plot on our \ncountry. I show these pictures to remind everyone what happened on that \nmorning--the lives that were lost; the heroic firefighters, police \nofficers, and emergency workers who ran toward danger, not away from \nit; the thousands and thousands of inhabitants of the buildings that \nwere destroyed and damaged, who, thankfully, made it to safety, and the \nthousands more who did not.\n  We know, as I have said before, the damage that has been done is \ndifficult to express in words. We are not even quite sure of the full \nimpact, but we do know from a study completed by the New York City \nPartnership and Chamber of Commerce that small businesses directly \naffected by the attacks have seen their sales decline by up to 80 \npercent. New York City is likely to lose 125,000 jobs in the fourth \nquarter of this year. We have already lost an unprecedented 79,000 jobs \nin October alone. A total of 270,000 jobs are at risk in Lower \nManhattan. In the 45 days following the attack, because of the \ninaccessibility--the crime scene designation, the streets blocked off, \nthe debris trucks moving up and down doing their job--small businesses \nlost nearly $795 million. Up to 55,000 small business jobs are expected \nto be lost during the first quarter of next year.\n\n  These are staggering numbers. Sadly, 79 days after the attacks, not \nnearly enough help has arrived for the businesses and workers who were \ndirectly victimized by these attacks.\n  There is a reason that our President and our leaders in the House and \nthe Senate committed to rebuild New York and to make the broken pieces \nright again. It is because we need New York. We need New York's energy, \ndynamism; it is the center of global commerce.\n  But even beyond that, it is because we, the Federal Government, the \nGovernment of our country, which represents all Americans, have a \nresponsibility, not only as outlined in the Constitution but one that I \nthink we feel as our duty. It is the same duty we felt after the \nMidwest floods devastated so many acres up and down the Mississippi; \nafter the North Ridge earthquake in California destroyed bridges and \nhighways and buildings and made people run for their lives in the \nmiddle of the night; after Hurricanes Hugo and Andrew and all the \nothers; after tornadoes; after the Oklahoma City bombing; after the New \nMexico fires. After every disaster, natural or manmade, one of the \nunique attributes of our Nation is that we rally around.\n  It is sometimes remarked that as Americans we find our best selves in \nthe face of tragedy. Whether it is people along the levee who are \nfilling sandbags or rescue workers going into the teeth of a tornado to \nmake sure everyone is safe, whether it is the heroic rescuers who carry \nout the injured and dying from the Oklahoma City bombing, we pull \ntogether. We take care of our own.\n  In the case, for example, of the New Mexico fires, just 62 days after \nthe President declared the disaster, the Cerro Grande Fire Claims \nOffice was created at FEMA for businesses and others to seek immediate \nassistance. By the 120th day, the first claim was approved. So the \noffice was set up, the claims were begun, and they were in the pipeline \nand being approved. As of today, $240 million has been paid out, \nincluding $20 million in relief going to businesses, $116 million to \nindividuals.\n  If you go back and look at how New Mexico responded, you can see \nthere is a real difference between the headlines from New York and the \nheadlines from New Mexico. Headlines from ground zero: ``New York Needs \nHelp Now to Rise From the Ashes,'' ``New York Financial Core Wobbles \nFrom Attack's Economic Hit,'' ``Since September 11, Vacant Offices and \nLost Vigor,'' ``Terror Attacks Have Left Chinatown's Economy \nBattered,'' ``A Nation Challenged: Small Shops Feel Lost In Aid \nEffort.''\n  Compare those headlines that appeared on November 19, November 21, \nthe 25th, the 26th--within the last days--with the headlines that came \nout of New Mexico.\n  Headlines from New Mexico read: ``Los Alamos Welcomes Federal Aid.'' \nThat's right, the headline was ``Los Alamos Welcomes Federal Aid.'' \nNot: Where is it? Why are we having to wait so long? Who will help us \nrise from the ashes? We have so many New Yorkers displaced by these \nattacks who are still awaiting help.\n  I have talked with a number of my colleagues about this. It seemed \nthe New Mexico model was a very good one. It made so much sense because \nhere was an instance when the Federal Government itself caused the \ndisaster by setting the fires, and the Federal Government took \nresponsibility and came forth with the assistance to aid businesses and \nindividuals who, through no fault of their own, were in the path of \nthat fire. They didn't start it; they didn't see it coming; it just \nhappened.\n\n  Some of my colleagues say: Yes, that is right. We immediately \nresponded. We got the job done. But, after all, the Federal Government \nset the fires.\n  That strikes me as a strange way of setting one disaster against \nanother. When I think about all the lives that were lost in the World \nTrade Center, when I think about all the businesses that are \nstruggling, and all the people who have lost their jobs, I have to \nreflect that this attack on our country is in some ways even worse than \nsetting a fire to stop a fire. The Federal Government made a mistake in \nNew Mexico. They followed a fire policy that got out of hand and did \nnot work, and they stepped up and took responsibility, representing \nAmericans' willingness to take responsibility.\n  Here we have the same kind of challenge. Through no fault of the \npeople on the ground in New York, we were attacked. I hope my \ncolleagues in the Senate, on both sides of the aisle, our colleagues in \nthe House, the administration, will have the same sense of \nresponsibility to help our businesses and workers who have been \ndisplaced by terrorist attacks as they had in assisting our fellow \ncitizens in New Mexico.\n  I and Senator Schumer have introduced a bill that builds on the \nlessons we have learned from the Cerro Grande Claims Office. There are \nother ways of providing the funding that is needed. My plea is that we \nget about the business of doing that.\n  The victims of the fires in New Mexico were not told to go through a \nlengthy process with the Small Business Administration. They weren't \ntold if you don't have any collateral and you can't get customers \nbecause you have a crime scene designation and therefore you are not \neligible or you cannot pledge your assets for a small business loan, \nyou are out of luck. We used our ingenuity. We were creative in solving \nthe problems that our friends and fellow citizens in New Mexico faced. \nThat is what we are asking on behalf of New Yorkers.\n  We are asking that all of these promises from the President; the \nSpeaker; the majority leader; Senator Lott, the minority leader; the \nOMB Director; and countless others--that these promises be realized as \nquickly and with the kind of dispatch that we saw when it came to New \nMexico.\n  I hope we can address this issue in the remaining days of this year \nbecause our people cannot wait. They could not wait in New Mexico, and \nthey were assisted. They cannot wait in New York either because this is \nunlike any disaster. This is not a disaster such as a terrible fire or \na hurricane. This is a crime scene. This has the kind of significance \nthat has burned itself into our consciousness. The fires are still \nburning.\n\n  I met earlier today with some residents who live in the buildings \nthat weren't destroyed. They are like pioneers. They are like people on \nthe frontier. They have gone back to their homes. It is not easy. There \nare no services. The work goes on 24 hours a\n\n[[Page S12098]]\n\nday, 7 days a week. The smell from the burning fires permeate the air. \nThey want to stay and be part of rebuilding New York. They want to make \nreal the words of all of our leaders. All they need is a little bit of \nhelp. I hope our colleagues will provide that.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  anwr\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, there will be a lot of time spent on other \noccasions debating energy. I don't want the day to end without there \nbeing spread across the record of this Senate the fact that all this \ntalk about the salvation of our country and the world by drilling in \nANWR is just based upon false facts. Out of 100 percent of fossil fuel \naround the country, excluding coal, the United States has 3 percent of \nthe reserves. Ninety-seven percent is someplace else. That includes the \nvery small portion of those reserves in Alaska.\n  We are going to have to change the way we do business in America as \nit relates to fuel or we are going to continue to import more fuel. We \ncannot be self-sufficient for gasoline and petroleum products. We can't \nbe. We do not have the natural resources to do that. We can drill in \nANWR--this beautiful pristine wilderness--and get enough fuel for 6 \nmonths in the United States, a relatively small amount. But what we \nhave to do is look to alternative energy sources--wind, sun, \ngeothermal, and biomass. That is where the future of this country is as \nfar as fuel proficiency. It is not in drilling for oil that we don't \nhave.\n  I again say that I don't want the day to go by with people maybe \nhaving watched us saying: Why aren't they going up and drilling in \nANWR? It would solve all of our problems. That is absurd.\n  I understand why my two distinguished colleagues from Alaska are \npushing for ANWR drilling. It creates jobs in Alaska. I know how \nimportant jobs are, but the overall benefit of the country is really \nnonexistent.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Madam President, I rise today in support of H.R. 1140, \nthe railroad retirement reform bill. As thousands of Georgians who have \ncontacted my office in support of this legislation will state, action \nby the Senate on this legislation is long overdue, and I am pleased to \nhear that we will hold a cloture vote on the bill this week. The House \nof Representatives passed this legislation more than once by \noverwhelming, bipartisan majorities, and the Senate version has 74 co-\nsponsors.\n  Not only would current and former employees benefit from this \nlegislation but also the widows and widowers of former employees, and \nthis legislation is the result of a long effort by both industry and \nlabor to reform the railroad retirement system. Not often does Congress \nhave the opportunity to vote on a cooperative effort supported by \nvirtually everyone in the affected industry. We have that opportunity \nnow, and we would be remiss to ignore it or not support it.\n  It is my understanding that a small number of Senators have stood in \nthe way of this legislation, which has necessitated the filing of a \ncloture petition to shut down the filibuster. These same colleagues \njoined me in support of a tax break package earlier this year that \ncosts over $1 trillion. At that time, we supported the tax legislation \nbecause of the potential economic stimulus it could provide. I say that \nreforming the railroad retirement system will also provide such \nstimulus by freeing up funds that could be reinvested in the economy by \nthe over one million active and retired rail workers and their \nfamilies.\n  This country exploded as the railroads moved west. It was the \nphysical incarnation of manifest destiny. Since the time these initial \ncourageous workers linked this country, hundreds of thousands of \nworkers have followed in their footsteps to maintain and expand their \nwork. These workers and their families would benefit from H.R. 1140. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation and \nprovide long overdue reform to the railroad retirement system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/28/senate-section/article/S12098-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I have, on many occasions, spoken from \nthis desk about the tendency of many in the entertainment industry to \nappeal to the least common denominator in our society in order to make \nthe largest possible profit. Whether it be through the promotion of sex \nto young people or through the glamorization of violence, drug use, or \nother illicit behaviors, the entertainment industry has, too often and \nfor far too long, popularized activities that promote negative and \noften dangerous behaviors.\n  Until last week, that idea dominated my opinion of much of the \nentertainment industry--television, film, and video games. But a \ncreative and intelligent film director, some very talented actors, and \na large and dedicated crew showed me that not all of Hollywood takes \naim at the most base elements of our society.\n  On November 20--my 84th birthday--I was provided the opportunity to \nparticipate in the filming of the movie, ``Gods and Generals.'' This \nfilm is directed by Mr. Ronald Maxwell and is written as a prequel to \nthe film ``Gettysburg,'' which Mr. Maxwell also directed. At Mr. \nMaxwell's invitation, I made my film debut, making a cameo appearance \nas General Paul J. Semmes, an adviser to General Robert E. Lee during \nthe Civil War. Early in the morning on a western Maryland farm, I \nstepped out of my reality representing West Virginia in the Senate and \ninto a small piece of the real-life history that gave birth to my \nState.\n  I arrived at the set at Flook's Farm near Keedysville, MD, at 7:30 \na.m. and was met by Mr. Maxwell and by my nephew, William T. ``Tommy'' \nSale. It had been years since I had seen Tommy. He was playing the part \nof a Confederate artillery gunner in the film. After some time, I was \nescorted to my trailer by Mr. Maxwell, where I changed from my 21st \ncentury business suit to my mid-19th century Confederate uniform. From \nthere, I walked to the make-up trailer, where my white locks were \nhighlighted with shades of grey and black, and my normally clean-shaven \nface was suddenly a well-rounded grey beard. I no longer looked like \nRobert C. Byrd. I had been transformed into Paul J. Semmes.\n  We drove up to the film location on the top of a nearby hill. At the \npeak were two rows of cannons, several columns of Confederate Civil War \nreenactors, including my nephew, and a tent that was to serve as the \n``Telegraph Hill'' headquarters of General Lee. Under this tent were \ngathered some of the top military leaders of the Confederacy--Robert E. \nLee, played by Robert Duvall, A.P. Hill, William Sanderson, J.E.B. \nStuart, Joseph Fuqua, James Longstreet, Bruce Boxleitner, George \nPickett, Billy Campbell, Thomas J. ``Stonewall'' Jackson, Stephen Lang, \nJohn Bell Hood, Patrick Gorman, and others. Scene 158--a little more \nthan 3 minutes of film in which General Lee and his military advisors \nplan the Battle of Fredericksburg--took several hours to complete. The \ndirector, cast, and crew were not interested in speed; they wanted \nquality and were committed to historical accuracy.\n\n  After a few hours of rehearsing and filming, we broke for lunch. It \nwas a delicious meal and the company of such talented professionals \nmade it memorable. For instance, not only are these men portraying \nConfederate generals, they also can talk at great detail about military \nhistory, tactics, and lessons. They can speak with certainty about the \nCivil War--its causes, its terrible loss of life, and the aftermath. \nThey can regale one with stories of the period and the people. They are \nnot simply reciting words on a page; rather, they are bringing to life \na period of American history that ended an inhuman practice and \nsolidified our future as one nation. At the conclusion of this lunch, \nthey surprised me with a birthday cake and serenade, and then called\n\n[[Page S12099]]\n\non me to say a few words. I was touched. I rose to my feet and recited \na few lines from memory that I thought appropriate.\n\n     Fame is a vapor;\n     Popularity, an accident;\n     Riches take wings;\n     Those who cheer today may curse tomorrow;\n     Only one thing endures: Character!\n\n  Then I told those of the cast and crew, ``You have it! You have that \ncharacter.''\n  After lunch, we had several more hours of rehearsing and filming. \nFinally, as the sun was disappearing behind the mountains in the \ndistance, we completed our work and called it a day. My beard and \nuniform were removed. I changed back into my business suit, and re-\nentered the 21st century. And while I was able to return to my wife and \nmy home for the evening, the cast and crew retired to nearby hotels and \nstarted preparations for the next day's filming, which would start with \nthe first light of the morning sun.\n  Many have asked me why I would take the time to play this role in a \nfilm, especially considering that I do not attend many movies. The \nanswer is simple. I have long sought to promote the teaching and \nunderstanding of our Nation's history. I have helped to create Federal \ninitiatives that focus on American history. I have talked countless \ntimes about George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, \nAlexander Hamilton, John Adams, the Founding Fathers, the \nConstitutional Framers, Nathan Hale, Abraham Lincoln, and other true \nAmerican heroes. I try to encourage young people to learn about these \ngreat figures of our country's past. I urge students to read, to visit \nhistorical sites, and to soak up as much knowledge as they can. This \nfilm allowed me the opportunity to help bring American history to life, \nto spring it from the pages of history books into the flickering images \nof the movie screen. In a small way, through this role, I am continuing \nto promote the understanding of our Nation's history. I thank Mr. \nMaxwell and the other actors for giving me such an opportunity.\n  In the days since my cameo appearance as General Semmes, I have \nreflected on our Nation's experiences during the Civil War and what \nlessons we can draw from our past during the current conflict at home \nand overseas. I worry about the men and women of our Armed Forces who \nare engaged in action in Afghanistan. I am concerned about our lack of \npreparedness to prevent further terrorist attacks from occurring on our \nhome soil, and to respond should, God forbid, another tragedy be \ninflicted upon our shores. I wonder what kind of world we will leave \nfor my two great-granddaughters, Caroline Byrd Fatemi and Kathryn James \nFatemi. I hope that those of us in positions of leadership can have the \nsame strength of character and dedication to our country as the \nNation's leaders exemplified during the Civil War. I pray that the \nAmerican people have the fortitude, the willingness to sacrifice, and \nthe patience that will no doubt be necessary during what I continue to \nbelieve may be a long battle against terrorism. At the same time, it is \nclear that the American people will need steadfastness and \ndetermination to move forward from the September 11 tragedies. I am \nthankful that we live in a country that can confront a crisis with \nstrength and moral certainty without abandoning the very principles and \nvalues that we hold most dear.\n  The final words in scene 158 of ``Gods and Generals'' come from \nGeneral Lee. After hearing from his advisors about the preparations and \nplanning for the upcoming battle, General Lee commends them and says, \n``The rest is in God's Hands.'' We can say the same today. We are \nmaking preparations and planning for the future. The rest is in God's \nHands.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/28/senate-section/article/S12099-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CHANGES TO H.

Madam President, I rise today to speak about \nhate crimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of \nthis year. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred May 16, 1995 \nin Eau Claire, WI. A man was beaten by another man who used anti-gay \nslurs during the assault, and claimed the victim made homosexual \nadvances toward him. The assailant, Chad A. Johnson, 19, was charged \nwith attempted first-degree intentional homicide under the State hate \ncrime law. I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its \ncitizens, to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The \nLocal Law Enforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can \nbecome substance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can \nchange hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/28/senate-section/article/S12099-3", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/28/senate-section/article/S12099-4", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/28/senate-section/article/S12099-5", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12099-S12100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:15 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 1459.

A bill to provide for homeland security block grants; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I rise today to offer a helping hand \nto communities in New York and around the country experiencing fiscal \ndistress as they struggle to respond to the heightened security needs \nof our country.\n  Although the terrorists responsible for the September 11 attacks \ntargeted two of our cities, communities thousands of miles away from \nGround Zero now find themselves on the front lines in the war against \nterrorism. Since the attacks, towns and cities, both large and small, \nall across America have been overwhelmed by calls about potential \nbiological or chemical attacks or threats to infrastructure. Along with \nthis new responsibility comes a heavy burden that these communities \nshould not be forced to shoulder alone.\n  That is why today I am introducing legislation to provide relief to \nState and local governments in their efforts to improve emergency \nresponse and public safety locally. This Federal aid will ensure that \nlocal communities will not have to bear the burden of a strong homeland \ndefense alone. Tomorrow, mayors from all around New York State will \nmeet in New York City to address these very concerns. The legislation \nI'm introducing today, along with my colleagues Senators Feinstein, \nMikulski, Durbin, and Schumer, will go a long way in helping them and \ncommunities across the country meet these needs.\n  Since the unimaginable acts of terrorism against American civilians \non U.S. soil that took place a few months ago, we have been forced to \nreevaluate virtually every aspect of our homeland security. One \nimmediate change to emerge in post-September 11 America has been that \nlocal communities are now charged with an enormous responsibility: \nplugging in the gaps in our public safety system and securing our \nhomeland defense.\n  Our entire country witnessed it on September 11 when hundreds of \nbrave men and women in uniform went rushing towards burning buildings \nto save peoples' lives. These courageous individuals were public safety \nofficers and emergency response personnel, and, on that day, America \nand its towns and cities were forever changed.\n  Mayor Joseph Griffo of Rome, New York described this new phenomenon, \nsaying,\n\n       The mayors have become the leaders, the first responders in \n     this new war on terrorism. The police, the firefighters and \n     the emergency personnel are the first responders. We have a \n     role and a responsibility in being more keenly aware of what \n     potentially could happen to our communities.\n\n  Already, towns and cities in New York, and municipalities across the \ncountry, have seen a glimpse of what homeland security's price tag \nlooks like and they are deeply concerned about how they will pay for \nit. Rome Mayor Griffo has said,\n\n       The finances, of providing security, are going to be very \n     difficult. I think it may be tough to recoup all the costs \n     that we've incurred to date. . . . Beyond that, we have to \n     see where we can work in partnership with the feds and the \n     state.\n\n  Bills from skyrocketing police and fire fighter overtime costs are \nsaddling many local governments with unanticipated costs. Local law \nenforcement agencies are struggling with expenses from a wide range of \nsecurity needs, including: properly securing major transportation \ninfrastructure, like tunnels and bridges; stepping up security at \nfacilities that store hazardous materials or drinking water; and \nproviding local health personnel with the resources\n\n[[Page S12102]]\n\nand training they need to respond to biological and chemical attacks.\n  Mayor Jerry Jennings of Albany, NY, estimates that increased patrols \nat Alcove Reservoir in Coeymans to ensure that the city's water supply \nis adequately protected will probably cost taxpayers $1 million. The \ncity of Buffalo, New York, has received 139 terrorist threats since \nSeptember 11. Buffalo Mayor Tony Masiello estimates these additional \nthreats will cost the city approximately $700 an hour.\n  Although the terrorist attacks of September 11 targeted New York and \nWashington, DC, every single community in our country has been affected \nby the attacks, Baltimore, for example, has incurred nearly $4 million \nin security costs since the September 11 attacks, and city budget \nofficials predict that those costs could grow to $15.8 million for the \nfiscal year.\n  New Orleans is contending with a $10 million budget gap due to \nsecurity costs for the city and the New Orleans airport. Dallas, \naccording to some estimates, has already spent $2 million on security \nand could end up spending $6 million by the end of the year. In \nMassachusetts, Acting Governor Jane Swift has approved $26 million for \nhomeland defense related spending, which includes state police \novertime.\n  According to the National Governors' Association, over the next six \nmonths expenses resulting from the September 11 attacks could end up as \nhigh as $10 billion in the 50 States, while the National League of \nCities projects a 4 percent decline in revenues for cities--a projected \n$11.4 billion--from the disastrous effects the attacks have had on \nlocal employment and tourism.\n  These figures point to what mayors have been saying for some time now \nand what I repeated on this floor a few weeks ago after meeting with \nmayors from all over the country: the cost of homeland security is \ncausing our cities to bleed dollars.\n  Of the 214 cities polled in late October, more than half said that \nthey increased spending on security after September 11 and that they \nwould have to dip into surpluses and cut programs as a result. It has \neven been reported that some states are considering using their state \nlottery funds to pay for the cost of bolstering local homeland defense \nefforts.\n  Our homeland security cannot be left to chance and no city or town in \nAmerica should have to choose between adequately protecting its \ncitizens and funding important programs that benefit our children, the \nmost vulnerable among us. It's the responsibility of the Federal \nGovernment to ensure our security and we must not let our cities and \ntowns bear the brunt of homeland defense alone.\n  These additional fiscal demands come at a time when we are already \nfacing a nationwide economic downturn and people are already \nexperiencing the pain of this economic uncertainty. Over the next 18 \nmonths, New York State will face an estimated $10 billion shortfall in \nstate revenues. To counter some of these pressures and help communities \nrecover more quickly from this economic slump, we must provide local \ncommunities with the resources they need to meet these increased \ndemands.\n  Under the legislation I am introducing, cities, counties, and towns \nacross America will be able to access Federal funds to help make up \nthese anticipated revenue shortfalls. The Homeland Security Block Grant \nAct provides $3 billion in funding to communities, with 70 percent \ngoing directly to more than 1,000 cities and counties across the United \nStates. The remaining 30 percent will be funneled to States to direct \nto smaller communities to help them improve security and public safety \nlocally.\n  Cities with a population of more than 50,000 and that are within \nmetropolitan areas and counties within metropolitan areas, regardless \nof the size of the county, will receive funds directly. For example, \nboth Syracuse and Onondaga County will be eligible to receive grant \nfunds.\n  Some of my colleagues have asked whether a small state provision can \nbe included in the bill, one that would guarantee that less-populated \nstates would receive a minimum level funding. I am very much looking \nforward to working with my colleagues on such a provision to include in \nthis bill.\n  This legislation gives local communities a lot of flexibility to \ndetermine how grant funds will be used because local communities are \nmost knowledgeable about their security needs. For example, funds can \nbe used for overtime expenses for law enforcement, fire, and emergency \npersonnel incurred as a result of terrorist threats or to purchase \npersonal protective equipment for fire, police, and emergency \npersonnel.\n  Communities could also use these federal funds to acquire state-of-\nthe-art technology to improve communication between the first \nresponders, based at myriad local agencies, so that they can work \ntogether closely and efficiently while responding to attacks. In \naddition, funds could also be used to improve security or water \ntreatment plants, nuclear power plants, tunnels and bridges, and \nchemical plants.\n  Towns and cities may also decide to use the funds to improve the \ncommunication system used to provide information to the public in a \ntimely manner about the facts of any threat and the precautions the \npublic should take.\n  Finally, to encourage communities to use the homeland security block \ngrants effectively, communities will be required to match by 10 percent \nthe funds received from the Federal Government. Financially distressed \ncommunities, however, will receive a waiver from the matching \nrequirement.\n  I'm proud that this legislation has the support of the International \nAssociation of Firefighters, the International Association of Fire \nChiefs, the National Association of Police Organizations, the National \nLeague of Cities, and U.S. Conference of Mayors.\n  Just as our Federal Government pays for defense overseas, it is our \nduty to fund our defense at home. Our homeland defense can only be as \nstrong as the weakest link at the State and local level. By providing \nour communities with the resources and tools they need to bolster \nemergency response efforts and provide for other homeland security \ninitiatives, we will have a better-prepared home front and a stronger \nAmerica.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1737\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist \n     attacks on our country, communities all across American now \n     find themselves on the front lines in the war against \n     terrorism on United States soil.\n       (2) We recognize that these communities will be forced to \n     shoulder a significant portion of the burden that goes along \n     with that responsibility. We believe that local governments \n     should not have to bear that responsibility alone.\n       (3) Our homeland defense will only be as strong as the \n     weakest link at the State and local level. By providing our \n     communities with the resources and tools they need to bolster \n     emergency response efforts and provide for other emergency \n     response initiatives, we will have a better-prepared home \n     front and a stronger America.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Based on the Attorney General's approval of \n     these recommendations, the Attorney General shall establish \n     such requirements for use by such grantees, States, and units \n     of general local government.\n       (2) Reviews and audits.--The Attorney General shall, at \n     least on an annual basis, make such reviews and audits as may \n     be necessary or appropriate to determine--\n       (A) in the case of grants made under section 7(b), whether \n     the grantee has carried out its activities and, where \n     applicable, whether the grantee has carried out those \n     activities and its certifications in accordance with the \n     requirements and the primary\n\n[[Page S12104]]\n\n     objectives of this Act and with other applicable laws, and \n     whether the grantee has a continuing capacity to carry out \n     those activities in a timely manner; and\n       (B) in the case of grants to States made under section \n     7(d), whether the State has distributed funds to units of \n     general local government in a timely manner and in \n     conformance to the method of distribution described in its \n     statement, whether the State has carried out its \n     certifications in compliance with the requirements of this \n     Act and other applicable laws, and whether the State has made \n     such reviews and audits of the units of general local \n     government as may be necessary or appropriate to determine \n     whether they have satisfied the applicable performance \n     criteria described in subparagraph (A).\n       (3) Adjustments.--The Attorney General may make appropriate \n     adjustments in the amount of the annual grants in accordance \n     with the Attorney General's findings under this subsection. \n     With respect to assistance made available to units of general \n     local government under section 7(d), the Attorney General may \n     adjust, reduce, or withdraw such assistance, or take other \n     action as appropriate in accordance with the Attorney \n     General's reviews and audits under this subsection, except \n     that funds already expended on eligible activities under this \n     Act shall not be recaptured or deducted from future \n     assistance to such units of general local government.\n       (d) Audits.--Insofar as they relate to funds provided under \n     this Act, the financial transactions of recipients of such \n     funds may be audited by the General Accounting Office under \n     such rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the \n     Comptroller General of the United States. The representatives \n     of the General Accounting Office shall have access to all \n     books, accounts, records, reports, files, and other papers, \n     things, or property belonging to or in use by such recipients \n     pertaining to such financial transactions and necessary to \n     facilitate the audit.\n       (e) Metropolitan City as Part of Urban County.--In any case \n     in which a metropolitan city is located, in whole or in part, \n     within an urban county, the Attorney General may, upon the \n     joint request of such city and county, approve the inclusion \n     of the metropolitan city as part of the urban county for \n     purposes of submitting a statement under section 5 and \n     carrying out activities under this Act.\n\n     SEC. 6.

ALLOCATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS.\n\n       (a) Allocation and Distribution of Funds; Set-Aside for \n     Indian Tribes.--\n       (1) Allocation.--For each fiscal year, of the amount \n     approved in an appropriation Act under section 4 for grants \n     in a year (excluding the amounts provided for use in \n     accordance with section 6), the Attorney General shall \n     reserve for grants to Indian tribes 1 percent of the amount \n     appropriated under such section. The Attorney General shall \n     provide for distribution of amounts under this paragraph to \n     Indian tribes on the basis of a competition conducted \n     pursuant to specific criteria for the selection of Indian \n     tribes to receive such amounts. The criteria shall be \n     contained in a regulation promulgated by the Attorney General \n     after notice and public comment.\n       (2) Remaining allocation.--Of the amount remaining after \n     allocations pursuant to paragraph (1), 70 percent shall be \n     allocated by the Attorney General to metropolitan cities and \n     urban counties. Except as otherwise specifically authorized, \n     each metropolitan city and urban county shall be entitled to \n     an annual grant, to the extent authorized beyond fiscal year \n     2002, from such allocation in an amount not exceeding its \n     basic amount computed pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2) of \n     subsection (b).\n       (b) Computation of Amount Allocated to Metropolitan Cities \n     and Urban Counties.--\n       (1) In general.--The Attorney General shall determine the \n     amount to be allocated to each metropolitan city based on the \n     population of that metropolitan city.\n       (2) Urban counties.--The Attorney General shall determine \n     the amount to be allocated to each urban county based on the \n     population of that urban county.\n       (3) Exclusions.--In computing amounts or exclusions under \n     this section with respect to any urban county, there shall be \n     excluded units of general local government located in the \n     county the populations that are not counted in determining \n     the eligibility of the urban county to receive a grant under \n     this subsection, except that there shall be included any \n     independent city (as defined by the Bureau of the Census) \n     which--\n       (A) is not part of any county;\n       (B) is not eligible for a grant pursuant to subsection \n     (b)(1);\n       (C) is contiguous to the urban county;\n       (D) has entered into cooperation agreements with the urban \n     county which provide that the urban county is to undertake or \n     to assist in the undertaking of essential community \n     development and housing assistance activities with respect to \n     such independent city; and\n       (E) is not included as a part of any other unit of general \n     local government for purposes of this section.\n\n     Any independent city that is included in any fiscal year for \n     purposes of computing amounts pursuant to the preceding \n     sentence shall not be eligible to receive assistance under \n     subsection (d) with respect to such fiscal year.\n       (4) Inclusions.--In computing amounts under this section \n     with respect to any urban county, there shall be included all \n     of the area of any unit of local government which is part of, \n     but is not located entirely within the boundaries of, such \n     urban county if the part of such unit of local government \n     which is within the boundaries of such urban county would \n     otherwise be included in computing the amount for such urban \n     county under this section, and if the part of such unit of \n     local government that is not within the boundaries of such \n     urban county is not included as a part of any other unit of \n     local government for the purpose of this section. Any amount \n     received by such urban county under this section may be used \n     with respect to the part of such unit of local government \n     that is outside the boundaries of such urban county.\n       (5)Population.--(A) Where data are available, the amount \n     determined under paragraph (1) for a metropolitan city that \n     has been formed by the consolidation of one or more \n     metropolitan cities with an urban county shall be equal to \n     the sum of the amounts that would have been determined under \n     paragraph (1) for the metropolitan city or cities and the \n     balance of the consolidated government, if such consolidation \n     had not occurred. This paragraph shall apply only to any \n     consolidation that--\n       (i) included all metropolitan cities that received grants \n     under this section for the fiscal year preceding such \n     consolidation and that were located within the urban county;\n       (ii) included the entire urban county that received a grant \n     under this section for the fiscal year preceding such \n     consolidation; and\n       (iii) took place on or after January 1, 2002.\n       (B) The population growth rate of all metropolitan cities \n     referred to in section 3 shall be based on the population \n     of--\n       (i) metropolitan cities other than consolidated governments \n     the grant for which is determined under this paragraph; and\n       (ii) cities that were metropolitan cities before their \n     incorporation into consolidated governments. For purposes of \n     calculating the entitlement share for the balance of the \n     consolidated government under this paragraph, the entire \n     balance shall be considered to have been an urban county.\n       (c) Reallocation.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), any \n     amounts allocated to a metropolitan city or an urban county \n     pursuant to the preceding provisions of this section that are \n     not received by the city or county for a fiscal year because \n     of failure to meet the requirements of subsections (a) and \n     (b) of section 5, or that otherwise became available, shall \n     be reallocated in the succeeding fiscal year to the other \n     metropolitan cities and urban counties in the same \n     metropolitan area that certify to the satisfaction of the \n     Attorney General that they would be adversely affected by the \n     loss of such amounts from the metropolitan area. The amount \n     of the share of funds reallocated under this paragraph for \n     any metropolitan city or urban county shall bear the same \n     ratio to the total of such reallocated funds in the \n     metropolitan area as the amount of funds awarded to the city \n     or county for the fiscal year in which the reallocated funds \n     become available bears to the total amount of funds awarded \n     to all metropolitan cities and urban counties in the same \n     metropolitan area for that fiscal year.\n       (2) Transfer.--Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph \n     (1), the Attorney General may upon request transfer \n     responsibility to any metropolitan city for the \n     administration of any amounts received, but not obligated, by \n     the urban county in which such city is located if--\n       (A) such city was an included unit of general local \n     government in such county prior\n\n[[Page S12105]]\n\n     to the qualification of such city as a metropolitan city;\n       (B) such amounts were designated and received by such \n     county for use in such city prior to the qualification of \n     such city as a metropolitan city; and\n       (C) such city and county agree to such transfer of \n     responsibility for the administration of such amounts.\n       (d) Allocation to States on Behalf of Non-qualifying \n     Communities.--\n       (1) In general.--Of the amount approved in an appropriation \n     Act under section 4 that remains after allocations pursuant \n     to paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a), 30 percent shall \n     be allocated among the States for use in nonqualifying areas. \n     The allocation for each State shall be based on the \n     population of that State, factoring in the population of \n     qualifying communities in that State, and the population of \n     qualifying communities of all States. The Attorney General \n     shall, in order to compensate for the discrepancy between the \n     total of the amounts to be allocated under this paragraph and \n     the total of the amounts available under such paragraph, make \n     a pro rata reduction of each amount allocated to the \n     nonqualifying communities in each State under such paragraph \n     so that the nonqualifying communities in each State will \n     receive an amount that represents the same percentage of the \n     total amount available under such paragraph as the percentage \n     which the nonqualifying areas of the same State would have \n     received under such paragraph if the total amount available \n     under such paragraph had equaled the total amount which was \n     allocated under such paragraph.\n       (2) Distribution.--(A) Amounts allocated under paragraph \n     (1) shall be distributed to units of general local government \n     located in nonqualifying areas of the State to carry out \n     activities in accordance with the provisions of this Act--\n       (i) by a State that has elected, in such manner and at such \n     time as the Attorney General shall prescribe, to distribute \n     such amounts consistent with the statement submitted under \n     section 5(a); or\n       (ii) by the Attorney General, in any case described in \n     subparagraph (B), for use by units of general local \n     government in accordance with paragraph (3)(B).\n       (B) The Attorney General shall distribute amounts allocated \n     under paragraph (1) if the State has not elected to \n     distribute such amounts.\n       (C) To receive and distribute amounts allocated under \n     paragraph (1), the State must certify that it, with respect \n     to units of general local government in nonqualifying areas--\n       (i) provides or will provide technical assistance to units \n     of general local government in connection with homeland \n     security initiatives;\n       (ii) will not refuse to distribute such amounts to any unit \n     of general local government on the basis of the particular \n     eligible activity selected by such unit of general local \n     government to meet its homeland security objectives, except \n     that this clause may not be considered to prevent a State \n     from establishing priorities in distributing such amounts on \n     the basis of the activities selected; and\n       (iii) has consulted with local elected officials from among \n     units of general local government located in nonqualifying \n     areas of that State in determining the method of distribution \n     of funds required by subparagraph (A).\n       (D) To receive and distribute amounts allocated under \n     paragraph (1), the State shall certify that each unit of \n     general local government to be distributed funds will be \n     required to identify its homeland security objectives, and \n     the activities to be undertaken to meet such objectives.\n       (3) Administration.-- (A) If the State receives and \n     distributes such amounts, it shall be responsible for the \n     administration of funds so distributed. The State shall pay \n     from its own resources all administrative expenses incurred \n     by the State in carrying out its responsibilities under this \n     Act, except that from the amounts received for distribution \n     in nonqualifying areas, the State may deduct an amount to \n     cover such expenses and its administrative expenses not to \n     exceed the sum of $150,000 plus 50 percent of any such \n     expenses under this Act in excess of $150,000. Amounts \n     deducted in excess of $150,000 shall not exceed 2 percent of \n     the amount so received.\n       (B) If the Attorney General distributes such amounts, the \n     distribution shall be made in accordance with determinations \n     of the Attorney General pursuant to statements submitted and \n     the other requirements of section 5 (other than subsection \n     (c)) and in accordance with regulations and procedures \n     prescribed by the Attorney General.\n       (C) Any amounts allocated for use in a State under \n     paragraph (1) that are not received by the State for any \n     fiscal year because of failure to meet the requirements of \n     subsection (a) or (b) of section 5 shall be added to amounts \n     allocated to all States under paragraph (1) for the \n     succeeding fiscal year.\n       (D) Any amounts allocated for use in a State under \n     paragraph (1) that become available as a result of the \n     closeout of a grant made by the Attorney General under this \n     section in nonqualifying areas of the State shall be added to \n     amounts allocated to the State under paragraph (1) for the \n     fiscal year in which the amounts become so available.\n       (4) Single unit.--Any combination of units of general local \n     governments may not be required to obtain recognition by the \n     Attorney General pursuant to section 3(2) to be treated as a \n     single unit of general local government for purposes of this \n     subsection.\n       (5) Deduction.--From the amounts received under paragraph \n     (1) for distribution in nonqualifying areas, the State may \n     deduct an amount, not to exceed 1 percent of the amount so \n     received, to provide technical assistance to local \n     governments.\n       (6) Applicability.--Any activities conducted with amounts \n     received by a unit of general local government under this \n     subsection shall be subject to the applicable provisions of \n     this Act and other Federal law in the same manner and to the \n     same extent as activities conducted with amounts received by \n     a unit of general local government under subsection (a).\n       (e) Qualifications and Determinations.--The Attorney \n     General may fix such qualification or submission dates as he \n     determines are necessary to permit the computations and \n     determinations required by this section to be made in a \n     timely manner, and all such computations and determinations \n     shall be final and conclusive.\n       (f) Pro Rata Reduction and Increase.--If the total amount \n     available for distribution in any fiscal year to metropolitan \n     cities and urban counties under this section is insufficient \n     to provide the amounts to which metropolitan cities and urban \n     counties would be entitled under subsection (b), and funds \n     are not otherwise appropriated to meet the deficiency, the \n     Attorney General shall meet the deficiency through a pro rata \n     reduction of all amounts determined under subsection (b). If \n     the total amount available for distribution in any fiscal \n     year to metropolitan cities and urban counties under this \n     section exceeds the amounts to which metropolitan cities and \n     urban counties would be entitled under subsection (b), the \n     Attorney General shall distribute the excess through a pro \n     rata increase of all amounts determined under subsection (b).\n\n     SEC. 8. NONDISCRIMINATION IN PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES.\n\n       No person in the United States shall on the ground of race, \n     color, national origin, religion, or sex be excluded from \n     participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected \n     to discrimination under any program or activity funded in \n     whole or in part with funds made available under this Act. \n     Any prohibition against discrimination on the basis of age \n     under the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101 et \n     seq.) or with respect to an otherwise qualified handicapped \n     individual as provided in section 504 of the Rehabilitation \n     Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) shall also apply to any such \n     program or activity.\n\n     SEC. 9. REMEDIES FOR NONCOMPLIANCE WITH REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       If the Attorney General finds after reasonable notice and \n     opportunity for hearing that a recipient of assistance under \n     this Act has failed to comply substantially with any \n     provision of this Act, the Attorney General, until he is \n     satisfied that there is no longer any such failure to comply, \n     shall--\n       (1) terminate payments to the recipient under this Act;\n       (2) reduce payments to the recipient under this Act by an \n     amount equal to the amount of such payments which were not \n     expended in accordance with this Act; or\n       (3) limit the availability of payments under this Act to \n     programs, projects, or activities not affected by such \n     failure to comply.\n\n     SEC. 10.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide regulatory relief appeals process reforms, contracting \nflexibility, and education improvements under the Medicare Program, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I am pleased to join my colleagues \nSenators Murkowski, Baucus and Grassley in introducing the Medicare \nAppeals, Regulatory and Contracting Improvement Act, MARCIA. This \nlegislation will give health care providers relief from unnecessary and \nburdensome government regulations that threaten to interfere with the \ndelivery of health care to our nation's Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Medicare provides health care coverage for over 40 million senior and \ndisabled Americans, relying on thousands of health care providers, \nincluding doctors, nurses, hospitals, nursing homes, home care \nagencies, and hospices, to deliver services, and more than fifty \nprivate health insurance companies to process millions of claims. While \nthis public-private partnership forms the linchpin of the Medicare \nprogram, it is not as strong as it could be.\n  Health care providers rightfully complain that Medicare has become \ntoo complex, with changes to claims payment systems made so frequently \nthat they can not keep up. Today, Medicare providers are subjected to \nover 100,000 pages of regulations that are continuously being modified. \nMany providers complain that they have less time to spend on patient \ncare because they are spending more time trying to understand how to \ncomply with massive amounts of paperwork and constantly evolving \nregulatory requirements.\n  The current Medicare appeals process is also problematic. It takes \nfar too long to appeal an incorrect Medicare decision, often taking \nseveral years to complete. This system, coupled with some of the \ntactics used by the Federal Government and its contractors in \ncollecting Medicare overpayments, leaves providers feeling frustrated, \nconfused, and besieged. Regulations necessary to ensuring the integrity \nand efficiency of the Medicare program must be maintained and enforced, \nhowever, the occasionally aggressive means through which these \nregulations are administered has discouraged many providers from \nwanting to participate in the Medicare program.\n  The Medicare Appeals, Regulatory and Contracting Improvement Act, \nMARCIA, will strengthen the Medicare public-private partnership. The \nbill has five primary components. First, it relieves burdens on \nbeneficiaries and providers by requiring the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services, CMS, to issue new rules and policies in an orderly \nand reasonable manner. Second, it provides new appeals protections for \nall Medicare fee-for-service providers and beneficiaries. Third, it \nallows CMS to use competition to select the best available \nadministrative contractors to serve beneficiaries and providers. \nFourth, it requires Medicare contractors and CMS to place a greater \nemphasis on provider education and outreach. Finally, it makes the \nMedicare overpayment collection and extrapolation process more fair. \nThe bill accomplishes all of these objectives without undermining the \nFalse Claims Act or other Medicare fraud recovery efforts, and I urge \nmy colleagues to join with me to secure its passage.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, right now, all across America, \nMedicare beneficiaries are seeking medical care from a flawed health \ncare system. Reduced benefit packages, ever escalating costs, and \nlimited access in rural areas are just a few of the problems our system \nfaces on a daily basis. For these reasons, Congress must continue to \nmove towards the modernization of Medicare. But as we address the needs \nof beneficiaries, we must not turn our back upon the very providers \nthat seniors rely upon for their care.\n  Who are providers? They are the physicians, the hospitals, the \nnursing homes, and others who deliver quality care to our needy \nMedicare population. They are the backbone of our complex health care \nnetwork. When our Nation's seniors need care, it is the provider who \nheals, not the health insurer--and certainly not the federal \ngovernment.\n  But more, and more often, seniors are being told by providers that \nthey don't accept Medicare. This is becoming even more common in rural \nareas, where the number of physicians is limited and access to quality \ncare is extremely restricted. Quite simply, beneficiaries are being \ntold that their insurance is simply not wanted. Why? Well it's not as \nsimple as low reimbursement rates. In fact it's much more complex.\n  The infrastructure that manages the Medicare program, the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, and its network of contractors, \nare working with a system that was designed to block care and micro-\nmanage independent practices. Providers simply cannot afford to keep up \nwith the seemingly endless number of complex, redundant, and \nunnecessary regulations. And if providers do participate? Well, a \nsimple administrative error in submitting a claim could subject them to \nheavy-handed audits and the financial devastation of their practice. \nShould we force providers to choose between protecting their practice \nand caring for seniors?\n  I believe the answer is no. For this reason, I am pleased to \nintroduce the ``Medicare Appeals, Regulatory and Contracting \nImprovements Act of 2001.'' I am joined by my colleagues Senator Kerry, \nSenator Baucus, and Senator Grassley. This legislation is a bipartisan \ncompromise, based upon legislation I offered earlier this year. It will \nallow providers to practice medicine without fearing the threats, \nintimidation, and aggressive tactics of a faceless bureaucratic \nmachine.\n  Most importantly, this bill will reform the flawed appeals process \nwithin CMS. Currently, a provider who allegedly has received an \noverpayment is forced to choose between three options: admit the \noverpayment, submit additional information to mitigate the charge, or \nappeal the decision. However, providers who choose to submit additional \nevidence must subject their entire practice to review and waive their \nappeal rights. That's right, to submit additional evidence you must \nwaive your right to an appeal!\n  And what is the result of this maddening system that runs contrary to \nour Nation's history of fair and just administrative decisions? Often, \nproviders are intimidated into accepting the arbitrary decision of an \nauditor employed by a CMS contractor. Sometimes, they are even forced \nto pull out of the Medicare program. In the end, our senior population \nsuffers.\n  To bring additional fairness to the system, the bill provides new \nappeal protections for all Medicare fee-for-service providers and \nbeneficiaries. It also requires the Medicare administrative contractors \nand CMS to place a greater emphasis on provider education and outreach. \nAnd most importantly, it reforms the Medicare overpayment collection \nand extrapolation process. All of this is accomplished without \nundermining the False Claims Act or current Medicare fraud enforcement \nefforts.\n  It is with the goal of protecting our Medicare population, and the \nproviders who tend care, that leads us to introduce this bipartisan \ncompromise. This bill will ensure that providers are treated with the \nrespect that they deserve, and that Medicare beneficiaries aren't told \nthat their health insurance isn't wanted. We owe it to our nation's \nseniors. I urge immediate action on this worthy bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the \nMedicare Appeals, Regulatory and Contracting Improvements Act of 2001.\n  Medicare is one of the Federal Government's greatest successes. It \nprovides health care for nearly 40 million seniors and disabled \nbeneficiaries. Medicare is often considered the gold-standard of health \ninsurance programs around the nation and the world. And it has lifted \nmillions of individuals out of poverty since its enactment in 1965.\n  Medicare's success is due to its public-private partnership, which is \nthe\n\n[[Page S12107]]\n\nfoundation of the program. While Medicare is almost entirely federally \nfinanced, it relies on thousands of private hospitals, private \nphysicians, and other health care providers and suppliers to deliver \nhealth care services. Moreover, it relies on more than 50 private \nhealth insurance companies to process millions of claims every year.\n  Every so often Congress needs to evaluate this public-private \npartnership to see how its working. And this past year, Senator Kerry, \nSenator Murkowski, Senator Grassley, and I have undertaken this \nevaluation.\n  I have heard from hundreds of health care providers who have levied \nlegitimate complaints about the operation of Medicare. They argue that \nMedicare has become too complex. Changes to the claims payment systems \nare made every day, and health care organization simply cannot keep up. \nThis is especially true for small rural hospitals and other health care \nproviders in my state of Montana. They do not have the staff to stay \nabreast of the constant changes to the Medicare payment systems.\n  I have also heard from providers about the current Medicare appeals \nprocess. The Medicare appeals process is broken. It takes too long to \nappeal an incorrect Medicare decision. Providers often have to file \nlengthy and expensive appeals, sometimes taking several years to \nsettle.\n  And finally, I have heard from health care providers about the \naggressive tactics that are sometimes used by Federal Government and \nits contractors in collecting Medicare overpayments. Medicare needs to \nrealize that mistakes happen, especially with this very complex \nprogram. When providers make honest mistakes, they should be treated as \nmistakes, not criminal fraud.\n  Earlier this year, my colleagues Senators Kerry and Murkowski \nintroduced a version of this bill, the ``Medicare Education and \nRegulatory Fairness Act of 2001.'' I commend Senators Kerry and \nMurkowski for their hard work on this bill; it made a very important \ncontribution to our understanding of this issue and the need for \nreform. However, I had some concerns with their original bill, namely \nthat it unintentionally created some new loopholes for truly dishonest \nproviders to commit fraud.\n  Rather than oppose their bill, I asked my staff along with Senator \nGrassley's staff to work with Senator Kerry and Senator Murkowki's \noffice to redraft their bill to address some of my concerns. And I am \nproud to say that we have developed a bill that everyone can support.\n  The Medicare Appeals, Regulatory and Contracting Improvements Act of \n2001 will make necessary and overdue improvements to the Medicare \npublic-private partnership. The bill does five things. First, it \nimproves the CMS rule-making process, for example, by requiring CMS to \npublish its regulations on one business day of each month. Second, It \nprovides new appeal protections for all Medicare fee-for-service \nproviders and beneficiaries. Third, it grants new competitive \nadministrative contracting authority to CMS. Fourth, it requires the \nMedicare administrative contractors and CMS to place a greater emphasis \non provider education and outreach. And fifth, it reforms the Medicare \noverpayment collection and extrapolation process.\n  The bill accomplishes all five of these important objectives without \nundermining the False Claims Act of current Medicare fraud enforcement \nefforts. We have received assurances from the Department of Justice, \nthe HHS Office of Inspector General, and the CMS that this is so.\n  This is a good bill, a bill that will receive the support of provider \ngroups and the support of the Federal agencies that oversee the \nMedicare program.\n  While this bill is primarily focused on health care provider issues, \nI agree with my colleagues in the Senate and House that Congress also \nneeds to ensure that beneficiaries are able to navigate and understand \nMedicare. I commend current efforts in the House to include provisions \nthat would guarantee that beneficiaries have the right to find out \nwhether Medicare services are covered before they become financially \nliable for them. Currently, when a doctor informs a patient that a \nservice may not be covered by Medicare, the patient has no way to \nverify if this is the case. I will work to include these provisions in \nany enacted legislation.\n  I commend my colleagues Senator Kerry, Senator Murkowski, and Senator \nGrassley for their commitment and their hard work on this bill. As \nchairman of the Finance Committee, I remain committed to quick \nconsideration of this bill in my committee. I urge all of my colleagues \nto support it.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I am pleased to join today as an original \ncosponsor of the Medicare Appeals, Regulatory and Contracting \nImprovements Act, MARCIA. This legislation represents a clear and \nuseful first step toward serious reform of the way Medicare does \nbusiness with America's health care professionals and Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  I have heard from literally hundreds of doctors, hospitals, and other \nhealth care professionals in Idaho about the truly appalling paperwork \nand regulatory burdens imposed by the Medicare program, and even more \ntroubling, about how these mounting regulatory burdens are causing many \ndoctors to limit their participation in Medicare or to leave the \nprogram altogether.\n  Also, as ranking member on the Senate's Special Committee on Aging, I \nhave made examination of Medicare's paperwork and provider enforcement \nsystems a key priority. In July, our committee held the first of what I \nhope may be a series of hearings looking into these problems, and this \nfall, members of my Aging Committee staff traveled across Idaho, \ntalking with more than 60 Idaho providers about their concerns with \nMedicare.\n  Most recently, I was pleased to have Tom Scully, the energetic and \nthoughtful new administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices, CMS, join me in Boise to talk about Medicare with Idaho \nhealth professionals and senior citizens. We heard a great deal of \nfrustration, and not a little anger.\n  At the same time, it was very clear to me that Tom Scully and the \nBush administration are serious about tackling Medicare's many \nshortcomings. Indeed, Tom Scully and the administration have worked \nclosely with Congress to help develop the legislation we are \nintroducing today.\n  Today, the number of pages of Medicare rules and regulations is \nnow more than 110,000, approximately three times that of Federal tax \nlaws and regulations. Moreover, for every hour spent on Medicare \npatient care in outpatient settings, doctors and their staffs now spend \napproximately 36 minutes on Medicare-related paperwork. And in hospital \nemergency care settings, that ratio is now 1 hour of paperwork for \nevery 1 hour of patient care.\n\n  These problems are genuinely daunting, and today's legislation is not \na panacea. Rather, it is a promising beginning in what I hope will be \nan ongoing cooperative effort to make Medicare more responsive, more \nrational, and more efficient.\n  Finally, let me be crystal clear: We must continue to devote \nsignificant resources to combating fraud and abuse in the Medicare \nprogram. Those who violate the public trust must be punished to the \nfullest extent of the law, and this legislation would in no way \nundercut these critical efforts.\n  Rather, this bill would relieve complex and unreasonable burdens on \nproviders and beneficiaries by requiring CMS to issue new rules in an \norderly and reasonable manner, and would provide new appeal protections \nfor many Medicare providers and beneficiaries. Further, this \nlegislation would require CMS to use competition to select the best \nadministrative contractors, and it would require CMS and its \ncontractors to place greater emphasis on provider education and \noutreach. In addition, the bill would implement needed improvements in \nthe way Medicare oversees alleged provider overpayments, principally by \nreforming current Medicare overpayment collection and extrapolation \nprocesses.\n  I am pleased to join my colleagues in sponsoring this much needed \nlegislation, and I look forward to continuing progress on these \nimportant issues in the coming year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CLELAND:\n  S. 1739. A bill to authorize grants to improve security on over-the-\nroad buses; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Madam President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nhelp\n\n[[Page S12108]]\n\nsecure an often overlooked mode of passenger transportation, intercity \nbuses.\n  In the wake of the current challenge to our Nation's security, it is \nthe duty of Congress to ensure that all modes of passenger \ntransportation, especially mass transportation vehicles including \nbuses, are safe and secure. Already, buses have been assaulted, and \ninnocent passengers have died. While these attacks have not so far been \ndirectly linked to the tragic events of September 11, I believe \nCongress would be negligent if we do not act on this issue while we \nhave this opportunity. Additionally, in many cities, bus terminals \nshare facilities with rail and/or air terminals. The Congress has \naddressed airport security and the Senate is working on rail security, \nbut this work will not be complete without securing the third \ncomponent. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support my legislation to \naccomplish this goal.\n  Clearly, bus service, which transports almost 800 million passengers \nannually, deserves Congress's attention. For many people throughout the \ncountry, motorcoaches are the only viable means of transportation. \nGreyhound, the largest carrier, and its interline partners serve over \n4,000 communities, roughly 8 times more than either the airlines or \nAmtrak. Many of the other bus companies that serve these communities \nare small businesses with fewer than ten motorcoaches, and these \nbusinesses, in particular, are more affected by the decrease in \npassenger demand due to concerns over safety. While many of these \ncompanies have already spent their own funds to upgrade security, they \nneed help to finish the job so that people will feel comfortable \nreturning to bus travel.\n  One of the main elements of my legislation provides grants for the \ninstallation of adequate communications equipment to alert law \nenforcement personnel if there is an onboard problem. Not only would an \nalarm be sounded to law enforcement but also current technology would \nbe employed to report the precise location of the bus in question. \nSpeedy deployment to deal with problems as they are happening could \nsave lives. The Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance, CVSA, an \nassociation of State, provincial and Federal law enforcement officials, \nbelieves that improved communication capability is among the top goals \nto improve the safety and security of passenger buses.\n  The legislation also will provide grants for research into methods to \nprotect the drivers. Some of the recent security incidents involve \ncompromising the safety of the driver. We must find out what options \nare available to protect and secure the drivers so that a bus can be \nstopped safely if there are problems. Additionally, these grants can be \nused to maintain the integrity of bus terminals, facilities, and \ncoaches, and conduct passenger screening, among other things.\n  This legislation also dedicates $3-5 million annually in funding to \nthe Secretary of Transportation to evaluate and coordinate current \npublic and private efforts to improve bus security and safety by \nestablishing ``best practices,'' including efforts to isolate the \ndriver and to detect potential chemical and biological elements. \nPortions of this funding could also be used to support additional \nresearch and development initiatives, and the recommendations developed \ncould be applied to both over-the-road and transit buses.\n  This funding is not a government ``handout'' to an industry that has \nnot been acting on its own to improve its facilities, but rather it \nwill supplement ongoing efforts. Since September 11, Greyhound has \nspent at least $5 million on enhanced security. Steps taken include \nscreening of passengers and baggage at selected terminals; requiring \nticket identification; providing cell phones to drivers as an interim \nemergency communications system; increasing security personnel in \nterminals; prohibiting passengers from sitting in the first row of \nseats behind the driver, and establishing information and \ncommunications systems to aid and coordinate with law enforcement. My \nlegislation would supplement and expand these initial efforts and \nassist with implementing these measures at additional terminals.\n  My legislation also provides needed assistance to an industry that is \nstruggling along with other segments of the travel and tourism sector. \nAfter the October 3 Nashville accident that resulted in 7 passenger \nfatalities, Greyhound's passenger sales dropped 15 percent and remain \nwell below last year's levels. According to a survey conducted by the \nTravel Business Roundtable, intercity bus transportation is the only \nmode of transportation that dropped in ``safety perception'' when \ncompared with air, auto, rail, and cruise travel. Incorporating the new \nsecurity costs, which are necessary to bring passengers back, while \nrevenue is down, will make it difficult for bus companies to maintain \ncurrent service levels. This Federal support will allow bus companies \nto dedicate resources to continuing service to smaller communities \nrather than reducing schedules to cut costs.\n  Additionally, this legislation instructs the Department of Labor to \nensure that grants under this section are certified in an expeditious \nmanner in accordance with its guidelines for processing grants to bus \noperators. As provided for under the Department's existing guidelines, \npreviously certified arrangements for assistance to intercity bus \noperators applicable to applicants for security improvement grants, \nshall be the basis for processing such grants by the Department. The \nSecretary of Transportation will have the discretion to administer this \nprogram directly or through a security administration that may be \nestablished at the Department of Transportation.\n  This bus security legislation is supported by the American Bus \nAssociation, Greyhound, the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance, Coach \nUSA, and the Amalgamated Transit Union. Protecting bus passengers is a \nvital part of ensuring a vibrant transportation industry, and it is the \nthird component to the safe passenger transportation equation. I urge \nmy Senate colleagues, all of whom have many communities in your state \nserved by intercity buses, to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1739\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The bill is identical to \n     the original bill, S. 535, and makes a simple but extremely \n     important technical change to the ``Breast and Cervical \n     Cancer Treatment and Prevention Act'' (P.L. 106-354) to \n     ensure the coverage of breast and cervical cancer treatment \n     for American Indian and Alaska Native women.\n\n\n                          Need for Legislation\n\n       The ``Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment and Prevention \n     Act,'' which passed the Senate by unanimous consent and had \n     76 cosponsors, gives states the option to extend coverage to \n     certain women who have been screened by programs operated \n     under Title XV of the Public Health Service Act (the National \n     Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection program) and who \n     have no ``creditable coverage.'' The term ``creditable \n     coverage'' was established by the Health Insurance \n     Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPPA). Under the \n     HIPPA definition, creditable coverage includes a reference to \n     the medical care program of the Indian Health Service (IHS). \n     In short, the reference to ``creditable coverage'' in the law \n     effectively excludes Indian women from receiving Medicaid \n     breast and cervical cancer treatment as provided for under \n     this Act.\n       The Indian health reference to IHS/tribal care was \n     originally included in HIPPA so that members of Indian Tribes \n     eligible for IHS would not be treated as having a break in \n     coverage (and thus subject to pre-existing exclusions and \n     waiting periods when seeking health insurance) simply because \n     they had received care through Indian health programs, rather \n     than through a conventional health insurance program. Thus, \n     in the HIPPA context, the inclusion of the IHS/tribal \n     provision was intended to benefit American Indians and Alaska \n     Natives, not penalize them.\n       However, use of the HIPPA definition in the recent ``Breast \n     and Cervical Cancer Treatment and Prevention Act'' has the \n     exact opposite effect. In fact, the many Indian women, who \n     rely on IHS/tribal programs for basic health care, are \n     excluded from the new law's eligibility for Medicaid. Not \n     only does the definition deny coverage to Indian women, but \n     the provision runs counter to the general Medicaid rule \n     treating IHS facilities as full Medicaid providers.\n       The legislation would resolve these problems by clarifying \n     that, for purposes of the ``Breast and Cervical Cancer \n     Prevention and Treatment Act,'' the term ``creditable \n     coverage'' shall not include IHS-funded care so that American \n     Indian and Alaska Native women can be covered by Medicaid for \n     breast and cervical cancer treatment. Since a number of \n     states are currently moving forward to provide Medicaid \n     coverage under the state option, the need for this \n     legislation is immediate to ensure that American Indian and \n     Alaska Native women are not denied from receiving life-saving \n     breast and cervical cancer treatment.\n\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/28/senate-section/article/S12110-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S12110]]\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 86--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT \n WOMEN FROM ALL ETHNIC GROUPS IN AFGHANISTAN SHOULD PARTICIPATE IN THE \n          ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL RECONSTRUCTION OF AFGHANISTAN\n\n  Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. McCain, Mrs. Clinton, Ms. \nSnowe, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. Hutchison, and Mrs. Boxer) \nsubmitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 86\n\n       Whereas until 1996 women in Afghanistan enjoyed the right \n     to be educated, work, vote, and hold elective office;\n       Whereas women served on the committee that drafted the \n     Constitution of Afghanistan in 1964;\n       Whereas during the 1970s women were appointed to the Afghan \n     ministries of education, health, and law;\n       Whereas in 1977 women comprised more than 15 percent of the \n     Loya Jirga, the Afghan national legislative assembly;\n       Whereas during the war with the Soviet Union as many as 70 \n     percent of the teachers, nurses, doctors, and small business \n     owners in Afghanistan were women;\n       Whereas in 1996 the Taliban stripped the women of \n     Afghanistan of their most basic human and political rights;\n       Whereas under Taliban rule women have become one of the \n     most vulnerable groups in Afghanistan, accounting for 75 \n     percent or more of all Afghan refugees;\n       Whereas a study conducted by Physicians for Human Rights \n     and released in May 2001 indicates that more than 90 percent \n     of Afghan men and women believe that women should have the \n     right to receive an education, work, freely express \n     themselves, enjoy legal protections, and participate in the \n     government; and\n       Whereas restoring the human and political rights that were \n     once enjoyed by Afghan women is essential to the long-term \n     stability of a reconstructed Afghanistan: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) a portion of the humanitarian assistance provided to \n     Afghanistan should be targeted to Afghan women and their \n     organizations;\n       (2) Afghan women from all ethnic groups in Afghanistan \n     should be permitted to participate in the economic and \n     political reconstruction of Afghanistan; and\n       (3) any constitution or legal structure of a reconstructed \n     Afghanistan should guarantee the human and political rights \n     of Afghan women.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I rise today, along with my colleagues \nSenators Kerry, McCain, Clinton, Cantwell, Snowe, Mikulski, Boxer, and \nHutchison to submit a resolution expressing the sense of Senate that \nwomen from all ethnic groups should participate in the economic and \npolitical reconstruction of Afghanistan. This is an issue we feel \nstrongly about, and it is my hope that the Senate will soon take up \nthis important issue. Let me also thank Congresswoman Connie Morella \nfor her work on this matter and for introducing companion legislation \nin House.\n  As you know, since the Taliban seized control of Kabul in 1996, women \nand girls living under this regime have been subjected daily to an \narray of human rights violations, from lack of access to education and \nhealth care to outright violence. They have been denied equal \nprotection under the law, and have struggled to survive without the \nsame professional or financial opportunities afforded the men in their \ncountry.\n  Certainly, even before the rise of the Taliban, Afghanistan was in \nmany respects a country in crisis, facing drought, ethnic conflict, and \nuncertain leadership. It was the women and children of this troubled \ncountry that bore the brunt of this suffering. However, despite these \nmany hardships, the women of Afghanistan persevered, and played a large \nand meaningful role in Afghani society. Prior to the rule of the \nTaliban, women had the right to vote, served as cabinet ministers, \nenjoyed rich professional careers, and indeed constituted a majority of \ncountry's lawyers, doctors, teachers, and business owners. Women \nparticipated in every aspect of Afghani life, and were fully integrated \ninto its cultural, political, and economic fabric. However, since the \nTaliban regime came to power, conditions for women and children have \nworsened drastically. Stripped of their basic human rights and \nfreedoms, they have fought hard to provide for themselves and their \nfamilies, and to weather the many abuses suffered at the hands of the \noppressive fundamentalist regime. Many women studied and taught in \nsecret, determined to retain something of the life they knew before \nthey were forced to retreat behind the burka.\n  In response to this humanitarian crisis, United States policy in \nAfghanistan has been guided, in part, by overwhelming concerns about \nthese and other gross human rights violations. Now that we are in midst \nof military action against the Taliban in response to the horrific \nattacks on American civilians on September 11, we have the opportunity \nto help restore to the Afghani women the basic freedoms and \nopportunities which should be available to all citizens of the world. \nIn addition, I believe that long-term stability in Afghanistan is \ncontingent upon a full and expeditious renewal of these rights. The \npeople of Afghanistan, both men and women, believe overwhelmingly that \nthere is a place for Afghani women in Islamic society that affords them \nopportunities for meaningful professional and political roles in the \nrebuilding of their country. The reconstruction of Afghanistan, both \npolitically and culturally, will require the insight and dedication of \nall of the people of Afghanistan, and women must not be excluded from \nthis vital process. They must be included as equal partners as this \nnation begins to recover and rebuild.\n  In many ways September 11 has become a turning point for the United \nStates. It has been one of sorrow, and it has been a wake-up call that \nwe need to guard our rights and our way of life. But it also an \nopportunity for the yoke of oppression to be once and for all lifted \nfrom the Afghani people, particularly the women and children who have \nsuffered so much over the last decade. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/28/senate-section/article/S12110-2", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 184--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n       USE OF CONTENT LABELING FOR INTERNET WEB SITES OF SENATORS\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN (for herself, Mr. Allen, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Brownback, Ms. \nLandrieu, and Mr. Ensign) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                              S.
