Madam President, I rise today to talk about the tax \nrebate checks that started going in the mail this very week. In fact, I \nhave already talked to someone who has received a tax rebate. It made \nme feel so good to know that something we have worked so long to do and \nso hard to do is now beginning to reach the American people.\n  I think it is a very timely opportunity for the American people to \nhave\n\n[[Page S8148]]\n\na little extra money in their pocketbooks, to be able to do some of the \nthings that maybe they weren't going to be able to do, and also, \nhopefully, to help spur this economy that is certainly in a stagnant \nphase.\n  We are very excited that July 23 is the week that the first set of \nchecks go out. They will be going out between now and the end of \nSeptember. And everyone who paid taxes last year will receive a rebate. \nIf you paid taxes and you are a single person, you will receive $300. \nIf you paid $300, you will receive $300 back. If you are a single \nperson who is the head of a household--a single mom or dad--you will \nreceive $500 in the mail. If you are a married couple, you will receive \n$600 in the mail if you paid taxes and if you filed your taxes for \n2000. Starting July 23, those checks will be in the mail during the \ncourse of the next 2 months.\n  Now, we are very hopeful that people will be able to take this money \nand do something that they might not have been able to do otherwise. It \nmight be just helping buy the children back-to-school supplies or \nclothes or shoes; it might be a little added something for a vacation--\nif you are getting your check in time for vacation, or maybe you are \nplanning on doing it. It could be investing for your pension. It could \nbe that little added bonus of $300 or $600 that you would put into \nretirement. Whatever a person does with their money will help the \neconomy because it will be an investment--an investment in something \nfor use today or an investment in something for use over the next few \nyears. All of that will be helpful. We are looking at layoffs being \nadvertised in the newspaper now, so people are needing that little \nextra boost in many ways.\n  I think it is just a great opportunity to say that we do have a \nsurplus in our Government. We are doing the job that we were elected to \ndo in a responsible way by covering the expenses that we know we must \ncover--expenses such as a strong national defense, expenses for \nMedicare and Social Security, expenses for the welfare needs for our \ncountry. A lot of money is going into education. We are increasing \neducation spending by 14 percent.\n  But there is still money left over because we have been careful with \nour taxpayer dollars, and we thought that the people should share in \nthat surplus. They created that surplus and they should share in it. \nThey pay for it. The taxpayers of our country fund the Government, and \nwhen we are efficient, we think the taxpayers who pay the bills should \nget the return.\n  We are very proud of the fact that the checks are starting to come in \nthe mail today and people will start seeing they have money coming.\n  I am proud all of us in Congress have come together to do this, and I \nam very pleased this rebate is just the beginning. In fact, we are \ngoing to see rate cuts. Many people who have taxes withheld will see \ntheir withholding has gone down 1 percent. So less is being taken out \nof their paycheck. They will be paying fewer taxes next year and every \nyear for the next 10 years.\n  Over the next 10 years, we will gradually decrease the marriage tax \npenalty. This is a tax that hits married couples where there are two \nworking spouses and they pay more in taxes because of a quirk in the \nTax Code, and we are eliminating that quirk or at least we are \nwhittling it away. We have not totally eliminated it, but hopefully we \nwill get to do that someday as well.\n  We are lowering the marriage tax penalty. We are going to eliminate \nthe death tax, a tax that I think is the wrong approach. If one is \nseeking the American dream, we want them to keep the money they earn \nand we want them to be able to pass it to their children if they choose \nto do that. We certainly do not think Uncle Sam should tax a person's \ndeath, and we especially do not want people to have to sell assets--\nsmall business assets or property--in order to pay the death tax.\n  There is more coming. The downpayment is in the mail today, and we \nare very proud to be able to talk about it.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor to the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, my sincere thanks to my colleague from \nTexas for giving us that fine overview of what is happening this week. \nI am very happy to report I had the pleasure last Friday of joining my \ncolleague from Kansas, Senator Brownback, and several Members of the \nHouse, in a trip to Kansas City, MO, with the Vice President and the \nSecretary of the Treasury, Paul O'Neill.\n  We went out to see a fascinating operation, not well-known, the \nFederal Financial Management Service branch of the Treasury in Clay \nCounty, North Kansas City. There the men and women who work for the \nTreasury Department's FMS are turning out 1.2 million checks a day. \nThey print the checks, they put them in envelopes, they sort them by \nZIP Code, and they are ready to go out the door. They do the whole \nprocess there. There are 1.2 million checks a day going out.\n  I do not happen to have the lowest last two digits in my Social \nSecurity number, so mine will not be coming for several weeks, but it \nwas thrilling to see a promise made and a promise kept.\n  That is one of the things the Vice President talked about, and the \nPresident joined us by videotape to emphasize the fact that last year \nhe said we needed a tax reduction, and he delivered. He delivered with \nhelp from a Republican Congress, and we also thank those on the other \nside of the aisle who joined with us to make it a bipartisan push to \nget the bill passed ultimately, and three Members from the other side \nof the aisle who stayed with us on the very difficult votes to make \nsure we did not lose any more from the amount promised by the \nPresident.\n  The President signed the Economic Growth and Tax Relief \nReconciliation Act of 2001 on June 7, and we are seeing literally the \nchecks in the mail. It is a change from the old laugh lines from the \nFederal Government: I am here to help you, and the check is in the \nmail. This time we are from the Federal Government, the checks are in \nthe mail, but we are returning your money. This is not somebody else's \nmoney you are getting.\n  This act provides the largest tax cut to the American people since \n1981, and not a moment too soon given the economic slump we are \ncurrently enduring.\n  There has been a lot of talk about how maybe, with the economy \nslowing down, we cannot afford a tax cut. Let me tell my colleagues and \nanyone else who is interested that whether you are a supply-sider or a \nKeynesian, there is no better time for tax relief to get the economy \nmoving by leaving money in the hands of those who earned it and \nallowing them to spend it and invest it. My colleague from Texas told \nus about the many different uses these tax rebates can be put to, but \nputting that money back in the hands of the hard-working Americans who \nearned it is the very best thing we can do to get the economy growing \nagain.\n\n  We saw what happened when the Republican Congress pushed through a \ncapital gains reduction about 4 or 5 years ago. No. 1, despite the \ngloomy predictions of many old-line liberal economists, receipts to the \nFederal Government did not go down. In fact, they went up because more \npeople unlocked the investments they had locked away with large capital \ngains built up and they sold those assets, generating revenue for the \nFederal Government. More important, they invested in the economy, in \nthe information technology that kept the economy growing through much \nof the remainder of the 1990s.\n  Alan Greenspan, who is no wild-side, born-again, anti-government \nconservative, had been preaching to us on the Budget Committee, the \nBanking Committee, and anybody who would listen to him that we needed \nto start reducing the debt.\n  With the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994, we did force \nthrough a balanced budget. We did bring spending under control. We are \nstarting to bring the debt down. We have provided the incentive for the \neconomy to grow with a capital gains tax reduction, and we generated \nmore revenue with that tax reduction.\n  Late last fall, when Alan Greenspan came before us, he said: The time \nhas come to start giving money back to those who earned it. Tax rates \nare too high. We need to continue to move to reduce the debt, but we \nhave threatened to build up such a surplus, because of the excessive \ntaxation imposed on this economy in 1993, that we are going to be in a \nposition where we will put a stranglehold on the economy and \npotentially have the Federal Government buying up private assets, i.e.,\n\n[[Page S8149]]\n\nnationalism or socialism, if we do not start leaving more money in the \npockets of hard-working Americans. So we began the process promised by \nPresident Bush of reducing taxes.\n  It turns out that not the recession officially but the downturn that \nwas forecast by the stock market in March of last year, and which \nreally began to take effect this quarter a year ago, which really \naccelerated during the winter, was getting worse, and the tax relief \nthat President Bush promised was not only a matter of fairness for \nAmerican taxpayers but it was a vitally needed boost for the economy.\n  When there is an economic downturn, the worst thing that can be done \nis to raise taxes. Herbert Hoover had a depression named after him \nbecause when he saw the economy turn down, he said: We have to maintain \nthe surplus. So he jacked up taxes and tariffs, and he led the United \nStates to take the world down into a worldwide depression.\n  I hope we have learned. I hope we have learned we can tell those \nnaysayers who say, oh, my gosh, we have an economic downturn so we have \nto raise taxes, that is the dumbest thing we can do. There is very \nrarely a time when we will see fiscal policy being an accurate, \neffective countercyclical measure.\n  This is the time to put money back in the pockets of hard-working \nAmericans who have earned it. I am very proud to have been one to \nsupport that tax cut all the way.\n\n  The rebate checks are going out, the child tax credit will increase, \nthe marriage penalty will be reduced, educational savings improvements \nwill be made. For Missouri small businesses, the devastating impact of \nthe death tax will be reduced, and there will be incentives for helping \npeople fund their retirement.\n  There is more to be done. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to assure that permanent tax relief, that this measure is \nmade permanent, and that we have a more fair, simpler, and flatter Tax \nCode. We are working to fulfill the promise that President Bush made. I \nam proud to have been part of it. I look forward to continuing to work \non that team.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from Missouri for talking about \nhis trip with the Vice President, and once again emphasizing a promise \nmade is a promise kept. I thank the Senator from Missouri.\n  I yield up to 5 minutes to the Senator from Idaho.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Texas for \nbringing this issue to the floor this morning and allowing time to talk \nabout what is going on in the mailboxes of Americans today. The rebate \nchecks are coming home.\n  A week and a half ago I was in Idaho walking across a street in a \nsmall town. A lady yelled across the street at me: When am I getting my \ncheck?\n  True story. It happened. I said: They will be mailed out in a week \nand a half. What are you going to do with your check?\n  She says: I have four kids and we are going to Wal-Mart to buy school \nclothes.\n  That is the message that is coming home to America today. President \nBush recognized that hard-working Americans were being taxed at the \nhighest level ever in our country's history. He worked with us, we \nsupported him, and as a result, when someone says today ``the check is \nin the mail,'' literally it is happening.\n  This week, America's taxpayers began to receive the rebate check we \npromised them, that President Bush promised them, that began to pull \ndown the surplus and keep money out of the hands of Government and \nreturn tax dollars to the hard-working American families who sent them \nhere in the first place.\n  In Idaho households, over 380,000 checks will arrive between now and \nSeptember 24. That represents $167 million to Idaho. That is a lot of \nmoney in our State. We are a small State. We have 1.2 million citizens. \nThat is going to have a phenomenal impact on the Idaho economy. \nNationally, that is 91.6 million taxpayers and about $39 billion.\n\n  This time, I am proud of what we have done as a Congress. Congress \ndid it right. Tax relief is reaching the people at the right time. It \nwill boost their confidence in the economy and their Government. I \nthink it will restore a little financial freedom when they need it. I \nthink you must always recognize with hard-working families, mom and dad \nboth working, if they have children, and of course they want children, \nthat is a very important but very real expense.\n  Just like that lady in Blackfoot the other day who said, ``I'm going \nto Wal-Mart and buy clothes for my kids,'' Americans will spend it; \nthey will save it. I don't care about all the great speculation and \ndebate that Americans are not going to save it and it isn't going to \nhelp the economy. Speculators, frankly, I don't care. It is the \ncitizens' money that is being returned to them and they will do a \nlittle bit of both with it. I think it is important we recognize once \nthe money is in the hands of the American working family, politicians \ncan't direct it or, more importantly, misdirect it.\n  The moms will go to Wal-Mart and buy clothes for their kids. It may \npick up a good number of tankfuls of gas. It may well put food on the \ntable or it might go into someone's savings account. That is what it is \nall about.\n  I heard some critics try to disparage or make fun of the rebate, \nsaying it is only $300 or $500 or $600. To some families, getting a \n$600 check in the mail can make all the difference in the world about \nsome of the choices they will make this late summer or fall. It may \nwell be the price they pay for a little additional vacation they had \ncut short because of the energy bills and the higher gas prices that \nthey were going to be paying this year. That is what a tax rebate is \nall about. Anyone who ridicules the rebate, my guess is they have lost \ntouch with the American people and the hard-working men and women who \nget up every day and go to work and spend 8 or 10 or 12 hours at work \nand pay their taxes because they think that is the way good Americans \nought to function. Many do it, and thank goodness they do it. Now we \nare able to reward them just a little bit.\n  My advice to the naysayer: If you don't need the rebate, give it back \nto the Treasury. Give it to a charity. Do something with it other than \nspend it on your family or save it because it is your money and we have \nguaranteed you the freedom to make that choice.\n  By the way, the Treasury Department has always had a fund to receive \ncontributions. So those who do not like the tax cut, give it back. \nThose who find it valuable, spend it and enjoy it. It is your money. \nThe check is in the mail.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from Idaho. I appreciate all the \nwork he has done to make this tax relief package a reality. He has been \nworking on it for a long time. He is one of our leaders and we \nappreciate his keeping the promises he made to the people of Idaho in \nhelping every American have a little more money in the next 2 months to \nspend on the needs that he described, such as the mom of four children \ngoing to Wal-Mart to buy the clothes for her children to start school.\n  Now, Madam President, I yield up to 5 minutes to Senator Thomas from \nWyoming.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I thank my friend, the Senator from \nTexas, for this time.\n  It is important we talk a little bit about some of the things that \nhave been done and the impact we will see immediately. This is unique. \nI cannot recall it ever happening this way before, where there were \nexcessive dollars available that came in, and more taxes than were \nnecessary to carry out the essential elements of Government. There was \na need for an economic boost and there is. So we took this opportunity \nto return some of this excess money to the people who have paid it.\n  That is a basic issue and one we deal with quite often. That is a \ndifference of philosophy in terms of how we handle money. Obviously, \neveryone agrees there has to be a sufficient amount of money to take \ncare of the necessary functioning of Government, although there is a \ndifference in view of what the\n\n[[Page S8150]]\n\nfunctions would be. There is also a philosophical difference among \nthose who would say we have money, so let's increase the role of \nGovernment; let's spend more and have more programs. Others say, wait a \nminute, let's try to keep the role of Government limited and return \nthis excess money to the people who paid it. That is what this is.\n  It is a very basic issue, one that is philosophical but it is the \nright thing to do.\n  I hear this business, from time to time, about millionaires are going \nto get $300 a day. How many people do you think, of all the taxpayers \nwho are going to get a check in the mail, are millionaires? The people \nI have seen are not millionaires, the people who are going to get some \nof the money they paid. All taxpayers who have paid their dollars will \nreap some benefits from this distribution.\n  That is what it is all about. Further, I think it is necessary at the \nsame time to recognize that on June 7 of this year, this Republican \nCongress and the White House kept a commitment to the American people \nand delivered the most significant tax relief in 20 years. Not only \nwill we have this distribution, of course, which is designed to give \nsome immediate impact to it, both for the taxpayers themselves and for \nthe economy--$300 for single filers, $500 for single moms, $600 for \nfamilies, and that is very important--but following that, of course, is \na new tax law that goes a long way to restore fairness in the Tax Code.\n  It reduces the marriage penalty, which my friend from Texas was \nobviously almost the singular leader in causing that to happen, and we \nappreciate it, the death tax, doubles the child credit and child care \nenhancements. We need to recognize that over a period of time we are \ngoing to do a great deal to increase fairness and return dollars via \nthe Tax Code, although that doesn't happen for several years. That is \nwhy this is very important, this immediate impact. I think it is one of \nthe greatest things that can happen. And, in addition, it should \nhappen.\n  We now hear people talking about raising taxes, for heavens' sake, \nwhen we are facing difficulties in the economy. When we find ourselves \nwith real surpluses, to talk about raising taxes --give me a break. I \ncannot imagine anything more unlikely to happen than that.\n  I think we should feel very good about what has happened. I am \nhopeful all these checks will be out very soon. They are now in the \nmail. Beyond this, I want to emphasize again we have had a significant \nchange in the tax culture and the Tax Code over time. This is the most \nimportant thing. I am happy to have had a chance to participate in it \nand recognize it today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for \nworking on this ever since he has been in the Senate, for being \ncommitted to tax relief for every hard-working American, and for being \none of our leaders, speaking out on this issue and talking about how \nimportant it is that we not only give tax relief right now, but also \nhopefully will have another tax relief package in the near future. We \nwant to have all the surplus used wisely. That means part of it should \ngo back to the taxpayers who have worked so hard to earn it.\n  I am pleased to yield the remainder of our time to the Senator from \nPennsylvania, Mr. Santorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 3 \nminutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Texas and the \nSenator from Wyoming for being here this morning to talk about what I \nthink is one of the most important issues we can talk about in the \nSenate, and that is what we are going to do to strengthen our economy. \nWhy is it I put it in that context? The right medicine at this time is \nto put more resources into the economy to get this rather flat-line \neconomy right now jump started.\n  Over the past year now, we have been going through a fairly \nsubstantial economic slowdown. The right medicine is exactly what the \nCongress did. We worked very hard with the President of the United \nStates to pass a tax relief measure that got an infusion of money out \ninto the public just in the nick of time, I hope--I hope just in the \nnick of time to help get this economy up and going and churning again. \nChecks are in the mail and being received by people all across America \nin amounts that are substantial, in amounts that are meaningful to \npeople, to families who are preparing for their children to go back to \nschool and need to buy school clothes and books and school supplies. \nThose are the kinds of expenditures that I know, with the number of \nchildren I have, can put a real pinch in your budget because they are \none-time expenditures, mostly at end of the summer, the beginning of \nthe fall, and they are very difficult to budget.\n  This check coming at this time can provide some help to middle-class \nand lower income families who really do need this help and help the \neconomy at the same time. It gets that infusion of money into our \neconomy.\n  I am proud that we were able to work in a bipartisan way in the \nSenate. Twenty-five percent of the Senate Democrats along with the \nRepublicans voted for this proposal. It showed that with good \nleadership we can get bipartisan work done to meet the needs of the \nAmerican people, to help the average American. At the same time, we can \nstrengthen our economy at a time when we are going through a very \ndifficult slowdown.\n  I know there are other things we need to do. We need a national \nenergy policy because at least in my State, in Pennsylvania, we have \nsome real problems in our manufacturing sector, driven principally by \nhigh energy prices over the past 18 months. We need to have a national \nenergy policy so we do not have these spikes that cause economic \ndownturns and difficult times in our manufacturing sector, which is \nstill, from my perspective, a very important sector of our economy.\n  We need to do something on trade. We need to open up new \nopportunities to trade around the world, which by doing so will create \nbetter jobs in America. The economy is important. We need to be aware \nhere in the Senate of what we can do at a time of economic slowdown to \nget this economy up and running.\n  The first and most important thing is to reduce the tax burden on the \nAmerican public to get more money in the economy. The second thing is \nto develop a national energy policy to make sure we have stable, long-\nterm, affordable, clean energy for America's future so we are not \nrelying on foreign energy and that problem. The third thing is to \nincrease trade.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the next \n30 minutes shall be under the control of the Senator from Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/25/senate-section/article/S8150-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8150-S8152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE TAX CUT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, historians and political scientists will \nfind this a very interesting morning debate in the Senate. Over the \nnext few months, they ought to take a look at what primarily Republican \npoliticians and the President are saying and mark it as a special part \nof American history because the American people really have been \nlobbied by the President and by his supporters to support a tax cut. \nThey have been lobbied to support a tax cut.\n  This morning we have had an array of Republican Senators coming to \nthe floor to explain why a tax cut is a good thing.\n  Think about it. The average person in Illinois would think a $300 \ncheck for a person or a $600 check for a family is obviously a good \nthing. That is going to help pay for school expenses, as the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania said. It is going to be around if you need it for \nwhatever the cause--paying off last winter's heating bill or taking \ncare of some expenses around the house. These are real things that \nfamilies face, and $300 from the Government or $600 from the \nGovernment, of course, is a good thing.\n  But, of course, the reason the Republicans are spending so much time \ntrying to convince us it is a good thing is because there is some doubt \nas to whether, on a long-term basis, the President's tax cut is really \nthe right thing for America. Do we need an economic stimulus right now? \nYou bet we do. This economy apparently is continuing to go down.\n\n[[Page S8151]]\n\n  Yesterday the stock market took quite a hit. I hope it recovers soon. \nEveryone does--anyone who has a pension fund or IRA or 401(k) or any \nkind of investment. But we do need a stimulus for this economy. Alan \nGreenspan is desperately looking for the right stimulus. He has reduced \nthe prime rate from time to time to try to stimulate the economy. It \ndoesn't seem to be working as he hoped because long-term interest rates \nhave not come down, and that is kind of an indicator as to whether or \nnot we are going to be moving forward and the people who make \ninvestments believe we are so they can have some confidence in our \nfuture.\n  To say we need some kind of tax cut now for economic stimulus for \nfamilies, you bet; I think it is a good idea. This would have been an \neasy thing to vote for--$300 for individuals, $600 for a family. But \nthat is not what President Bush proposed. That is not what passed the \nSenate.\n  What he passed was a package of tax cuts that span 10 years. How do \nyou get to a point where you can say what America's economy is going to \nlook like 2 years from now, 5 years from now, or 10 years from now? \nThat is where a lot of us think this tax cut proposed by the President \nwent too far. He should have come in with a tax cut as a stimulus for \nthis economy now. The Democrats and Republicans both support that kind \nof a tax cut. But when you expand it to a 10-year program, when you \ncannot say with any certainty what this economy is going to look like, \nyou run some real risk.\n  The fact is, the truth is, in a very short period of time, in a \nmatter of just weeks since the President had his bill signing, we have \nreceived some economic information about the current state of the \neconomy that shows that all the economists who painted the rosiest \npicture in the world to justify a tax cut may have been wrong about \nthis year, let alone 10 years from now.\n  This morning, Kent Conrad, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, \nbrought in Members to talk about some of the problems they can foresee. \nIf you look at them, they are already very troubling. Even this year it \nwill be necessary, because of President Bush's budget and tax cut, for \nus to take $17 billion out of the Medicare trust fund--the trust fund \nfor the elderly and disabled that is clearly under siege because of the \nnumber of people who need it and the increasing cost of medical care. \nAlready this year, because of the Bush tax cut, we are going to have to \nstart raiding the Medicare trust fund.\n  I can tell you that Republican and Democratic Senators alike said \nthat would never happen; we are going to protect these trust funds. Yet \nalready we can see that is on the horizon. Sadly, it gets worse.\n  In a very short period of time, we are not only raiding the Medicare \ntrust fund but also the Social Security trust fund. For what? Because \nthe surplus is not adequate to cover the Bush budget and tax cut. That \nis what it boils down to.\n  Those who come to the floor and take great pride in having voted for \nthis Bush tax cut and this Bush budget also have to acknowledge that \nthey were wrong in the economic forecast. There are already revisions \nthat we are receiving showing that America's economy is not growing as \nfast as they said it would. We find ourselves in a perilous position.\n  It has not been that long ago; I can remember when I was first \nelected to Congress when we had deficit after deficit. We piled up a \nnational debt of $5.7 trillion. That is our national mortgage. When \npeople receive a $300 check from the Federal Government, I hope they \ndon't think we have paid off the mortgage before we sent the check. No. \nThe mortgage is still out there for all the folks receiving the check \nand their children and their children. It is still there.\n  What does our national debt cost Americans? One billion dollars a day \nin interest. How do we raise the money to pay the interest on the \nnational debt? You will see it in your payroll tax. You will see it in \nyour income tax. We continue to collect $1 billion a day to pay the old \ndebt--the mortgage--of Americans at a time when we are sending out a \nrefund of $300 for individuals and $600 for families.\n  You say to yourself: What would have been the more prudent and \ncareful thing to do, the conservative thing to do, if you want? \nCertainly, from my point of view, it would have been to pay down this \nnational debt as fast as possible; get this off the books as quickly as \nyou can so our children don't have to carry that burden and so we don't \nhave to collect over $350 billion a year to pay interest on our old \nmortgage, our national debt. That should have been our first priority. \nIt was not the first priority of the Bush budget.\n  Second, if you are going to have a tax cut, let's have a tax cut to \nstimulate the economy. But let's focus it on families who really need \nthe money. Many families who will receive $300 or $600 really need the \nmoney.\n  When you look at the Bush tax cut, it isn't a tax cut that is \ndirected toward working families or those who are struggling to make \nends meet. It is a tax cut where 40 percent of the benefits go to \npeople making over $300,000 a year.\n  I find it incredible that the President and his friends in Congress \nbelieve that people making over $300,000 a year desperately need a tax \ncut. In fact, they get 40 percent of all the tax breaks. That is what \nthe Bush tax plan proposed.\n  As individuals receive $300 with this tax cut, keep in mind that if \nyour income is over $1 million a year you will receive a $300 tax cut \ncheck every other day under the Bush tax cut plan. That is the \nunfairness of this.\n\n  For us to really put ourselves on the line and to imperil our \neconomic future by enacting a tax cut based on economic assumptions \nthat have already proven to be wrong because we didn't pay down the \nnational debt as we should have when we had the chance to do it but \ninstead declared a bank holiday with $300 checks for everybody is where \nwe missed the boat.\n  It is not popular to say pay down the national debt. People do not \nrise, cheer, applaud, and say they really love that Senator who wants \nto pay down the debt. No. As you go down the parade route, they say: \nCut my taxes. I heard it before the July break, and I have heard it as \nlong as I have been in this business.\n  What is the responsible thing to do for this country? As we see now, \nit isn't enacting the Bush budget, which has us this year already \nraiding the Medicare trust fund to pay for the tax cut and soon to be \nraiding the Social Security trust fund to do the same.\n  What else is at risk? Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, who has \nbeen doing a review of the Department of Defense, has said we need to \nmake some significant changes in the way we defend our country. All of \nus, I hope, agree that is our highest single priority--the common \ndefense of America. Yet when Secretary Rumsfeld is put on the spot, \nwhen people ask, How will you pay for this, he is at a loss. He can't \nanswer it. The money has already been spent. The money has been spent \non a tax cut projected for the next 10 years.\n  I think that is shortsighted. Instead of focusing on paying down the \nnational debt and on the defense of America as our highest priority, we \nhave decided that a tax cut primarily for the wealthiest people in \nAmerica is a much higher priority.\n  I don't think history is going to judge us well for that. The men and \nwomen in uniform who put their lives on the line for the country expect \nus to do the very best we can for them. They expect that equipment \nworks. They expect to be well armed and trained so they can defend \nAmerica and its interests.\n  For us to have to shortchange that or cut back on that because of \nthis Bush budget and tax cut I don't think makes much sense.\n  Let me add another thing. If you ask American families, What is the \nhighest priority issue in your life that you think the Government can \ndeal with time and again, whether it is a State poll or a Federal poll \nor a local poll, the answer always comes back: education. The answer is \neducation. People believe education is really what America is all \nabout. That has been our ladder of opportunity in this country.\n  The President came forward with a bipartisan education bill supported \nby Democrats and Republicans. I supported it, too. I thought it was a \ngood piece of legislation. I might have made some changes here and \nthere, but on\n\n[[Page S8152]]\n\nbalance I thought it really moved us in the right direction. It said \nfor the first time in a long time that the President's party was \ncommitted to investing in education.\n  It wasn't that long ago that the President's party and its party \nplatform wanted to eliminate the Department of Education in Washington. \nThey said this is a State and local issue; it shouldn't be Federal. \nThey have changed. Thank goodness they have. I think it is a wise \ncourse they have taken now--to say that the Federal Government should \nmake strategic investments in education for the good of our country.\n  That is what the bill said--include accountability for teachers and \ntests for students. It included a lot of incentives to deal with \nafterschool programs and to improve the quality-of-reading programs, \nmathematics and science programs. These are all great ideas and great \ninvestments. But the sad news is, because of the Bush budget, the money \nis not going to be there to invest in education. We will pass \nlegislation saying this is a good thing to do. We will authorize it. We \nwill approve it as a concept. But when it comes to appropriating the \nmoney and actually spending the money, we are going to find that it is \nnot there. That is the difficulty, too.\n  Again, as we receive these tax cut checks in the mail, we have to put \nit in perspective. Life is a tradeoff. Politics is a tradeoff. In this \ntradeoff, we have decided that a tax cut plan by President Bush that is \nprimarily loaded for the rich is far more important than paying down \nthe national debt, improving America's national defense, and investing \nin education. In the long run, I think that is going to be viewed as \nvery shortsighted. I think we should have been more careful and more \nprudent in the approach that we took.\n  When you look at the long-term outlook for the amount of money that \nwill be taken from the Social Security trust fund and the Medicare \ntrust fund, next year we will have to raid the Social Security trust \nfund by some $24 billion and the Medicare trust fund by $38 billion. \nThat means people who are paying payroll taxes today to sustain today's \nSocial Security retirees have to understand that the trust fund they \nare counting on to be there when they retire is going to be diminished \nbecause of the Bush budget and because of the Bush tax plan. This is \nsomething that is a reality. It is a reality that we have to face in \nCongress. It is not one we are happy to face but one we must face.\n  Let me also say that when it comes to other economic assumptions in \nthe President's budget, there are some real weaknesses, too. The \nPresident's budget did not include appropriate contingencies for \nnatural disasters. I hope there will never be another one. I know there \nwill be. When there is a disaster, we will rise to the occasion--\nwhether it is a flood in Illinois or a hurricane or a tornado. All of \nthese things cause problems, and the Federal Government rallies to help \nfamilies solve them. It costs money. The Bush budget, sadly, does not \nhave enough money for that help.\n  Tax extenders are programs such as investment in research for \ncorporations that come up with new and innovative and creative \nproducts. These need to be reextended. They cost money. The Bush budget \ndidn't provide that.\n  The alternative minimum tax, which was established to try to catch \nthe high rollers who might escape some tax liability, has really been \nignored, and it should not be. Yet the Bush budget does not take into \naccount that is something that obviously has to be done or we will end \nup penalizing middle-income families who thought they were receiving a \ntax cut, on the one hand, from the President and, on the other hand, \nget nailed with the alternative minimum tax.\n\n  So what we have here, sadly, is a budget proposed by the President \nthat already has us raiding the Medicare and Social Security trust \nfunds that already imperils our ability to deal with priorities, such \nas national defense and education and paying down the national debt.\n  I see my colleague from Minnesota is in the Chamber.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/25/senate-section/article/S8152-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        THE PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION TO STRENGTHEN SOCIAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I want to say a word or two, in closing, \nabout the effort that has been made by the President's commission to \nstrengthen Social Security. I hope this commission is going to be more \nobjective in the way they deal with the Social Security Program. All of \nus understand that Social Security cannot go on indefinitely, that it \nneeds help, and that we need to make the appropriate investments to \nmake sure that Social Security is there for generations to come.\n  It is the most broadly based and most successful social program in \nthe United States. Social Security gives to retirees the safety net \nthey need to live a life of comfort. Along with Medicare, these are the \ntwo things that retirees really count on in America.\n  I am concerned about the draft interim report by President Bush's \ncommission which is supposed to look to the future of Social Security. \nThe report makes many misleading assertions in an attempt to convince \nthe public that Social Security is on the verge of collapse. I hope \nthat any commission entrusted with the challenge of strengthening \nSocial Security will carefully consider all options for reform. \nUnfortunately, this commission has been charged only with the task of \nhow to convert Social Security into a system of private accounts, not \nwith the careful study of whether or not this is the right thing to do.\n  Let me give you an example. If you wanted to invest in a mutual fund \ntoday, you would generally find there is a minimum investment. Why is \nthere a minimum investment? Because there is an administrative overhead \ncost to that investment. Unless you put in $500 or $1,000 or $2,000, it \nreally does not warrant the administrative cost. Think about it in \nterms of individuals who decide they want to invest $100 a month, let's \nsay, of their Social Security check into a private investment. \nAdministrative costs come with each of those investments, and that has \nto be taken into account in the real world.\n\n  Secondly, we have seen yesterday--and we have seen over the last \nyear--that although the stock market can be very generous to those who \ninvest in it, it can also be very cruel. And any who happen to have \ninvested in the last year, making retirement dependent on their \ninvestments, will have to think twice about it because things have not \ngone well in a lot of indices, whether it is the Dow Jones or the S \n500.\n  So those who think the stock market will always go up, historically \nthey are right, it has always gone up, but there are peaks and valleys. \nIf you should happen to make the investment of your Social Security \nretirement fund at a point when we are in an economic valley in the \nstock market, you may find all you counted on is not there when you \nneed it. That is an important consideration.\n  There has also been a consideration that some 2 percent of Social \nSecurity would be invested in these private investments. Because it is \na pay-as-you-go system, that could require cuts of up to 40 percent in \nthe benefits under Social Security or increases in Social Security \npayroll taxes.\n  So what I would say to the President's commission is: Give us your \nalternative in its entirety, give us your program, get beyond the \nprinciples and the theories. Tell us how you are going to pay for this. \nIf we are going to move to private investment and private accounts, \nshow us how this will work.\n  This program of Social Security, created in the days of Franklin \nDelano Roosevelt, was one many people branded as socialism. Many \npredecessors of the folks on the other side of the aisle voted against \nit because they thought it was an experiment in which America should \nnot be involved. History has proven them wrong. Social Security is \nimportant. But those of us who serve today in the Senate and the House \nhave an important responsibility to serve that legacy well, to make \ncertain that Social Security and Medicare are here for many years to \ncome.\n  We can make Social Security stronger, and we can guarantee to \nsuccessive generations that safety net will be there, but we have to be \nprudent and careful in the way we approach it.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  (Mrs. CARNAHAN assumed the chair.)\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/25/senate-section/article/S8153-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8153]]\n          TRANSPORTATION APPROPRIATIONS AND LONG-HAUL TRUCKERS\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, just in the time we have remaining, I \nreally would like for us to move forward on this legislation and, \nindeed, on other legislation that is important to people's lives.\n  I want to speak to three different questions.\n  First of all, on the Murray amendment--and presumably we will have \nmore time for debate; I do not know whether or not we have a filibuster \nthat is going to be sustained or whether or not there is going to be \nsome agreement, but I want to thank Senator Murray for her good work.\n  I tell you, people in Minnesota, as we look at I-35 coming from the \nsouth, are interested in safe drivers and safe trucks and safe \nhighways. They are interested in their own safety. Frankly, I think it \nis terribly important that all of us support Senator Murray's \namendment.\n  For my own part, I also want to give a lot of credit to what \nCongressman Sabo from our State of Minnesota has done on the House \nside. He basically has said, we are not going to have the funding to \ngrant the permits because there is just simply no way that right now we \nare going to be able to have any assurance that the safety standards \nare going to be there.\n  I want to make one point that perhaps was brought up yesterday in the \ndebate but which I think is really important as well. As a Senator, I \ndo not really make any apology for also being concerned about--above \nand beyond safety--the impact this is going to have on jobs in our \ncountry, frankly, the impact of NAFTA on jobs in our country.\n  In particular, I think the very powerful implications of all this are \nas we see more and more subcontractors crossing the border at maquilas, \nit is far better, from the point of view of people in Minnesota, that \nthe subcontractors to our auto plants or to other parts of our economy \nare located in the United States. With a lot of the transportation \nbeing done by American trucks, that is what happens.\n  The Bush administration is pushing this full force, and they are not \neven interested in respect for the safety standards.\n  The other thing that is going to happen is, you are going to have \nmore and more subcontractors basically located in Mexico because \nMexican trucks take whatever is produced there right to wherever it \nneeds to go in the United States, thus eliminating a lot of other jobs.\n  So I think this is not just about truckdrivers, not just about \nTeamsters, not just about safety--all of which I think is very \nimportant--I think it is also about living-wage jobs in our own \ncountry. It is also about our economy. Frankly, in some ways, though I \nsupport the Murray amendment, I really appreciate Mr. Sabo's effort. \nAnd we will see what happens on the floor of the Senate, whether or not \nwe will have an amendment similar to Mr. Sabo's amendment in this \nChamber.\n  But I think, at the very minimum, we have to insist on the safety \nstandards, and, at a maximum, eventually we are also going to have to \nhave yet more honest discussion about this new global economy and where \npeople fit into it. All that happened in Italy and all that happened in \nSeattle I would not defend--not all of it, by any means, but what I \nwill tell you is that there are an awful lot of people in our country \nand throughout the world who are raising very important justice \nquestions. They are not arguing that we are in a national economy \nalone. They are not arguing that we ought to put up walls on the \nborders. But they are arguing, if we are going to have a new global \neconomy and we are in an international time, then above and beyond it \nworking for large financial institutions and multinational \ncorporations; it ought to work for working people; it ought to work for \nhuman rights; it ought to work for consumer protection; it ought to \nwork for small producers; and it ought to work for the environment.\n\n  Frankly, I think that is part of what is being debated in this \nChamber. We have a very, what I would call incremental, pragmatic \namendment, which Senator Murray has done an admirable job of defending. \nI am amazed other Senators believe this goes too far by way of assuring \nbasic safety on our highways. I think we need to defend Senator \nMurray's effort.\n  Above and beyond that, I have some real questions about whether or \nnot all of this will be enforced and then properly certified. Then \nabove and beyond that, I have some real questions about these trade \nagreements and the impact they have on whether or not we will have \nliving-wage jobs for the people in our country to enable people to earn \na decent standard of living so they can support their families.\n  And above and beyond all that, eventually, I am telling you --it may \nnot be this year; it may be 5 years from now; it may be 10 years from \nnow--we are going to design some new rules for this international \neconomy, so that rather than driving environmental standards down, or \nwages down, with a complete lack of respect for human rights, we can \nhave the kind of standards that lift up people's lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/25/senate-section/article/S8153-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8153-S8154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      A PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Obviously, we will not be able \nto do it now, but people in the country are certainly interested in the \npolitics that speak to the center of their lives.\n  I want to see us eventually pass a bill that calls for health \nsecurity for all citizens. Before we do that, we ought to have a decent \nprescription drug benefit. I recommend to my colleagues a Sunday story \nin the New York Times, front-page story by Robert Perrin. I forget the \nname of the coauthor; I apologize.\n  The gist of the piece was that it is going to be very difficult, \nwithin the $300 billion allowance over the next 10 years because of the \ntax cuts, to have a benefit that is going to work for a lot of elderly \npeople. If the premiums are too high and the copays are too high and \nthe deductibles are too high, many people can't afford it. Quite to the \ncontrary of the stereotype of greedy geezers traveling all over the \ncountry playing at the most swank golf courses, the income profile of \nelderly people is not high at all. Disproportionately, it is really \nlow- and moderate-income people.\n  So, A, people will not be able to afford the benefit. And then, B, if \nwe don't deal with the catastrophic expenses--that is to say, after \n$2,000 a year, people should not be paying any more additional \nexpenses--then it is going to be a proposal or a piece of legislation \nthat is going to invite mutiny. People are going to say: We thought \nwhen you campaigned that you made a commitment to us. We thought you \nmade a commitment to affordable prescription drugs. But you are not \nwilling to do it.\n  I have introduced a piece of legislation called MEDS. At a very \nminimum, we are going to have to understand $300 billion over 10 years \nwill not do the job. We have to understand that this tax cut that has \nboxed us all in is a huge mistake. We are going to have to be \nintellectually honest with the people in the country, and we are going \nto have to find our courage. Frankly, I predict we will revisit--the \nsooner, the better--this tax cut proposal. It is too much Robin Hood in \nreverse, too much going to the very top of the population. And now we \nare without the revenue and the resources to do well for people with an \naffordable prescription drug. ``Affordable,'' that is what everyone \ncampaigned on.\n  In addition, yesterday Senator Rockefeller, chairing the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, had Secretary Principi come in. He is a good man. I \nhave a great deal of respect for him. I think he cares deeply about \nveterans. He was talking about prescription drug benefits within the \nVA. I asked him several times whether or not he felt that their global \nbudget and the discount they insist on has enabled them to hold down \nthe cost. The copay for veterans for prescription drugs right now is \n$2. He said: Absolutely.\n  Maybe what we are going to have to do--there are Republicans who will \nagree; I hope all the Democrats agree--is also have some cost \ncontainment. We have 40 million Medicare recipients. I suppose we might \nbe able to say that 40\n\n[[Page S8154]]\n\nmillion Medicare recipients represent a bargaining unit and we want a \ndiscount from these pharmaceutical companies that are making excessive, \nobscene profits.\n  There are a lot of issues people care about. There are many issues on \nwhich we need to move forward. In particular, in order to do well by \npeople, we are going to have to be not only intellectually honest, but \nwe will have to have some political courage--political courage to talk \nabout the ways in which this tax cut bill puts us in a straitjacket and \namounts to a miserable failure from the point of view of our being able \nto do well for people and from the point of view of our being willing \nto live up to our promises. Everybody who ran for office talked about \nan affordable prescription drug benefit.\n\n  In addition, we are going to have to challenge some of the profits of \nthe pharmaceutical industry and have some cost containment so this \nworks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/25/senate-section/article/S8154-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                VICTIMS ECONOMIC SECURITY AND SAFETY ACT\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, today I am going to introduce \nlegislation, the Victims Economic Security and Safety Act, with Senator \nMurray--she probably will not be able to be at the press conference \nbecause she is doing such an admirable job of standing her proper \nground for safety--Senator Schumer and Senator Dodd; and \nRepresentatives Carolyn Maloney and Lucille Roybal-Allard on the House \nside.\n  Basically, this legislation deals with what is a huge problem; that \nis to say, estimates are that as many as 50 percent of the victims of \ndomestic violence have lost jobs in part due to their struggle. The \nsame thing holds true for victims of sexual assault.\n  The legislation addresses three or four issues. No. 1, it would \nprovide emergency leave for those women--sometimes men, almost always \nwomen--who are having to deal with the battering and with the violence, \nbe it in the home, be it sexual assault, be it stalking. It will allow \nthem to take some time off from work to see a lawyer, to see a doctor, \nto do what they need to do.\n  No. 2, it would extend unemployment compensation to people who are \nforced to leave their jobs in order to provide for their own safety and \ntheir children's safety. Amazingly, this happens in about 50 percent of \nthe cases: Quite often for these women, the man--be it the former \nhusband, a stalker, somebody who has assaulted them sexually--will come \nto their workplace and constantly be there. And in order to be safe, in \norder sometimes literally to save their lives, in order for their \nchildren to be safe, they then have to leave work. We want to, with \ndocumentation, be able to provide some unemployment compensation.\n  No. 3, it would prohibit discrimination against victims of domestic \nand sexual assault. This is critically important. What happens is the \nemployer--and some of the employers are great--sometimes says: This is \ncreating a lot of trouble. Therefore, we fire you.\n  That is the last thing in the world you want to do.\n  It also provides protection from insurance company discrimination. \nThere is no reason why women should be battered again by an insurance \ncompany that says: We understand that this guy has come to work, is \nthreatening you, that you have this problem. We don't think you are a \ngood bet for health insurance.\n  Finally, it provides tax credits to companies that will provide the \nprograms and the help.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, before the Senator from Minnesota leaves \nthe floor, I wish to say was not able to hear all of his statement but \nmost of it. He mentioned what we need around here is political courage. \nThat is something that is not lacking in the service of the Senator \nfrom Minnesota.\n  I appreciate his legislation regarding stalking and domestic \nviolence. Stalking is a very evil thing, for lack of a better way to \nput it. I can't imagine how difficult it is for people who are stalked.\n  Senator Ensign and I had the misfortune of having somebody who was \nstalking us. It was very serious. He felt he had been aggrieved in \nMexico and that we should do something about it. Of course, there was \nnothing we could do about it. It became a very big burden on my staff. \nHe wouldn't leave my office. Finally, in an effort to get attention, \nrather than shoot one of my staff members or me, he shot himself in \nfront of my office. He survived the gunshot wound and proceeded to \ncontinue to harass us. He was convicted and sent to prison. I only say \nthat because if people of our stature and in the public awareness have \ndifficulties, I can't imagine people who don't have the U.S. marshals \nand other people protecting them. So we need to do more. It is a very \ninsidious thing. We need to do a better job of training law \nenforcement, although they are trained much better than they were \nregarding domestic violence. We need to have judges who better \nunderstand domestic violence.\n\n  I am anxious to look at the Senator's legislation. It sounds as if it \nis heading toward the correct destination. We need to focus more \nattention on this national problem.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Nevada and \ntell him that, as we move forward, we will talk about some companies \nthat have put together model programs. Again, unfortunately, what a \nbitter irony that for too many of these women--part of what this is all \nabout is control. They have had the courage to move out of the home \nbecause the home is very dangerous for them and very dangerous for \ntheir children. Still, about every 15 seconds a woman is battered in \nthe United States. Maybe this guy will come to work--and basically he \ndoesn't want her to be working, so that is part of her independence. He \nwill stalk her and make threats. Then all too often the employer will \nbasically let her go, saying it is too much trouble. Then where is she? \nQuite often, she is forced back into a horrible situation. In about 50 \npercent of the cases, it happens where the guy or woman comes to work \nand the threats are made.\n  We are saying there has to be a way we can provide additional help \nand support. So we do a number of different things for those who have \nbeen victims of violence in homes, sexual assault, and stalking. A \nnumber of things are in this legislation. I think it would make a huge \ndifference. I thank my colleague for his comments.\n  Mr. REID. I will say one more thing to the Senator. There are more \nanimal shelters than there are domestic crisis shelters in America. In \nNevada, a rapidly growing community, we are so understaffed. We have a \nlack of facilities. These brave women are willing to break away from \nthis domestic violence, and we are having trouble finding a place for \nthem to go. It is a really difficult situation, not only in Nevada but \nall over the country. It is a national problem. We have helped with \nsome national moneys but not nearly enough.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague.\n  In addition, even if women have been in shelters, there is no \naffordable housing.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, we are this morning discussing the \nTransportation appropriations bill. As Members know, this bill contains \nmany, many important infrastructure projects across this country for \nMembers' airports, the Coast Guard, roads, infrastructure, bridges. We \nare trying diligently to move this bill forward so we can make progress \nand move to the House for a conference so we can do our duty in terms \nof the transportation infrastructure in this country and getting those \nprojects funded.\n  I know many Members have priority projects in here they want to make \nsure are included. Senator Shelby and I have been working extremely \nhard together in a bipartisan manner to ensure those projects move \nforward in a timely fashion.\n  We implore all of our colleagues who have amendments to come to the \nfloor this morning. It is 10:30 on Wednesday morning. We are here. We \nare ready. We are waiting for those amendments to be offered. I \nunderstand Senator Graham of Florida will be here shortly to offer his. \nI let all Members know, postcloture their amendments may fall, and we \nare going to be moving to that very quickly. Members have this morning, \nthe next hour and a half, to offer any amendments they would like to \nhave considered, either to be included in a voice vote that we hope to \nhave or to be offered as amendments. Otherwise, they may not get their \nproject debated on the floor and included in our bill.\n  Senator Shelby and I are ready to consider any amendments that \nMembers bring. We let them know that if they don't bring them shortly, \nthey will probably not be allowed to be offered or included in the \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I come to the floor to speak again about \nthe issue of highway safety and the issue of allowing Mexican long-haul \ntruckers to come in beyond the 20-mile limit in this country because, \nas the President suggests, that is part of what NAFTA requires. I \ndisagree with that.\n  Before I talk about that issue, I will talk about something that \nhappened yesterday and has been happening day after day on the floor of \nthe House. A colleague stood up yesterday and said: Is this a way to \nrun the Senate? He was upset at the end of the day that not much had \nhappened on this appropriations bill. What is happening on these \nappropriations bills is, we are working in the Appropriations Committee \nto get these bills out. The chairman of the committee, Senator Byrd, \nand the ranking member, Senator Stevens, have done a wonderful job \nworking with all of the subcommittees. We are getting the bills out of \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee. We are getting them to the floor \nof the Senate. What we see is a slow-motion action by people in the \nSenate who decide they really don't want the Senate to act. They don't \nwant the Senate to move.\n  I don't think it is in the Senate's interest and I don't think it is \nin the country's interest to slow this process down. We have very \nlimited time. We on the Appropriations Committee have tried to do a \nserious job of putting together good appropriations bills that we can \nconsider, to move forward, so we can have conferences and get the \nspending bills in place and signed into law before October 1.\n  Senator Murray and Senator Shelby have worked on this piece of \nlegislation. While I have differences on the issue of Mexican trucking \nwith not only the chairman and the ranking member, I also have \ndifferences, very substantial differences, with others who want to \noffer amendments from the other side. We ought to be able to resolve \nit, have the amendments and have the votes and move on, finish whatever \nother amendments are available to be offered to this bill, go to third \nreading, and pass this appropriations bill.\n  I bet Senator Murray and Senator Shelby, who have exhibited enormous \npatience sitting on the floor waiting for people to offer amendments, \nwould like nothing better than to have this Senate dispatch this bill. \nToday. Move the amendments. Get this bill out of here.\n  While someone stands on the floor and says, is this any way to run \nthe Senate, the way Senator Daschle and other leaders are trying to run \nthe Senate, bringing bills to the floor, offering amendments, and \ngetting the bills passed, others are sitting on the back seat of the \nbicycle built for two with the brakes on, peddling up hill.\n  The message is either lead or get out of the way for those who want \nto stall the business. Senator Daschle has come to the floor and said \nthat these are the pieces of legislation we have to finish before the \nend of next week. He is serious about that. He should be. He \nunderstands what the Senate has to accomplish. We have some who don't \ncare much; they want to stall and stall and stall.\n  We have a number of appropriations bills that are waiting. Let's get \nthis bill done and then move on. It seems to me it serves no national \npurpose to hold up appropriations bills for any great length of time.\n  Having said that--which I said because I was nonplused by someone \nstanding up being critical of the way the Senate is being run when we \nare doing the right thing but we are not getting the cooperation; we \nneed the cooperation to get these things done--we ask for more \ncooperation today to see if we cannot get this appropriations bill \nmoving and through the Senate.\n\n  This morning's Washington Post says ``Battle on Mexican Trucking \nHeats Up.'' It describes two positions on the issue of Mexican \ntrucking. Really, there are three positions. I want to describe the one \nthe Washington Post forgot to mention. There is the position that is \noffered in this legislation by Senator Murray and Senator Shelby. They \nhave negotiated and reached a position that describes certain \nconditions that must be met before Mexican long-haul trucks move into \nthis country. The other position is the position adopted by the House \nby a nearly 2-1 vote which says we cannot spend money; we are \nprohibited from spending money to approve the licenses or approve the \npermits to allow Mexican trucks to come into this country beyond the \n20-mile limit during the coming fiscal year. I happen to favor the \nHouse approach because I think that is the only way to stop what \notherwise inevitably will happen.\n  The approach taken by the Chair of the subcommittee and the ranking \nmember is one that I think has merit, but one that I think requires \ncertifications that certain things are met. My experience with \ncertifications is that if an administration wants to do something, it \nwill certify anything. I worry very much it will not stop what I don't \nwant to happen. What I don't want to happen is this: I don't want \nMexican long-haul truckers to be doing long hauls into the United \nStates of America until and unless we are sure they are going to meet \nthe same safety requirements our trucking industry has to meet: the \nsame safety requirements with respect to equipment, and the same safety \nrequirements with respect to drivers.\n  As I did yesterday, I refer to a wonderful piece written in the San \nFrancisco Chronicle by a reporter who went to Mexico and rode with a \nMexican long-haul trucker. This is what he discovered. He rode 3 days \nin a Mexican truck with a truckdriver. During the 3 days, they traveled \n1,800 miles and that truckdriver slept 7 hours in 3 days, driving a \ntruck that would not have passed inspection in this country, driving a \ntruck for $7 a day, driving a truck that if it comes to the border in \nthis country under today's circumstances would likely not be inspected \nfor safety, and if it were allowed to continue into this country on a \nlong haul, one\n\n[[Page S8156]]\n\nwould expect that some American driver in his or her rearview mirror \nwould see a truck with 80,000 pounds on an 18-wheel truck moving down \nAmerica's highways without an assurance it has brakes, without \nassurance it has the kind of safety equipment that we require in this \ncountry. I don't think that is what we ought to allow.\n  I will not speak at great length because I think there are a couple \nothers who wish to offer amendments this morning. Let me compare the \nsafety regulations between the United States and Mexico. The free trade \nagreement between our two countries, one which I voted against, has in \nmy judgment, not been a good trade agreement for our country. Prior to \nthe trade agreement, we had a slight trade surplus with Mexico; now we \nhave turned that into a very large deficit. Now we are told by \nPresident Bush that because of that trade agreement, we must allow \nMexican trucks into our country beyond the 20-mile border. In other \nwords, we must allow Mexican trucks without the same safety \nrequirements--because those safety requirements do not exist in \nMexico--to come in with drivers making $7 a day and do long hauls in \nthe United States. That is not a trade agreement that seems, in my \njudgment, to represent this country's best interests.\n  Here are the differences between the United States and Mexico with \nrespect to safety regulations: Vehicle safety standards in the United \nStates, comprehensive standards for components such as anti-lock \nbrakes, underride guards, nice visibility, front brakes: Mexico, far \nless rigorous and, in fact, in some places no inspection. Maximum \nweight: 80,000 pounds in the United States; 135,000 pounds in Mexico.\n\n  Hazardous materials rules: Very strict standards, training, licensure \nand an inspection regime in this country that is very strict. In \nMexico, fewer identified chemicals and substances and fewer licensure \nrequirements.\n  Roadside inspections: In this country, yes; in Mexico, no.\n  Hours of service: In the United States you can drive up to 10 hours \nconsecutively in the trucking industry. You can work up to 15 \nconsecutive hours with a mandatory 8 hours of rest. You cannot drive \nmore than 70 hours during each 8-day period. In Mexico, none.\n  I described the driver who drives for 3 days and has 7 hours of \nsleep, driving with a reporter from the San Francisco Chronicle riding \nbeside him--3 days, 7 hours. Do you want you or your family to have \nthat truck in your rearview mirror? I don't think so. Hours of service \nin Mexico, none.\n  Random drug testing: In Mexico, none. In the United States, yes, for \nall drivers.\n  Medical condition disqualification: In the United States, yes, we do \ndisqualify them for medical conditions if they cannot meet medical \nconditions. In Mexico, no.\n  Logbooks: In Mexico they say, yes, we require logbooks. There is a \nrequirement in law. But, in fact, no driver carries a logbook. It is \nvery much like the Mexican contention that they have very strict \nenvironmental rules. When we had American manufacturing plants moving \nto the maquiladora border, at the border between the United States and \nMexico, we had people worrying about environmental rules. Mexico said: \nYes, we have very strict environmental laws. Yes, they do and they do \nnot enforce any of them. Strict laws, no enforcement. The same is true \nwith logbooks.\n  Finally, here is a picture. GAO, the Government Accounting Office, \ndid the investigation. Overweight trucks from Mexico hauling steel \nrolls at Brownsville, TX, a gross weight of 134,000 pounds. The U.S. \nlimit is 80,000 pounds. The Department of Transportation's Inspector \nGeneral said, when we talked about lack of parking spaces at inspection \nstations in this country as trucks enter--and, incidentally, there are \nvery few inspection stations; only two of them on all of that border \nare open during all commercial operating hours. Most of them have one \nor two parking spaces. In response to one of the problems with parking \nspaces, when we said, why don't they just turn the trucks around if \nthey are unsafe, he said: Let me give an example. We have a truck come \nin from Mexico and we inspect it and it has no brakes. We cannot turn \nit around and send it back to Mexico with no brakes, an 18-wheel truck \nwith no brakes.\n  Is that what you want in your rearview mirror? I don't think so.\n  We have 27 inspection sites, two of them have permanent facilities. \nMost of them have no access to telephone lines to be able to check \ndrivers' licenses on some sort of database. The fact is, this is a \ncolossal failure. It would be a serious mistake for our country to \nembrace a policy suggested by the President to allow Mexican long-haul \ntrucks to come into this country beyond the 20-mile border and haul all \nacross this country with an industry that nowhere near matches the \nsafety requirements that we insist on in this country for trucks and \ntruckdrivers.\n  All of us understand the consequences. I understand there are people \nwho believe very strongly that we ought to just allow this to happen \nbecause it is part of our trade agreement. No trade agreement in this \ncountry, none, should ever compromise safety in this country--not with \nrespect to food safety, not with respect to highway safety. No trade \nagreement has the right to compromise safety for the American people at \nany time, period.\n  We have a disagreement about this issue. We will resolve it, I \nassume, soon. The sooner the better as far as I am concerned. My hope \nis that we will see people come to the floor of the Senate and offer \nwhatever amendments exist on not only this issue but other issues \ntoday. Then we can finish this bill.\n  Senator Daschle, the majority leader of the Senate, has made it quite \nclear we have work to do. It does not serve this Senate's interests to \ndecide to stay away from the floor of the Senate but try to hold up the \nwork of the Senate. Let's come to the floor. Let's hash these \namendments out, decide what we want to do with them, vote on them and \npass this piece of legislation. The Senate owes that to the \nappropriators and the Appropriations Committee. We owe it to Senator \nDaschle and Senator Lott, who are trying to make this Senate do its \nwork on time.\n  I hope today we can see real progress on this bill. I hope especially \none way or another, with one strategy or another, we can find a way to \nrepresent this country's best interests on the subject of stopping or \npreventing the long-haul Mexican trucks from coming into this country \nbecause they do not have anywhere near the equivalent safety standards \non which we must insist they have, before we allow them to be on \nAmerican roads.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Florida is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1064 to Amendment No. 1025\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, in October of last year I spoke to the \nSenate about a specific part of the Transportation appropriations, and \nthat was the earmarking of intelligent transportation systems, or ITS, \nfunds. At that time I expressed my concern that intelligent \ntransportation funds had been earmarked over the last several \nappropriations cycles, and that earmarking was inconsistent with the \npurposes and objectives of the underlying legislation which authorized \nITS funds which was TEA-21, the current Surface Transportation Act.\n  The Surface Transportation Act clearly stated the money was to be \nallocated on a competitive solicitation process overseen by the \nSecretary of Transportation. I discussed this in the last few months \nwith both Senator Murray and Senator Shelby, and raised my concerns. \nTherefore, I am pleased to say that, while there are still earmarks of \nITS funds in this legislation, they, in my opinion, are noticeably less \nonerous than those earmarks to which I objected last October. I thank \nSenator Murray and Senator Shelby for their efforts in that direction.\n  Let me give a little history and also point out some of the \nimprovements which have given me encouragement from last year's \nTransportation appropriations bill.\n\n[[Page S8157]]\n\n  In March of 1998, Congress overwhelmingly approved groundbreaking \ntransportation legislation, TEA-21. This was not only intended to \nrevamp distribution of Federal highway funds but was also to usher \nAmerica into the completed interstate period of our highway history. We \nhad spent the better part of a half century building the interstate \nsystem. By the 1990s, that mammoth national effort, at least as it had \noriginally been conceived, has largely been accomplished. So the \nquestion was, Where do we go in the ``after interstate construction'' \nperiod?\n  One of the areas in which the Congress clearly believes we needed to \ngo is to make the interstate and our other national highway systems as \nefficient as possible. As the Presiding Officer, who comes from a large \nand growing State, I can appreciate the number of interstate lanes you \ncan build through a city such as St. Louis or Kansas City is just about \nlimited unless you are prepared to do very significant demolition of an \nurban environment.\n  We increasingly are asking ourselves how we make these systems that \nare already in place operate as efficiently as possible. The 1998 TEA-\n21 legislation set aside money for research and development and also \nfor the deployment of components of intelligent transportation systems. \nThe goal was to accelerate our knowledge of how we make these systems \nmore efficient and then to develop sound national policy for dealing \nwith traffic congestion in the 21st century.\n  The Intelligent Transportation Program works to solve congestion and \nsafety problems, improve operating efficiencies in vehicles and in mass \ntransit, in individual automobiles and commercial vehicles, and reduces \nthe environmental impact of growing travel demand. Intelligent \ntransportation systems use modern computers, management techniques, and \ninformation technology to improve the flow of traffic.\n  ITS applications range from electronic highway signs that direct \ndrivers away from congested roadways, to advanced radio advisories, to \nmore efficient public transit.\n  This plan, developed by the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nwas thoughtful and had a specific purpose in mind: to foster the growth \nof ITS, and, in a scientific manner, gather results from new ITS \nprograms so that we could make wise decisions when the next \ntransportation bill is authorized.\n  We might make the decision that ITS has been a failure and we should \nabandon attempts to improve the efficiencies of our highways. I \npersonally doubt that will be the answer. It is more likely, I hope, \nthat the answer will be that the practical necessities and limitations \nof other alternatives require us to try to make our existing highways \nas efficient as possible and that there are some means of doing that.\n  One of my concerns from last year's bill was the small dollar amount \nallocated to most of the earmarks. If you looked at last year's \nTransportation appropriations bill under the provision of ITS, you saw \nalmost a mind-numbing list of specific communities with dollar amounts \nbehind them. I know from personal experience that ITS, while a very \npotentially valuable component of any transportation plan, is not \ninexpensive. The plan I am most familiar with is Orlando, FL, which is \na plan that combines many of the components of a modern ITS system and \nhas had a pricetag in excess of $15 million. Therefore, when I saw many \nearmarks that were in the range of $500,000, I wondered where they were \ngoing to get the ``critical mass'' of funds needed to do an effective \nITS system, where there was going to be a critical mass of the various \ncomponents of ITS that would give us the kind of information we are \ngoing to need to make the judgment as to how far we can push this \ntechnology and these management systems as an increasingly significant \npart of our national transportation policy.\n  This year's Senate bill has earmarks. But many of them seem to reach \nthe level of critical mass. That gives me encouragement that we are \ngoing to actually learn something from these projects because there are \nenough resources for a community to do a serious ITS program.\n  A second concern is that there has been little correlation between \nwhat we have identified as the Nation's most congested communities and \nwhere we have sent our ITS money. In the legislation of last year, as I \npointed out in my October statement, almost no money went to the cities \nthat had been designated as among the 70 most congested cities in \nAmerica. There has been some improvement this year.\n  The source of information the Federal Government looks to to \ndetermine where the greatest congestion on the highway exists is a \nstudy which is produced annually by the Texas Transportation Institute \nlocated at Texas A University. They published their annual report for \nthis year in May. The 10 most congested cities in America, based on \nthis analysis, are, in order:\n  Los Angeles; San Francisco-Oakland; Chicago; Seattle; Washington, DC, \nand suburbs; San Diego; Boston; Atlanta; Denver; and the Portland, OR, \narea.\n  Unlike last year's appropriations bill, actually some money was \nallocated this year to these most congested cities: $3.75 million is \ngoing to the State of Illinois, assuming some of that will be directed \ntowards the third most congested city in America; $4 million to the \nWashington, DC, area, the fifth most congested area; $1 million to \nAtlanta, the eighth most congested area; and $6 million to the State of \nWashington, again assuming that some will go to the fourth most \ncongested area of Seattle.\n  Having said that, I point out that 6 of the 10 most congested areas \ndid not receive any of the funds. Of the 44 earmarked areas in the \nSenate bill, 23 are directed towards cities or localities that are in \nthe top 70 most congested areas in America, according to the Texas \nTransportation Institute study.\n\n  Even though I personally believe that there should be no earmarks and \nthat we should fully comply with the prospects laid out in TEA-21, I am \nencouraged to see that the money seems to be directed, more so than in \nthe past, to where the need is the greatest. I again commend Senator \nMurray and Senator Shelby for that.\n  As I mentioned last year, I am not categorically opposed to earmarks. \nThere may be appropriate areas within a mature transportation program \nwhere it is appropriate for Congress to indicate a national priority. \nAs a former Governor, my preference is to allocate these funds to the \nStates so that the States which have the responsibility for managing \nthe transportation systems for all of their citizens can make \nintelligent judgments as to priorities, and then to oversee to \ndetermine that the actual results which led to the appropriations were \naccomplished.\n  I have grave concerns about where we are earmarking funds in a \nprogram that is evolving, where the stated purpose is to be able to \nenhance our knowledge of how this system operates, so that in the \nfuture we can make more informed judgments as to whether it is a \nprogram that deserves continued specific Federal support or whether it \nshould be abandoned or whether it should be accelerated because of its \ndemonstrated contribution. I am concerned about the relationship of \nearmarks to the legislative structure which led to the establishment of \nthese creative and evolving programs.\n  In an effort to allay those concerns about earmarks, I have presented \nto the managers of this legislation--I am pleased to state that they \nhave accepted--an amendment that I will soon offer. This amendment \nstates that all of the earmarked projects will have to meet the \nauthorization standards that were included in TEA-21 as to their \nsignificance and the contribution they will make towards our better \nunderstanding of the potential for intelligent transportation. I thank \nagain Senators Murray and Shelby for having indicated their acceptance \nof this amendment.\n  Let me conclude with a few words of caution. There is a role for the \nNational Government beyond just redistribution of highway funds to the \nStates and territories and the District of Columbia which benefit from \nthose funds. We also have the opportunity, from time to time, to be a \nnational laboratory for new, innovative ideas. There were several of \nthose in TEA-21.\n  There was a new idea about innovative financing, how we could better \nput national, State, and, in some cases, private funds together in \norder to finance transportation projects. There was a new idea about \nstreamlining and coordinating the permitting of transportation projects \nso some of the long\n\n[[Page S8158]]\n\ndelays that we are all familiar with could be avoided in the future. \nThere was the innovative idea of enhancing our knowledge of intelligent \ntransportation systems in order to make our highways more efficient.\n  Most of those involve a specific program, with specific funding \nauthorizations. Most of those were intended to use a competitive \nprocess so that the best of the best ideas could be given a chance to \nbe demonstrated in real life, that our knowledge would be accelerated.\n  However, if we proceed in a manner that every time we try to use a \nnational laboratory of innovation, what happens is, the funds that were \nprovided for that end up being earmarked in an unsystematic, I would \nsay in some cases, irrational manner, then what is the point? Why \nshould we try to be a laboratory of innovation if that goal will be \nfrustrated by the manner in which the funds are distributed, that \nrather than being distributed on a competitive basis, where merit and \ncontribution to the national store of knowledge will be the primary \nobjective, we distribute the money based on who happens to have the \nmost influence within the appropriations process?\n  If that is going to be the pattern, then I, for one, would say, let's \nabandon the concept of the U.S. National Government as a laboratory, \nand let's just put all those moneys back into the pool to be \nredistributed to the States under an established formula.\n  I would personally hope we would not abandon that objective and that \nimportant role the Federal Government can play as a laboratory, but it \nis going to require the kind of discipline that we have made between \nOctober of 2000 and now into July of 2001, where there has been \nprogress made in the Senate. We are going to have to continue that \ndiscipline as we go into conference with the House of Representatives, \nwhich, unfortunately, from my examination, has continued most of the \npractices that I bemoaned back in the fall of last year--a long list of \nsmall projects that do not seem to have the critical mass or the \ndirection towards where congestion has been demonstrated to be the \ngreatest and, therefore, where the opportunities to learn most about \nthese ITS projects is the greatest.\n  So I will hope our conferees will stand strong for the principles \nthey have already adopted and the principles which are represented in \nthe amendment which I offer and ask for adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment will \nbe set aside, and the clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. GRAHAM] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1064 to amendment No. 1025.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To ensure that the funds set aside for Intelligent \nTransportation System projects are dedicated to the achievement of the \ngoals and purposes set forth in the Intelligent Transportation Systems \n                              Act of 1998)\n\n       On page 17, line 11, insert after ``projects'' the \n     following: ``that are designed to achieve the goals and \n     purposes set forth in section 5203 of the Intelligent \n     Transportation Systems Act of 1998 (subtitle C of title V of \n     Public Law 105-178; 112 Stat. 453; 23 U.S.C. 502 note)''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, Senator Shelby and I have both seen the \namendment. It is a good amendment, and I think it will be accepted on \nboth sides.\n  Mr. SHELBY. That is right. I have no objection.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If there is no further debate, the question is on agreeing to \namendment No. 1064.\n  The amendment (No. 1064) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Madam President. And I thank Senator Murray \nand Senator Shelby for their consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Florida and \nwould, again, let all Members know that Senator Shelby and I are in the \nChamber. We say to all Senators, one more time, Members have just a \nshort timeframe to come to us with any of their amendments.\n  I understand the Senator from Georgia is on his way. We have heard \nfrom several other Senators who may have amendments. I remind all \nMembers that they just have a short time this morning to get their \namendments here if they want to speak on them or they will probably not \nbe able to speak to their issue.\n  We want to move this bill forward. We are here. We are ready. We are \nworking. And we would appreciate it if Members would let us know what \namendments they have so we can move this bill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 15 minutes, with the proviso that if someone comes \nto offer an amendment on the underlying bill, I will relinquish the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dorgan and Mr. Reid are printed in today's Record \nunder ``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the manager of this bill and I have spoken \non a number of occasions. We have some down time here. The Senator from \nGeorgia is on his way and should be here momentarily to offer an \namendment. We look forward to him offering that amendment.\n  We have work that has to be done. We have to work on this bill. The \nSenator from Washington and the Senator from Alabama have spent weeks \nof their lives working on this bill. For me, in the State of Nevada, \nthe Transportation bill is very important. It is one of the ways that \nwe in Nevada--especially the rapidly growing Las Vegas area--are able \nto keep up with the growth--or try to. We need this.\n  Not only is this an important bill--immediately when we think about \ntransportation, we think of highways--but also the innovations in this \nbill are tremendous.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. If the Senator from Nevada will yield for a moment.\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are here on the floor talking about \nthe Transportation appropriations bill, as the Senator from Nevada has \nstated. We have taken some time to hear about the Patients' Bill of \nRights because no Members have come to the floor to offer their \namendments.\n  I can share with you, as chairman of the Transportation \nAppropriations Subcommittee, many Members on the floor, Republicans and \nDemocrats, have come to me over the last 5 weeks to tell me how \ncritical an airport is in their State, or a road, a bridge, or a \nhighway. Many Members have thanked me for the money for the Coast Guard \nand for pipeline safety. Many Members have mentioned to me the critical \nissues facing their States, their infrastructure needs that have piled \nup. We have done a good job--Senator Shelby and I--in putting a lot of \nmoney into these projects that will help families in every State in \nthis country to be better able to get to work quickly, to take care of \ntheir kids and get to a babysitter and pick them up before they go \nhome, to go to an airport that has improvements so they don't have long \nwaits. Those issues are critical.\n  One amendment on our side is from the Senator from Georgia. He will \nbe here shortly. I have heard rumors of several Members on the \nRepublican side who have amendments. So far, none of them has come to \nthe floor. I tell all of our Members that we cannot get this to \nconference and advocate for\n\n[[Page S8159]]\n\nthose needs that you have impressed upon us unless we move this bill \noff the floor. We are here, and we want to work with you on amendments. \nBut unless somebody comes and offers an amendment, we are unable to \nmove forward.\n  I remind everybody again that we are moving to a cloture vote \ntomorrow. Your amendments will not likely be in order after that, and \nwe will not be able to help you with that. Again, I plead with our \ncolleagues on both sides, if you have amendments, come to the floor \nnow. Let us know. We are happy to work with you. Otherwise, your \nproject will not be part of the bill that is going to move out of here.\n  I thank my colleague from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. If I may say to the manager of this bill, I believe that \ncloture will be invoked. This legislation is so important to this \nSenator and my colleague, the junior Senator from Nevada.\n  We know how this bill helps us. The Senator mentioned surface \ntransportation. One of the things the Senator is helping us with on \nthis bill, which we needed so badly, is a fixed-rail system, the \nmonorail we have to take from the airport. McCarran Field now gets \nalmost 40 million visitors a year in that little airport, and we need \nsome way to bring those people into the strip and the downtown.\n  I say to my friend, having managed a number of appropriation bills \nover the years, if by some chance this bill does not pass and whoever \nis responsible for defeating this bill, either directly or indirectly, \nwhen this bill goes on some big omnibus bill, many of these projects, \nmany of these programs which Senator Murray and Senator Shelby have \nworked so hard on will just be gone. Is that a fair statement?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Nevada is absolutely correct. We can \nfight for these projects in the conference bill with the House \ncommittee that has spoken on many of these issues as well. If cloture \nis not invoked and this bill ends up in an omnibus bill, we will be \nsubject to whatever small amount of money we have left to deal with, \nand we do not know what that will be, depending on some of the other \nappropriations bills that go through here.\n  I tell my colleague from Nevada that I have worked very hard to fund \nthe President's priorities within this bill. In fact, we did much \nbetter in the Senate bill than the House did for the President's \npriorities. Those may well not be part of the final package if we move \nto an omnibus bill on this.\n  I agree with the Senator from Nevada; we will likely invoke cloture \ntomorrow because so many Members have such critical projects that may \nnot be there if we do not move on this bill.\n  I say to my colleague from Nevada, and to the Presiding Officer of \nthe Senate, it is clear there is one issue that is hanging up this bill \nat this point, and that is the issue of safety on American highways, \nthat is the issue of whether or not we are going to implement strong \nsafety protections for our constituents across this country in this \nbill.\n  Senator Shelby and I have worked very hard in a bipartisan manner to \nput together strong safety requirements that we believe will ensure \nthat the Mexican trucks under NAFTA that are crossing our border have \ndrivers who are licensed, that have been inspected at their sites, that \nare not overweight, and we can assure our constituents we have safe \nroads. We believe the unanimous consent of the Appropriations Committee \nallowed us to move forward on that.\n  We believe a number of Members of the Senate agree with those safety \nprovisions and are not willing to doom their projects on a cloture vote \nover the safety provisions that have been included in this bill. Again, \nthat vote will occur tomorrow and we will see where the votes are. We \nwant to move this bill forward.\n  I see the Senator from Georgia is here. I do know he has an \namendment, and we will hear from him shortly on that, and we will be \nable to move to a vote on that amendment. I again remind all of our \ncolleagues, if they have amendments, get them to the floor.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding--and I say to my friend from \nWashington, she and her staff have spent a lot of time trying to work \nsomething out with Senators McCain and Gramm--that as we speak there \nare negotiations in progress; Is that true?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Nevada is correct.\n  We met late last night with the staffs from a number of Republican \noffices. We believe we are able to talk to them about some issues on \nwhich we can possibly agree, but as many Members of the Senate on both \nsides agree, we cannot compromise on some key safety provisions we \nbelieve are essential. We are continuing to talk to Senator McCain, \nSenator Gramm, and other Senators on the other side who do not want to \nsee provisions in this bill regarding safety.\n  We will continue to have those discussions up to and including the \nvote tomorrow, but I tell all of our colleagues I think the provisions \nin this bill regarding safety are absolutely imperative. I think a \nmajority of the Members of the Senate agree with us. That does not \npreclude us from talking. We have given our full faith to do that.\n  We will be meeting with those Members again this afternoon and with \nthe Department of Transportation to see if we can come to some \nagreements on that, but meanwhile we are ready and willing to work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1033 to Amendment No. 1025\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to temporarily \nlay aside the pending amendment and call up amendment No. 1033 and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Cleland] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1033 to amendment No. 1025.\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To direct the State of Georgia, in expending certain funds, \n          to give priority consideration to certain projects)\n\n       On page 81, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 3____. PRIORITY HIGHWAY PROJECTS, GEORGIA.\n\n       In selecting projects to carry out using funds apportioned \n     under section 110 of title 23, United States Code, the State \n     of Georgia shall give priority consideration to the following \n     projects:\n       (1) Improving Johnson Ferry Road from the Chattahoochee \n     River to Abernathy Road, including the bridge over the \n     Chattahoochee River.\n       (2) Widening Abernathy Road from 2 to 4 lanes from Johnson \n     Ferry Road to Roswell Road.\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, this amendment addresses a critical issue \nof safety in my State of Georgia, and I want to thank the distinguished \nchairman of the subcommittee, Senator Murray, and the ranking member, \nSenator Shelby, from the great State of Alabama, for all their work on \nthis tremendous issue of transportation, which is the cornerstone and \nbuilding block really of our economic development in this country.\n  Recently, State Farm Insurance ranked the most deadly intersections \nin the Nation, and five intersections in Georgia made that list. \nGeorgia actually is the fastest growing State east of the Mississippi, \nand we are in many ways suffering the aftereffects in terms of our \ntraffic problems.\n  Today I am offering an amendment to improve one of the five most \ndangerous intersections in my State. Specifically, my amendment would \nrequire the State of Georgia to give priority consideration to \nimprovements that would impact the killer intersection of Abernathy \nRoad and Roswell Road in Sandy Springs, just north of Atlanta. This \ndeadly intersection is located in Metropolitan Atlanta which now has \nthe longest average vehicle miles traveled in the Nation. It has, \nsadly, become the Nation's poster child for pollution, gridlock, and \nsprawl--not a pretty sight.\n  There are 85,000 automobiles which travel this particular corridor \nevery day, and to make matters worse this artery narrows from four \nlanes to two lanes at the historic Chattahoochee River, as one crosses \nfrom Cobb County into Fulton County. The result is a bottleneck of \nhistoric proportions,\n\n[[Page S8160]]\n\nwhich has continued to be a problem for 25 years. According to an \narticle recently appearing in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution \nnewspaper, ``Fender benders never stop,'' at Abernathy and Roswell Road \nintersection and the four other killer intersections in Georgia which \nmade State Farm's list.\n  Specifically, my amendment calls for Georgia to give priority \nconsideration to improving Johnson Ferry Road from the Chattahoochee \nRiver to Abernathy Road, including the heavily traveled bridge over the \nChattahoochee River. It also calls for priority consideration in \nwidening Abernathy Road from two to four lanes from Johnson Ferry Road \nto Roswell Road. These improvements enjoy widespread bipartisan support \nin my State, from the Governor of Georgia to the Georgia Department of \nTransportation, to Cobb County and Fulton County and their elected \ncommissioners.\n  I stress that my amendment calls for no new money--no new money. The \nimprovements to this deadly intersection would come from formula funds \nalready guaranteed to Georgia.\n  As the AJC article points out, this is not a new issue. The streets \nnamed by State Farm ``have had their reputations for some time.'' In \nfact, my distinguished colleague in the House, Representative Johnny \nIsakson, has waged this important battle for 25 years. Congress now has \nan opportunity to do something which will be critically important to \nmetro Atlanta, the State of Georgia, and the safety of their citizens. \nI call on my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee and ranking \nmember from Alabama for this opportunity to talk about this important \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the Cleland \namendment be laid aside and Senator Gramm of Texas be recognized to \noffer a first-degree amendment; further, that the time until 12:20 be \nunder the control of Senator Gramm and that the time from 12:20 to \n12:25 be under the control of Senator Murray; that immediately \nfollowing the expiration of her time, we would move to a vote in \nrelation to the Cleland amendment; that there would be no second-degree \namendments in order prior to the vote; further, that following the \ndisposition of the Cleland amendment, the Senate resume consideration \nof the Gramm amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Reserving the right to object, I just ask for one \nclarification. My amendment would be a second-degree amendment to the \npending Murray amendment. With that change, I would have no objection.\n  Mr. REID. Although I did not understand that, I do now and so I move \nto amend my unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request as so \nmodified? Hearing none, it is so ordered. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Democratic \nfloor leader for working with me as he so often does in helping the \nSenate move forward in an efficient fashion.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1065 To Amendment No. 1030\n\n(Purpose: To prevent discrimination in the application of truck safety \n                               standards)\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself, Senator McCain, and Senator Domenici and I ask for its \nimmediate consideration and I ask it be read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm] for himself, Mr. McCain \n     and Mr. Domenici, proposes an amendment numbered 1065:\n       At the end of the amendment, insert the following: \n     ``Provided, That notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     section, and consistent with United States obligations under \n     the North American Free Trade Agreement, nothing in this \n     section shall be applied so as to discriminate against Mexico \n     by imposing any requirements on a Mexican motor carrier that \n     seeks to operate in the United States that do not exist with \n     regard to United States and Canadian motor carriers, in \n     recognition of the fact that the North American Free Trade \n     Agreement is an agreement among three free and equal nations, \n     each of which has recognized rights and obligations under \n     that trade agreement.''.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I think the amendment is fairly self-\nexplanatory. But since this is somewhat of a complicated issue in that \nit has to do with a Transportation appropriations bill and a rider \nwhich is now pending to it, which I am trying to amend, and in that it \nrelates to NAFTA, what I would like to do in the next few minutes is \ntry to go back to the beginning and explain what the NAFTA agreement \nsaid, what the obligations are that we have undertaken--the President \nsigning NAFTA, cosigning it with the President of Mexico and the Prime \nMinister of Canada--and what obligations we undertook as a Congress \nwhen we ratified that agreement by adopting enabling legislation, \nthereby committing not only the executive branch but the American \nGovernment to NAFTA.\n  Much has been said about truck safety. I want to make it clear to my \ncolleagues and anybody who is following this debate that so far as I am \nconcerned there is no disagreement about safety. In fact, I would argue \nthat I am more concerned and with better reason about truck safety than \nany other Member of the Senate except my colleague from Texas, Mrs. \nHutchison, since we have more Mexican trucks operating in Texas than \nany other State in the Union and the implementation of NAFTA will in \nand of itself assure that more Mexican trucks transit highways in Texas \nthan in any other State in the Union.\n  What I want and what NAFTA calls for--and I believe that I will show \nconvincingly what it calls for--is that Mexican trucks under NAFTA have \nto be subject to the same safety standards that we apply to our own \ntrucks and to Canadian trucks, no more and no less.\n  There are some circumstances where the inspection regime and the \nenforcement regime might be different, but the standards and the impact \ncannot be different. Let me begin with a document. This thick, brown \ndocument I have here is the North American Free Trade Agreement. This \nis the agreement that was signed by the President of the United States, \nthe President of Mexico, and the Prime Minister of Canada. It is the \nagreement through legislation that we ratified. I want to read from \nthis agreement as it relates to cross-border trade in services. \nTransportation is a service. The basic two commitments we made under \nthis NAFTA trade agreement are embodied in the following two articles: \nArticle 1202, national treatment, says:\n\n       Each party shall accord the service providers of another \n     party treatment no less favorable than that it accords in \n     like circumstances, to its own service providers.\n\n  Let me read that again ``each party''--obviously that is the United \nStates, Mexico, and Canada--``shall accord the service providers of \nanother party''--that is our trading partners, so ``we'' are the United \nStates, that is Mexico and Canada--``treatment no less favorable than \nthat it accords in like circumstances to its own service providers.''\n  The second provision is a most-favored-nation treatment, and it says \nbasically the same thing, but for completeness let me read both:\n\n       Each party shall accord the service providers of another \n     party treatment no less favorable than that it accords, in \n     like circumstances, to the service providers of any other \n     party or nonparty.\n\n  What is our obligation under this trade agreement that the President \nsigned and we ratified by passing legislation which was signed into \nlaw, making this agreement the law of the land?\n  Our obligation is with regard to cross-border trade in services and, \nin this particular case, trucks. We are going to treat Mexican trucks \nthe same as we treat our own trucks, and we are going to treat our own \ntrucks the same as we treat Canadian trucks.\n  The basic commitment we made when we ratified this agreement was\n\n[[Page S8161]]\n\nthat we were going to treat Mexican trucks no less favorably than we \ntreated trucks in the United States. We were going to allow in a free \ntrade agreement the free provision of trucking services in North \nAmerica, whether those trucking services were provided by an American \ncompany, a Mexican company, or a Canadian company. Each of those \ncompanies would be subject to safety standards, but the safety \nstandards would have to be the same. They would not have to be \nimplemented identically, but the standards would have to be the same.\n  There is a proviso. I want to be sure that I talk about this proviso. \nThe United States has a proviso in the agreement. That proviso is on \npage 1,631. It consists basically of three provisions. The first \nprovision says that 3 years after the date of signatory of this \nagreement, cross-border truck services to or from the border States of \nCalifornia, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, such persons will be \npermitted to enter and depart the territory of the United States \nthrough different ports of entry.\n  In other words, the first reservation or proviso was that for 3 years \nwe were going to allow Mexican trucks only in these border States. \nThree years after we entered into the agreement and it was in force, we \nwere going to allow cross-border scheduled bus services. That was the \nsecond reservation or proviso.\n  The third was that 6 years after the date of entry into force of this \nagreement we would have cross-border trucking services provided on a \nnationwide basis.\n  What does the treaty say that the President signed and that we \nratified with an act of Congress? It says, subject to phasing in a \npolicy for 3 years where the trucks operate only in border areas, after \nthe treaty was in force for 6 years we would have free trade in \ntrucking.\n  Those are the only provisos. We had no other reservations in this \ntrade agreement.\n  The basic principle of the trade agreement was that we would have \nnational treatment for Mexican trucks. Converted into simple, \nunderstandable words, that means Mexican trucks would be treated for \nregulatory purposes as if they were American trucks--no better, no \nworse. That is the law of the land. This is a ratified trade agreement \nwhich is now the law of the United States of America.\n  Let me try to explain what would be allowed under this law and what \nwould not be allowed under this law.\n  There has been a lot of discussion about whether or not the pending \nMurray amendment violates NAFTA. Let me go over, within the provisions \nof what I have just read, what constitutes a violation.\n  First of all, the provision makes it very clear that you have to have \nthe same standards. You cannot have discriminatory standards. But, \nobviously, it also makes it clear that you don't have to enforce them \nin exactly the same way. For example, it would not be a violation of \nNAFTA for us to begin our new relationship with Mexico by inspecting \nMexican trucks that come into the United States.\n  I note that would be substantially different than what we do now. \nCurrently, in the year 2000, 28 percent of all American trucks \noperating in our country were inspected. Forty-eight percent of all \nCanadian trucks operating in America were inspected. Seventy-three \npercent of all Mexican trucks were inspected.\n\n  It would not be a violation of NAFTA in admitting Mexican trucks to \noperate nationwide, for the first time for us to inspect every truck \nuntil standards were established and until a pattern was developed \nwhere it became clear that Mexican trucks were meeting American \nstandards.\n  After the point where the disqualification rate was similar on \nAmerican trucks, Canadian trucks, and Mexican trucks, then continuing \nto require an inspection of all Mexican trucks without any evidence \nthat such inspection was required to meet the standards, at some point \nthat would become a violation of NAFTA, but it would not be a violation \nin the implementation phases.\n  Senator McCain has proposed--and I support--a safety regime that \ninitially would inspect every truck coming into the United States from \nMexico. If the way the Mexican Government keeps its records is \ndifferent than the way the Canadian Government keeps its records or the \nway the United States Government keeps its records, it would not be a \nviolation of NAFTA for us to set up a separate regime in how we \ninterface with the Mexican Government to enforce uniform standards. \nThat would not be a violation. But where violations come is not in \nenforcing under different circumstances. Where violations come is when \nthe standard is different.\n  It is perfectly within the bounds of NAFTA that you can have a \ndifferent inspection regime because of the difference in circumstance. \nBut it is a violation of NAFTA, a violation of the law, and a violation \nof the letter and the spirit of an international obligation that we \nundertook and we willingly ratified when you have different standards \nfor Mexican trucks as compared to American trucks and Canadian trucks.\n  Let me give you four examples of provisions in the Murray amendment \nthat violate NAFTA.\n  Again, why do they violate NAFTA? It is not a violation of NAFTA if \nyou have a different inspection regime to achieve the same result. That \nis contemplated in NAFTA. In fact, the North American Free Trade \nAgreement arbitration panel has noted that there is nothing wrong with \nenforcing the same standards differently depending on the \ncircumstances.\n  Let me cite four violations. Under the Murray amendment, it is \nillegal for Mexican trucks to operate in the United States unless they \nhave purchased American insurance. That is a flat-out violation of \nNAFTA. Why do I say that? Because it is not required in the United \nStates that Canadian trucks purchase American insurance. In fact, the \ngreat majority of trucks that operate in the United States from \nCanada--100,685 trucks last year--the great preponderance of those \ntrucks had either Canadian insurance or British insurance. Many of them \nare insured by Lloyd's of London.\n  Requiring that Mexican trucks have American insurance is a violation \nof NAFTA because we do not require that our own trucks have American \ninsurance. We require that they have insurance, but we do not require \nthat the insurance company be domiciled in the United States of \nAmerica. We require that Canadian trucks have insurance, but we don't \nrequire that the insurance company be domiciled in the United States of \nAmerica. But the Murray amendment requires that Mexican trucks have \ninsurance from insurance companies that are domiciled in the United \nStates of America. And that is as clear a violation of NAFTA as you can \nhave a violation of NAFTA. It violates the basic principle of national \ntreatment.\n\n  Let me give you a second example.\n  We have regulations related to companies leasing their trucks. We \nhave laws and regulations in the United States. We enforce those laws \non American trucks. We enforce those laws as they relate to Canadian \ntrucks. But the Murray amendment has a special provision that applies \nonly to Mexican trucking companies. That provision is that Mexican \ntrucking companies, if they are under suspension or restriction or \nlimitations, cannot lease their trucks to another company.\n  I am not arguing that we should not have such a provision in the \nUnited States. Quite frankly, I would be opposed to it. Why would we \nforce a trucking company that cannot provide a certain service to \nsimply let its trucks sit idle when the trucks can pass a safety \nstandard and some other trucking company might use them?\n  For our own trucks, we have deemed that to be inefficient. For our \nown trucking companies, we have deemed that to be destructive of their \neconomic welfare. We have the same standard for Canadian trucks. But \nunder the Murray amendment, we do not have the same provision with \nregard to Mexican trucks. Therefore, the Murray amendment violates \nNAFTA. It violates NAFTA because you cannot say that an American \ncompany that is subject to suspension, restriction, or limitation can \nlease its trucks, that a Canadian company that is subject to the same \nrestrictions can lease its trucks, but that a Mexican company, that is \nsubject to the same restrictions, cannot lease its trucks. You can\n\n[[Page S8162]]\n\ntreat Mexican trucks any way you treat your own trucks, but you cannot, \nunder NAFTA, treat them any differently. I made that clear when I read \nthe two provisions directly related to trucking.\n  Another clear violation is a violation with regard to penalties. We \nhave penalties in the United States. If you are a bad actor, if you do \nnot maintain your trucks, if you do not operate them safely, if you \nviolate other provisions, we, in the name of public safety, do--and we \nshould--impose penalties. But the penalties that we apply to our own \ntruckers and we apply to Canadian truckers, under this bill we would \nhave a different penalty regime, and that penalty regime would prohibit \nforeign carriers from operating--reading the language--apparently, \npermanently, based on violations.\n  Look, we would have every right, under NAFTA, to say, if you violate \nthe law, you are permanently banned from ever being in the trucking \nbusiness again. We very quickly would have nobody in the trucking \nbusiness. But we can do that. If we did that to our own trucking \ncompanies, we could do it to Mexican trucking companies; we could do it \nto Canadian trucking companies. But what we cannot do--the line over \nwhich we cannot step, and which this pending measure, the Murray \namendment, does step--is treat Mexican trucks and Mexican trucking \ncompanies differently than you treat American trucking companies and \nthan you treat Canadian trucking companies.\n  Let me give one more example, and then I will sum up, because I see \nmy dear colleague, Senator McCain, is in the Chamber.\n  Another provision of the pending Murray amendment makes reference to \nthe Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999. This was a provision \nof law adopted by the Congress, signed by the President, in 1999, that \nmade revisions relative to safety.\n\n  This bill was adopted, and it applies to every American trucking \ncompany, and it applies to every Canadian trucking company. And it can \napply to every Mexican trucking company. But that is not what the \nprovision in the Murray amendment does.\n  The Murray amendment says, until the regulations that are contained \nin this 1999 law are written, and fully implemented, Mexican trucks \ncannot operate in the United States. If the bill said, American trucks \ncannot operate until it is implemented and Canadian trucks cannot \noperate until it is implemented, we might all go hungry, but that would \nnot violate NAFTA.\n  What violates NAFTA is, while we have not written the regulations and \nimplemented this act, we have 100,000 Canadian trucks operating in the \nUnited States. And by singling out Mexican trucks and saying they \ncannot come in until these regulations are written and implemented--\nwhich probably cannot be done for 2 years, according to the \nadministration; and I am for the implementation of this law; I am for \nthe regulations--but you cannot say, under a national treatment \nstandard, which we entered into--signed and ratified--you cannot say, \nAmerican trucks can operate without this law being implemented, \nCanadian trucks can operate without this law being implemented, but \nMexican trucks cannot operate without this law being implemented. That \nviolates NAFTA. And it is clearly illegal under the treaty.\n  Let me sum up by saying I have a letter from the Secretary of the \nEconomy in Mexico. Let me conclude by reading just a couple sentences, \nand then I want to yield to Senator McCain.\n  I quote the letter:\n\n       Mexico expects nondiscriminatory treatment from the U.S. as \n     stipulated under the NAFTA. . . . Each and every truck \n     company from Mexico ought to be given the opportunity to show \n     it complies fully with U.S. standards at the state and \n     federal levels. . . .\n       We are very concerned after regarding--\n\n  I am sure they mean ``looking at''--\n\n     the Murray amendment and the Administration's position \n     regarding it that the legislative outcome may . . . \n     constitute a violation of the agreement.\n\n  This amendment would guarantee that we do not discriminate against \nMexico. That is what this issue is about. This is not about safety; \nthis is about the question of whether or not Mexican trucks, in a free \ntrade agreement, where we committed to equal treatment, will in fact be \ntreated equally.\n  Madam President, it is my understanding that we have the floor for \nanother 6 minutes, and then the Senator from Washington will be \nrecognized. Didn't the unanimous consent agreement say 12:25?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The unanimous consent agreement gives the Senator until \n12:20. I have 5 minutes, and then we go to a vote.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Was it 12:20?\n  Let me ask unanimous consent that Senator McCain have 5 minutes and \nthen Senator Murray have as much time as she would like.\n  Mr. REID. The only problem with that is one of the Senators has a \npersonal situation. What we can do is have Senator McCain speak until \n12:25, and then Senator Murray speak from 12:25 until 12:30, and the \nvote will be put over by 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. We thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that that be the \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank my friend from Nevada for his \nusual courtesy and consideration. I may not even take the 5 minutes \nbecause I think we will be debating this amendment for some period of \ntime.\n  Let me assure my colleagues, we are not seeking to hold up the \nappropriations process, as was alleged earlier today. Nor is it \nacceptable for us to be told to go ahead and pass this legislation and \nhope that it is worked out in a conference where neither the Senator \nfrom Texas nor I will be present.\n\n  I won't sit idly by on this issue just because I don't happen to be \nserving on the Appropriations Committee.\n  Let me remind my colleagues, the jurisdiction of truck and bus safety \nis under the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. \nI can assure the Senate, I was not consulted in advance regarding the \nAppropriations Committee's truck provisions. This is my opportunity to \nexpress my views and seek what I believe are reasonable modifications \nto certain provisions that are simply not workable.\n  The amendment would take an important first step to ensure the intent \nof any of the provisions ultimately approved by the Congress is not \nallowed to discriminate against Mexico. This does not say they can't be \ndifferent. It says they can't discriminate.\n  Later on I will go through various provisions that clearly \ndiscriminate. I believe our disagreement is really about the question \nof whether the Murray provisions are simply different methods or if, in \ntheir totality, the 22 requirements result in an indefinite blanket \nban. The panel ruled that a blanket ban was a violation of our NAFTA \nobligation, and the senior advisers to the President of the United \nStates have clearly indicated they will recommend the President veto \nthis bill if it includes either the House-passed or pending Senate \nlanguage.\n  As the Statement of Administration Policy said yesterday: The Senate \ncommittee has adopted provisions that could cause the United States to \nviolate our commitments under NAFTA, et cetera.\n  This is a very serious issue. The lesson here should be, No. 1, we \nshould not be doing this on an appropriations bill. That is the first \nlesson. Members of the committee of jurisdiction were neither consulted \nnor involved in any of this process. Then once we were told it was \nthere, we should ignore it because it is already in there and leave it \nto the appropriators. I will not do that. I will not do that on this \nissue or any other issue, including one that is viewed, at least by the \nPresident of the United States, as a violation of the North American \nFree Trade Agreement, a solemn treaty entered into by three nations.\n  This is a very serious issue. That is why we may spend a long, long \ntime on it.\n  A suggestion has been made that the language be dropped. It was made \nby a member of the Appropriations Committee. I fully support that. Let \nthe language be dropped. We understand there is onerous language in the \nHouse. We will proceed because we can't do anything about what the \nother body does.\n\n[[Page S8163]]\n\n  Another suggestion has been to negotiate. I have to tell my \ncolleagues again, there has not been negotiations. Thankfully, there \nhas been a meeting. I have negotiated perhaps 200 pieces of legislation \nsince I have been in this body, some of them fairly serious issues such \nas campaign finance reform, a Patients' Bill of Rights, the line-item \nveto, and others. I am used to negotiating. I want us to at least come \nto some agreement. In many respects, on the 22 requirements as imposed \nby this legislation, we could have some workout language. So far there \nhas not been one comma, not one period, not one word changed in the \npresent language of the bill.\n  That is why Senator Gramm and I are required to at least see that we \ndo not discriminate against our neighbor to the south, and we will have \nother amendments to make sure that it doesn't happen, not to mention a \nviolation of a treaty in wording that is contained in an appropriations \nbill.\n  Later this year I am going to propose a rule change on which I am \nsure I will only get a handful of votes. We ought to abolish the \nAppropriations Committee. The Appropriations Committee has taken on so \nmuch power and so much authority. It was never envisioned that we would \nbe here debating language in an appropriations bill that violates a \ntreaty, a solemn treaty between three nations.\n  If I seem exercised about it, I am because we are not giving every \nSenator the voice that they deserve in representing the people of their \nState when, on appropriations bills, language of this nature is added \nwhich has such profound impact not only on domestic but international \nrelations.\n  I will discuss much further this important amendment by the Senator \nfrom Texas.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, clearly, as the Senator from Arizona \nknows, our staffs met until a little after midnight last night. We \nstand ready to continue to talk with him about any way that we can find \nthat allows him and other colleagues on the other side to believe we \nhave moved.\n  We also have to deal with a number of colleagues, both Republicans \nand Democrats, who believe as strongly as I do in safety. And we will \ncontinue to have those discussions and negotiations as long as \npossible.\n  The amendment sent forward by the Senator from Texas is about whether \nor not we can put provisions into legislation that require safety on \nour highways regarding Mexican trucks. Any effort by the Senator from \nTexas to change that and try to talk about other issues simply is not \nfact. This is an issue of safety. The provisions under the bill do, in \nfact, subject Mexican trucks to stricter provisions than do Canadian \ntrucks, but there is a very good reason for that. It is shown on this \nchart.\n  Of the trucks that are inspected, 36 percent found in violation are \nMexican trucks; 24 percent, American; only 14 percent, Canadian. It is \nvery clear that Mexican trucks crossing the border have safety \nviolations. That is why a number of our constituents across this \ncountry are telling us that, in order to move forward the NAFTA \nprovisions, we need to ensure that our people who are driving on the \nhighway, who see Mexican trucks or Canadian trucks or American trucks, \nknow they are in fact safe.\n  This isn't discriminating against Mexico. It is ensuring the safety \nof the American public is something that this Congress and this Senate \nstands behind.\n  I am a supporter of NAFTA. I am a supporter of free trade. But I am \nnot a supporter of allowing the American public traveling our highways \nto be unsafe. The provisions in the underlying bill do not violate \nNAFTA, no matter what the Senator from Texas says. That is not just my \nopinion. It is the opinion of the arbitration panel under NAFTA that \nsaid in their document:\n\n       The United States may not be required to treat applications \n     from Mexican trucking firms in exactly the same manner as \n     applications from United States or Canadian firms. . . . U.S. \n     authorities are responsible for the safe operations of trucks \n     within U.S. territory, whether ownership is United States, \n     Canadian or Mexican.\n\n  Clearly, they tell us that we have the right in this country to \nensure that trucks coming across our borders are safe. That is what the \nMurray-Shelby amendment does. It is not just my opinion. It is the \nopinion of the NAFTA arbitration panel that is very clear about that.\n  The Senator from Texas is trying to say we are violating provisions \nof NAFTA. We are not. We are assuring, as we have a right to under the \ntreaty, that people who travel in this country, families who are on \nvacation, traveling to work, dropping their kids off at school, know \nthat the trucks on the highway with them follow specific safety \nprovisions. That is what the underlying amendment does.\n  The amendment before us clearly is an attempt to gut those safety \nprovisions and will mean that families in this country cannot be \nassured of their safety.\n  We have a right under NAFTA to do that. As a supporter of NAFTA, I \nwill fight with everything I have to assure that the American public is \nsafe under any treaty obligation we have.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                       Vote On Amendment No. 1033\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nCleland amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1033.

Madam President, we have been consulting on both sides \nof the aisle over the last several moments. The authors of the Gramm-\nMcCain amendment have agreed to a vote on that amendment at 1:45. It is \nmy expectation we will have a vote at 1:45 on the McCain-Gramm \namendment and then we will at that point entertain the possibility of \nmoving to the Iranian-Libyan Sanctions Act if we can reach a unanimous \nconsent agreement with regard to time.\n  So far, one of our colleagues is still contemplating what his \nlegislative options might be, and we have not been able to reach that \nagreement. If we are not able to reach that agreement, we will proceed \nwith additional amendments to the transportation bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S8164]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 1065\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Boxer). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Are we on the Gramm-McCain amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. \nSome of us think the Murray-Shelby amendment that is in the bill is not \nstrong enough. I certainly would oppose attempts to weaken it. The \nissue here is not that we are singling out one country versus another \ncountry. The issue is safety on American highways. The fact is that we \nhave a trade agreement that links the United States, Canada, and \nMexico. I happen to have voted against that agreement because I think \nit is very hard to link two economies as dissimilar as the economies of \nthe United States and Mexico.\n  Notwithstanding my vote against the trade agreement, I don't think \nanyone who voted in favor of it ever would have contemplated, when they \nwere voting, that we would be required to compromise safety on \nAmerica's highways as part of the trade agreement. That is not logical \nat all.\n  I indicated earlier this morning that we and Mexico have very \ndifferent standards with respect to long-haul trucking. The proposition \nby the President and by the NAFTA arbitration panel that ruled on this \nis that we should allow Mexican long-haul trucks to operate within this \ncountry beyond the 20-miles in which they are currently permitted.\n  The logical question to ask is, What should we expect from the \nMexican trucking industry? Can we expect them to meet the same safety \nrequirements that are imposed on American trucking firms and drivers? \nThe answer clearly is no. They have no minimum standard hours of \nservice in Mexico. They do not carry logbooks in their truck. They, by \nand large, do not have inspections for safety on their vehicles. They \nhave no random drug testing for their truckdrivers. You can just go on \nand on. All of us understand they do not have anywhere near the kind of \nsafety inspections and regulatory requirements that we impose on our \ntrucking industry in this country.\n  Let me refer again to the San Francisco Chronicle that I thought did \na wonderful piece. I know it is just anecdotal but still it is, in my \njudgment, representative of what we find with the Mexican trucking \nindustry.\n  A reporter went to Mexico and spent 3 days riding with a Mexican \ntrucker. They had a long-haul truck carrying freight from Mexico City \nto Tijuana. They drove 1,800 miles in 3 days. The truckdriver slept 7 \nhours in 3 days. This is a truckdriver sleeps 7 hours in 3 days and \ndrives a truck that could not pass a safety inspection in this country. \nAnd we are told that a trade agreement requires us to allow Mexican \ntrucks into this country for long hauls, notwithstanding other issues.\n  It is illogical, in my judgment, to do that. This is not about \nsingling Mexico out. It is about protecting our people on our highways.\n  Do you want or do you want your loved one to look in a rearview \nmirror and see an 18-wheel truck bearing down on you with a 80,000-\npound load, wondering whether it has been inspected, whether it has \nbrakes, whether the driver has driven for 2 days and slept for 6 hours? \nDo you want that for yourself or your family or your neighbor? I don't, \nnor do I think would most Americans want that to be the case.\n  I know one might say: You are being pejorative here about Mexican \ntruckers and the Mexican trucking industry. All I can tell you is it is \na very different industry than the U.S. trucking industry. They drive a \nmuch older fleet of trucks than we do. They do not have the same \nrequirements that we have imposed on our drivers. They don't have the \nsame inspection regime that we impose on American trucks.\n  The question for this Senate is, What kind of safety requirements are \nwe going to require and impose on our highways with respect to foreign \ntrucks that are coming into this country hauling foreign goods? I have \nsaid before, let me just say it again, the ultimate perversity, in my \njudgment, of this terrible trade agreement will be to have Mexican \nlong-haul truckers driving unsafe trucks, hauling unfairly subsidized \nCanadian grain into American cities. You talk about a hood ornament to \nfoolishness, that is it.\n\n  With respect to the amendment, the amendment on the floor now is to \nweaken the Murray-Shelby language. I have spent time on the floor \nsaying, frankly, the Murray-Shelby language is not bulletproof as far \nas I am concerned, in terms of preventing unsafe vehicles from coming \nonto American highways. I would much prefer the House version, the so-\ncalled Sabo language, which the House passed 2-1, which simply said no \nfunds can be expended to approve applications to allow long-haul \nMexican trucks into this country in the next fiscal year.\n  It will take some time to integrate the trucking requirements and \nregulations between our countries. Perhaps it can be done, but there is \nnot a ghost of a chance it can be done by January 1 of next year, which \nis when President Bush says we ought to allow this to happen. There is \nnot a ghost of a chance for that to occur.\n  We had a hearing in the Commerce Committee on which I serve, and the \nSecretary of Transportation and the Inspector General for the \nDepartment of Transportation testified. The testimony was fascinating. \nWe have 27 border stations through which Mexican trucks now move into \nthis country. They are only allowed to go 20 miles into this country \nbecause of safety concerns. Yet we have found truckdrivers operating \nMexican trucks in 26 States in our country, including the State of \nNorth Dakota. So we know that the current 20-mile limit is being \nviolated.\n  At the hearing we held in the Commerce Committee, we were told of the \n27 border stations through which trucks enter this country. Only two of \nthem have inspection facilities that are open during all commercial \nhours of operations. Even in those circumstances there are a very \nlimited number of inspectors. In most cases where they have inspectors, \nthey work only a few hours a day, and they have one or two parking \nspaces for a truck.\n  We asked the Secretary and Inspector General of the Department of \nTransportation: Why do you need a parking space? They said: We just \ncan't turn them back. For example, if a truck comes and has no brakes, \nwe can't turn that truck back to Mexico. Let's not forget that 36 \npercent of the Mexican trucks inspected are placed out of service for \nserious safety violations.\n  Think about this for a moment. A truck shows up at the border with a \ndriver who has been driving for 3 days and has had 7 hours of sleep. \nThey discover it has no brakes. They don't have a parking space to park \nit. They know they cannot turn it back. Here we in the Senate are \ndebating about allowing trucks into this country unimpeded.\n  The other side says that Mexican trucks face a serious inspection \nregime. Show me. Show me the money. Show me the money you are going to \ncommit to have a rigorous regime of inspection at every single U.S.-\nMexico border crossing. Show me the money because it doesn't exist.\n  Even if you show me the money, show me the compliance regime by which \nyou send investigators down to Mexico to investigate the trucking \ncompanies before they give them the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval \nso we know when someone shows up with a logbook that it hasn't been \nfilled 10 minutes before they reached the border; that it is not \nsomebody who has been up for 20 hours. Show me the money by which you \nwill be able to show the American people they should have confidence \nthese trucks and drivers belong on America's highways.\n  You cannot do it because that money does not exist in our \nappropriations bills to accomplish that task, and everybody here knows \nit. Yet we are debating the conditions under which we allow these \ntrucks into this country.\n  The issue before us is the amendment offered by my colleagues, \nSenators Gramm and McCain. I do not support it. In fact, I do not \nsupport at all allowing Mexican trucks to enter this country during the \nnext fiscal year. What I do support is to have our people seriously \nbegin discussions on how you could create reasonably similar inspection \nopportunities and investigations of the trucking companies and their \ndrivers so at some point when we do this, that we have some certainty \nof safety on America's roads.\n  We are nowhere near that time frame. It is not going to happen in 6 \nmonths. And, in my judgment, it is not\n\n[[Page S8165]]\n\ngoing to happen in 18 months. But we have to start working on it now. \nThe best way to work on it, in my judgment, is to do what the House of \nRepresentatives did. The worst possible thing to do at this moment is \nto water down the Murray-Shelby language, which is too weak. This \namendment waters down language that I think is not sufficient.\n\n  The worst possible moment for this Senate would be to support an \namendment that carves out the foundation or weakens the foundation of a \nprotection that, in my judgment, still does not meet efficiency.\n  I am going to oppose the amendment offered today by my two \ncolleagues. I have great respect for both of them.\n  In my judgment, the Senate will do this country no favor if it rushes \nto say that the NAFTA trade agreement allows us to compromise safety on \nAmerica's roads. A trade agreement, should never, under any \ncircumstance, ask any of us to cast a vote that jeopardizes the safety \nof America's highways. No trade agreement has that right. No trade \nagreement that anyone votes for, in my judgment, should allow that to \nhappen to this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I would like to address the Gramm \namendment and the underlying issue of cross-border trucking.\n  First, I compliment Chairman Murray and Senator Shelby for their fine \nwork on this Transportation Appropriations bill and to thank them for \nthe funding provided for a number of important projects in New Mexico.\n  At the outset, let me say that I supported NAFTA, and I continue to \nsupport free trade. I do believe NAFTA is good for the country and good \nfor New Mexico. However, it is not inconsistent with NAFTA to ensure \nthat trucks and buses crossing the border from Mexico meet all of our \nsafety standards.\n  I do believe the American people expect Congress to ensure that our \nhighways are safe to all users. The fact is safety standards in Mexico \nfor trucks and buses are not the same as in our country. NAFTA doesn't \nrequire that they be consistent. Under NAFTA, domestic trucks and buses \noperating in Mexico must comply with Mexican standards and Mexican \nvehicles operating in our country must comply with our standards. The \nMexican Government has never sought reduced safety or security \nstandards for its trucks and buses.\n  The regulatory structure and systems currently in place of ensuring \nthe safety of trucks and buses in Mexico, including driver safety \nrecords, licenses, insurance records, hours of service logs, and so \nforth, are not as sophisticated as ours or those used in Canada.\n  In recognition of the differences in standards and regulatory \nregimes, the NAFTA Arbitration Panel concluded the United States did \nnot have to consider applications from Mexican vehicles exactly the \nsame as we treat U.S. vehicles. The certification process for Mexican \ntrucks and buses needs to be adapted to the different forms and \navailability of safety information used by government officials in \nMexico. The Gramm amendment would have forbidden any adaption of our \ncertification process to the safety and regulatory situation in Mexico.\n  Let me be clear, the Senate bill does not discriminate against \nMexico. The Murray language in this bill does not establish different \nsafety standards for Mexican-owned trucks and buses. Rather, the Senate \nlanguage will ensure that Mexican trucks and buses meet the same safety \nstandards that U.S. and Canadian trucks are required to meet, before \nthey are allowed free access to our highways.\n  There is another point I would like to make. The State of New Mexico \nis not ready to deal with a dramatic increase in cross-border trucks. \nThe New Mexico Department of Public Safety has not completed the truck \ninspection facility at Santa Teresa--our largest border crossing--\nbecause the Governor vetoed $1 million he had requested for the \nproject. Another facility at Orogrande, on U.S. Highway 54 in Otero \nCounty, has not been built. Both of these facilities were to include \nboth weigh-in-motion and static scales to ensure all cross-border \ntrucks comply with New Mexico's weight-distance road-use fees. They \nwill also be equipped to perform full level-one safety inspections.\n  For years Congress has failed to provide the additional funds needed \nfor border States to prepare for the additional truck traffic that we \nall know would result from NAFTA. This year, the Senate bill has \nprovided an additional $103.2 million--$13.9 for 80 additional Federal \nsafety inspectors, $18 million in safety grants to States, and $71.3 \nmillion for construction and improvement of inspection facilities such \nas those at Santa Teresa and Orogrande in my State. The House bill, \nunfortunately, does not contain this additional funding.\n  I applaud Senator Murray and the members of the Senate Committee for \nproviding this important additional funding. I urge the House to accept \nthe Senate funding levels. When the additional inspectors are in place \nand our inspection facilities are completed, I believe we will be in \nmuch better position to begin opening our borders fully to cross-border \ntrucking.\n  Again, I compliment Chairman Murray and Senator Shelby for their work \non this bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I rise today to discuss the issue of \nMexican trucks. I want to applaud Senator Murray and Senator Shelby for \ntheir efforts to craft a common-sense solution on this issue. Their \nprovision would ensure strong safety requirements and would be \nconsistent with our obligations under NAFTA.\n  As most people are well aware, the last Administration delayed \nopening the border to Mexican trucks because of serious safety \nconcerns. Indeed, numerous reports have documented these concerns \nfailing brakes, overweight trucks, and uninsured, unlicensed drivers to \nname just a few.\n  The Department of Transportation's most recent figures indicate that \nMexican trucks are much more likely to be ordered off the road for \nsevere safety deficiencies than either U.S. or Canadian trucks.\n  While a NAFTA arbitration panel has ruled that the United States must \ninitiate efforts to open the border to these trucks, we need to be \nclear about what the panel has said.\n  The panel indicated, and I quote: ``the United States may not be \nrequired to treat applications from Mexican trucking firms in exactly \nthe same manner as applications from United States or Canadian firms. . \n. . U.S. authorities are responsible for the safe operations of trucks \nwithin U.S. territory, whether ownership is United States, Canadian, or \nMexican.''\n  Moreover, U.S. compliance with its NAFTA obligations--and again to \nquote the panel: ``would not necessarily require providing favorable \nconsideration to all or to any specific number of applications'' for \nMexican trucks so long as these applications are reviewed ``on a case-\nby-case basis.''\n  In other words, the U.S. government is well within its rights to \nimpose standards it considers necessary to ensure that our highways are \nsafe.\n  The Administration has suggested that it is seeking to treat U.S., \nMexican, and Canadian trucks in the same way--but we are not required \nto treat them in the same way. That's what the NAFTA panel said.\n  With Mexican trucks, there are greater safety risks. And where there \nare greater safety risks, we can impose stricter safety standards.\n  In addition to safety, we must also be concerned about the effect on \nour environment. I am co-sponsoring an amendment by Senator Kerry to \nensure that--consistent with the NAFTA--opening our border to Mexican \ntrucks does not result in environmental damage.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nbetween now and 2:15 p.m. be equally divided between Senators Gramm and \nMurray, or their designees, and that at 2:15 either Senators Murray or \nShelby be recognized to move to table the Gramm amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I wanted to add my voice to \nthe Senator from North Dakota. It is just beyond me that in the name of \nfree trade we would be for sacrificing the safety of Americans on \nAmerican highways.\n  I had occasion to rise on the floor yesterday to point out with a \nchart all\n\n[[Page S8166]]\n\nof the huge differences between the safety standards for trucks in \nMexico and trucks in America. If there is one consistent complaint I \nhave had in a lifetime of public service to my constituents, it is \nabout safety on our roadways. How many times over the course of three \ndecades have the people of Florida said to me as their elected \nrepresentative that they saw this or that safety violation or they were \nconcerned about how the truck suddenly cut them off or that they saw a \ntruck spewing all kinds of emissions.\n  If we then allow new lower standard Mexican trucks on American \nroadways, not even to speak of the lower safety standards that have \nbeen articulated by the Senator from North Dakota, what about the \nenvironmental standards? What about all of the emissions that will be \ncoming from these trucks that we don't allow from our own trucks? Are \nwe not concerned about our environment? Are we not concerned about \nglobal warming? Are we not getting ready to seriously address the \nmileage standards of automobiles and SUVs in order to try to reduce the \nemissions into the atmosphere to try to do something about global \nwarming?\n  Here we are about to address an amendment that is going to allow for \nlower emission standards for Mexican trucks.\n  It is, as we say in the South, just beyond me that we would seriously \nallow, in the name of free trade, this safety-jeopardizing situation \nfor our American motorists on our American highways.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that under the \nquorum, the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, how much time is on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On Senator Gramm's side, 31 minutes 15 \nseconds; on the side of the Senator from Washington, 27 minutes 45 \nseconds.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Madam President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Washington \nnot only for yielding me the time but for leading this effort in what \nhas been a difficult and important moment for the Senate.\n  Madam President, it is fairly said that in an institution such as the \nSenate, every interest is ultimately represented; in an enormous \ncountry of varied industries and peoples, there is someone who will \nrepresent every cause.\n  The cause that Senator McCain brings to the Senate today is fair \ntrade. Indeed, this is a cause in which we have all participated in \nrecent years. I voted for the Canadian-American Free Trade Agreement. I \nhave come to this Chamber in favor of the World Trade Organization. We \nhave all understood that open, free, and fair trade is a foundation of \nour prosperity. But, ultimately, Senator McCain makes the point not for \nfree trade, but that any good cause can be taken to its illogical \nconclusion. This is the limit of common sense, and it is a collision \nbetween our fundamental belief in free trade and our belief in a \nvariety of other causes for more than a generation.\n  We believe in free trade, but we also believe in a number of other \nthings I want to outline for the Senate today.\n  We believe in protecting American citizens on our highways. We \nbelieve in the highest standards of automotive construction. We believe \nin emissions controls. We believe in safety from hazardous cargo. We \nbelieve in licensing and training drivers. We believe in all of these \nthings.\n  We believe in free trade, to be certain, but not to the exclusion of \neverything else. That is the issue before the Senate.\n  For 50 years, we have looked, in horror, at the death toll on \nAmerican highways. Every year, 100,000 Americans are injured on our \nAmerican highways with large trucks hauling cargo. Not hundreds but \nthousands of Americans lose their lives.\n  Democrats and Republicans and State legislatures and the American \nCongress have responded through the years by insisting on weight \nlimitations, training, and better engineering. It has been a struggle \nof generations to reduce these numbers, even as our economy grew.\n  The Senator from Arizona would bring to this Senate Chamber today a \nproposal that on January 1 the United States will allow Mexican trucks \nto come across the borders on to the highways of every State in the \nNation, recognizing that at the 27 crossing points from Mexico to \nAmerica there are inspectors, 24 hours a day, at 2. Every other road, \nduring all those hours of the day, is without inspection for weight or \nqualifications or licenses. Those trucks will traverse our highways.\n  Would the Senator from Arizona come to this Senate Chamber and ask \nthat we repeal weight limitations on American trucks? I think not.\n  Would he come to this Senate Chamber and ask that we repeal emissions \ncontrols? I doubt it.\n\n  Would he like to offer a requirement that we reduce licensing \nrequirements from the age of 21 to 18 years old? How about the \nlicensing of the trucks themselves? How about background checks for \ncriminal activity for those who will haul hazardous cargo? I doubt it.\n  The Senator from Arizona is a reasonable man. He cares about his \nconstituents and, obviously, his country. No Member of this Senate \nwould propose any of those things. Yet that is the practical effect of \nexactly what he offers.\n  Mexico, until recently, has had no restrictions on hazardous cargo--\nno warnings, no signs, no background checks. Those cargoes will flow \ninto America.\n  Mexico does not have the emissions controls of the United States that \nhave been so important in my State and other urban areas around the \ncountry. Those trucks will come into the United States.\n  Ten years ago, Senators rose in this Chamber--to the man and woman--\nas we witnessed hazardous cargoes being dumped into our rivers and \nalong our highways, as people dumped these dangerous cargoes. We did \nbackground checks to ensure the highest integrity of those hauling such \ncargoes. Mexico does not. One day it might. Today, it does not. Those \ntrucks will enter America.\n  Why would we do indirectly--by allowing unlicensed, uninspected \nMexican trucks into the United States--that which no logical person \nwould do directly in repealing our own laws? This is the effect.\n  And here is the further reality: One day, if NAFTA succeeds, the \nregulatory systems between Mexico and the United States will be similar \nas they are between the United States and Canada. One day, respect for \nenvironmental protection, hazardous cargoes, and labor rights will be \nsimilar. That will be a good day for all nations. And in that \nequalization, this border can truly be liberalized and opened fully and \nfairly, for the movement of peoples and cargoes as we now want it, for \ntrade under NAFTA.\n  We have not reached that point. These are fundamentally different \ntransportation systems. The average Mexican truck is 15 years old. That \nmeans Mexican highways have trucks that may be 20, 25, and 30 years \nold. The average truck on the interstate highway system in the United \nStates is 4 years old--with modern emissions controls, modern braking \nsystems, antilock braking systems, and equipment for foul weather, with \nproper communications.\n  I respect my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. But as they \nrise to defend NAFTA, who will rise in this Senate Chamber and defend \nthe average American family, who rides the interstate highway system, \nwith their children strapped in the back seat, to go out for the \nafternoon, already sharing our interstate highway system with\n\n[[Page S8167]]\n\nmassive 18-wheel trucks, sometimes two and three trucks long, a \nnecessity of a modern economy, now sharing that road with 18-year-old \ndrivers, potentially in 15-, 20-, and 25-year-old trucks, hauling \nmassive cargo while unlicensed, uninspected, potentially harzardous \ncargo? It is not a theoretical threat.\n\n  Of those Mexican trucks that now are inspected, theoretically, \narguably the best of the Mexican trucks, since they are subjecting \nthemselves to inspection, 40 percent are failing. The most common \nelement: their brakes don't work; second, inadequate stoplights. Who in \nthis Senate wants to be responsible for telling the first American \nfamily to lose a wife or a child that this was at the alter of free \ntrade? Free trade to be sure, but have we become so blinded in our \nfaith in free trade that we have lost our commitment to all other \nprinciples, including the safety of our own constituents?\n  I have seen causes without merit in the Chamber of the Senate before, \nbut never a cause that so little deserved advocacy. To be \nintellectually honest, the authors of this amendment that would strike \nSenator Murray's language in the bill should come to the floor with the \nfollowing proposal: The United States has a limit of 85,000 pounds for \ntrucks because heavier trucks destroy our roads and cost the taxpayers \nbillions of dollars in repair. Mexican trucks are 135,000 pounds. Come \nto the Senate floor and repeal the American limit and make it identical \nwith Mexico, if that is what you believe.\n  American drivers are 21 years old. In Mexico, they are 18. Come to \nthe Senate floor and repeal the 21-year-old limit. We are licensing \nthese drivers to ensure they can handle hazardous cargo and toxic \nwaste. Come to the Senate floor and repeal that background requirement.\n  I do not believe Senator Murray's language is perfect. I do not \nbelieve in a year or in 18 months we can reconcile differences between \nthe trucking industry in Mexico and the United States. Indeed, I do not \nbelieve we can do so in a decade.\n  I am certain of this: There is no chance of having an inspection \nregime in place by January 1--none. This is not only wrong; this is \nirresponsible. I, for one, if I were the only Member of this \ninstitution, would not have my fingerprints on the loss of life that \nwill follow.\n  Yes, there is an advocate for every cause in the Senate. Perhaps \nevery cause should be heard, every voice should be recognized. This \ncause does not deserve advocacy. Free trade, yes, but to the exclusion \nof the safety and interests of our citizens, never.\n  I rise in support of Senator Murray's language and urge the Senate to \nreject the amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the last 5 \nminutes of the debate be reserved for Senator Shelby.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that time spent under the quorum \ncall be equally divided and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  (Mrs. MURRAY assumed the chair.)\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be told when \nI have used up to 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Then I will end my remarks and the Senator from Arizona \ncan have the floor at that time.\n  Madam President, I have listened to this debate, and I have \nparticipated in it. I believe, in light of Senator Torricelli's \nremarks, that if he was the only one in the Senate who felt strongly \nabout this issue and how right you were on the issue, Madam President, \nhe would stand and be proud.\n  I want to make it clear that a lot of us do agree with you about the \nimportance of passing your underlying language and your amendment that \nyou offered to strengthen the safety of NAFTA trucks.\n  As a member of the Commerce Committee--I am a new member--I had the \nhonor of sitting through the hearing that I actually had requested that \nSenator Hollings hold on the issue of NAFTA trucks. I have nothing but \nthe highest regard for former Congressman Mineta, now the Secretary of \nTransportation, but I believe very much--and this is with great \nrespect--that he is not really ready to make January 1 the deadline to \nallow these trucks into the interior of the country.\n  One of the things that happened at that hearing was one of the \nwitnesses said something to the effect that those of us who were \nconcerned on the safety issue were really against Mexico. I remember at \nthe time Senator Dorgan, in a sense, chastised that particular witness \nand said: This is ridiculous.\n  I said at the time, and I want to repeat now, that the reason I feel \nso strongly that the trucks coming through our country should be safe \nis to protect the people that I represent in California, 30 to 40 \npercent of whom are Mexican Americans.\n  I want to protect all the people. I want to make sure, as Senator \nTorricelli says, truckdrivers who come through the border are rested; \nthat they don't have any medical condition that might prevent them from \ndriving for hours; that in fact we can test them for drugs as we do \nwith our own truckdrivers. Your decal amendment that is so important \nwould say that the truck companies in Mexico would have to comply with \nour safety standards, and they would be inspected in Mexico and not \nhave situations that we have now where the trucks are stopped at the \nborder and, by the way, 2 percent of the trucks coming in are stopped \nbecause we don't have enough enforcement. And as Senator Torricelli \nsaid, 40 percent of them fail; my figure is about 36 percent, but it is \nsomewhere in that vicinity.\n  And then I asked the inspector general, who appeared at the Commerce \nCommittee hearing, why it was that we didn't send these trucks back. He \nsimply said, ``because they have no brakes.'' I would not want to be \nthe Senator in this Chamber who votes against Senator Murray's safety \nlanguage and has to face the parent of a child who is killed, or a \nfamily of survivors of someone who is hurt or killed.\n  I was at a press conference about a year ago where I was calling for \ntougher standards for our own trucks, our own drivers. We still have \nfar too many injuries on our own highways, and we need to even tighten \nthose up. What we are ready to do here with this loophole amendment \noffered by Senator Gramm is to dilute your provision and Senator \nShelby's provision that would, in fact, simply ensure that we are ready \nfor this phase of NAFTA. We cannot be so ideological, bow down at the \naltar of free trade, and blind ourselves to reality. If it means \nsomebody makes a complaint against us, I want to be there, I say to my \nfriend from Arizona. I will defend us. I will say to those folks \nsitting in judgment of us that we want our people safe on the roads.\n  When I asked former Congressman Mineta, now Secretary Mineta, about \nthis, he said the law says we cannot allow trucks on our roads that \ndon't meet the standards. That is right, but if we can't enforce it, \nwhat good is it? If we can't enforce the law, what good is it?\n  If we have a law, and we do, which says you can't walk into a \nsupermarket and pull out a lethal weapon and threaten someone, but we \nnever enforce it, and there are robberies going on all over the country \nand nobody is enforcing it and going after the bad guys, what good is \nit?\n  So until we have enforcement mechanisms in place where all trucks are \ninspected either at the border or they have a decal before they cross, \nI am not afraid to fight for our right in a court that is looking at \nNAFTA. Senator Murray and Senator Shelby say very clearly that their \nprovision does not violate NAFTA--does not violate NAFTA. The fact is, \nI happen to know that Senator Murray supports many free trade \nagreements. The Senator's State depends on free trade. Yet you are the \none who has taken a considered approach to this. You have made sure\n\n[[Page S8168]]\n\nyour language doesn't interfere with NAFTA. You are simply saying that \nwe want to make sure before these provisions go into effect, where \nthese long-haul trucks can come in, that they, in essence, are \ncompatible with our laws. What a straightforward, commonsense idea. I \ncan't imagine how the American people could understand it if we would \ndo anything less. We have to have the same standards, and we have to \nenforce the same standards.\n  Therefore, I strongly support Senator Murray's amendment in the \nunderlying bill, the decal amendment.\n  I yield the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I could not help but be entertained by \nthe remarks of the Senator from California who says--I guess she feels \nif she says it often enough, it will be true--that it doesn't violate \nNAFTA; it doesn't violate NAFTA; it doesn't violate NAFTA.\n  Well, although she may not agree with the results of the last \nelection, the fact is that the President of the United States happens \nto be an individual who believes that it is in violation of NAFTA, and \nhis senior advisers have said the Murray language is in violation of \nNAFTA, and the President has said he may have to veto because of NAFTA. \nSo with all consideration for the views that the Murray language is not \nin violation of NAFTA, the fact is, according to the President's senior \nadvisers, it is.\n  This morning at 11:15, the President said:\n\n       I also am aware that there are some foreign policy matters \n     in the Congress. And I urge Congress to deal fairly with \n     Mexico and to not treat the Mexican truck industry in an \n     unfair fashion; that I believe strongly we can have safety \n     measures in place that will make sure our highways are safe. \n     But we should not single out Mexico. Mexico is our close \n     friend and ally and we must treat them with respect and \n     uphold NAFTA and the spirit of NAFTA.\n\n  So every Senator is entitled to their views; I view them with great \nrespect. But the reality is that the President of the United States and \nhis senior advisers--unless changes are made, the President's senior \nadvisers will recommend that the President veto the bill. So that is \nthe situation on the ground, as we say.\n  This amendment that is pending, however, really has everything to do \nwith discrimination, and this amendment is very simple in its language \nbecause all it says is:\n\n       Nothing in this section shall be applied so as to \n     discriminate against Mexico by imposing any requirements on a \n     Mexican motor carrier that seeks to operate in the United \n     States that do not exist with regard to United States and \n     Canadian motor carriers, in recognition of the fact that the \n     North American Free Trade Agreement is an agreement among \n     three free and equal nations, each of which has recognized \n     rights and obligations under that trade agreement.\n\n  We need to talk about some facts for a minute. These are the numbers \nof trucks and inspections in the United States. There are 8 million \nregistered trucks in the United States; 2.3 million of them have been \ninspected. That is 28 percent. Now, 100,685 Canadian trucks have been \nin the United States, of which 48,000, or 48 percent have been \ninspected. There have been 63,000 trucks from Mexico operating in the \nUnited States, of which 46,000, or 73 percent of them have been \ninspected.\n  According to the McCain-Gramm-Domenici amendment, which the \nadministration agrees with, we would make sure that every Mexican truck \nis inspected--every single one.\n  This chart says ``inspection results/out-of-service rates.'' It says \n8 percent in the United States, 9.5 in Canada, and 6 percent in Mexico. \nThe vehicle out-of-service rate for Mexico is 36 percent. The problem \nis that it has been 36 percent, as opposed to 14 percent for Canada, \nand 24 percent for the United States. That is why we have in our \nsubstitute some very detailed, important, and very stringent \nrequirements, including:\n  The Department of Transportation must conduct a safety review of \nMexican carriers before the carrier is granted conditional operating \nauthority to operate beyond U.S. municipalities and commercial zones on \nthe U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n  The safety review must include verification of available performance \ndata and safety management programs, including drug and alcohol \ntesting, drivers' qualifications, drivers' hours-of-service records, \nrecords of periodic vehicle inspections, insurance, and other \ninformation necessary to determine the carrier's preparedness to comply \nwith U.S. motor carrier safety rules and regulations.\n  It requires every vehicle operating beyond the commercial zones of a \nmotor carrier with authority to do so to display a Commercial Vehicle \nSafety Alliance decal obtained as a result of a level 1 North American \nstandard inspection or level V vehicle-only inspection, and imposes \nfines on motor carriers operating a vehicle in violation of this \nrequirement to pay a fine of up to $10,000.\n  It requires the DOT to establish a policy that any safety review of a \nmotor carrier seeking operating authority to operate beyond U.S. \nmunicipalities and commercial zones on the U.S.-Mexico border should be \nconducted onsite at the motor carrier's facilities when warranted by \nsafety considerations or the availability of safety performance data.\n  It requires Federal and State inspectors, in conjunction with a level \n1 North American standard inspection, to verify electrotonically or \notherwise, the license of each driver of such a motor carrier \ncommercial vehicle crossing the border, and for DOT to institute a \npolicy for random electronic verification of the license of drivers of \ncommercial vehicles at U.S.-Mexico border crossings.\n  There are two pages in the McCain-Gramm-Domenici substitute that \nrequire additional inspections, verification, insurance, rulemakings, \net cetera. But all of those are not in violation of NAFTA. One reason \nwhy they are not is because of this information here. Federal motor \ncarrier safety laws and regulations apply to all commercial motor \nvehicles operating in the United States.\n  When the United States-Mexico border is open, all Mexican carriers \nthat have authority to operate beyond the commercial zones must comply \nwith all Federal motor carrier safety laws and regulations and all \nother applicable laws and regulations.\n  Mexican carriers will be subject to the same Federal and State \nregulations and procedures which apply to all other carriers that \noperate in the United States. These include all applicable laws and \nregulations administered by the U.S. Customs Service, the Immigration \nand Naturalization Service, the Department of Labor, and the Department \nof Transportation. All of these Federal motor carrier safety \nrequirements have to be complied with by any carrier that comes up from \nMexico.\n  For the illumination of my colleagues, this is what is required for a \nCanadian carrier to operate within the United States of America. This \nis off the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's Web site.\n  Basically, what is required is, over the Internet, to verify under \npenalty of perjury, under the laws of the United States of America, \nthat all information supplied on the form or anything relating to the \ninformation is true and correct. Then $300 is sent in and the carrier \noperates in the United States of America. That is what is required as \nfar as Canadian vehicles are concerned.\n  I hope someday carriers from Mexico will be able to exercise exactly \nthat same procedure. We all know that is not possible now, and that is \nwhy we need very much to have additional requirements until such time \nas Mexican carriers meet the standards that prevail in the United \nStates of America.\n  I have a number of comments about section 343, the so-called Murray \nlanguage, and I will not go through them right now because the subject \nof discussion is the pending Gramm amendment. The pending Gramm \namendment basically says that we cannot discriminate against Mexico. \nThis amendment was carefully crafted.\n  In all candor, so that everybody knows what they are voting on, some \nof the language in the so-called Murray language would be negated by \nthis because in the view of the President, in the view of this Senator, \nin the view of the Department of Transportation, and in the view of the \ncountry of Mexico, the language contained is discriminatory. This is a \nvery important issue to our neighbors to the south. This is a very \nimportant issue in our relations with Mexico.\n\n[[Page S8169]]\n\n  It is a very important issue for those who purport to be a friend of \nthe country of Mexico. This is a very important issue. The fact that we \nare going to vote on whether we choose to or choose not to discriminate \nagainst the country of Mexico, and we are taking a recorded vote on \nthat issue, is one of significant importance.\n  I hope all of my colleagues will vote, no matter how they feel about \nthe Gramm-McCain amendment or the substitute on which Senator Gramm, \nSenator Domenici and I will seek a vote at the appropriate time.\n  We intend to stay on this issue. We intend to do whatever we can in \nthe future to make sure the Appropriations Committee does not legislate \non an appropriations bill, particularly where it affects trade \nagreements between sovereign nations, and we intend to see this issue \nthrough. We are heartened by the support and commitment of the \nPresident of the United States as expressed as recently as a couple of \nhours ago.\n  Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Boxer). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, it is my understanding that quorum \ncalls will be equally divided. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator needs to make that request.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call be equally \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I know the last 5 minutes of our time \nis yielded to Senator Shelby, so I ask unanimous consent to use 1 \nminute of that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I rise to make a very simple point. The \nSenator from Arizona listed a series of provisions contained in his \nproposed substitute. Those provisions, such as the requirement to \ninspect every truck, would apply to Mexico, not to Canada, and that \nreally is the point. We can and should impose strict requirements on \nMexico.\n  The Senator cited inspection statistics. These are the results of \nthose inspections. We believe very clearly, as the NAFTA arbitration \npanel has stated, that the underlying provisions are not a violation of \nNAFTA, and we think the Senate should uphold the NAFTA arbitration \npanel by voting to table the Gramm amendment.\n  I know Senator Shelby has 5 minutes remaining on his side. How much \ntime is left on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator McCain has 17\\1/2\\ minutes left, and \nthere is 5 minutes left on the side of the opponents of the Gramm \namendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, first of all, we do not disagree over \nthe fact that the February report of the NAFTA Dispute Resolution Panel \ndoes not prevent the United States from imposing different requirements \non foreign carriers. In fact, let me quote from the report:\n\n       It is important to note what the Panel is not determining. \n     It is not making a determination that the Parties of NAFTA \n     could not set the level of protection that they consider \n     appropriate in pursuit of legitimate regulatory objectives. \n     It is not disagreeing that the safety of trucking services is \n     a legitimate regulatory objective.\n\n  I agree with that.\n  The panel goes on to say:\n\n       The United States may not be required to treat applications \n     from Mexican trucking firms exactly the same as applications \n     from the U.S. or Canadian firms, as long as they are reviewed \n     on a case by case basis.\n\n  That is why I pointed out the difference between how a Canadian \ncarrier can enter the United States, basically filing over the \nInternet, as opposed to the provisions we have in our substitute which \nare very stringent and detailed.\n\n       However, in order to satisfy its own legitimate safety \n     concerns the United States decides, exceptionally, to impose \n     requirements on Mexican carriers that differ from those \n     imposed on U.S. or Canadian Carriers, then any such decision \n     must (a) be made in good faith with respect to a legitimate \n     safety concern and (b) implement differing requirements that \n     fully conform with all relevant NAFTA provisions.\n\n  I believe that what our disagreement is really all about is the \nquestion of whether the Murray provisions are simply ``different \nmethods'' or, if in their totality, the 22 requirements --there are 22 \nrequirements in the Murray language--result in an indefinite blanket \nban. The panel ruled that a blanket ban was a violation of our NAFTA \nobligations.\n  As I have already mentioned on several occasions, the administration \nestimates that the Senate provisions under section 343 would result in \na further delay in opening the border for another 2 years or more. This \nwould be a direct violation of NAFTA. It effectively provides a blanket \nprohibition on allowing any Mexican motor carrier from operating beyond \nthe commercial zones. Does that permit a case-by-case review of a \ncarrier? I do not believe so.\n  I would like to find one objective observer who does not view the \nMurray language as delaying implementation of NAFTA by 2 or 3 years. I \ndo not see how in the world any objective observer could believe that \nthe requirements, including onsite inspections and the inspector \ngeneral going down into Mexico, could possibly do anything but delay \nthe implementation of NAFTA, and that is what it is all about. This \nview is shared by a number of us, as well as the President's senior \nadvisers.\n  Let me give an example of a provision that could be viewed as more \nthan simply different. It concerns how a Mexican carrier would receive \nauthority to operate in the United States under the Murray provision.\n  The Murray provision requires the Federal Motor Carrier Safety \nAdministration to conduct a full safety compliance review before \ngranting conditional operating authority and again before granting \npermanent authority to assign a safety rating to the carrier. The \nreviews must be conducted onsite in Mexico.\n  The problem with that requirement is that a ``compliance review'' \nassesses carrier performance while operating in the United States. It \nis conducted when a carrier's performance indicates a problem--that it \nis ``at risk.'' As a technical matter, a full-fledged compliance review \nof a Mexican carrier would be meaningless since that carrier would not \nhave been operating in this country and would not have the type of \nperformance data that is audited during a compliance review. If the \nDepartment of Transportation is forced to conduct what would largely be \na meaningless compliance review, every carrier will receive a \nsatisfactory rating because there will be no records or data on which \nto find violations of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations.\n  There are, three more important provisions that clearly would delay \nthe implementation of NAFTA, and that is clearly a violation of NAFTA.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator reserves the \nremainder of his time. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, we have heard a lot about this debate in \nthe last few days, what it is about and\n\n[[Page S8170]]\n\nwhat it is not about. I believe the Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, my \ngood friend, continues to define this issue as one about identical \ntreatment of Mexican trucks, U.S. trucks, and Canadian trucks.\n  Unfortunately, for my good friend from Texas, this is not about \ncreating a rubber-stamp approach to trucks entering our country and \ndriving on our highways. This is about providing an approach tailored \nto the out-of-service rates we see in Mexican trucks.\n  Unfortunately, for the position put forth by my good friends from \nTexas and Arizona, under NAFTA, we have the right and we have the \nobligation to provide for safety on our highways in the United States \nand to regulate Mexican trucks entering this country as long as such \nregulations are ``no greater than necessary for legitimate regulatory \nreasons such as safety.'' This language came from the arbitration \npanel.\n  The Murray-Shelby provision is clearly within the legitimate safety \ninterests that we have an obligation to regulate in this country. Also, \nunfortunately, I believe, for my colleague from Texas, his argument \nthat the Murray-Shelby provision violates NAFTA, violations of NAFTA \nare not judged by the Senate or even the administration. Alleged \nviolations of NAFTA are ruled on by an arbitration panel. That is part \nof the agreement. His contention that NAFTA would be violated does not \nmake it so.\n  If you want to talk about discrimination, let's talk about \ndiscrimination against the American driver. Nothing in NAFTA should be \nmisread to require that we give Mexican drivers a pass on safety \nstandards while we strip our drivers of their licenses for infractions \nthat may be honored in Mexico or which the Senator's amendment tells us \nthat we should ignore because to do otherwise would violate a treaty \nthat I never supported.\n  This is about enforcing the safety regulations of the United States \nof America. That is within the purview of NAFTA, as it would be for the \nMexican Government to do likewise.\n  At the proper time, I will move to table the Gramm-McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama and the Senator from \nWashington have 2 minutes remaining. The supporters have 13 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, how much time do we have on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirteen minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, first, I want to read a statement made \nearlier today by the President related to this issue. This is what the \nPresident said:\n\n       I urge Congress to deal fairly with Mexico and to not treat \n     the Mexican truck industry in an unfair fashion. I believe \n     strongly we can have safety measures in place that will make \n     sure our highways are safe. Mexico is our close friend and \n     ally, and we must treat them with respect and uphold NAFTA \n     and the spirit of NAFTA.\n\n  The issue before us is not safety. There is agreement in the Senate \nthat we want to inspect Mexican trucks, and there is a commitment to \ninspect every single Mexican truck. We only inspect 36 percent of the \nCanadian trucks. No one disagrees that in starting up a new system with \nMexico it is proper, to begin with, to inspect every single truck. The \nissue is not safety; the issue is discrimination.\n  Basically, when we signed NAFTA, the President made the commitment \nand we ratified it, and that commitment said with regard to trucks \ncoming across the border, going in both directions, all three nations \ncommitted that ``each party shall accord the service providers of \nanother party treatment no less favorable than that it accords, in like \ncircumstances, with its own service providers.''\n  That is what we committed. Convert it into simple English, we \ncommitted to treat Mexican trucking companies operating in the United \nStates exactly as we treat American trucking companies, and exactly as \nwe treat Canadian trucking companies. The issue before us is not \nsafety. The issue before us is discrimination and protectionism.\n  We have every right to inspect Mexican trucks. If you look at the \nagreement, we do not have to--in implementing uniform standards, we can \nimplement them differently with regard to Mexican trucks if \ncircumstances are different. Senator McCain and I, and the President, \nhave said in our initial implementation it is proper to inspect every \nMexican truck, whereas we inspect only one out of three Canadian trucks \nand only one out of four American trucks each year.\n  But what we cannot do and what the Murray amendment does is set \ndifferent standards for Mexican trucks than it sets for American trucks \nand for Canadian trucks.\n  It is one thing to say we are going to have safety standards and \nMexican trucks have to live up to those standards, but it is quite \nanother thing to set totally different standards. Let me give four \nexamples. It is very simple.\n  Today we have trucks operating all over America, 100,000 of them from \nCanada, and virtually none of those trucks are insured by American \ninsurance companies. We have American trucks operating in the United \nStates that are not insured by American insurance companies. Many \nCanadian trucks are insured by Canadian companies, or by Lloyd's of \nLondon. American trucks in some cases are insured by Canadian companies \nand by British companies. But the Murray amendment puts a requirement \non Mexico that we do not put on ourselves, that we do not put on \nCanada. That requirement is having to have insurance from companies \ndomiciled in America. That is a flatout violation of NAFTA. No denial \ncan change that fact. That is a clear violation of the treaty into \nwhich we entered. It is illegal and it is unfair.\n  We have, in the Murray amendment, three other provisions that clearly \nviolate NAFTA. It is one thing to say we are going to have penalties \nand that those penalties are going to apply to anybody operating a \ntruck in the United States of America. I want penalties because I want \nsafe roads and highways. We have more Mexican trucks operating in Texas \nthan any other State in the Union. I want safety.\n  But to say that while we have various penalties for American trucks \nand truckers, for Canadian trucks and truckers, that we are going to \nhave an entirely different penalty regime for Mexican truckers, so that \na violation can forever ban a Mexican trucking company from operating \nin the United States is discrimination. It is illegal, it violates \nNAFTA. If we wanted to say if you are an American trucking company and \na Canadian trucking company and you have a single violation that you \nare forever banned from being in the trucking business, that would be \nGATT legal. It would be crazy because you can not operate a big \ntrucking company without some violations. But we could do it, and it \nwould be legal.\n  But what you cannot do under NAFTA is you cannot say we are going to \nhave one set of penalties with regard to American trucks and Canadian \ntrucks, and a totally different set of penalties with regard to Mexican \ntrucks.\n  Under our current trade agreements, United States companies and \nCanadian companies can lease trucks to each other. In fact, that is \nnecessary for good business. If you do not have the business, you own \nthe trucks, they are sitting there, they meet safety requirements, you \nlease them to somebody else. If you do not have that right, you do not \nstay in the trucking business long.\n\n  But the Murray amendment has a unique provision that relates only to \nMexico. Only Mexican truck operators are forbidden the right to lease \ntrucks if they are in violation in any way.\n  We might want to say, if you have any violation, you cannot lease \ntrucks. If we apply that to Americans and to Canadians, we can apply it \nto Mexicans. But what you cannot do is have different standards in a \nfree trade agreement, where we committed to treat Mexican producers \nexactly the way we do our own.\n  Finally, on safety standards, we passed a law in 1999 changing safety \nstandards with regard to trucks. I want to implement that bill. The \nregulations have not been written and it has not been implemented. The \nMurray amendment says because it has not been implemented, that Mexican \ntrucks cannot come into the United States even though we have entered \ninto a treaty, which has been ratified, saying they can.\n\n[[Page S8171]]\n\n  If the Murray amendment had said because we have not promulgated \nregulations, because we have not implemented these new rules, that \nCanadian trucks cannot operate in the United States, that American \ntrucks cannot operate in the United States, and Mexican trucks cannot \noperate, we would all go hungry tonight, but that would be legal with \nregard to the agreement that we entered into called NAFTA. But to say \nthat because we have not promulgated the rules and because we are not \nat this point therefore enforcing these rules, that Canadian trucks can \noperate and American trucks can operate but Mexican trucks cannot \noperate, is a clear, irrefutable, indisputable violation of NAFTA.\n  Basically what we are seeing here is a choice between special \ninterest groups and high on the list is the Teamsters Union. They don't \nwant Mexican trucks because they don't want competition.\n  My point is we should have thought about that when we approved this \ntrade agreement because we made a solemn national commitment to allow \nMexican trucks to operate in the United States, American trucks and \nCanadian trucks to operate in Mexico. Our credibility all over the \nworld in hundreds of trade agreements is on the line. If we go back on \nthe commitment we made to our neighbor, if we discriminate against \nMexico, how are we going to have any moral standing in asking other \ncountries to comply with the agreements they negotiated with the United \nStates?\n  It is my understanding, while I think we should have more time to \ndebate this--one of the authors of the amendment, Senator Domenici, has \nnot had an opportunity to speak--and while I would like to have more \ntime, it is my understanding there is going to be a motion to table. It \nis also my understanding that there may be a cloture motion tomorrow.\n  I want to assure my colleagues that I am not sure where the votes \nare, but I am sure what my rights as a Senator are. I want to assure \nyou that I am going to use every power that I have as a Member of the \nU.S. Senate to see that we do not discriminate against a country that \nhas a 1,200-mile border with my State. I am going to use every power I \nhave as a United States Senator to see that we do not violate NAFTA, to \nsee that we do not destroy the credibility of the United States in \ntrade relations around the world.\n  What that means is we will have, not one cloture vote, we will have \nfive cloture votes. At some point here people are going to want to go \non to other business. I want to assure my colleagues if there is not \nsome compromise here that produces a bill the President can sign, we \nare not going to other business.\n  Finally, let me conclude by saying this bill is not going to become \nlaw until we comply with the treaty. The President is not going to sign \nthe bill. We can fool around and have five cloture votes and hold up \nall other business until we get back from Labor Day. We can stay in \nAugust. We are going to see the full rules and protections of the \nSenate here because this is a critically important agreement.\n  When you start not living up to agreements that you made with your \nneighbor, you start to get into trouble, whether you are a person or \nwhether you are the greatest nation in the history of the world.\n  I think the Murray amendment is wrong. Senator McCain and I have been \nwilling to compromise. The President is willing to compromise. But we \nare not going to compromise on violating NAFTA. That is a compromise \nthat is not going to occur. We can come up with a safety regime. It \ndoesn't have to be identical with Canada and Mexico, but the \nrequirements have to be identical. That is what the trade agreement \nsays.\n  The Murray amendment in four different areas violates NAFTA. This has \nto be fixed if we are going to go forward.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the pending amendment, which I have \noffered with Senator McCain and Senator Domenici. I urge them to oppose \na motion to table. I assure them that this issue is not going to go \naway. The Senate may vote to discriminate against Mexico, but they are \ngoing to get to vote on it on many occasions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time is left on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has 2 minutes 1 \nsecond.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this amendment that is before us, no \nmatter what we hear, is about safety, is about our ability as a country \nto ensure that our constituents--whether they are traveling to work, \ntaking their kids to daycare, going on vacation, or traveling down the \nhighway--are safe. We have a right in this country to ensure the safety \nof our constituents.\n  I hear our opponents saying this is a violation of NAFTA. Do not take \nmy word for it. Take the word of the NAFTA arbitration panel. They have \nclearly told us that the United States may not be required to treat \napplications from Mexican trucking firms in exactly the same manner as \napplications from United States or Canadian firms. United States \nauthorities, in their words, are responsible for the safe operation of \ntrucks within United States territory, whether ownership is United \nStates, Canadian, or Mexican.\n  We have a right under treaties right now to ensure the safety of our \ncitizens on our highways. That is what this amendment is about. That is \nwhat this vote is about--whether or not we will undermine that safety \nall on our own here in the Senate and go beyond what the NAFTA panel \nhas told us we can do and undermine the NAFTA panel, or whether we are \ngoing to stand up for safety. That is what this amendment is about.\n  I urge all of our colleagues to vote on the side of families and \nsafety.\n  I yield to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I move to table the Gramm-McCain amendment \nand ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to thank a number of my \ncolleagues, especially Senator Gramm and Senator McCain. I also \nespecially thank the distinguished Republican leader for his help in \ngetting us to this point.\n  We have been discussing throughout the day the schedule for the \nbalance of the day. I will propound a unanimous\n\n[[Page S8172]]\n\nconsent request for the moment that will allow us now to take up the \nIran-Libya Sanctions Act. Following that, it will be my intention to \nmove to a couple of the nominations that we agreed yesterday we would \ntake up. There are time requests for debate on both nominees, and we \nwill accommodate those requests as the unanimous consent provided for \nlast night.\n  With that understanding, I will propound the request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following the vote with respect to the \nGramm amendment, regardless of the outcome, the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 98, S. 1218, the Iran-Libya sanctions \nbill, and that the bill be considered under the following limitations: \nthat there be a time limitation of 60 minutes for debate on the bill, \nwith the time equally divided and controlled between the chairman and \nranking member, or their designees; that the only first-degree \namendment in order to the bill be a Murkowski amendment regarding \nIraq's oil; that there be 90 minutes for debate with the time divided \nas follows: 60 minutes under the control of Senator Murkowski, 30 \nminutes under the control of the chairman and ranking member, or their \ndesignees; that upon the use or yielding back of time on the amendment, \nthe amendment be withdrawn; that upon the use or yielding back of all \ntime, the bill be read the third time, and the Senate proceed to vote \non passage of the bill, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, from the \nstandpoint of clarification, the amendment that I am prepared to offer, \naccording to the statement by the majority leader, would be withdrawn. \nIt had been my request of both leaderships that the condition on \nwithdrawing the amendment would be the assurance that I would have an \nopportunity for an up-or-down vote at a future time on the issue of oil \nimports from Iraq. I request consideration, if indeed the leadership \nwill consider that, associated with the appropriate opportunity--maybe \non one of our trade agreements that will come before this body--that I \nwould be allowed at least not more than an hour and a half or 2 hours \nto debate that and have the assurance of an up-or-down vote. I ask the \nleadership for that consideration.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if I may respond, Senator Murkowski has \nreiterated the understanding we have on both sides of the aisle with \nregard to his offering an amendment at a later date on Iraq oil on \nanother bill. I will certainly provide him with a vote in relation to \nthat amendment when that time comes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, are the intentions, after \ndisposition of the nominations, to return to the pending legislation?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. In answer to my colleague from Arizona, the intention \nwould be that we go right back to the Transportation appropriations \nbill. What I am hoping, frankly, is that over the course of the next \nseveral hours we can continue our discussions. Our staff has indicated \nagain that they are willing to begin the discussions in earnest, with \nthe hope that we might proceed with some expectation that we find some \nresolution. It is our hope that while our colleagues debate these other \nmatters, that will free up those people who have been involved in this \nissue to talk, and it would be our intention to come back to this.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Further reserving my right to object, we have just \nestablished 35 votes, which is sufficient to sustain a Presidential \nveto, which has been threatened on this bill. I hope it will motivate \nthe other side to engage in a meaningful negotiation, which has not \nhappened so far, so that we can resolve the situation.\n  I reiterate my commitment to remain through a series of cloture \nvotes, if necessary, until we get this issue resolved to the \nsatisfaction of those who are concerned about it, including the \nPresident of the United States.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Reserving the right to object, just for clarification \nfrom the leader, the Senator from Alaska requested specifically the \nassurance of an up-or-down vote, and I believe the majority leader \nindicated a reference ``in relation to.'' I don't want to \nmischaracterize the intent. I wanted to have an understanding I would \nbe afforded an opportunity for an up-or-down vote.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will have no objection to an up-or-down vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I \nwant to say that I appreciate the majority leader's comments about the \nneed for us to have a serious effort to find a compromise on this issue \nthat is still pending on the Transportation bill. I thank him for the \nassurances given to Senator Murkowski.\n  As I understand it now, we will go to the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act \nand have 60 minutes on that bill. Senator Murkowski will have his time, \nand we will go to final passage. Then after some debate time, we will \nhave one or two votes on nominees. Did the Senator clarify that?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, in answer to the Republican leader's \nquestion, the answer is, we would provide for the debate allotted under \nthe unanimous consent that we were able to arrive at last night. In \nregard to the Horn nomination and the nomination for the Administrator \nof the SBA, in both cases, as I understand it, rollcalls have been \nrequested. So it is my intention that we would have debate on the two \nnominees and then the votes on those yet tonight. Then we will revert \nback to Transportation.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator. Further reserving the right to object, \nI know there are strong feelings on the question of the U.S.-Mexican \ntruck crossing at the border, a lot of ramifications, and making sure \nit is NAFTA compliant, and making sure the trucks come into the country \nin a safe way after being inspected. I understand all of that.\n  This is an appropriations bill and this language should not even be \non this bill. Clearly, though, this can be resolved.\n  While everybody is in a position of wanting to get dug in, let me \npoint out that this issue could go on for days. It is really not \nnecessary. I have never seen an issue that is more clearly in the realm \nof having an agreement worked out. We ought to do it. I urge both sides \nto do their very best to accomplish that.\n  I thank Senator Daschle for giving these answers. I withdraw my \nreservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nmajority leader?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not, I wanted \nto inform the majority leader that the proposition of discussions about \nthe Murray language, in my judgment, should not just be among those who \nsupport the language and those who wish to weaken it. Others wish to \nstrengthen it. While there is a disagreement on this issue, it is not \njust on one side. I hope if discussions ensue in the coming hours on \nthis subject, they include those of us who believe the Murray language \nis not strong enough.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I say to Senator Dorgan that I don't \nthink we ought to exclude anybody. Clearly, no one has devoted more \ntime to the issue and has been more eloquent on the floor with regard \nto safety and the importance of recognizing the issue of safety than \nSenator Dorgan. Senator Murray has accommodated everybody, and I know \nin these discussions that would be her intent as well. I appreciate the \nSenator's interest in being involved in these discussions. I want to \nsay that we hope to include anybody that has an interest in it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/25/senate-section/article/S8172-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8172-S8182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ILSA EXTENSION ACT OF 2001\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the bill, S. 1218, by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1218) to extend the authorities of the Iran and \n     Libya Sanctions Act 1996 until 2006.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n\n[[Page S8173]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is beginning consideration of S. \n1218. The Senator from Maryland controls 30 minutes; the Senator from \nTexas controls another 30 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I thought I would make a very short \nopening statement. Senator Murkowski is here and wants to launch into \nthe debate of his amendment. We want to move along, and I am hopeful we \nwill be able to yield back a considerable amount of time on the bill \nitself and time with respect to the Murkowski amendment. Altogether, \nthere is 2\\1/2\\ hours allotted for all of that: 1 hour on the bill and \n1\\1/2\\ hours on the Murkowski amendment.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask that after the Senator speaks, I be \nrecognized for a short period of time before we begin the discussion of \nSenator Murkowski's amendment.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Fine. I will hold my time down because I do want to get \nto the Murkowski amendment and the Senator from Alaska is in the \nvicinity.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 1218, the renewal \nauthorization legislation for the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, commonly \nknown as ILSA. This legislation was reported favorably out of the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs by a vote of 19-2. We \nmade some modifications. Therefore, a committee print served as the \nvehicle for the committee markup, but this committee print paralleled \nclosely with the renewal legislation introduced by Senator Schumer of \nNew York and Senator Smith of Oregon which garnered 79 cosponsors.\n  I am including in the Record the full list of the 79 cosponsors. I \nask unanimous consent that the list be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I especially thank Senators Schumer and \nSmith for their leadership on this issue. We are very appreciative of \nthe very vigorous effort they mounted with respect to this issue. The \nexisting ILSA legislation expires on August 5 of this year. Therefore, \nwe need to move quickly to approve this legislation. This will extend \nILSA for another 5 years. It will lower the threshold for foreign \ninvestment in the Libyan energy sector from $40 million to $20 million \nto trigger sanctions. That puts Libya on a par with Iran at the \nexisting requirement, and it closes a loophole in the existing \nlegislation making it clear that modification or addition to an \nexisting contract would be treated as a new contract for purposes of \nevaluating whether such amendment or modification would invoke the \nsanctions. There has been a loophole with respect to companies \noperating in Libya, and we need to address that.\n  With respect to the Iran portion of ILSA I wish I could come to the \nChamber and report there has been a significant change in Iranian \nconduct that warrants a response from the Congress in terms of when we \nconsider whether to extend these sanctions forward. Unfortunately, \nIran's support for terrorism continues unabated. The latest State \nDepartment Report on Patterns of Global Terrorism 2000 states:\n\n       Iran remains the most active state sponsor of terrorism in \n     2000. Its revolutionary guard corps, the IRGC, and the \n     Ministry of Intelligence and Security, MOIS, continue to \n     be involved in the planning and execution of terrorist \n     acts and continue to support a variety of groups that use \n     terrorism to pursue their goals.\n\n  Iran is also stepping up efforts to acquire weapons of mass \ndestruction. The latest unclassified CIA report to Congress on \nworldwide weapons of mass destruction acquisition notes:\n\n       Iran remains one of the most active countries seeking to \n     acquire weapons of mass destruction and advanced chemical \n     weapons technology from abroad. In doing so, Iran is \n     attempting to develop an indigenous capability to produce \n     various types of weapons--chemical, biological, and nuclear--\n     and their delivery systems.\n\n  In June of this year, when the Justice Department handed down \nindictments in the Khobar Towers bombing case, a case in which 19 of \nour airmen in Saudi Arabia were killed in 1996, the Attorney General \nstated publicly that Iranian officials ``inspired, supported, and \nsupervised members of Saudi Hezbollah,'' which is the group that \ncarried out the attack.\n  As for Libya, very briefly, it has fulfilled only one aspect of the \nU.N. Security Council resolutions relating to the Pan Am 103 bombing; \nnamely, the handing over of the suspects for trial. Libya has not \nfulfilled the requirement to pay compensation to the families of the \nvictims, to accept responsibility for the actions of its intelligence \nofficers, and to renounce fully international terrorism.\n  In fact, President Bush on April 19 of this year stated:\n\n       We have made it clear to the Libyans that sanctions will \n     remain until such time as they not only compensate for the \n     bombing of the aircraft, but also admit their guilt and \n     express remorse.\n\n  Because Iran and Libya have not clearly fulfilled the requirements of \nILSA, I believe that not to extend ILSA for a full 5 years would send \nthe wrong signal. Failure to do so would be seen as a sign of lack of \nresolve on the part of the United States.\n  I also believe that placing Libya on a par with Iran with regard to \nILSA's conditions sends a strong signal to Libyan leader Qadhafi that \nthe pressure will be kept on until he fulfills all relevant U.N. \nSecurity Council resolutions concerning the bombing of Pan Am flight \n103, which I remind my colleagues killed 270 people, including 189 \nAmericans.\n  This legislation had overwhelming support in the committee in being \nbrought before the Senate. It has been endorsed by a clear majority--a \nvery substantial majority--of Members of this body, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support the legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                            ILSA Cosponsors\n\n       Senators Schumer, Smith (OR), Hollings, Rockefeller, Reed, \n     Levin, Durbin, Carnahan, Johnson, Gregg, Cleland, Campbell, \n     Murray, Allard, Mikulski, Ensign, Collins, Bob Smith, \n     Lieberman, Harry Reid.\n       Senators Corzine, Sessions, Kyl, McConnell, Boxer, \n     Santorum, Shelby, Voinovich, Breaux, Torricelli, Clinton, \n     Stabenow, Harkin, Kohl, Daschle, Bob Graham, Inouye, Thomas, \n     Helms, Brownback.\n       Senators Feinstein, Kennedy, Grassley, Craig, Warner, \n     Biden, Bingaman, McCain, Sarbanes, Bennett, Wyden, \n     Hutchinson, Bunning, Dorgan, Crapo, Bill Nelson, Edwards, \n     Kerry, Hatch, Lott.\n       Senators Cochran, Frist, Akaka, Conrad, Bayh, Dayton, \n     Allen, Snowe, Miller, Wellstone, Landrieu, Dodd, Cantwell, \n     Ben Nelson, Leahy, Bond, Lincoln, DeWine, and Murkowski.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from New York, after \nwhich it is the intention we go to the amendment of the Senator from \nAlaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). The Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair, and I thank the chairman of our \nBanking Committee, the Senator from Maryland, for bringing this matter \nto the Chamber with such alacrity. I thank him on behalf of Senator \nSmith and myself who have been the lead sponsors of this legislation, \nas well as the 78, now 79, cosponsors.\n  As has been said, time is of the essence. With the original ILSA law \nset to expire on August 5, the Senate needs to swiftly pass this bill \nto get our version approved by the House and then over to the President \nfor his signature within the next 10 days. I again thank Senator Smith \nfor working so hard with me on bringing this bill forward so quickly. \nIt is a bipartisan bill. We have garnered 79 cosponsors and the support \nof both the chairman of the Banking Committee, as you just heard, and \nmost of the membership of the Banking Committee as well.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support the Iran \nand Libya Sanctions Extension Act of 2001, a bill originally introduced \nby Senator Gordon Smith and me, currently supported by 79 cosponsors.\n  Time is of the essence. With the original ILSA law set to expire on \nAugust 5, the Senate needs to swiftly pass this bill, get our version \napproved by the House, and then over to President Bush for his \nsignature within the next 10 days.\n  I know time for debate is limited, but I just want to say a few words \nin support of this important bill which extends U.S. sanctions against \nforeign companies which invest in Iran and Libya's oil sector for five \nmore years.\n  First, I would like to thank Senator Smith for his invaluable \nleadership on\n\n[[Page S8174]]\n\nthis bill. I would also like to thank Senator Sarbanes for giving this \nbill his utmost consideration and following through with a hearings and \nmarkup schedule which got the bill reported out of the Banking \nCommittee last week on a 19-2 vote.\n  Everyone in Congress is well acquainted with ILSA; it passed \nunanimously in both Houses in 1996.\n  And today it is vitally important for Congress to once again speak \nout loudly and strongly in support of maintaining a hard line on two of \nthe world's most dangerous outlaw states.\n  In fact, the argument in support of reauthorizing ILSA for another \nfive years is a very simple one: over the past five years, Iran and \nLibya have done nothing to show they should be welcomed into the \ncommunity of nations and benefit from better relationships with the \nUnited States and our allies.\n  Quite the contrary.\n  Despite the election of so-called ``moderate'' President Mohammad \nKhatami in 1997, Iran remains the world's most active state sponsor of \nterrorism, and has been feverishly seeking to develop weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  Just last month, a U.S. Federal grand jury found that Iranian \ngovernment officials ``supported and directed'' the Hezbollah \nterrorists who blew up Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia in 1996, an act \nwhich killed 19 brave American servicemen.\n  And Iran proudly supports the Hamas terrorist group, whose most \nrecent claim to fame was sending a suicide bomber into a crowded disco \nin Tel Aviv killing 21 Israeli teenagers.\n  As far as Libya is concerned, we recently learned beyond a doubt that \nthe Libyan government was directly involved in the bombing of Pan Am \n103--one of the most heinous acts of terrorism in history.\n  Yet Libya still refuses to abide by U.N. resolutions requiring it to \nrenounce terrorism, accept responsibility for the Libyan officials \nconvicted of masterminding the bombing, and compensate the victims' \nfamilies.\n  These actions by Iran and Libya are not actions worthy of American \nconcessions. They are actions worthy of America's most supreme outrage, \nand worthy of U.S. policy that does everything possible to isolate \nthese nations in hopes of preventing them from doing further harm to \nAmerica and our allies.\n  Some in the Administration argue that the United States should lift \nor ease sanctions on rogue states like Iran and Libya first, and \ndecent, moral, internationally-acceptable behavior will follow.\n  I say that is twisted logic.\n  If these states are serious about entering the community of nations, \nand seeing their economies benefit from global integration, they must \nchange their behavior first.\n  They must adapt to the world community, the world community should \nnot adapt to them.\n  I have spoken to people on all sides of the issue of sanctions, \nparticularly with respect to sanctions on Iran. And even those most \nopposed to sanctions on Iran cannot tell me any viable alternative to \nILSA.\n  The idea that United States concessions to Iran through ending or \nwatering down ILSA would bring about change for the better in Iran, and \nmoderation in its foreign policies, is not simply misplaced \nspeculation, it would be prohibitively dangerous policy.\n  An Iran emboldened and enabled by billions more in foreign investment \nleading to hundreds of millions more in oil profits would simply mean a \nmore potent threat to America and our allies. Plain and simple.\n  The truth is ILSA has been very harmful to Iran--over the past five \nyears, the threat of sanctions has successfully dissuaded billions in \nforeign investment, causing the Iranian government to invest in its own \noil fields rather than in terrorism and weapons programs.\n  In fact, since ILSA was enacted, Iran has promoted more than 55 \nforeign investment opportunities in its energy sector and landed only \neight contracts worth a total of roughly $2.5 billion--earning Iran \nbarely half of what its tiny Persian Gulf neighbor, Qatar, netted in \nforeign investment during the same period.\n  With ILSA firmly in place, Iran cannot hope to fulfill its goal of \nattaining $60 billion in foreign investment over the next decade which \nit needs to rehabilitate and modernize its oil sector.\n  But ILSA is not simply about harming Iran and Libya's ability to do \nbusiness and accrue greater oil revenues. It is about American \nleadership in the world in doing what's right.\n  Mr. President, the United Sates stands in the international community \nas a beacon of freedom--a beacon of what's right. Our great nation is \nabout much more than economic might. It is about moral leadership, and \ncombating those who wish to vanquish the principles of liberty and \nfreedom which Americans have fought and died over the centuries to \nuphold.\n  An overwhelming vote today in support of ILSA reauthorization will \nsend a strong signal that the United States is not prepared to \nrelinquish the moral high ground when it comes to dealing with the \nworst renegade states--those who wish to disrupt our way of life.\n  Although some of the administration would like to water down ILSA, a \nveto-proof vote here in the Senate today would say to the \nAdministration and the world that sanctions against the world's worst \nrogue states will remain firmly in place.\n  After all, the alternative is unthinkable: What would the \ninternational community think should the world's greatest power relax \nsanctions on two rogue states that have shown themselves to be so \noutside the family of nations, and engaged in some of the most \ndastardly acts the world has ever seen?\n  Mr. President, don't get me wrong, I fully support the Bush \nadministration's desire to review U.S. sanctions policies to make sure \nthey are working effectively.\n  But ILSA is as close as we have come to a perfect sanctions regime. \nFirst, it is highly flexible: It grants the President full waiver \nauthority on a case-by-case basis, and it contains a menu of sanctions \noptions ranging form a slap on the wrist, to more serious economic \nretaliation.\n  Second, its sunset provisions are profoundly reasonable: Libya needs \nto simply own up to its responsibility for Pan Am 103; Iran simply \nneeds to stop its support for international terrorism and end its \nobsessive quest for weapons of mass destruction.\n  So for those who argue for eliminating or weakening ILSA, I say this: \nOnly two states can eliminate the need for ILSA, Iran and Libya.\n  For Iran that means an unconditional end to its support of \ninternational terrorism, and its dangerous quest for catastrophic \nweapons. Let Iran prove it is moderate before America rewards it.\n  For Libya, it means full acceptance of responsibility for the Pan Am \n103 bombing, and full compensation for the families of the victims.\n  If the day arrives that Iran and Libya fulfill these reasonable \ninternational obligations, ILSA will no longer be needed and it will be \nterminated.\n  Unfortunately, that day is not yet in sight.\n  I urge my colleagues, in the strongest possible terms, to vote yes \nfor ILSA reauthorization.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I will yield 5 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts. I thank the Senator from Alaska for his courtesy. I \nsay to other colleagues who want to speak on the bill itself, we will \nstill reserve some time and they can speak later, but Senator Murkowski \nhas been waiting for quite a while to bring up his amendment. I yield 5 \nminutes to Senator Kennedy, and then I assure the Senator from Alaska, \nwe will go to his amendment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am happy to accommodate Senator Kennedy.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska for his \ncourtesy. I will take just a moment. I know I speak for the 13 families \nfrom Massachusetts who lost loved ones; and they continue to be \nstrongly supportive of this legislation. I thank the Senator from \nMaryland for all of his work and for his timeless energetic leadership \non this extremely important issue.\n  We are reminded every day that we live in a dangerous world. As a \nmember of the Committee on Armed Services, we have been listening to \nthe proposal of the administration about antiballistic missile systems. \nWe have been\n\n[[Page S8175]]\n\nwatching the leaders of the great industrial nations meeting in Europe. \nWe have seen President Bush and President Putin meeting to talk about \nnuclear weapons.\n  As a member of the Committee on Armed Services, all of us are \nconvinced the great threat to the United States is in the form of \nterrorism: nuclear proliferation, bioterrorism, computer terrorism, but \nit is terrorism. That is the principal threat to the safety and \nsecurity of the people of the United States and our allies.\n  We are relentless in dealing with the state of terrorism around the \nworld. We spend a great deal of money doing that. The best way we can \ndeal with the issue of terrorism is to show persistence, consistency, \nand as much tough-mindedness as the terrorists. The way to do that is \nto not forget and not forgive the brutal attacks and killings and \nassassinations of the Americans and citizens of 22 other countries in \nthe Pan Am 103 disaster.\n  Members of Congress, and those who talk about wanting to deal with \nterrorism, ought to be here every single day. Unless we are going to be \npersistent and unless we are going to be tough-minded and unless we are \ngoing to deal with this and demonstrate to the world we are serious \nabout dealing with the problems of state-sponsored terrorism, no matter \nhow much we are going to spend on ballistic systems, no matter how much \nwe will spend on the nonproliferation of weapons, how much we spend on \nintelligence, it will undermine our effectiveness.\n  The matter before the Senate sends a clear message, that we have not \nforgotten about state-sponsored terrorism in Libya. It is as clear as \nthat.\n  According to the State Department, Iran continues to be ``the most \nactive state sponsor of terrorism.'' Sanctions should continue on that \nnation.\n  There is also a compelling foreign policy rationale for extending \nsanctions on Libya. Easing sanctions on Libya by allowing the law to \nexpire would have a far-reaching negative effect on the battle against \ninternational terrorism and the 12-year pursuit of justice for the 270 \nvictims of the bombing of Pan Am flight 103.\n  Current law requires the President to impose at least two out of six \nsanctions on foreign companies that invest more than $40 million in one \nyear in Libya's energy sector. The President may waive the sanctions on \nthe ground that doing so is important to the U.S. national interest. \nFor Libya, the law terminates if the President determines that Libya \nhas fulfilled the requirements of all U.N. resolutions relating to the \n1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103. Those conditions, which were imposed \nby the international community, require the Government of Libya to \naccept responsibility for the actions of its intelligence officer, \ndisclose information about its involvement in the bombing, provide \nappropriate compensation for the families of the victims of Pan Am \nflight 103, and fully renounce international terrorism.\n  President Bush has emphasized his support for these conditions. As he \nstated on April 19, ``We've made it clear to the Libyans that sanctions \nwill remain until such time as they not only compensate for the bombing \nof the aircraft, but also admit their guilt and express remorse.'' Yet \nthe Government of Libya continues to refuse to meet the conditions of \nthe international community. Until it does, both the United States and \nthe international community should continue to impose sanctions on the \nregime.\n  Despite the conventional wisdom that economic sanctions do not work, \nthey have been effective in the case of Libya. As a result of the \nUnited Nations sanctions, the U.S. sanctions, and diplomatic pressure, \nthe Libyan Government finally agreed in 1999 to a trial by a Scottish \ncourt sitting in the Netherlands of two Libyans indicted for the \nbombing. Last January 31, one of the defendants, a Libyan intelligence \nagent, was convicted of murder for that atrocity.\n  The court's decision clearly implicated the Libyan Government. The \nconviction was a significant diplomatic and legal victory for the world \ncommunity, for our nation, which was the real target of the terrorist \nattack, and for the families of the victims of Pan Am flight 103.\n  The Iran Libya Sanctions Act is also intended to help level the \nplaying field for American companies, which have been prohibited from \ninvesting in Libya by a Presidential order issued by President Reagan \nin 1986. The statute enacted in 1996 imposed sanctions on foreign \ncompanies that invest more than $40 million in any year in the Libyan \nenergy sector. The objective of the 1996 law is to create a \ndisincentive for foreign companies to invest in Libya and help ensure \nthat Amercian firms are not disadvantaged by the U.S. sanctions. Since \nthe sanctions on U.S. firms will continue, it is essential to extend \nthe sanctions on foreign firms as well.\n\n  The administration has indicated that it has no evidence of \nviolations of the law by foreign companies. But some foreign companies \nare clearly poised to invest substantially in the Libyan petroleum \nsector, in violation of the law. A German company, Wintershall, is \nreportedly considering investing hundreds of millions of dollars in the \nLibyan oil industry in violation of the law.\n  Allowing current law to lapse before the conditions specified by the \ninternational community are met would give a green light to foreign \ncompanies to invest in Libya, putting American companies at a clear \ndisadvantage. It would reward the leader of Libya, Colonel Qadhafi, for \nhis continuing refusal to comply with the U.N. resolutions. It would \nset an unwise precedent of disregard for U.N. Security Council \nResolutions. It would undermine our ongoing diplomatic efforts in the \nSecurity Council to prevent the international sanctions from being \npermanently lifted until Libya complies with the U.N. conditions. And \nit would prematurely signal a warming in U.S.-Libyan relations.\n  Our European allies would undoubtedly welcome the expiration of the \nU.S. sanctions. European companies are eager to increase their \ninvestments in Libya, but they do not want to be sanctioned by the \nUnited States. They are ready to close the book on the bombing of Pan \nAm flight 103, and open a new chapter in relations with Libya.\n  But the pursuit of justice is not only for American citizens. \nCitizens of 22 countries were murdered on Pan Am flight 103, including \ncitizens of many of our allies. The current sanctions were enacted on \nbehalf of these citizens as well. Our government should be actively \nworking to persuade European countries that it is premature to \nrehabilitate Libya.\n  I am especially pleased that two modifications to the Libya section \nmake by the House International Relations Committee are included in \nthis legislation. I commend Chairman Sarbanes for his leadership by \nincluding these provisions in his mark.\n  The first modification reduces the threshold for a violation in Libya \nfrom $40 million to $20 million. Under current law, a foreign company \ncan invest $40 million in Libya before sanctions kick in, but it can \nonly invest $20 million in Iran. When the law was originally drafted, \nthe threshold for both Iran and Libya was $40 million. When it was \nreduced for Iran, it was not reduced for Libya. It should have been. \nThe threshold for a violation should be $20 million for both Iran and \nLibya.\n  The other modification closes a loophole in the law that allows oil \ncompanies to expand upon contracts that were signed before the current \nlaw was enacted. A number of companies which signed contracts before \nILSA became law are expanding their operations, such as by developing \nfields adjacent to those in which they made their original investment, \nand calling this expansion a part of the original contract.\n  The law should cover modifications to existing contracts and \nagreements. Even if the original contract pre-dates ILSA, subsequent \ninvestments that expand operations should be treated as a new contract. \nThis point should be clarified in the law, and the administration \nshould aggressively seek the information necessary to enforce it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter written by the President of the \nVictims of Pan Am flight 103, Inc. asking the Congress to make these \nmodifications to existing law be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S8176]]\n\n\n\n\n                           Victims of Pan Am Flight 103, Inc.,\n\n                                    Cherry Hill, NJ, 23 May, 2001.\n     Subject: Iran-Libya Sanctions Act.\n\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: The members of our organization, the \n     Victims of Pan Am Flight 103, Inc. urge you to vote to extend \n     the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act\n       The Scottish court in the Netherlands convicted a Libyan \n     intelligence agent, Abdel Basset al-Megrahi, of the murder of \n     270 innocents on Pan Am flight 103. The judges also found \n     that Megrahi was acting ``in furtherance of the purposes of \n     Libyan Intelligence''. Within a few hours, President Bush \n     declared on CNN, to the world, that the Scottish Court's \n     decision proved the Libyan government was responsible for the \n     murders of our loved ones.\n       U.N. Security Council resolutions 731 and 748 require that \n     Libya turn over the suspects for trial, cooperate in the \n     international investigation, pay appropriate compensation to \n     the families and end support of international terrorism. The \n     Libyan Regime must be made to comply fully with the UN \n     Resolutions.\n       Allowing ILSA to lapse would undermine President Bush's \n     statements the day of the verdict, the intent of the UN. \n     Security Council's resolutions and give tacit approval to \n     Quadhafi's flagrant disregard for international law and human \n     life. It would, in effect, reward Libya's murderous actions \n     and stonewalling. It would declare open season on Americans.\n       We ask that you support two changes to the law. The first \n     would reduce the threshold for a violation from $40 million \n     to $20 million. The threshold for a violation for investment \n     in Iran is $20 million. There is no compelling reason why the \n     threshold for investment in Libya should not be the same.\n       The second change would close a loophole in the law that \n     enables oil companies to expand existing contracts and avoid \n     being examined for violations. We understand that a number of \n     European companies which signed pre-ILSA contracts are \n     expanding operations by, for example, developing fields \n     adjacent to the fields in which they had their original \n     investment and portraying this expansion as part of the \n     original contract. Our organization believes such investment \n     should always be investigated for ILSA violations. Even if \n     the original contract pre-dates ILSA, any post-ILSA \n     investment, no matter how large or remote form the original \n     contract, should be treated as the entry of a new contract \n     and investigated for an ILSA violation.\n       We respectfully suggest that if ILSA is not renewed, the \n     United States will have failed in one of the most important \n     challenges it faced in the 2nd half of the twentieth century.\n       Our organization strongly supports an extension of ILSA, \n     which has worked well to deter significant new investment in \n     the Libyan oil sector and look forward to working with you \n     toward that extension.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Robert G. Monetti,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. These families, as all families, are enormously \nimportant. Many have been out there at Arlington and had Presidents of \nthe United States meet with them. Many have followed closely the \ndevelopments that have taken place regarding the trial. Many of us have \nspent a good deal of time with these families. If we are going to keep \nfaith with these families, if we are going to be serious about dealing \nwith State-sponsored terrorism, if we are going to at least be able to \nhave some impact on countries that may be thinking a little bit about \nsponsoring some terrorism around--if they know the United States is \ngoing to continue to lead the world in not forgetting and not forgiving \nState-sponsored terrorism, it may make some difference and it may \nresult in the saving of American lives. It certainly can help move us \nso hopefully someday we get a sense of justice out of the loss of lives \nas we know them in the Pan Am 103 tragedy.\n  Extending the law that requires sanctions on foreign companies that \ninvest in Libya for another five years is in both the security interest \nof the United States and the security interest of the international \ncommunity. Profits in Libya should not come at the expense of progress \nagainst international terrorism and justice for the families of the \nvictims of Pan Am flight 103.\n  Seventy-eight Members of the Senate have cosponsored legislation to \nextend the Iran Libya Sanctions Act for five years, and S. 1218 was \napproved by a vote of 19-2 by the Senate Banking Committee.\n  I urge my colleagues to approve this legislation without delay.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the floor manager, my good friend, Senator \nSarbanes, and Senator Kennedy.\n  First, let me speak to the underlying bill. I very much appreciate \nthe leadership bringing it up at this time. The bill before the Senate, \nas I understand it, has only one cosponsor, Senator Sarbanes, the \nchairman of the Banking Committee, which reported this as an original \nbill. However, there are 79 cosponsors of the underlying bill sponsored \nby Senators Smith and Schumer. I want the record to note I am on that \nbill.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is of no consequence to me, but I think it is----\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is important. The list of cosponsors was sent to the \ndesk and the Senator is included in the list. The reason the bill came \nout of the committee this way, when you do a committee print, is that \nis how it had to be presented. We did a committee print instead of the \noriginal bill that was introduced because there were some relatively \nminor changes that were made, and we laid down a committee bill, as it \nwere, for markup purposes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I certainly understand and appreciate that. I just \nwanted the record to note why I was not seen as a cosponsor on it. \nObviously, not being a member of the committee, and understanding the \nintention of the chairman--as former chairman, I understand the \nprocedure and I do not take issue with it. But I wanted the record to \nnote, as the floor manager indicated, my support of the bill.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1154\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I rise on an issue of grave concern. Clearly, I stand \nwith my colleagues and those who have spoken on the justification of \nextending the sanctions timeframe for another 5 years on both Iran and \nLibya.\n  I hope the Chair will notice that there is another country that is \nexcluded from this list, and that is Iraq. The presumption is that it \nis taken care of under the U.N. sanctions.\n  I have come to this floor to speak of inconsistencies before in our \nforeign and energy policy. I come today to address an inconsistency in \nrelationship to what this particular bill addresses. It addresses the \nattitude prevailing in the Senate that we are going to stand against \nterrorism.\n  Clearly and appropriately that attitude should be directed to Iran \nand Libya. But the same moral question is applicable to our \nrelationship with Iraq. I am not going to go into great detail on the \nprevailing attitude in Iraq with regard to terrorists, but I think the \nprevailing attitude of Saddam Hussein is known to all Members--his \ncontinued criticism of Israel. I think it is fair to say he concludes \nalmost every address with the words ``death to Israel,'' or quotes to \nthat effect.\n  I am not going to stand here and take a contrary position on the \nissue of condemning those that foster terrorism, Iran and Libya, which \nthis amendment addresses, and an extension of the sanctions for another \nfive years. But I do want to raise awareness of an inconsistency here. \nI am referring, of course, to our growing dependence on imported \npetroleum from Iraq.\n  Let me show the reality of what is happening in this country. I know \nmany Members have, since the price of gasoline has gone down, an \nindifferent attitude that the question of our national security has had \nlittle impact on this debate. But I think it has every relevance to \nthis debate because our national security is threatened by our \nescalating dependence on foreign imports. You have to separate energy \nsources. You have to separate the energy that comes from our \nconventional sources, whether they be nuclear, hydro, natural gas, wind \nalternative--from oil because oil moves America. Oil moves the world. \nYou do not generate much electricity with oil, but you move everything \nand everybody. We are becoming more dependent on imported oil, \nparticularly from disturbing sources.\n\n  Many in this body will remember in 1973 we had the Yom Kippur war. We \nhad gas lines around the block in this country. We were 37-percent \ndependent on imported oil.\n  The public was outraged. How could this happen? We created a \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve. We said this country will never ever \napproach or exceed 50-percent dependence on imported oil.\n\n[[Page S8177]]\n\n We are 56-percent dependent now. The Department of Energy has \nindicated we are going to be 66-percent dependent by the year 2010, \napproximately 65-percent dependent in the year 2008.\n  This dependence is very real and there is no relief in sight. I want \nto make it again clear I support this underlying bill. There is no \njustification in my mind for allowing the Iran-Libya Sanction Act to \nlapse. I have talked to many people, many interest groups on this \nsubject. But I want to go on record to recognize that we have not \nimported more than a drop of oil from Iran in 20 years or, for that \nmatter, Libya.\n  On the other hand, do you have any idea what we are importing from \nIraq today? You should, because it is a million barrels a day. Yet Iraq \nis not included in these sanctions.\n  I am not going to go into the reason, but I am going to point out the \nobvious. This chart was made not so very long ago, when we were \nimporting 750,000 barrels a day. Now this figure should read 1 million \nbarrels a day; the Persian Gulf, 2.3 million; OPEC, 5 million barrels a \nday.\n  Make no mistake about it, OPEC is a cartel. Cartels are illegal in \nthe United States. They are antitrust violations. But we have become \naddicted to oil. We don't produce enough in this country. We are \nincreasing our dependence and also, if you will, compromising our \nnational security. What did we see as late as 3\\1/2\\ weeks ago? Our \nfriend Saddam Hussein, in a beef with the United Nations, decided to \ncurtail his production. He took 2\\1/2\\ million barrels a day off the \nworld market. We were led to believe OPEC would increase production \n2\\1/2\\ million barrels a day and there would be no shortage. That \ndidn't happen. Saddam Hussein curtailed for a month 2\\1/2\\ million \nbarrels a day. A little over 60 million barrels didn't get to the \nmarket. OPEC didn't increase the production. The price stabilized. It \nwent up a little bit.\n\n  Make no mistake about it, blood is thicker than water, if I can use \nthat expression, in the sense of OPEC making a determination that while \nthe United States is one of their largest customers, they also had an \nobligation to respond to what Saddam Hussein was attempting to do; that \nwas to get more flexibility from the U.N.\n  I go into this in some detail because I don't think my colleagues or \nthe American public really understand the significance of what this \nmeans to the national security of this country.\n  When we take his oil, he takes our money. We gave Saddam Hussein $6 \nbillion last year alone for the purchase of oil. What does he do with \nthat money? He pays his Republican Guard to take care of his safety and \nother personal needs. He develops a missile capability, a delivery \ncapability, and a biological capability. At whom does he aim it? He \naims it at our ally, Israel.\n  I don't know about you, Mr. President, but that bothers me. It shows \na grave inconsistency in our foreign policy.\n  Mr. President, my amendment attempts to address that by requiring \nthat we terminate our purchase of oil from Iraq.\n  What does that mean? If I were to spill this water on this desk, it \nwould spill to all four corners of the desk. That is the way the oil \nmarket works. There is so much oil out in the world, and there is so \nmuch consumption. If we choose not to buy --when I say ``we,'' I am \ntalking about America's oil companies--from Iraq, that will relieve \nIraq of oil to be purchased by somebody else, and that somebody else \ncan relieve their purchaser. So we can basically purchase the oil from \nsomeone other than Iraq. But obviously Iraq has it for sale. The terms \nare probably favorable in the competitive market.\n  I am not going to go too far down that pipeline other than to suggest \nthat we don't necessarily short ourselves a million barrels a day if we \ndon't buy our oil from Iraq. There are other places to buy that oil.\n  But I want to remind the American people that since the end of the \nGulf War in 1991 we have enforced a no-fly zone, flying over 250,000 \nsorties. Those sorties have specifically been initiated to prevent \nSaddam Hussein from threatening our allies in the region. Every time we \nfly a sortie, we are putting American men and women in harm's way, \nbecause he attempts to take down our aircraft.\n  It is pretty hard to get an estimate of how much we have expended to \nkeep Saddam Hussein in his box since the 1990 invasion of Kuwait. It \nhas been estimated, as near as we can determine, that it is some $50 \nbillion.\n  That war was in early 1991. Saddam invaded Kuwait in the summer of \n1990. What was his objective? We know the war was, at least in part, \nover oil. His objective was to go through Kuwait, and then on into \nSaudi Arabia, and control the world's supply of oil--the life's-blood \nof the world.\n\n  Every day we place our service men and women in harm's way. We lost \n147 American lives, we had 450 American wounded and 23 American \nprisoners of war in the 1991 Gulf War.\n  I said this before on this floor. I think I have it right. We take \nIraqi oil, we put it in our airplanes, and send our pilots to go after \nIraqi artillery and return to fill up with Iraqi oil again.\n  Mind you, there is a sanctions bill on the floor against Iran, and \nsanctions against Libya. Where is Iraq? Some say that is covered by the \nU.N. sanctions. Come on, let's not kid each other. We know he is black-\nmarketing a significant amount of oil outside the sanctions because we \nhave no enforcement of the sanctions. The U.N. doesn't have ready \naccess to his country, and only limited control over what he does with \nthe money. We know he is not taking care of the needs of his people \nwith the money he gets from oil sales.\n  Again, through this entire presentation, I appeal as we consider the \nbill before us, where is Iraq? Why aren't we initiating meaningful \nsanctions against Iraq at the same time?\n  Last week, Iraq fired a surface-to-air missile into Kuwait airspace \nfor the first time since the 1991 Gulf War. The missile was aimed at a \nUnited States unarmed surveillance aircraft on routine patrol several \nmiles inside the Kuwait border with Iraq. That is reality. But it is \nhardly makes the newspaper. It is not news anymore. We take it for \ngranted.\n  Saddam Hussein is heating our homes in the winter, gets our kids to \nschool each day, gets our food from the farm to the dinner table, and \nof course we pay him to do that.\n  What does he do with the money he gets for the oil? As I indicated, \nhe pays his Republican Guard to keep him alive. He also supports \ninternational terrorist activities. We have heard from our colleagues \nregarding Iran and Libya. I agree with them. This issue on Iran and \nLibya is a moral stance against those countries that foster terrorism. \nBut again, where do we stand on Iraq? Saddam funds a military campaign \nagainst American service men and women and against those of our allies. \nHe builds an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction. The threat is real \nto our men and women and our allies in the Persian Gulf.\n  You may recall, as I do, the hundreds of Kuwaitis who remain \nunaccounted for since the Gulf War and who were kidnapped from Kuwait \non Saddam's retreat in 1991. Hundreds of thousands of Iraqi lives have \nbeen lost. Countless Iraqis are suffering due to Saddam's continuing \ntyranny.\n  I find this extraordinary. I find it outrageous that the Senate has \nbeen silent. We seem to have our heads buried in the sand. We are all \nfor extending unilateral sanctions against Iran and Libya, but where is \nIraq? What is different here? Is it because of our increased dependence \non his oil? How did we allow ourselves to get into such a situation?\n  For a number of years the United States has worked closely with the \nUnited Nations on the Oil for Food Program.\n  The program allows Iraq to export petroleum in exchange for funds \nwhich can be used for food, medicine, and other humanitarian products. \nBut despite more than $15 billion available for these purposes, Iraq \nhas spent only a fraction of that amount for the people's needs. \nInstead, the Iraqi Government spends the money on items of questionable \nand often suspicious purposes. Why?\n  Why, when billions are available to care for the Iraqi people, who \nare malnourished--some of them are sick; some of them have inadequate \nhealth care--would Saddam Hussein withhold the money available and \nchoose, instead, to blame the United States for the plight of his \npeople? He does.\n  Why is Iraq reducing the amount it spends on nutrition and prenatal \ncare when millions of dollars are available from the sale of oil?\n\n[[Page S8178]]\n\n  Why does $200 million worth of medicine from the U.N. sit \nundistributed in Iraqi warehouses?\n  Why, given the urgent state of humanitarian conditions in Iraq, does \nSaddam Hussein insist that the country's highest priority is the \ndevelopment of sophisticated telecommunications and transportation \ninfrastructure?\n  Why, if there are billions available, and his people are starving, is \nIraq only buying $8 million worth of food from American farmers each \nyear?\n  I do not personally have a quarrel with the Oil For Food Program. It \nis well-intentioned. I do, however, have a problem with letting Saddam \nHussein manipulate our growing dependency on Iraqi oil.\n  Where are we on this issue? We are silent. Three times since the \nbeginning of the Oil For Food Program, Saddam Hussein has threatened or \nactually halted oil production, disrupting energy markets, and sending \noil prices skyrocketing. Why?\n  Why does he do this? He does it to send a message to the United \nStates. Do you know what the message is? The message is: I have \nleverage over you. And by the indication of our increased imports, as I \nindicated, the figure is one million barrels a day now. It seems he is \npretty much right on target there.\n  Every time he has done this, he has had his way. We have proven \nourselves addicted to Iraqi oil. Saddam has been proven right: He does \nhave leverage over us.\n  Last month, in a display of displeasure over U.S. attempts to revise \nthe sanctions regime, as I indicated, he withdrew 2.5 million barrels a \nday from the market for 30 days. OPEC did not make it up. Now we are \nimporting over a million barrels a day. Ten percent of our oil imports \ncome directly from Saddam Hussein.\n  Am I missing something? Is this really acceptable to this body? We \nhave placed our energy security in the hands of this individual.\n  The administration has valiantly attempted to reconstruct a sensible, \nmultilateral policy towards Iraq. Attempts have, unfortunately, not \nbeen successful. I think that before we can construct a sensible U.S. \npolicy towards Iraq, we need to end the blatant inconsistency between \nour energy policy and our foreign policy. We need to get our heads out \nof the sand. We need to end our addiction to Iraqi oil. We need to \nbasically find another alternative.\n  To that end, in the amendment that I have at the desk, I am offering \nlanguage to prohibit imports from Iraq, whether or not under the Oil \nFor Food Program, until it is no longer inconsistent with our national \nsecurity to resume those imports.\n  I have had a colloquy with the leadership and the floor manager, and \nI agreed to submit my amendment to the desk, to speak on it, and \nwithdraw it, with the proviso that I would receive an up-or-down vote \nat a later time on my amendment which would prohibit the purchase of \nIraqi oil into the United States until certain conditions have been \nfilled. And that is my intention. But I think it important to point out \nwe simply cannot ignore this inconsistency in foreign policy.\n  We simply cannot turn our heads and say, on one hand, we stand firm \nagainst terrorism associated with Iran and Libya and simply not mention \nIraq, turn a blind eye towards our increased dependence on Iraqi \nsources as a supply of oil, and not make a connection somehow that if \nthere is justification for sanctions against Iran and Libya, there \ncertainly is justification for equivalent sanctions against Iraq.\n  The bill that my good friend, the senior Senator from Maryland, has \nproposed addresses, obviously, the issue of extending the sanctions on \nIran and Libya. I support that, as I have indicated. I recognize the \nvarious interests and the number of Members who are already in favor of \nthe underlying bill. I respect that. But I would implore our colleagues \nto recognize that we are on a very dangerous, slippery slope with Iraq \nas we simply take for granted their willingness to sell us oil, and we \ntake for granted our continuing dependence--an increasing dependence--\non that source and seem to be totally unconcerned about it.\n  We are legitimately concerned about Iran and Libya, but Iraq \nsanctions terrorism as well. Is it because we have allowed ourselves to \nbecome more dependent on Iraq? This is almost like an examination of \nconscience--the conscience of our country, the recognition of our \nnational security imperatives.\n  My good friend from Maryland may expect me to go into a long-winded \nexplanation of other alternatives for our increased dependence on oil. \nI believe that many alternatives can come domestically from the United \nStates. However, America's environmental community that suggests we \ncannot do it here at home.\n  But that environmental community isn't concerned with the national \nsecurity consequences of our increased dependence on Iraq. I think the \nAmerican people are inclined to take for granted that they can go to \nthe gas station and simply pick up the hose and put it in their \nautomobiles. We have had occasions where individuals have said: I \nthought that is the way it came. I forgot all about the reality that \nsomebody had to find it, recover it, refine it, ship it, and make it \navailable. Do we care about the fact that so much of it is coming from \nIraq--a place with which we are in a virtual state of war?\n  We stand against terrorism from Iran and Libya. But where do we stand \non the imminent threat from Iraq?\n  As we again address the reality of whether Americans should care \nwhere their oil comes from, it is fair to state there seems to be \nlittle concern about how environmentally compatible the development of \nSaddam Hussein's oil fields are. We do not seem to care about that. It \nis too far away. We want his oil. We will pay for it. End of \ndiscussion.\n  But should we care where it comes from? Yes, we should, just as we \nshould care very much about allowing terrorism to flourish in Iran and \nLibya. We should care about how we are contributing through our \naddiction to Iraqi oil to Saddam Hussein's campaign of terror.\n  We should stand against the environmental degradation that is \nassociated with some of the exploitation of resources in other \ncountries that ultimately are bound for the United States.\n  What about our economy? The greatest single contributor to the \ndeficit balance of payments is the price of imported oil. We send our \ndollars overseas; we send our jobs overseas. We have the resources here \nat home, not to totally relieve but to a degree lessen our dependence. \nDo we have the fortitude to recognize the alternatives are here?\n  This is a message that I don't think is very complex. It is a message \nbased on simple but indisputable facts. That reality is, we move \nAmerica and we move the world on oil. We are becoming more and more \ncommitted to that oil coming from Iraq, and Iraq has more and more \nleverage on the United States as a consequence of that. Again, I ask \nmyself: Where is Iraq in the bill that is before this body?\n  I have agreed to withdraw my amendment with the provision that the \nfloor leadership has assured me of an up-or-down vote on my amendment \nat a later time. I want the administration, the State Department, and \nthe domestic oil industry in this country that imports this oil from \nIraq to get the message that I mean business. We are going to have in \nthis body an up-or-down vote to either terminate our imports from Iraq \nand find our oil someplace else until such time as the administration \nand the President satisfies us that the inconsistencies associated with \nour relationship with Iraq are adequately addressed.\n  Iraq should be part of this bill before us. However, in accordance \nwith my agreement with the Leadership, I will withdraw the amendment, \nand unless there are other Members who want to speak on this on my \ntime, it would be my intention, if there are no others, with the \nagreement of the floor manager, I would consider yielding back the \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment for the \ninformation of the Senate.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1154.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n[[Page S8179]]\n\n    (Purpose: To make the United States' energy policy toward Iraq \n  consistent with the national security policies of the United States)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE AND FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act can be cited as the ``Iraq \n     Petroleum Import Restriction Act of 2001''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the government of the Republic of Iraq:\n       (A) has failed to comply with the terms of United Nations \n     Security Council Resolution 687 regarding unconditional Iraqi \n     acceptance of the destruction, removal, or rendering \n     harmless, under international supervision, of all nuclear, \n     chemical and biological weapons and all stocks of agents and \n     all related subsystems and components and all research, \n     development, support and manufacturing facilities, as well as \n     all ballistic missiles with a range greater than 150 \n     kilometers and related major parts, and repair and production \n     facilities and has failed to allow United Nations inspectors \n     access to sites used for the production or storage of weapons \n     of mass destruction.\n       (B) routinely contravenes the terms and conditions of UNSC \n     Resolution 661, authorizing the export of petroleum products \n     from Iraq in exchange for food, medicine and other \n     humanitarian products by conducting a routine and extensive \n     program to sell such products outside of the channels \n     established by UNSC Resolution 661 in exchange for military \n     equipment and materials to be used in pursuit of its program \n     to develop weapons of mass destruction in order to threaten \n     the United States and its allies in the Persian Gulf and \n     surrounding regions.\n       (C) has failed to adequately draw down upon the amounts \n     received in the Escrow Account established by UNSC Resolution \n     986 to purchase food, medicine and other humanitarian \n     products required by its citizens, resulting in massive \n     humanitarian suffering by the Iraqi people.\n       (D) conducts a periodic and systematic campaign to harass \n     and obstruct the enforcement of the United States and United \n     Kingdom-enforced ``No-Fly Zones'' in effect in the Republic \n     of Iraq.\n       (E) routinely manipulates the petroleum export production \n     volumes permitted under UNSC Resolution 661 in order to \n     create uncertainty in global energy markets, and therefore \n     threatens the economic security of the United States.\n       (2) Further imports of petroleum products from the Republic \n     of Iraq are inconsistent with the national security and \n     foreign policy interests of the United States and should be \n     eliminated until such time as they are not so inconsistent.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON IRAQI-ORIGIN PETROLEUM IMPORTS.\n\n       The direct or indirect import from Iraq of Iraqi-origin \n     petroleum and petroleum products is prohibited, \n     nothwithstanding an authorization by the Committee \n     established by UNSC Resolution 661 or its designee, or any \n     other order to the contrary.\n\n     SEC. 3. TERMINATION/PRESIDENTIAL CERTIFICATION.\n\n       This Act will remain in effect until such time as the \n     President, after consultation with the relevant committees in \n     Congress, certifies to the Congress that:\n       (1) the United States is not engaged in active military \n     operations in enforcing ``No-Fly-Zones'' in Iraq, supporting \n     United Nations sanctions against Iraq, preventing the \n     smuggling by of Iraqi-origin petroleum and petroleum products \n     in violation of UNSC Resolution 986, complying with United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 687 by eliminating \n     weapons of mass destruction, or otherwise preventing \n     threatening action by Iraq against the United States or its \n     allies; and\n       (2) resuming the importation of Iraqi-origin petroleum and \n     petroleum products would not be inconsistent with the \n     national security and foreign policy interests of the United \n     States.\n\n     SEC. 4. HUMANITARIAN INTERESTS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the President should \n     make all appropriate efforts to ensure that the humanitarian \n     needs of the Iraqi people are not negatively affected by this \n     Act, and should encourage through public, private, domestic \n     and international means the direct or indirect sale, donation \n     or other transfer to appropriate non-governmental health and \n     humanitarian organizations and individuals within Iraq of \n     food, medicine and other humanitarian products.\n\n     SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       (a) 661 Committee.--The term ``661 Committee'' means the \n     Security Council Committee established by UNSC Resolution \n     661, and persons acting for or on behalf of the Committee \n     under its specific delegation of authority for the relevant \n     matter or category of activity, including the overseers \n     appointed by the UN Secretary-General to examine and approve \n     agreements for purchases of petroleum and petroleum products \n     from the Government of Iraq pursuant to UNSC Resolution 986.\n       (b) UNSC Resolution 661.--The term ``UNSC Resolution 661'' \n     means United Nations Security Council Resolution No. 661, \n     adopted August 6, 1990, prohibiting certain transactions with \n     respect to Iraq and Kuwait.\n       (c) UNSC Resolution 986.--The term ``UNSC Resolution 986'' \n     means United Nations Security Council Resolution 986, adopted \n     April 14, 1995.\n\n     SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The prohibition on importation of Iraqi origin petroleum \n     and petroleum products shall be effective 30 days after \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 1154, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I wanted to take a few minutes to \naddress some of the comments of the Senator from Alaska. We have time \non the amendment. Then I would be happy to yield back the time. I \nassume the Senator would yield back his time on the amendment. Then we \nwould just be left with completing the bill. If I may now be recognized \nto speak on the time allotted with respect to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Alaska, there \nis much in what he said. I certainly agree with his condemnation of \nSaddam Hussein. He asked, why isn't Iraq in this bill?\n  I think there are two reasons. One is, the bill was addressed to do a \nvery simple, straightforward thing, and that was to extend the Iran-\nLibya sanctions. We did not undertake, either with hearings or in any \nother way, to examine the Iraqi situation.\n  Secondly, the Senator has given Members of this body a lot of food \nfor thought with respect to the Iraq situation. Let me add a couple of \nobservations which Members should keep in mind. This goes back to the \nadministration's efforts now to tighten sanctions at the United Nations \nwith respect to Iraq and the fact that the United States is part of an \neffort, through the U.N., to constrain Saddam Hussein.\n  Iraq is able to sell oil to foreign companies, including American \ncompanies, but legally only under the guidelines of the U.N. Oil For \nFood Program.\n  It is true they are bootlegging oil, and they have some middlemen at \nwork. Of course, they are trying to tighten the regime in order to \npreclude those two possibilities. But the money that is being paid for \nthe oil under the U.N. Oil For Food Program goes into a U.N.-controlled \nescrow account. The expenditures of that money out of the escrow \naccount, the disbursement is subject to our review and our veto.\n  This is all an effort to try to ensure that the money goes in for \nhumanitarian purposes involving the Iraqi people and not for Saddam \nHussein's purposes.\n  The fact that we have been able to work through U.N. Security Council \nresolutions means that there is a program in place barring companies \nfrom making energy investments in Iraq. That is now being followed by \nthe United States and by other countries as well. We are trying to \nmonitor this program to alleviate the humanitarian situation and to \nensure that the moneys do not go into the coffers of Saddam Hussein.\n\n  We are in a sensitive situation at the United Nations because we just \ngot the existing sanctions regime extended. We were unable to get the \nsanctions regime altered, as we ran into difficulties in the end from \nRussia. We have to be very careful how we move on this situation so we \ndon't risk losing the existing multilateral sanctions regime which, \nalthough not perfect, is serving a very useful purpose.\n  Obviously, if the U.S. companies are barred under the U.N. Oil For \nFood Program, other companies will fill the gap. I am more concerned \nabout the fact that if we start playing this unilateral game on Iraq \nwhere we have multilateral sanctions in place, we may erode and \nundermine the multilateral sanctions.\n  As we consider this proposal, and as the Senator from Alaska has \nindicated, he anticipates it will be back before us at some future \ntime, we have to keep in mind this very difficult situation we have at \nthe U.N.--Secretary Powell's efforts to sharpen the sanctions and to \nfocus them in a more direct way. I don't think we want to jeopardize \nthat.\n  I think Members need to keep that in mind as we consider the Iraqi \nsituation.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I may respond to the floor manager.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\n[[Page S8180]]\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield myself a minute or so.\n  It is not the intention nor the wording of my amendment to in any way \nalter the Oil For Food Program. That stays. My amendment does not \njeopardize that. Let me make a couple of points in response.\n  What I wish to emphasize is our increasing dependence on this source. \nIt is now 10 percent of the total oil that we import. The significance \nof that is that, as the Senator from Maryland pointed out, is that the \nOil-for-food program is kind of like a sieve. There are these \nsanctions, but as the Senator from Maryland noted, the oil seeps out \nthrough other routes than the U.N. Unfortunately, it doesn't have an \nadequate safeguard.\n  So he is able to fund a significant amount of oil outside of the U.N. \nsanctions. And then the last point I want to make is that this is a \nunique situation. We should remind people that we are flying sorties, \nenforcing a no-fly zone over a country that we are allowing ourselves \nto become more dependent upon. I think that is very dangerous from the \nstandpoint of national security.\n  Obviously, Saddam Hussein himself and his record of terrorism speaks \nfor itself. We rightly condemn Iran and Libya for harboring and \nsponsoring terrorists. I think Saddam Hussein fits into that category \nas well. In addition, we should not forget that have a growing \ndependence on an individual who, at virtually every opportunity, \nconcludes major speeches with ``death to Israel.''\n  Clearly, we are almost at war with this individual. These are the \ninconsistencies that need to be brought out and recognized for what \nthey are and addressed in some responsible manner. The efforts by the \nSenator from Alaska to address this--first, to bring it to the body, \nwhich I have done today, and I have a commitment for an up-or-down vote \nfrom leadership, and I hope that the conscience of America reflects to \nsome degree on each of our colleagues the fact that this is not, by any \nmeans, the best situation we could have in our foreign policy, nor our \nnational security, by increasing dependence on this particular source. \nI would feel much better getting it from the OPEC nations rather than \nSaddam Hussein. That concludes my remarks. I thank my friend for his \ncourtesies.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Has the amendment been withdrawn?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield back the time we had on the amendment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield back my time, too.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield 3 minutes?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I think the Senator from Texas has time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I yield myself such time as I might consume.\n  Mr. President, first of all, I congratulate Chairman Sarbanes on this \nbill. This is a bipartisan bill. I think it is a good bill. I think it \nis justified. I am not unaware of the fact that things are happening in \nIran. I continue to hope that a great country with a very proud \nhistory, with 67 million people, will have an awakening of freedom, and \nthat Iran will rejoin the community of nations at some point. But while \nour committee is not unaware of the fact that there are some promising \nsigns in Iran, the policy of the Government is still a policy that we \nfind objectionable. Therefore, I support this bill.\n  If something changes in Iran, if there is a change in policy, \nproduced either by a change in the Government or a change in the policy \nof the Government, I think there is strong support in our committee, in \nthe Congress, and in the country to change the current policy. But it \nis up to Iran and its people as to what course they are going to \nfollow, whether they are going to be one of the responsible nations in \nthe world or whether they are going to support terrorism.\n  Let me also say that I see no sign that any similar hope is present \nin Libya. The bottom line is that we have to judge nations as we judge \npeople, based on how they behave. When they behave irresponsibly, we \ncan take note of it if we want to discourage that behavior.\n  I hope we will get a strong vote. I have to say that when our \ncommittee debated this issue, while there was an overwhelming vote of \nsupport, we had a very good debate. Many important points were raised, \nand I was quite proud of how seriously we took this issue.\n\n  I don't have any intention to use my 30 minutes. I don't know if \nanyone else on my side wishes to speak, so maybe for the time being I \nwill reserve my time and see if anybody comes over. Let me conclude my \nremarks and see if there is anyone on the Democrat side who wants to \nspeak. I hope my colleagues will vote for the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act. \nI believe that, unfortunately, it is needed. I hope things will change \nso that we can lift these sanctions some day, and I hope it is soon. \nBut something has to change to make that happen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will yield the Senator from Oregon as much time as he \nmight require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I thank Senator Gramm. I will be brief. Mr. \nPresident, I compliment the ranking member and the chairman of the \nBanking Committee for bringing this legislation to the floor. It has \nbeen my privilege to introduce it to their committee with Senator \nSchumer, the Senator from New York--a Republican and a Democrat.\n  Senator Schumer and I came together on this bill in the belief that, \nas America pursues its national interests abroad, we should not forget \nour national values at home. One of the national values that I believe \nwe have is our commitment to the State of Israel to defend it in its \nexistence. This is a commitment that continues today in some very \ntroubled waters. But the truth is, if you examine the globe and try to \nevaluate where America could be drawn into a conflict, surely the \nMiddle East is one of those.\n  Some of the actors in the Middle East, it seems to me, have made it \nclear in recent days that their intention is not to make peace with \nIsrael but to eliminate Israel from the map. To that end, we see in \nIran a nation that is pursuing its petroleum business in order to buy \nits munitions, its weapons business, to build weapons of mass \ndestruction and the rocketry to deliver them, to engage in this deadly \ntrade--all aimed at the State of Israel.\n  What can we do about that? Well, one of the things this Congress and \nthe American people have done as an expression of our commitment is to \nestablish the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act. We need to renew that before \nAugust 5 or it will lapse. It will now be renewed, I believe, for an \nadditional 5 years. It is very important that we do this because, \ncurrently, Iran is giving $100 million a year to finance the activities \nof Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad, and Hamas. They are supplying them with \nthe deadliest of munitions, and we are seeing their work played out on \nthe streets of Jerusalem.\n  Further, now we know that Iran is proliferating all kinds of weapons \nof the deadliest kind. So the only peaceful means we have to respond is \nwith our dollars and with these sanctions, which try to thwart the \ndevelopment of petroleum projects in Iran--by the way, they have been \nvery effective in that interruption--the profits from which can be \nspent on weapons of mass destruction.\n  Where does Libya come in? Libya still refuses to abide by U.N. \nSecurity Council resolutions regarding Pan Am flight 103, which require \nthat Tripoli formally renounce terrorism, accept responsibility for the \nactions of its Government officials convicted of masterminding the \nbombing, provide information about the bombing, and pay appropriate \ncompensation to the families of the victims. Further, Libya is a prime \nsuspect of many of the past terrorist actions that have rocked the \nMiddle East.\n  ILSA threatens the imposition of economic sanctions against foreign \nentities investing in Iran and Libya. Again, as we look at how \neffective it has been, of the 55 major petroleum projects in Iran that \nhave sought foreign investment, I am only aware of a half dozen or so \nthat have received foreign investment. This is the best and most \npeaceful way we have to respond to a buildup of weaponry that could \nthreaten Israel's existence and draw the United States into conflict as \nwell.\n  I believe ILSA has proven it works. I believe it reflects our \nnational values,\n\n[[Page S8181]]\n\nand I believe it restates in the clearest of terms our commitment to \nthe security of Israel and its place in the world.\n  I am pleased over 78 of our colleagues have signed on as original \ncosponsors of this bill.\n  I thank the chairman of the committee and the ranking member for \nbringing it to the floor today and to a vote, I assume, very soon.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has 10 minutes \nremaining, and the Senator from Texas has 21\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SARBANES. There is a total of 31 minutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am going to put in a quorum call and \nalert my colleagues if there is anyone else who wishes to speak on this \nbill, they should let us know and come to the floor promptly. \nOtherwise, we will yield back all of our time and schedule this matter \nto go to a vote at 6:30 this evening. I will get further guidance on \nthat, but for the moment I will put in a quorum call with the alert to \nother colleagues, if there is anyone else who wishes to speak on this \nbill, they should let us know and come at once. Otherwise, we are going \nto draw this debate to a close.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Lincoln). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I join my colleagues in support of \nrenewing the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act to protect American interests in \nthe Middle East. Despite promising changes within Iranian society, \nIran's external behavior remains provocative and destabilizing. Iran \ncontinues to aggressively foment terrorism beyond its borders and \ndevelop weapons of mass destruction as a matter of national policy. \nConsistent calls from its leaders for Israel's destruction, and the \nIranian government's bankrolling of murderous behavior by Hezbollah, \nHamas, and other terrorist groups, should make clear to all friends of \npeace where Iran stands, and what role it has played, in the \nconflagration that threatens to consume an entire region.\n  Nor has Iranian-sponsored terrorism targeted only our Israeli ally. \nAccording to Attorney General Ashcroft, Iranian government officials \n``inspired, supported, and supervised members of Saudi Hezbollah'' \nresponsible for the 1996 terrorist attack on Khobar Towers, which took \nthe lives of 19 U.S. service men. According to former FBI Director \nFreeh, that chain of responsibility extends to Iran's most senior \nleadership.\n  Critics of our Iran sanctions policy make two arguments. The first is \nthat these sanctions are ineffective. But according to the Iranian \ngovernment itself, in a 1998 report to the United Nations, ILSA caused \n``the disruption of the country's economic system,'' a ``decline in its \ngross national product,'' and a ``reduction in international \ninvestment.'' As Lawrence Kaplan points out in this week's edition of \nThe New Republic, since ILSA was enacted in 1996, Iran has promoted \nover 50 investment opportunities in its energy sector but has secured \nonly eight oil contracts. Sanctions have a deterrent effect on \ninternational investors, notwithstanding the foreign policies some of \ntheir national governments pursue.\n  The second argument of sanctions critics is that ILSA renewal would \nstifle American-Iranian rapprochement, in which we hold a strategic \ninterest. This argument would carry weight had our government not \nrepeatedly sought to initiate an official dialogue on normalization \nwith Iran. But our highest leaders have extended the olive branch on \nseveral occasions. Each time, the Iranian government has rejected it. \nIn June 1998, then-Secretary of State Albright called for mutual \nconfidence-building measures that could lead to a ``road map'' for \nnormalization. The Iranian government rejected this unprecedented \noverture. In March 2000, Secretary Albright gave another speech in \nwhich she expressed regret for American policy towards Iran in the \npast, called for easing sanctions on some Iranian imports, and pledged \nto work to resolve outstanding claims disputes dating to the \nrevolution. Iran's government deemed this offer insufficient to form \nthe basis for a new dialogue. In September 2000, then-President Clinton \nand Secretary Albright went out of their way to attend President \nKhatami's speech at the United Nations an important diplomatic symbol \nof our interest in a new relationship. But the Iranians again balked. I \nask: whose policy is static and immovable America's, with our repeated \ndiplomatic entreaties for a more normal relationship, or Iran's, which \nrejects all such overtures even as it steps up the very behavior we \nfind unacceptable?\n  Nor is it time for the United States to lift sanctions on Libya. The \nsuccessful conclusion of the Lockerbie trial, which explicitly \nimplicated Libya's intelligence services in the attack, does not \nabsolve Libya of its obligations to meet fully the terms of the U.N. \nSecurity Council resolutions governing the multilateral sanctions \nregime against it. Libya has not done so. Libya's support for state \nterrorism, as certified again this year by our State Department, and \nits aggressive efforts to develop chemical and potentially nuclear \nweapons, exclude Libya from the ranks of law-abiding nations.\n  Lifting sanctions now on Iran and Libya would be premature and would \nunjustly reward their continuing hostility to basic international norms \nof behavior. I support extension of ILSA in the knowledge that it is \nnot American sanctions policy but unacceptable behavior by these rogue \nregimes that precludes a new policy toward them at this time.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise to express my concerns about the \nlack of review and reporting requirements for S.1218, the \nreauthorization of the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, known as, ILSA. I \nbelieve that a renewal of any sanctions law should accompany a full \nreview and report to the Congress on the effectiveness of the sanctions \npolicy it imposes.\n  First, I want to express my support for the goals of ILSA. All of us \nwant to prevent terrorist organizations from carrying out their \nterrible activities and we want to stop the dangerous proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction, (WMD), technology. We must work with our \nallies and friends to use multilateral means and pressure these \nentities and countries to depart from these dangerous activities and \nwork to encourage them to behave in a manner consistent with \ninternational norms. In the case of Libya, multilateral agreement on \nthe course of action has been largely reached. Libya must take full \nresponsibility for the despicable terrorist act resulting in the \ndowning of Pan Am flight 103. In the case of Iran, however, the level \nof multilateral agreement is less consistent, in part because Iran has \nmade some changes, albeit very small.\n  The Banking Committee recently reported, by a 19 to 2 margin, the \nIran-Libya Sanctions Act. I was one of those who could not support the \nbill at the time because it failed to require a report on the results \nof ILSA. I believe that this Congress has neither taken adequate time \nto examine the effectiveness of ILSA, nor the consequences of renewing \nILSA for 5 years.\n  At the Banking Committee markup, I supported Senator Hagel's \namendment, which would have reauthorized ILSA for two years, and more \nimportantly, required the President to report to the Congress on the \neffectiveness of the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act. The administration also \nrequested a 2-year reauthorization so it could have a better \nopportunity to review its effectiveness. It is reasonable and prudent \npolicy to review sanctions laws on a periodic basis. It would help \nensure that the administration and Congress work together to forge an \neffective, commonsense policy which promotes our national security and \nforeign policy goals. We are living in a complex and more globalized \nworld, so periodic review is necessary to keep pace with new \ndevelopments. I also encourage a review of all of our sanctions \nstatutes specifically relating to Iran to ensure a simplified approach \nto U.S. sanctions policy toward Iran.\n  The current ILSA does not sanction Iran and Libya. Instead, it \nsanctions those who engage in certain levels of investment in Iran's \nand Libya's petroleum sectors. In addition, it does not\n\n[[Page S8182]]\n\nappear to me that the Congress fully considered the few positive \ndevelopments that have occurred in Iran since the 1996 when ILSA was \nfirst passed. I fully understand that the hard-line clerics still \ncontrol many of Iran's policies. However, we must not turn a blind eye \ntoward Iran's election of Khatemi and the desire of young Iranian \npeople to liberalize Iran's policies. Instead of showing some \nwillingness to work with Iran, we are demonstrating our own \ninflexibility.\n  The United States has direct national security interests in \nmaintaining the stability of the Middle East. Israel is an island of \nstability within this turbulent region. It deserves the support of the \nUnited States. In doing so, however, we must do everything possible to \navoid making enemies for both the United States and Israel in that \nregion. The U.S. must remain strong, but willing to revisit issues of \nsuch importance to the security of both the United States and Israel. \nIt is my hope that despite the lack of a reporting requirement in \nS.1218, the Bush administration will conduct a thorough review of the \neffectiveness of ILSA and other sanctions laws.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I rise today to speak in support of S. \n1218, the Iran Libya Sanctions Extension Act of 2001. This legislation \nwill extend for another five years the Iran Libya Sanctions Act of \n1996, which would otherwise expire on August 5, 2001.\n  In 1996 Congress unanimously enacted ILSA in response to Iran's \nemergence as the leading state sponsor of international terrorism, its \naccelerated campaign to develop weapons of mass destruction, its denial \nof Israel's right to exist, and its efforts to undermine peace and \nstability in the Middle East.\n  Five years later, the U.S. State Department's ``Patterns and Global \nTerrorism,'' reported that Iran still remains ``the most active state-\nsponsor of terrorism'' in the world, by providing assistance to \nterrorist organizations such as Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Islamic \nJihad.\n  Eleven short days from now, ILSA is set to expire. That is why we \nmust act today to renew this important legislation to deter foreign \ninvestment in Iran's energy sector--its major source of income. By \ndoing so we can continue to undermine Iran's ability to fund the \ndevelopment of weapons of mass destruction and its support of \ninternational terrorist groups.\n  In February of this year, I met with families of the American victims \nof the bombing of Pam Am Flight 103 in 1988. Brian Flynn, from New York \nCity, recalled driving to John F. Kennedy airport to retrieve the body \nof his brother, J.P. Flynn, who had perished in the bombing. Brian \nremembered: ``There was no flag, no ceremony, no recognition that he \nwas killed simply for being an American.''\n  Earlier this year, once again Brian drove to John F. Kennedy airport, \nthis time, to go to the Netherlands to listen to the verdict against \ntwo Libyan nationals indicted for the bombing. A Libyan intelligence \nofficer was found guilty of murder in the bombing, in the words of the \ncourt, ``in furtherance of the purposes of . . . Libyan Intelligence \nServices.'' Yet Libya continues to refuse to acknowledge its role and \nto compensate the family members of 270 victims of the bombing. The \nState Department reports that Libya also remains the primary suspect in \nseveral other past terrorist operations. Brian and so many family \nmembers of the dozens of New Yorkers killed in the bombing, have \nwritten to me and conveyed how important it is for the United States to \ncontinue to hold Libya accountable for its support of international \nterrorism.\n  By acting now to renew ILSA, the Senate is sending a clear message to \nIran and Libya that their dangerous support for terrorism and efforts \nto develop weapons of mass destruction are unacceptable and will not be \ntolerated.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote \non final passage of S. 1218, the Iran-Libya sanctions bill, occur this \nevening at 6:30.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object other than to indicate to all of the Senators within the \nsound of my voice, we are going to attempt to have two, maybe three, \nvotes at 6:30. Senator Wellstone will be here at 4:30 to begin the \ndialogue, the debate on the Horn nomination, and then after that we are \ngoing to go to the nominee for the Small Business Administration, Mr. \nBarreto. We hope we can have those votes also at 6:30.\n  I appreciate the usual good work of my friend from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I want to make it clear to colleagues \nthat I am ready to speak on the nomination of Wade Horn to be HHS \nAssistant Secretary for Family Support. We are moving forward and are \ntrying to get some work done. I am ready to speak. I think there are \nother Senators who want to speak in favor of the nomination. My guess \nis that it is a relatively noncontroversial nomination and there will \nbe strong support. It can be a voice vote. It doesn't matter to me. But \nI want to speak and get this work done now. I am ready to do so.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

HORN, OF MARYLAND, TO BE ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR \n        FAMILY SUPPORT, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the nomination.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Wade F. Horn, \nof Maryland, to be Assistant Secretary for Family Support, Department \nof Health and Human Services.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, again, for the sake of my colleagues' \nschedules, I do not think this will take that much time. I know there \nare some Senators who want to speak. I think it is a relatively \nnoncontroversial nomination. I certainly do not need 2 hours.\n  I do want to speak on the nomination of Dr. Wade Horn to the position \nof Assistant Secretary for Family Support at the Department of Health \nand Human Services.\n  This is a very important position. Once confirmed for this position, \nDr.\n\n[[Page S8183]]\n\nHorn is going to have authority over the administration of the Federal \nwelfare, child care, child welfare, foster care, and adoption programs. \nHe is going to have considerable influence in the upcoming \nreauthorization of the so-called welfare reform legislation.\n  These are issues that all of us care about. But, as my colleagues \nknow, much of my own background, in addition to teaching, was community \norganizing. Most of that was with poor people. And much of that was \nwith single-parent families, almost always women, sometimes men. \nUnfortunately, when marriages dissolve, or when it comes to the \nresponsibility of raising children, it disproportionately falls on the \nshoulders of women.\n  I have devoted a lot of time to these issues. I really believe that, \nfor me, if I have a passion, it is around the central idea that every \nchild in our country should have the same opportunity to reach her or \nhis full potential. That is what I believe. I suppose all of us do. \nMaybe people have different ideas how we realize that goal, but, for \nme, that is the core value that informs me as a Senator. And I am for \neverything--public sector, private sector--that makes that more likely, \nmore possible, and I am opposed to whatever makes it less possible.\n  In my opinion, Dr. Horn's views about the causes of the circumstances \nof these families--especially single-parent families, almost always \nheaded by women--as well as a number of his stated proposals as to how \nto address these circumstances make him not the right choice to serve \nin this position. I do not think he is the right person for this job.\n  I hasten to add that I have met with him. I am sure that this \ndiscussion in the Senate Chamber is of great interest to Dr. Horn. As I \nsay, I have met with him. He was more than obliging to come by. I \nthought we had a very good discussion. And I do not say that as a \ncliche. He responded in writing to a number of questions I sent to him \nfollowing the conversation.\n  I think he feels just as strongly about these issues as I do. I think \nhe would fight against any policy he thought would be harmful to low-\nincome families, especially poor children. I do not want to caricature \nhim. We have an honest but fundamental disagreement about the best way \nto move families in this country from poverty to self-sufficiency.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter and \nthe signatures of more than 90 organizations that oppose this \nnomination.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    June 14, 2001.\n       Dear Senator: We are writing to urge your opposition to the \n     nomination of Wade Horn as Assistant Secretary for Family \n     Support at the Department of Health and Human Services. We \n     ask that you investigate the writings and philosophy of Mr. \n     Horn and that you question him thoroughly when he comes \n     before the Senate Finance Committee for confirmation.\n       The HHS Assistant Secretary for Family Support, the \n     country's top family policy post, will be making important \n     decisions and recommendations on many critical public \n     programs which serve predominantly lower income children and \n     families, including welfare, childcare, child welfare, child \n     support, adoption, foster care, child abuse and domestic \n     violence. The person who holds this job will also influence \n     the Administration's positions and activities dealing with \n     next year's reauthorization of the Temporary Assistance to \n     Needy Families (TANF) programs. This person must be able to \n     understand and promote the needs of ALL families in our \n     society.\n       Wade Horn wants the government to promote marriage by \n     penalizing families where the parents divorce, separate, or \n     do not marry. He also wants the government to tell unmarried \n     mothers to surrender their children for adoption. There is \n     very little ``support'' for families in these sentiments.\n       With Wade Horn as Assistant Secretary for Family Support, \n     we fear a Department of Health and Human Services that will \n     penalize, and promote discrimination against, families headed \n     by a divorced. Separated, or never-married parent or where \n     both parents live in the home but are not married. Horn has \n     written that single parent families should be denied public \n     benefits whose supply is limited--such as public housing, \n     Head Start, and child care--unless all married couples have \n     been served first. Horn has written that cohabiting parent \n     families should be denied any welfare benefits at all, and \n     kept at the end of the waiting list for other benefit \n     programs.\n       Due to divorce, separation, death, abandonment or their \n     parent's never-married status, more than half the children \n     growing up today will spend some of their childhood in a \n     single-parent family. An increasing number of children live \n     in two parent families where the parents delay marriage, \n     choose not to marry or are prevented by law from marrying. \n     Horn advocates penalizing all these children.\n       By supporting Wade Horn's nomination as Assistant Secretary \n     for Family Support at the Department of health and Human \n     Services, president Bush's campaign call to ``Leave No Child \n     Behind'' rings hollow. If the President's true intention is \n     to support all of America's families and children, rather \n     than judging and penalizing many, he should appoint an \n     individual who can work with Congress, our states and our own \n     dedicated organizations to ensure that we will be more--not \n     less--compassionate when dealing with our children and \n     families living at or near poverty.\n           Sincerely,\n\n     Abortion Access Project\n     ACORN\n     AIDS Action Committee\n     Alternatives to Marriage Project\n     American Ethical Union\n     Applied Research Center\n     Arizona Coalition Against domestic Violence\n     Association of Reproductive Health Professionals\n     Boston Coalition of Black Women\n     Boston Women's Health Book Collective\n     Business and Professional Women/USA\n     Center for Community Change\n     Center for Reproductive Law and Policy\n     Center for Third World Organizing\n     Center for Women Policy Studies\n     Center on Fathers, Families and Public Policy\n     Chicago Jobs Council\n     Chicago Metropolitan Battered Women's Network\n     Children's Foundation\n     Choice USA\n     Coalition Against Poverty\n     Coalition for Ethical Welfare Reform\n     Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights\n     Coalition of Labor Union Women\n     Colorado Center on Law and Policy\n     Communications Workers of America\n     Community Voices Heard\n     Democrats.com\n     Displaced Homemakers Network of New Jersey\n     Empire State Pride Agenda\n     EMPOWER,\n     Family Economic Initiative\n     Family Planning Advocates of New York State\n     Feminist Majority\n     Finding Common Ground Project at Columbia University\n     Grassroots Organizing for Welfare Leadership (GROWL)\n     Hawaii Coalition for the Prevention of Sexual Assault\n     Hawaii State Coalition Against Domestic Violence\n     Hesed House\n     inMotion, Inc.\n     Institute for Wisconsin's Future\n     Iowa Coalition Against Domestic Violence\n     Jewish Women International\n     Los Angeles Coalition to End Hunger & Homelessness\n     Make the Road by Walking\n     Massachusetts Welfare Rights Union\n     McAuley Institute\n     Men for Gender Justice\n     MOTHERS Now\n     National Association for the Advancement of Colored People \n         (NAACP)\n     National Association of Commissions for Women\n     National Black Women's Health Project\n     National Center on Poverty Law\n     National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs\n     National Employment Law Project\n     National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association\n     National Gay and Lesbian Task Force\n     National Organization for Women (NOW)\n     National Women's Conference\n     National Women's Political Caucus\n     New York City Gay & Lesbian Anti-Violence Project\n     9to5, National Association of Working Women\n     Nontraditional Employment For Women\n     North Carolina Coalition Against Domestic Violence\n     Northeast Missouri Client Council for Human Needs\n     Northeast Washington Rural Resources Dev.

A lot of the organizations listed include women and \nchildren organizations and, in particular, organizations that do the \ndown-in-the-trenches work dealing with domestic violence. That is what \nI want to talk about. It does not get discussed enough.\n  In this disagreement, I want to address, in particular, Dr. Horn's \nfocus on ``marriage promotion and responsible fatherhood policies.'' He \nis a prominent advocate of ``marriage promotion and responsible \nfatherhood.'' Some of these ideas are going to be central to the \nreauthorization of welfare ``reform'' next year.\n  Again, I always put ``reform'' in quotes. Just as single moms were \nthe focus in 1996, single dads could very well be in the spotlight next \nyear. I do not think that, in itself, is a bad thing. I doubt whether \nthere is anyone among us who would argue against the importance of \nwhere fathers fit in with families, about the importance of investing \nin the needs of low-income men, just as we should be concerned about \nthe needs of low-income women.\n  The question is, what kind of investments we should make, and how can \nwe best serve the needs of low-income adults, men and women, and also \ntheir children?\n  Dr. Horn most recently was president of the National Fatherhood \nInstitute which was created in 1994 ``to counter the growing problem of \nfatherlessness by stimulating a broad-based social movement to restore \nresponsible fatherhood as a national priority.''\n  I believe in the importance of responsible fatherhood. Having three \ngrown children and six grandchildren, I certainly believe in it. I am \nnot here to speak against responsible fatherhood.\n  He also sat on the board of Marriage Savers, which is a Maryland-\nbased group promoting community marriage covenants that are designed to \nmake divorces more difficult to obtain. Dr. Horn has in the past urged \nStates to take advantage of opportunities created by welfare reform to \naddress what many cultural conservatives consider to be the root of \nsociety's social ills today, the decline of the traditional family.\n  In 1997, he wrote a report, along with Andrew Bush, director of the \nHudson Institute's Welfare Policy Center. Dr. Horn recommended that \nStates basically--I have to use this word-- ``discriminate'' against \nsingle-parent families by establishing ``explicit preferential \ntreatment for marriage in the distribution of discretionary benefits \nsuch as public housing and Head Start slots.''\n  Now, although he has distanced himself from this suggestion, as \nrecently as June of this year, Dr. Horn has continued to advocate for \npolicies that would provide financial incentives for marriage.\n  Let me go back to 1997. I know this is not the issue that carries the \nmost weight in the Senate Chamber. I am not trying to be self-\nrighteous. There is a reason why so many organizations and so many \npeople around the country work in this area. The notion of women being \nbattered at home and what the children see, that is just not so much on \nour radar screen, although a woman is battered every 15 seconds of \nevery day in America. When you start making an argument that for Head \nStart or public housing the way that you are going to encourage \nmarriage is to give preferential treatment to those who are married, \nwhat you do is you put poor women in a situation where they dare not \nleave a home which is so dangerous for them and their children because \nthen they may not have any Head Start benefits for their child or they \nmay not be in line to get the housing they need. Why in the world would \nanyone ever want to advocate such policies?\n\n  I am sorry. A lot of this discussion today on my part will be low key \nfor me, but not this part of the discussion. I know that Senators don't \nthink about this, but just think about the harshness of these kinds of \nproposals. Dr. Horn, I hope, is going through some rethinking on this \nquestion as well. I think he is, from the discussion we had. But it \nconcerns me for anyone as recently as 4 years ago to advocate that for \nlow-income families, you give preferential treatment to those who are \nmarried so that single-parent homes headed by women, almost always, are \nput at a disadvantage. Then we are going to make it hard for this woman \nto get out of this situation. Sometimes you don't want women to stay in \nthe homes. Sometimes you don't want them to stay in the marriages \nbecause they are hellish situations. Somebody has to say that in the \nSenate.\n  The only reason I am speaking today, after having already testified \nto the goodwill of Dr. Horn as a person, is because I am going to stay \nso close to his work, and I am going to insist that not one proposal \ncome from this administration that puts some of these women and these \nchildren in jeopardy. This problem of violence in homes is a real \nproblem in our country.\n  In a recent article, entitled ``Wedding Bell Blues, Marriage and \nWelfare Reform,'' Dr. Horn suggested that Congress could mandate that \nStates implement policies such as West Virginia's current practice. \nThat is, you provide a cash bonus to single mothers on welfare who \nmarry their child's biological father, or perhaps, he has suggested, \nCongress could provide a $5,000 cash payment to a woman at risk of \nbearing a child out of wedlock, if she bears her first child within \nmarriage, to be disbursed in $1,000 annual payments over 5 years as \nlong as she remains married.\n  Again, I know if these proposals are made within the framework of \npromoting responsible fatherhood or promoting intact families or being \nopposed to divorce, it may sound attractive. But again, think about the \nways in which these proposals can be in some circumstances actually \ndangerous to the well-being of many low-income women and children. \nSomebody in the Senate has to advocate this position.\n  My wife Sheila--more Sheila than I--has spent years now working on \ndomestic violence issues. There is no doubt in my mind, none, that \npolicies that tie financial incentives to getting married or staying \nmarried will result in increased incidents of domestic violence. Think \nabout it for a moment. If a low-income woman is faced with a choice of \nreceiving $1,000 a year, especially a woman who with her children is \nliving in extreme poverty, or leaving a situation where she has been \nabused, what is she likely to do? What kind of incentive have you built \ninto public policy?\n  You have built in an incentive which says to this woman: You need to \nstay at home. You need to marry this man. You need to stay married to \nthis man. What if this man has battered her over and over and over \nagain?\n\n  How can so many Senators who supported the Violence Against Women \nAct, where we finally have begun to address this issue, now not express \nconcern about these kinds of proposals?\n  By the way, if we can afford to give families with children an extra \nthousand dollars a year, then by what logic can we possibly suggest \nthat other families with children should be made poor simply because \ntheir parents are unmarried? Think about it for a moment. Why should a \nchild, no fault of his own or her own, just because that child is the \ndaughter or son, little daughter or son, of a single parent, a family \nwhere the parents are not together, be penalized? This is nonsensical. \nThese are rather perverse priorities or incentives built into public \npolicy.\n  When considering marriage as a solution for poverty, we need to face \nthe reality that violence against women is a significant cause of \nwomen's poverty. Domestic violence makes women poor, and it keeps them \npoor. The majority of battered women attempt to flee their abusers, but \nmany of them end up on welfare or they end up homeless. Study after \nstudy demonstrates that a large proportion of the welfare caseload, \nconsistently between 15 and 25 percent, consists of current victims of \nserious domestic violence. Between one-half and two-thirds of the women \non welfare have suffered domestic violence or abuse at some time in \ntheir adult lives. Over 50 percent of homeless women and children cite \ndomestic violence as the reason they are homeless.\n  Please understand, whether it be preferential treatment for Head \nStart\n\n[[Page S8185]]\n\nor affordable housing, or whether it be bonuses that reward women for \nstaying in a marriage, let's not put low-income women in a position \nwhere they are in a very dangerous home, they are being battered, and \nquite often their children are battered as well.\n  Their children witness the violence not in the movie, not on \ntelevision, but in their own living rooms. The children can't do as \nwell in school. Don't create a set of financial incentives that are \ngoing to make it harder for these women and these children to be able \nto leave these circumstances. That is what I am saying today. These are \nmy concerns. That is why you have close to 90 organizations--by the \nway, hardly any of them would have any clout--that have real concerns \nabout this. For these women and children, the cost of freedom and \nsafety has been poverty. Marriage is not the solution to their economic \ninsecurity.\n  By the way, do you know that one of the problems is, even if these \nwomen leave and they go to shelters--as my colleague from Nevada said \nearlier today, in many of our States we have more animal shelters than \nwe have shelters for women and children who experience violence. How \nabout that? Then, if they are in a shelter, there is no affordable \nhousing to go to. As opposed to making proposals, which Dr. Horn has \nmade, that talk about all these bonuses and ways of promoting marriage, \nwhy don't we, instead, put the emphasis on responsible fathers?\n  Don Frazier, who was mayor and a great representative of the House of \nRepresentatives, did a lot of that in Minnesota. We should do more. But \nif we have this kind of money, why don't we put it into affordable \nhousing?\n  Marriage is not the solution to their economic insecurity. For some \nof these women--can I say this one time in this Chamber? For some of \nthese women, marriage could even mean death. I am sorry. I am going to \nsay it again. That is true. I feel strongly about this. I know what the \nreality is, from what I have seen with my own eyes from the work Sheila \nand I have done with women who have been faced with violence in their \nhomes. For some of these women, not only is marriage not the answer to \ntheir economic insecurity, for some of them marriage could even mean \ndeath. It will undoubtedly mean economic dependence on the abuser. Many \nbattered women are economically dependent on their abusers. Between \none-third and almost 50 percent of abused women, surveyed in five \nstudies, said their partner prevented them from working entirely. In \nfact, we introduced legislation today--Senator Murray, Senator Dodd, \nSenator Schumer were a part of this--in which we said--and we had \npeople from the business community and the labor community testify--\npart of the problem is a lot of women, when they try to leave and work, \nthe abuser, the stalker, comes to work, threatens them, comes into the \noffice and makes a scene, and guess what happens. The employers let the \nwomen go. They say we can't take this any longer, and then she loses \nher job.\n  Of the 96 percent of women who report they experienced problems due \nto domestic violence, 70 percent have been harassed at work, 50 percent \nhave lost 3 days of work a month as a result of abuse, and 25 percent \nhave lost at least 1 job due to domestic violence.\n  Do you want to put these women in a situation where they have to stay \nin these marriages? Marriage is not always the answer, colleagues. I \nhave been married 37 years--maybe closer to 38 years. It has been the \nbest thing that ever happened to me. God, I will sound corny. I am most \nreligious in my thinking about having met Sheila when we were 16. It is \nthe best thing that ever could have happened to me. I am not just \nsaying some trumped up thing on the floor of the Senate. But marriage \nis not always the answer or the alternative to poverty for many of \nthese women and children.\n  Dr. Horn has not shown the understanding and sensitivity to these \nquestions he needs to show. He is a good person. He will be nominated. \nI already said that. But I at least want to speak about my concerns.\n  The Congress has recently recognized that domestic violence is a \nserious national problem. We have the Violence Against Women Act and \nother legislation, and it seems to me that we ought to at least be very \nsensitive to these concerns.\n  Dr. Horn and others in the responsible fatherhood movement argue that \nmany of our most pressing social problems--school violence, teen \npregnancy, and substance abuse, to name a few--can be directly related \nto the absence of fathers in the lives of their children.\n  David Blankenhorn of the Institute for American Values has gone so \nfar as to suggest that fatherlessness is ``the engine that drives our \nmost pressing social problems.'' And topping the list of concerns, of \ncourse, is child poverty. For many of these advocates, the solution to \nending child poverty is clear: marriage. They argue that what we really \nneed to do is to teach low-income men to properly value marriage and \nfamily, based on the presumption that low-income men don't.\n  Can I also say this at the risk of annoying some colleagues? You know \nwhat. I am over and over again struck by the fact that too many \nSenators seem to know so much about the values of poor people, but they \nhave never spent any time with any of them. It is like I don't know \nwhere our understanding of the values of people and how they live their \nlives comes from. It is certainly not based upon a lot of experience. I \nbelieve it is incorrect to presume that low-income men somehow value \nmarriage and fatherhood less than other men. In fact, there is \nconsiderable evidence that low-income men value marriage and fatherhood \njust as much as you do, Mr. President, and as much as I do. But these \nadvocates look at the data indicating a correlation between child \npoverty and single parenthood, and rather than consider the fact that \nall too often it is the poverty that leads to the single parenthood, \nnot single parenthood that leads to the poverty, they argue that \nmarriage is the way to eliminate the poverty. That is what I am worried \nabout with Dr. Horn because he is going to be in a key position.\n  Here is the way one low-income mother put it to me, and thank God for \nher wisdom:\n\n       They can marry off everybody in my neighborhood, but then \n     all we'll have is two poor people married to each other.\n\n  This is what is really at the heart of the matter. You don't end \npoverty by simply promoting marriage. In fact, you probably promote \nmore successful marriages if that is your goal. And do you know what. I \nthink that is our goal. Let me state as a given that every Senator, or \nalmost every Senator wants to promote more successful marriages. One of \nthe ways is by ending poverty.\n  My colleague from Indiana will speak for Dr. Horn. I made it clear \nthat I met him. He cares as much as I do. It is an honest disagreement. \nI made the argument, I say to Senator Bayh from Indiana--and we will \nvoice vote this with overwhelming support. I needed to come to the \nfloor because some of Dr. Horn's advocacy of preferential treatment for \nHead Start and affordable housing for two-parent, married households, \nand arguments that you want to have bonuses for people to get married \nand stay married--I made the argument that the implications of this, \nwhen it comes to violence in homes, is grim and harsh. You don't want \nsome of these women to be in a position of feeling as if they can't \nleave a home where they are being battered and their children are being \nbattered. That is what some of these proposals do.\n  As to some of his ideas, he said, ``I no longer necessarily believe \nall of this.'' But I have said some of these arguments about promoting \nmarriage are fine; I am for it. But for some women this is not the \nanswer.\n  You don't want to have financial incentives, or disincentives, if you \nwill, that put women in a position where the choice is, Do I stay in \nthis home where I am being battered, my child can be battered, or my \nchild witnesses this violence, or if I leave then no longer will I get \na Head Start benefit, or I will lose my bonus I have received for being \nin this marriage or I will not be able to get affordable housing.\n\n  That is one of the things that concerns me the most, I say to two \ngood colleagues. One of the reasons we have so many of these \norganizations in the trenches working in domestic violence expressing \nthis concern is because of this argument. Someone needs to say it \nbecause Dr. Horn will be in this position, and then we will work with \nhim.\n  I am all for promoting responsible fatherhood and marriage, but I do \nnot\n\n[[Page S8186]]\n\nwant to do it in such a way that we end up--I said this before my \ncolleagues came--for some of these women, marriage is death. That is \nright. For some of these women, staying in a marriage means they will \nlose their lives. I do not want public policy or social policy that \nmakes it more difficult for them to leave these homes which are not \nsafe homes, where they should leave these homes. That is part of what \nthis debate is about.\n  In just the few minutes I have left, the other part of the argument I \nwant to make is if, in fact, you want to promote successful marriages, \nespecially if you are talking about the low- and moderate-income \ncommunity, one of the ways to do it is to focus on some of these \neconomic issues. There is a whole world of problems out there, such as \nunemployment, not having a living-wage job, drug and alcohol addiction, \ndepression and mental illness, poor education, jail time, hunger and \nhomelessness, and, in all due respect, quite often these are the \nreasons that marriages do break up.\n  Unless we talk about marriages and responsible fatherhood in the \ncontext of also dealing with these very tough problems that rip \nfamilies apart, I do not think we go very far, and I will insist all of \nthem be considered.\n  Frankly, it is not necessarily his fault, but I do not hear much from \nthis administration in terms of being willing to invest some of the \nresources in any number of these different areas.\n  We had a proposal in Minnesota. I said ``had.'' It was the Minnesota \nFamily Investment Program. It was a pilot program. Too bad, because \nfrom my point of view, this is welfare reform. Two former Governors did \na great job saying we are going to put a lot of money into childcare, \ninto job training skills development, into making sure these families \ndo not lose their medical care, and we are going to put a lot of money \ninto significant income to disregard when they made more money, they \nthen lost, dollar for dollar, what they were making.\n  Studies compared former AFDC recipients to those on MFIP and found \nMFIP individuals were 40 percent more likely to stay married and 50 \npercent less likely to be divorced after 5 years. There you have it. \nThat is part of what we need to do.\n  Mr. President, do you know what. That is not what we are doing in a \nlot of this so-called welfare reform. As a matter of fact, finally I \ngot the Food and Nutrition Service study the other day. I said to them: \nTell me what is going on with food stamps. Why have we had a 30-\npercent-plus decline in food stamp participation post 1996? They said: \nIn some cases, people are working and maker better income. In most \ncases, they are not, but they do not know they are eligible any longer.\n  There were cuts in food stamp benefits, massive cuts in benefits to \nlegal immigrants. Frankly, Families USA points out there are some \n660,000 people who no longer have medical assistance because of the \nwelfare bill. In too many cases, people have dropped out.\n  Berkeley and Harvard did a study of the childcare situation and found \nthat many of these kids were in dangerous situations or in front of a \nTV, and it would not surprise anyone if they came to kindergarten way \nbehind.\n  I am for promoting families, responsible fatherhood, and I want these \nchildren to have as much a chance as other children, and I want to know \nfrom where the commitment comes.\n  Marriage is not, in and of itself, the way to address the root causes \nof poverty, and it is no reliable long-term solution to poverty, \nparticularly poverty among women and children, and, in general, two \nincomes are better than one. It is far better to have two parents in \nthe household, but that fact is not sufficient to support an argument \nthat marriage will lead to an end of family poverty.\n  There are many reasons that women, more often than men, experience an \neconomic downfall outside of marriage: Discrimination in the labor \nmarket; lack of quality, affordable accessible childcare; domestic \nviolence; and I also say to my colleagues--Senator Reid said it \nearlier--in many States there are more animal shelters than shelters \nfor women who come out of these very dangerous homes.\n  Moreover, the tragedy of it is, after they get out of shelters, there \nis no affordable housing. As a matter of fact, this is going to become \na front-burner issue for us because we are not doing anything by way of \ngetting resources back to State and local communities, and it is a huge \ncrisis. It is not surprising that the other day there was a report that \ncame out in the Washington Post pointing out the issue really is not \npoverty, the issue is we have to double the official definition of \npoverty, which is around $17,000. If you want to be realistic of what \nit takes for a family to make it, there are many families with incomes \nunder $40,000 who are having a heck of a time making it, and one of the \nreasons is the cost of housing.\n  If you do not address these factors that keep women from being \neconomically self-sufficient, then your marriage and family formation \nadvocates are merely proposing to shift the woman's dependence from the \nwelfare system to marriage. You see what I am saying? There is a \nmissing piece here, I say to Dr. Horn and others.\n  Some women should not be dependent on their marriage. They should get \nout of their marriage. They should not be there. They should get out of \nthese homes with their children because if they stay, they are going to \nbe murdered and their children--talk about posttraumatic stress \nsyndrome. What do my colleagues think it would be like to be a little \nchild? I have been with them. I met with some of these families and \nhave seen a mother who has been beaten up over and over, day after day. \nWhat do my colleagues think that does to children?\n  With domestic violence and divorce at the current rates, marriage \nwill never be the sole answer. The solution is not, as Dr. Horn and \nothers suggest, to interfere with the privacy rights of poor women but, \nrather, let's focus on economic self-sufficiency.\n  Congress should not use women's economic vulnerability as an \nopportunity to control their decisions regarding their marriage or, for \nthat matter, childbearing. Fighting poverty and promoting family well-\nbeing will depend on positive Government support, for policies that \nsupport low-income parents in their struggle to obtain good jobs so \nthat they can have a decent standard of living, so they can give their \nchildren the care they know their children need and deserve. That is \nwhat it ought to be about.\n  I disagree with Dr. Horn on this policy, but colleagues and the \npublic should be further aware that certain recent statements and \nwritings by the nominee signal that basic views which underlie his \npolicy positions I think are a little bit over the top.\n  I have already talked about how I like him, I say to both colleagues \nbecause I know they know him. I will give a couple examples.\n  Dr. Horn has recently written, for example, that females raised by \nsingle mothers ``have a tendency toward early and promiscuous sexual \nactivity.'' That material was given to me by advocate organizations. \nThat is in direct quotes. From where in the world does that come? Where \nis the evidence for that?\n  He recently wrote that males raised by single mothers have ``an \nobsessive need to prove their masculinity.'' He reportedly has linked \nsingle mothering or father absence to acts of violence carried out by \nmales, such as the shootings at Columbine High, although, by the way, \nin that case, the families were intact. These were not single-parent \nfamilies. This is not an attack on character.\n\n  I want Dr. Horn to know he is going to be nominated on a voice vote. \nHe will be supported. That is fine. But I want to be on record saying I \ndon't think he is the right choice. I certainly want to question some \nof the statements he has made and, more importantly, some of the \npositions he has taken. He will be the one in the middle of the welfare \nreform. He will be the one dealing with a lot of the policy that \naffects low- and moderate-income families.\n  Ninety organizations have urged the Senate Committee on Finance to \noppose his nomination. A majority of them are organizations that deal \nwith domestic violence. That is where the real fear is. I have heard \nfrom too many people whose opinions I respect and whose judgments I \nvalue, starting with my wife Sheila, to allow the nomination to pass \nsilently. Dr. Horn will be confirmed, but I felt compelled to\n\n[[Page S8187]]\n\nraise these issues and concerns about some of the policies I think he \nis likely to promote as Assistant Secretary for Family Support. I hope \nhe proves me wrong; he may very well.\n  I hope he will use the occasion of this appointment to reconsider \nsome of his views--not all; he is entitled to many of his views. The \nissues are too important and too many lives are affected to not speak \nout. I hope Dr. Horn and others at Health and Human Services, as well \nas colleagues in the Senate, will carefully consider the implications \nof policies that we all propose that affect low-income families.\n  I said earlier, and I meant it as a criticism of Senators on both \nsides of the aisle, although we cannot generalize, I am always amazed \nwe infer the values of people. We seem to know so much about the values \nof people and how they live their lives, especially low-income people--\nthat fathers do not respect fatherhood or the pathology of their \nlives--when hardly any Members spend any time with them. Dr. Horn is an \nexample of someone who has inferred people's values, which can be \ndownright dangerous, especially when we are talking about violence in \nhomes today.\n  What we really need to do is to support these women and children. \nTherefore, I hope the Senators, as we go forward with the welfare \nreauthorization bill and we make policy that affects directly the lives \nof poor people in this country, will make it our business to be very \ncareful. They are not on the Senate floor, they have very little clout, \nand in too many ways they are right out of Michael Harrington's ``The \nOther America.'' They are invisible and without a very strong voice. \nThere are helpful organizations, thank God, such as the Children's \nDefense Fund, but not enough.\n  I wish Dr. Horn the very best. We will work together. But I want Dr. \nHorn to know I have a lot of concerns which I have discussed today. I \nam not speaking for myself, but for a lot of people in the country, \nespecially those down in the trenches doing the work, dealing with the \nviolence in families, trying to protect women and children, to make \nsure they can rebuild their lives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. BAYH. Before my colleague from Minnesota leaves the floor, I \nexpress my appreciation to him and compliment him for the passion he \nbrings to the cause of helping those less fortunate in our society. \nThere is no Member of this body who feels more strongly about \nempowering those who need opportunity in our country than Senator \nWellstone. For that, I compliment the Senator and thank him for being \nsuch a valuable Member of this body.\n  I also say, before the Senator leaves the floor, I find myself in \nstrong agreement with his sentiments about the rights of women, \nparticularly that they are not given incentives to stay out of \nrelationships that are abusive, or assisting or providing incentives \nfor men with a proven record of abuse from entering family \nrelationships where they do not belong.\n  I am not familiar with all of the statements he has made, but I can \nsay from my own experience with Dr. Horn that it is my understanding he \nhas distanced himself from several of these controversial statements. I \ncan say from my personal experience with him in working on the \nResponsible Fatherhood Act that he has shown a great willingness to \nensure that abusive men are not reinserted into family situations and, \nin fact, women are protected, as they should be. We should insist upon \nthis, even as we try to promote men living up to their responsibility \nand doing right by not only their children but the mothers of their \nchildren.\n  We had a recent conference at the Thurgood Marshall Center in \nWashington, DC, a lower income area, and we were heartened to see \nrepresentatives from many organizations representing low-income \nAmerica. I am glad the Responsible Fatherhood Act has been advocated by \nthe Black Caucus.\n  From my experience, Dr. Horn has shown great empathy toward the cause \nof helping children with a less fortunate background. I know it is \nentirely appropriate that the Senator comes to the floor and expresses \nhis concerns. I thank him, before he gets on with his busy schedule, \nfor his championing of the cause of the less fortunate, to express \nstrong support for his dedication, particularly ensuring that women are \nnot placed in abusive situations but, in fact, are protected from \nabusive men who would do them or their children harm. I express those \nsentiments before the Senator has to leave.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator from Indiana for his graciousness. \nI think the statement he just made, especially dealing with violence in \nhomes, is extremely important. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for the \nnomination of Wade Horn to be Assistant Secretary of HHS for Family \nSupport. I am confident that he will do an outstanding job in \ndischarging his duties for all Americans.\n  I have known Dr. Horn personally since 1996 when I had the privilege \nas Governor of our State of holding one of the first conferences in the \ncountry on the importance of promoting more responsible fatherhood on \nthe part of many men.\n  The vast majority of men in our society, when they bring children \ninto the world, do the right thing by supporting children economically, \nemotionally and economically, and supporting the mothers. Regrettably, \nin recent years, in the last decade or so, we began the alarming trend \nof many men walking away from responsibilities, financial and \notherwise, with great detriment to the children and the mothers of \nthose children and, because of that, the society and taxpayers, as \nwell.\n  Wade Horn worked with us not only in that conference but in \nfashioning legislation in the Halls of Congress to do something about \nthis epidemic of fatherlessness that harms our society in so many \nimportant ways. He understands that a child growing up without the \ninvolvement of a father, emotionally or financially, is five times more \nlikely to live in poverty, twice as likely to be involved with drugs or \nalcohol abuse, twice as likely to commit a crime of violence, twice as \nlikely for a young girl to be involved with teen pregnancy, and much \nmore likely to get involved in a variety of situations that will harm a \nyoungster throughout the course of his or her lifetime.\n  Wade Horn is committed to doing something about this phenomenon, and \nthereby strengthening families and helping children. He understands \nthis effort is not only good for America's children; it is good for \ntaxpayers, as well.\n  Many of the issues we debate in this Chamber, many of the initiatives \nwe pursue to try to help America really deal with the manifestations of \nwhat are actually deeper underlying problems. If we are going to get at \nthe root causes of the problems that afflict too many of America's \nchildren, we have to deal with them where they begin, the breakdown of \nthe American family, and, in particular, too many men bringing children \ninto the world and walking away, leaving women and taxpayers to try to \npick up the pieces by themselves. That is not right. We spend hundreds \nof billions of dollars each and every year to try to overcome the \nconsequences of irresponsible fathers not living up to their \nobligations.\n  Wade Horn understands that if we are going to do right by those kids \nand do right by our citizens who are picking up the tab, we need to do \nsomething about this problem. So he has committed much of his life to \ndoing exactly that.\n  He also understands that this effort will be good for women. Women \nare doing heroic work, particularly single mothers, to try to pick up \nthe pieces when men bring kids in the world and walk away.\n  It is not right that those women should labor without the emotional \nsupport and the financial support to which they are entitled. Our \nresponsible fatherhood initiative is designed to help children, help \ntaxpayers, and help women as well.\n  As I mentioned before our colleague, Senator Wellstone, had to leave \nthe floor, we reached out to many women's organizations to make sure \nthis effort is done in a way that is sensitive to the concerns of women \nwho have experienced the horror of being battered or abused by a spouse \nor male companion. We want to make sure that is not the case; that, in \nfact, we protect women\n\n[[Page S8188]]\n\nand children from the consequences of that type of behavior.\n  Wade Horn has been involved in that effort to make sure we pursue \nstrengthening families to help women and children with legitimate and \nimportant concerns and take into account the scourge of domestic \nviolence that is unfortunately all too frequent in society today.\n  Mr. Horn, when he is confirmed, will be in a position to be \nintimately involved in the next generation of welfare reform that we \nwill undertake this year and next. Because of his lengthy experience \nlaboring in these vineyards, I think he is ideally suited to this task.\n  Let me offer a very brief recitation of some of Dr. Horn's \nexperience. From 1989 to 1993, Dr. Horn was Commissioner for Children, \nYouth and Families, and Chief of the Children's Bureau within the U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. Dr. Horn also served as a \nPresidential appointee to the National Commission on Children from 1990 \nto 1993, a member of the National Commission on Childhood Disability \nfrom 1994 to 1995, and a member of the U.S. Advisory Board on Welfare \nIndicators from 1996 to 1997.\n  Prior to these appointments, Dr. Horn was the director of outpatient \npsychological services at the Children's Hospital, National Medical \nCenter here in Washington, DC, and an associate professor of psychiatry \nand behavioral sciences at George Washington University.\n  Currently, Dr. Horn is also an adjunct faculty at Georgetown \nUniversity's Public Policy Institute, and an affiliate scholar with the \nHudson Institute.\n  Simply put, if I could just summarize, I have known Dr. Horn now for \nseveral years. I know of no more decent, more compassionate individual. \nI know of no one who cares about the cause of helping children more \nthan Wade Horn, or the cause of strengthening America's families and \nthat is what this really comes down to. Whether it is within the bonds \nof marriage or outside, this all comes down to the cause of helping \nchildren, and in so doing not only helping those little ones but \nhelping society as a whole.\n  In conclusion, let me just say among his many other attributes, Wade \nHorn is an author. He authored a book after his own experience with \ncancer and wrote very eloquently in that book about the emotions that \nhe experienced when he was sick, fighting cancer, seeing his own little \ngirls come to his bedside.\n  I know, based upon that personal experience and his many years of \nefforts in the vineyards of good public policy, there is no one who \nwill bring a deeper, more heartfelt conviction to the cause of helping \nchildren, helping women, strengthening families, and strengthening \nAmerica than Dr. Horn. I respectfully urge my colleagues to vote in \nsupport of his confirmation.\n  Before, I yield the floor, I would also like to say how much \nI respect my colleague from Delaware. I thank Senator Carper for his \nefforts on behalf of the Responsible Fatherhood Act. Perhaps it is not \na coincidence that Senator Carper and I are both former Governors and \nhave personally been in a position of actually implementing welfare \nreform, not simply enacting it into law.\n\n  For that reason, I salute my dear friend and colleague, Senator \nCarper, and thank him for his presence as well today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, let me say while Senator Bayh is still \nhere, we have not only been Senators together, as he said, we have been \nGovernors together. We were also fathers of young boys, his a few years \nyounger than mine.\n  He believes, as I believe, and certainly as Wade Horn believes, while \nemphasizing the importance of fathers and fatherhood, we have no \nintention, no need, no interest in diminishing the importance of the \nrole of mothers. Every child deserves not just one loving, nurturing, \ncaring parent but two. To the extent that we as a society can encourage \nmen to live up to the responsibilities of the children they father and \nbring into this world, those children will be better for it and so will \nour country.\n  I say a special thanks to Senator Bayh, for his leadership on this \nissue. I am delighted to be able to support these efforts.\n  Senator Bayh has known Wade Horn for a half dozen or so years. So \nhave I. I have known him through our work with the National Governors' \nAssociation where he came from time to time, at our invitation, to \nspeak on fatherhood. I have known him through his role in cohosting the \nNational Summit on Fatherhood, where I have had the opportunity to \nparticipate. I have invited him to my home State of Delaware to speak \nat our Governor's prayer breakfast, to focus on fatherhood and the \nimportance of fathers in our lives.\n  I also know him, having hosted him in our Governors house, having \nspent time with him and his wife there. I met his children, his \ndaughters. I have some idea, not just what the author is like, not just \nwhat the speaker is like, not just what the policymaker is like, but I \nfeel as if I know him a little bit as a human being. I have seen him in \nthe role of devoted husband and loving father as well.\n  Senator Wellstone said, before he finished his remarks--and I \nappreciated the concerns he expressed--and I think this is a quote, \n``Dr. Horn will be in this position and we will have the opportunity to \nwork with him.'' I hope he is right. I believe Senator Wellstone is \nright in that.\n  Based on my experience from the last 6 years of knowing Wade Horn and \nhis family, I believe we will appreciate the opportunity to work with \nhim. I feel confident those who question his nomination will come, in \nthe end, to be glad that he was nominated and that we voted to confirm \nhim.\n  I know others have gone back and looked at the words that have been \nattributed to Dr. Horn in the past. They could do that for me or the \nPresiding Officer or for any of us and have it appear we say things \nthat, taken out of context, we may not have really said or intended to \nsay. I have never heard Wade Horn speak about compelling women to \nremain in an abusive relationship or threatening relationships. I have \nheard him say that too many men fall short in meeting their obligations \nto the children they father and to the women who bear those children.\n  I have never heard Wade Horn disparage single moms for the work that \nthey do in raising children. I have heard him speak of the need for \nyoung girls to see, in their own lives, a father who treats a mother in \na way that that young girl herself would want to be treated by her \nhusband someday. I have heard him say there are young boys in this \ncountry who need to see how a man treats his wife so that young boy \nwill know how he should treat his wife someday, when he has grown.\n\n  I have never heard Wade Horn say that children raised by single moms \nroutinely turn out badly. I have heard him say that all children \ndeserve to be raised by two loving, caring, nurturing parents, and that \nincludes their fathers.\n  I have heard it said that as to 16-year-old girls who become \npregnant, drop out of school, never marry the father of the children \nthat they bear, 80 percent of them--80 percent of those women and their \nfamilies will live in poverty at some point in time. As to the 16-year-\nold girl who does not become pregnant, does not drop out of school, \ngraduates from school, waits until the age of 20 to have a child and \nmarries the father of that child, there is an 8-percent likelihood that \nfamily will live in poverty--80 percent on the one hand, 8 percent on \nthe other hand.\n  I cannot stand here today and vouch for those numbers. But if they \nare even close, I think they serve to underscore for us the need for \nfathers, for men who father children, to take seriously their \nobligation to the children they father and to the women who bear them.\n  I believe Wade Horn will serve in this capacity doing a number of \ngood things for the families of our country, men and women, boys and \ngirls. But I think he is going to be a good voice, a recurring voice, \none we need to hear, that says: Fathers are not dispensable. They are \nas important today as they were 100 years ago or 200 years ago. We need \nto remember that, those of us who are fathers and those of us who \nsomeday will be.\n  I am pleased to rise today in support of this nomination, and I hope \nit will receive ringing endorsement from this body.\n\n[[Page S8189]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I rise today to add my voice in support of \nthe nomination of Wade Horn to serve as Assistant Secretary for Family \nSupport at the Department of Health and Human Services.\n  I have had the pleasure of working with Wade Horn over the past few \nyears on an issue that is vitally important to both of us--making sure \nthat children receive the child support money they are owed. This has \nbeen a very positive and productive working experience. Dr. Horn and I \nshare the goal of changing the current child support distribution \nsystem, which harms children by allowing States and the Federal \nGovernment to keep their child support money instead of distributing it \nto the kids who need it. Through his experience, Wade Horn recognizes \nthat fathers pay more child support when they know their children will \nactually receive their money and benefit from it. He understands that \nthe route to responsible fatherhood means we have to remove government-\ncreated barriers that actually discourage fathers from paying child \nsupport, and create more incentives for fathers to become actively \ninvolved in their children's lives.\n  I have greatly appreciated Wade Horn's commitment to changing the \nchild support distribution system. His suggestions, input and advocacy \nhave helped move this issue forward during the past several years, and \nI look forward to working with him to pass this vital legislation once \nhe is confirmed. Together, I am hopeful that he and Secretary Thompson, \nwho is also a tremendous advocate of child support distribution reform \nin his own right, will make this a top priority in the Bush \nAdministration so that children get the support they are owed and need.\n  As President of the National Fatherhood Initiative, Dr. Horn \nunderstands that fathers, mothers and children often need support and \nhelp to maintain a strong and stable family life. His organization's \ngoal has been to encourage fathers to become positive role models for \ntheir children and become fully involved in their lives. He has worked \nto encourage greater support services and assistance for low-income \nfathers so they can actively and responsibly participate in their \nchildren's upbringing. Not only do their children benefit from their \nsupport and involvement, but all of society reaps the benefits of \nhaving stronger families.\n  I realize that some have raised concerns about views Dr. Horn has \nexpressed in the past regarding government support for single-parent \nfamilies. It is my understanding that he has reconsidered many of those \nviews and has committed to serving all families who need support and \nassistance. I believe this is critical; our nation must address a \nvariety of issues to help working families of all shapes and sizes, and \nI look forward to working with him on a range of issues important to \nfamilies--including increasing funding for Child Care, Head Start, and \ncontinuing to provide support for families making the transition from \nwelfare to work. These will not be easy tasks, but I am hopeful that \nWade Horn will take a thoughtful, balanced approach to addressing these \nmatters. I urge my colleagues to support his nomination.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I am proud to support the \nnomination of Dr. Wade Horn to be the Assistant Secretary for Family \nSupport at the Department of Health and Human Services. As chairman of \nthe National Commission on Children, I had a unique opportunity to work \nclosely with Wade Horn. From that experience, I know how deeply Wade \ncares about children and families. I know that Wade is willing to \nlisten to diverse views and find common ground, which will be key to \nhis success in this important position.\n  On the Children's Commission, committed advocates representing both \nthe liberal and conservative policy views came together to learn about \nchild development and we struggled to find bipartisan policy \ninitiatives to help children and their families. Our process was \nintense, but it led to a bold, bipartisan report full of \nrecommendations to change policy to support children. Throughout that \nprocess, I witnessed how Wade Horn was willing to take risks for the \nright reasons.\n  I am proud to say that the Children's Commission report has been a \nguidebook for my legislative initiatives on children's policy. While \nthere is much more to do on children's issues, we are making real \nprogress. The Children Commission that Dr. Horn and I supported in 1991 \ncalled for a refundable child tax credit and an improved Earned Income \nTax Credit. Our report recommended changing the welfare system, then \nknown as Aid to Families with Dependent Children. It stressed the \nimportance of child support enforcement. It called for education reform \nwith a greater emphasis on local schools. And it even had a \ncontroversial chapter called ``Creating a Moral Climate for Children,'' \nwhich challenged public officials, the media, the entertainment \nindustry, and individuals to serve as role models for children.\n  Many of our recommendations from the Children's Commission have \nbecome public policy, and I continue to build on this foundation.\n  While Dr. Horn and I do not agree on every issue, we do strongly \nagree about the importance of supporting children and families. We \nagree on the importance of bipartisanship on children's issues, \nespecially in the area of child welfare and adoption. We agree about \nthe importance of direct and honest communication and cooperation \nbetween Congress and the Department of Health and Human Services.\n  Because I have worked with Dr. Wade Horn on the Children's Commission \nand during his previous position in the first Bush administration, I am \nconfident that he will be a committed leader on children's issues in \nthis administration. I look forward to working with him, including on \nthe reauthorization of the Safe and Stable Families Program this year.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the nomination of Wade \nHorn.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on the \npending business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to speak on behalf of the \nnominee to be Assistant Secretary for Children and Families at the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, Dr. Wade Horn.\n  I got to know Dr. Horn while working with him on several fatherhood \ninitiatives. He has been an outstanding leader in the fatherhood \nmovement. And I am confident that he will serve with distinction in the \nposition to which he has been nominated.\n  Dr. Horn is a dedicated public servant, a distinguished child \npsychologist, a skilled administrator, and an excellent choice to lead \nthe Administration for Children and Families--a key and critical \nposition for the administration.\n  Dr. Horn is a highly respected child psychiatrist, with a proven \nrecord of both competence and integrity. He has consistently \ndemonstrated his deep commitment to increasing the well-being, \nstrength, and stability of families and children in general, and at-\nrisk children in particular.\n  It bears mention that Dr. Horn was previously confirmed by the Senate \n11 years ago for the position of commissioner of the Administration for \nChildren, Youth and Families. As the Commissioner for the Children, \nYouth and Families Administration, Dr. Horn administered numerous \nprograms serving children and families, including Head Start, foster \ncare and adoption assistance, the National Center on Child Abuse and \nNeglect, runaway and homeless youth shelters, and various anti-drug \nprograms.\n  Since leaving the Department of Health and Human Services, Dr. Horn \nhas served as the President of the National Fatherhood Initiative--\nwhere I really got to know him--a nonpartisan initiative which has \ndrawn the support and involvement of several Senators\n\n[[Page S8190]]\n\nfrom both sides of the aisle, including myself, Senator Lieberman, \nSenator Carper, and Senator Bayh. As the President of the Fatherhood \nInitiative, Dr. Horn has been at the forefront of the effort to \nencourages fathers to become more involved in the lives of their \nchildren and families. The Fatherhood Initiative has conducted both \nnational forums and targeted outreach programs to at-risk families to \nencourage increased responsibility, affection, support, and involvement \nof fathers something we desperately need in their country. He has also \nauthored regular columns dispensing advice to parents on how to raise \nhealthier, happier, and more secure children, which have helped and \nencouraged literally thousands of families across the country.\n  One of the criticisms leveled against Dr. Horn is that he has sat on \nthe board of Marriage Savers, and has been involved in marriage \npromotion programs. Why this is a criticism, I am not sure. Dr. Horn \nwould never, has never advocated that anyone stay in an abusive \nmarriage. No one believes this, despite inferences to the contrary on \nthe floor of this Senate. What he has done is worked with groups that \nwork with couples who want to strengthen their marriage and their \nfamily. And I would think that working towards strengthening marriage \nin our country--which has, let me note, a divorce rate near 50 \npercent--would be regarded as a positive qualification, not grounds for \ncriticism.\n  We have Marriage Savers programs in Kansas. In two counties in the \nState of Kansas, Marriage Savers programs have helped to reduce divorce \nrates by over thirty percent in that area. This is a great achievement, \nnot a questionable activity. That Dr. Horn's involvement with Marriage \nSavers--a group dedicated to working with individuals who have \nrequested assistance in strengthening their marriage--would somehow be \ncited as a red flag in Dr. Horn's record is utterly baffling.\n  Dr. Horn has never advocated that women stay in abusive situations. \nHe is saying that in marriages where children are involved, it is a \ngood thing for a married couple to try to work through their problems.\n  With the background, temperment, and record that Dr. Horn has, it is \ndifficult to understand why this nomination should have generated any \ndebate at all. I don't think that anyone can credibly raise a question \nabout Dr. Horn's qualifications for the job. I look forward to the \nconfirmation of Dr. Horn to the position of Assistant Secretary for \nChildren and Families at the Department of Health and Human Services, \nand I wish him the best in this capacity.\n  Finally, I note that this is an extraordinarily qualified nominee to \nthis position. He is a person who has worked in this field virtually \nhis entire life, who has worked successfully in this field and in an \narea of endeavor in which we need a lot of help. Our children and \nfamilies are suffering in this country. Dr. Horn has worked himself, \npersonally and directly, to put families back together. That is \nsomething we should be applauding, not questioning or condemning.\n  I strongly support the nomination of Dr. Wade Horn to this position \nwithin the Department of Health and Human Services.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, on behalf of Senator Wellstone, I yield \nback his time on the Horn nomination.\n  Madam President, is there further time on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/25/senate-section/article/S8190-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8190-S8194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      NOMINATION OF HECTOR V. BARRETO, JR., OF CALIFORNIA, TO BE \n           ADMINISTRATOR OF THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent, under the \ndirection and authority of the majority leader, that we now move, \npursuant to an order entered on July 24, to the Barreto nomination, for \nthe Small Business Administration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Hector V. Barreto, Jr., \nof California, to be Administrator of the Small Business \nAdministration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, let me request 5 minutes of the time \nallotted to our side for my presentation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I rise to briefly discuss the nomination \nof Hector Barreto to head the Small Business Administration. I note \nthat Senator Kerry, the chairman of the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, supports this nomination. I plan to support the \nnomination as well. I think he is a good appointment. He will serve our \ncountry well. I look forward to working with him in his new role as \nAdministrator of the Small Business Administration.\n  As he begins his tenure at the SBA, I did not want this moment to go \nby without pointing out to him, and to the SBA, that we face, in my \njudgment, a rather severe challenge about an issue that concerns me \ngreatly. Let me describe the issue.\n  The SBA has packaged up a series of loans that it has made, including \ndisaster loans, and sold them with deep discounts to financial \ncompanies around the country. The representation to the American people \nwas that this would not impact their loans at all, and it is just a \nmatter of selling them so that the SBA does not have to do loan \nservicing.\n  That sounded benign enough, I guess, to almost everybody in the \ncountry. It sounded benign enough to Congress. And so the SBA sold \nloans, including disaster loans.\n  Let me describe the impact of what has happened as a result of the \nsale of those loans.\n  Most Americans will remember the great flood in the Red River Valley \nin 1997, when the city of Grand Forks, ND, with nearly 50,000 \nresidents, had to evacuate the entire city. The city was inundated with \nfloodwaters from the Red River. In the middle of the flood, after the \nentire city had been evacuated, a fire started in the downtown area of \nthe city. So we had the spectacle of nearly 3 years worth of snow \nfalling in 3 months and when the snow melted, it caused a dramatic \nflood along the Red River, inundating the city of Grand Forks. Then a \nfire started in the middle of the city, and firetrucks tried to get \ninto the evacuated city on flatbeds and various devices to fight a fire \nin the center of downtown Grand Forks.\n  It was a devastating time for the people of Grand Forks. When the \nwaters receded, most homeowners and business men and women of Grand \nForks, came back to their homes and businesses to find severe damage. \nThey found massive damage in buildings all across this city.\n  The city, of course, was helped by FEMA, the SBA and other agencies \nof the Federal Government. President Clinton came to Grand Forks and \nsaid: You're not alone. The American people are with you. The American \npeople want to help you. And, indeed, the American people did.\n\n  This Congress was generous to the communities along the Red River \nValley and to Grand Forks especially. Grand Forks and East Grand Forks \nwere hit very hard, and they required a substantial amount of help.\n  So many of these businesses and families, in order to get back on \ntheir feet, took a low-interest SBA loan, often a 4-percent loan with a \nrather lengthy term. We provide disaster loans in law so that the SBA \ncan help these families and businesses get back on their feet after a \nnatural disaster.\n  Then, after these businesses and homeowners were able to get the \nloans to help them get back on their feet, the SBA sold the loans, \nincluding disaster loans, to private companies. These are private \nfinancial companies that come in and buy a batch of loans and often pay \nabout 70 cents on the dollar and then assume the responsibility for \nservicing the loans.\n\n[[Page S8191]]\n\n  That is a long story to tell you where we are at the moment. We have \ndiscovered that homeowners and businesses in Grand Forks, ND, that were \nhit with one disaster--that is, a disaster coming from a river that \ninundated their community--are in the middle of another disaster. These \npeople have discovered that their disaster loans were sold to private \ncompanies. These loans are now being serviced by private companies who \nhave put many of these families and businesses right smack in a pair of \nhandcuffs when it comes to trying to sell their home and buy another \nhome or sell an asset in a business in order to buy another asset to \nmake the business more efficient.\n  The companies that bought these loans are now saying: No, you can't \nsubstitute collateral. If you do that, you are going to have to pay a \nvery substantial fee. We will not allow you to transfer the lien. In \nother words, the company is sticking to the terms of the SBA loan with \nrespect to the interest rate and time but is not nearly as flexible as \nthe SBA has always been with these homeowners and businesses. The SBA \nwould tell borrowers: We understand, we will allow you to transfer the \nlien to the next home you are going to buy, or, we understand, you can \npurchase these additional assets your business needs to become more \nefficient and transfer the lien from the other asset you are going to \nsell.\n  What homeowners and small business owners are discovering now is that \nno such flexibility exists with private companies. Instead, they are \ntold: No dice. That is a very serious problem. People hit with a \ndisaster are now given a pair of handcuffs when a private company buys \ntheir disaster loan. That is wrong. That ought not happen.\n  Let me just mention a couple people. There is a woman named Marie \nfrom Grand Forks, ND, who wrote me and said: I'm another flood victim \ntrying to find a way to transfer the current loan I have from the SBA \nto another property. My SBA loan was sold to Aurora Loan Services, and \nI have been told by Aurora they don't transfer loans, period. So \nessentially I'm out of luck. Personal circumstances made it necessary \nfor me to sell my property, and I need this low interest rate in order \nto be able to afford another property and get back on my feet.\n  A man named Steven also wrote to me. He is a businessman in Grand \nForks, ND. He said: I'm an optometrist. In the flood of 1997, our \noffice received 5 feet of water. Pretty much a total loss.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will not read all of this letter, but Steven goes on to \nsay: We see the opportunity to borrow money at 4 percent for 30 years \nas a gift from the American people.\n  These people were inundated with water, in deep trouble, and the \nFederal Government said: We are here to help you. Let's give you a \nhelping hand to get you back on your feet.\n  The letter continues: Nobody was going to make our community whole \novernight, but these loans over 30 years, would go a long way in \nhelping.\n  Then he describes his need to have flexibility to purchase additional \nassets and the difficulty he has had trying to negotiate with the \ncompany that purchased the loan. They have simply said: No dice. No \nway.\n  What he is saying is that he has been handcuffed by this process.\n  He had no idea that would be the case. He had no idea the SBA would \nsell his disaster loan to a private company that won't allow him to \ntransfer a lien as the SBA has almost always done to disaster victims. \nI tell these stories only to say there is something wrong with this \nprocess.\n  We ought not sell disaster loans. We simply should not do that. The \nSBA should service those loans and do so in a thoughtful and rational \nway. Let's not sell those loans. We certainly ought not allow citizens \nwho have been hit with a disaster discover there is a second disaster \naround the corner if they need to sell a home and purchase another or \nneed to purchase an essential asset for their business but can't sell \nthe old asset because they can't transfer the lien. This is not a fair \nthing to do.\n  We ought to do a couple things. No. 1, we should ask the new SBA \nhead--someone who I intend to support and vote for, Mr. Barreto--to \nwork with us to see that these companies that have purchased the old \nloans will use the same flexibility in servicing those loans as the SBA \npreviously did.\n  No. 2, let's not have the SBA selling these loans in the future. That \nis not the right thing and the fair thing to do. It may require \nlegislation, I expect, to prevent that. I hope to discuss that with \nsome of my colleagues and hope they will agree that those who have been \nhit with disaster in this country don't deserve to be handcuffed later \nby a private company that is able to buy deeply discounted SBA disaster \nloans. This is not the right thing to do to the citizens of this \ncountry who have suffered through a disaster. We can do better. I hope \nwe will. I hope my comments will be noted by Mr. Barreto. I wish him \nwell. Although I don't expect there will be a recorded vote on his \nnomination today, I think he is a good appointment. I commend the \nPresident for offering this candidate for public service. I hope we can \nget together and visit about this important issue very soon, when he \nassumes office.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I yield myself up to 5 minutes of the time \non this side on the nomination of Mr. Hector Barreto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, it is a pleasure to rise today to join \nwith my colleagues and urge them to support the President's nomination \nof Hector V. Barreto, Jr., as Administrator of the Small Business \nAdministration.\n  We have just received word that there will be a voice vote rather \nthan a recorded vote. For the friends and supporters of Mr. Barreto, \nthat simply means that everybody has agreed upon it, and apparently we \nwill not have to go through a rollcall vote. It does not mean in any \nway that we view this nomination as less important. It is just that as \na result of the work done on the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, his nomination should go through.\n  He was approved unanimously by the committee under the leadership of \nmy colleague, Chairman John Kerry. The nomination of Mr. Barreto comes \nat a critical time when the Small Business Administration's assistance \nand development programs will be tested very thoroughly as a result of \nthe slowing economy.\n  The SBA has a promising future and a very important mission that can \nbest be realized with effective leadership to refocus the agency on the \nprograms and missions established by Congress.\n  I believe President Bush has shown his commitment to supporting that \nmission and the Nation's Main Street small business community by his \nnomination of Mr. Barreto.\n  The need for a proven leader with a track record of business \nexperience has never been greater at the SBA. It is time the SBA \nconcentrate on sound management of its operations and existing programs \nrather than expanding its reach with new programs.\n  I expect Hector Barreto's experience in the financial services \nindustry, his standing in the small business and Latino communities \nwill serve the President, the Nation, and small business very well.\n  When we review Mr. Barreto's credentials, it is easy to see he has \nexceptionally fine roots. He was born and reared in Kansas City, MO. He \nwent to high school in Kansas City. He received his degree from \nRockhurst University, also in Kansas City. I have known his father, a \nprominent business leader in the Hispanic community, for many years. \nEven though he comes to us from California, I assure you, he really is \na Missourian at heart.\n  Hector Barreto, Sr., founded the United States Hispanic Chamber of \nCommerce, and in recent years Hector Barreto, Jr., has been serving on \nits board of directors. With his Missouri heritage and his strong \nbusiness foundation, there really isn't much more that needs to be said \nabout the President's nominee.\n  Seriously, however, we should look closely at Mr. Barreto's small \nbusiness background and his business experience. His early work \nimmediately out of college was as area manager for the Miller Brewing \nCompany. But his small\n\n[[Page S8192]]\n\nbusiness experience began in earnest when he moved to California and \nestablished the Barreto Insurance and Financial Services Company. His \ngoal simply was to provide insurance and financial services to southern \nCalifornia's expanding Latino population.\n  It takes a lot of nerve and confidence in one's abilities just 3 \nyears after finishing college to move halfway across the United States \nto set up a small business.\n  His business should be distinguished from the go-go dot-com \nundertakings of the 1990s, where investors could not wait to be \nseparated from their money. Mr. Barreto's small business was and is \nmore of a Main Street USA variety, and his goal simply was to provide \ninsurance and financial services that were very much needed in the \nminority community in southern California.\n\n  With each new Presidential administration, we hear how difficult it \nis to attract top-notch talent to serve in the often thankless and \nusually criticized jobs of serving in Government. We are fortunate to \nhave someone of the caliber of Mr. Barreto who knows what it is to \nstart a small business from scratch and work hard to make it grow. This \nis the American dream of millions of entrepreneurs. His exposure to the \nchallenges he faced will serve him well as SBA Administrator.\n  We should not lose sight of the fact that Mr. Barreto is making a \nsacrifice by leaving his small business to spend the next 3, maybe 4, \nmaybe more, years at the SBA. In response to this call to Government \nservice, Mr. Barreto won't be there to run his business. We need to \nremember that Hector Barreto is not a senior company official leaving a \nlarge business where there is always someone ready to step up from the \nranks to take over. Most often in a small business, there is not \nsomeone waiting in the ranks, and the small business suffers or closes \nits doors when the owner leaves.\n  Although he may not be closing his business for good, Mr. Barreto is \ntaking a long leave of absence and the business is going into an \nextended status of hibernation. His is a significant sacrifice.\n  As ranking member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I have had the opportunity to discuss with him his \nviews on targeting the most critical problems at the SBA and \nprioritizing solutions that might be implemented. I sincerely \nappreciate the energy and dedication with which Mr. Barreto approaches \nthese tasks.\n  We have a ripe opportunity to retool the SBA and its programs to \nbetter capitalize on the remarkable potential small business offers to \nfuel the economy and generate economic growth.\n  I am confident that Hector Barreto will do a solid job at the helm of \nthe SBA. I look forward to working with him to address key concerns \nabout agency programs and operations.\n  I urge and thank my colleagues for their support of the President's \nnomination of Hector V. Barreto, Jr., to be Administrator of the Small \nBusiness Administration.\n  Madam President, I now yield 5 minutes or as much time as he should \nrequire to the distinguished Senator from Virginia, Mr. Allen, a member \nof our committee, and ask that any remaining time be reserved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, I thank the ranking member of the Small \nBusiness Committee, Senator Bond, who cares a great deal about small \nbusiness issues.\n  I am pleased to stand with my colleague and for all the people in the \nSenate today and give my support for the confirmation of Hector V. \nBarreto, Jr., as Administrator of the Small Business Administration, \nwhich is, of course, the top post in that agency.\n  On July 19, the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, of \nwhich I am a member, unanimously approved Mr. Barreto for the position \nof Administrator of the Small Business Administration. As a member of \nthe committee, it was my privilege to attend the hearing and cast my \nvote in support of this fine candidate.\n  What also was very inspirational was Mr. Hector V. Barreto, Sr., and \nhis story, a gentleman who came up from Mexico, settled in Missouri, \nand started a business. And then Hector, of course, went on even \nfurther.\n  It really is the American dream of opportunity, of a small business, \na man with a dream, his father, and then obviously inculcating in his \nson that same sort of spirit and hard work and dedication and honesty.\n  I know that Mr. Barreto, Sr. was very proud of his young son and what \neveryone was saying about him that day of the committee hearing.\n  This nomination does come at a particularly crucial time, as the SBA \nwill need the guidance of a strong and qualified leader to ensure that \nits assistance and development programs are available to small \nbusinesses during this time of challenging, slowing economic growth. I \nbelieve Mr. Barreto is particularly qualified to develop new and \ninnovative ways for the Small Business Administration to refocus and \nbetter target its resources to promote growth and access to capital for \nsmall business owners and entrepreneurs and increase opportunities for \nminorities and women in the small business community.\n  Madam President, I want to take this opportunity to focus on Mr. \nBarreto's background and his experiences because what somebody has done \nin the past is a good indicator of what he or she will do in the \nfuture. I believe it will provide him also with a very special insight \ninto the unique challenges facing minority- and women-owned businesses, \nespecially small businesses.\n  Mr. Barreto, just 3 years out of college, left his home State of \nMissouri and moved to California to start up a small insurance and \nfinancial services company to address the financial needs of southern \nCalifornia's expanding Latino population and the needs of all southern \nCalifornia's minority communities. Once in southern California, Mr. \nBarreto became involved in the Latin Business Association, serving as \nthe organization's chairman in recent years.\n  In addition, Mr. Barreto served on the award-winning Los Angeles \nMinority Business Opportunity Committee and also as vice chairman of \nthe U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.\n  As a result of his dedication and outreach, Hector Barreto has \nreceived the support of many businesses and business organizations \nnationwide, including a significant number from California-based \norganizations and Latino business groups.\n  It would take far too long to mention all of the groups supporting \nhis nomination, but I want to mention a few. The endorsements have come \nfrom widely diverse groups, such as the Hispanic Business Roundtable \nand the Minority Business Roundtable, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and \nthe U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, as well as other Chamber \naffiliates, such as the Los Angeles Area Chamber, New Jersey Regional \nChamber, San Antonio Hispanic Chamber, the Korean American Coalition, \nand the Hispanic Business Women's Organization.\n  Given Mr. Barreto's credentials, background, and past experiences, \nthe work he has done to increase economic opportunities for minority \ncommunities, the extremely positive and overwhelming bipartisan support \nafforded him by members of the Small Business Committee, I believe he \nis exactly the right candidate for this position.\n  A vote in favor of this nomination is a vote in support of the \ninterests and the needs of small business owners, particularly minority \nbusiness owners, providing them with the experience, dedication, and \nleadership that Mr. Barreto will bring to the Small Business \nAdministration and its very important programs.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President. I join with my colleagues in support of \nthe President's nomination of Hector V. Barreto, Jr., to be \nAdministrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration, or SBA.\n  Mr. Barreto was born and raised in Kansas City, MO. He received a \nB.S./B.A. degree in management and Spanish, in 1983, from Kansas City's \nRockhurst College.\n  As Administrator of the SBA, it will serve Mr. Barreto well that he \ncomes from the small business community and can appreciate the \nchallenges small business owners face. He founded Barreto Insurance and \nFinancial Services in 1986 and serves as president-owner. The firm \nprovides financial services and business insurance to the Los Angeles \narea Latino community. He also founded a second business,\n\n[[Page S8193]]\n\nTELACU-Barreto Financial Services, which is one of the first Latino-\nowned securities broker-dealers, specializing in retirement-pension \nplans.\n  Mr. Barreto has been active in Latino business affairs. He has served \nas vice-chair of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, an organization \nfounded by his father, Hector Barreto, Sr. He also has served as chair \nof the Latin Business Association, Founding Member of the New America \nAlliance and chair of the Latin Business PAC, and on several corporate \nboards, including GE Financial Advisory Board, Sempra Energy Advisory \nBoard and the TELACU Industries Board of Directors. Many of these \ngroups have joined more than 90 others in support of Mr. Barreto's \nnomination.\n  I am pleased with Mr. Barreto's small business roots and admire his \nefforts to empower Hispanic Americans to share in our country's \neconomic vitality. I hope he will bring the insights gained from his \nexperiences to his leadership at the SBA.\n  SBA has played an instrumental role spurring the growth of this \ncountry's small businesses. The Agency has helped Americans start, run, \nand grow their businesses by offering access to credit and capital, \nprocurement guidance, business management education and technical \nassistance.\n  I met with Mr. Barreto last week. We had a good discussion about SBA \nand the many issues and obstacles that small business owners and \nentrepreneurs must face on a daily basis. I look forward to working \ntogether with Mr. Barreto to make the SBA even more effective than it's \nbeen.\n  There is a strong benchmark from which to start. SBA's record has \nbeen nothing short of extraordinary, particularly in view of a 22 \npercent staff level reduction. From 1993 through 2000, SBA provided \nmore services to more small businesses than in the entire previous \nhistory of the Agency. Its loan portfolio almost quintupled from $10 \nbillion to nearly $50 billion and its venture capital dollars \npractically doubled from $10.2 billion to over $19 billion. Moreover, \nSBA approved more than $19 billion in loans to some 80,000 minority-\nowned businesses--more than double the amount recorded during the \nAgency's prior 39 years.\n  Typically, SBA's assistance is needed most during economic downturns. \nIf the economy continues to cool, as many economists predict it will, \nCongress and the administration will need to redouble their support for \nthe policies and programs that SBA has used so successfully to \nstimulate the growth and contributions of America's small businesses.\n  One of the best opportunities to do so is in the shaping of SBA's \nbudget. The budget with which we were presented this year was \ninadequate. That is why Senator Bond and I worked together to pass an \namendment to restore large, unwise cuts in SBA's fiscal year 2001 \nbudget. As Mr. Barreto assumes a key role in the preparation of SBA's \nfiscal year 2002 budget, I hope he will work with us and fight hard for \na budget that adequately funds important SBA programs.\n  The administration's commitment to small businesses should start with \nSBA's new Administrator. Specifically, we will look to Mr. Barreto, for \nthe vision, leadership, and management skills required for SBA to \nsurpass the progress made by the Agency over the last 8 years in \nsupporting and encouraging small business and entrepreneurship.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Mr. Barreto's nomination.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I am proud to express my support for \nHector Barreto, nominee for Administrator of the Small Business \nAdministration, and a fellow Californian.\n  Mr. Barreto has been involved with small business concerns from an \nearly age. His father, Hector Barreto, Sr., helped found the U.S. \nHispanic Chamber of Commerce. As a young adult, the nominee helped his \nfather manage a family restaurant, an export-import business, and a \nconstruction company.\n  In 1986, Barreto founded a small business of his own: Barreto \nInsurance and Financial Services.\n  The entrepreneur designed the firm to address a lack of financial \nservices available to Southern California's rapidly growing Latino \npopulation.\n  Today, the firm generates $3 million in sales a year, and is \nconsidered one of the premier insurance and retirement planning firms \nin Los Angeles.\n  Barreto also acts as the vice chairman of the board of the Hispanic \nChamber of Commerce and until 1997, he was chairman of the board for \nthe Latin Business Association in Los Angeles.\n  Barreto founded the Latin Business Association Institute, an \nextension of the Latin Business Association, to provide technical \nassistance, education, and business development opportunities to Latin \nBusiness Association members.\n  For his dedication and commitment to the Latino Business Community, \nBarreto was awarded the Gold Medal of honor by the Multicultural \nInstitute of Leadership for his work in promoting diversity and \nimproving race relations.\n  In addition, he has received special recognition from Congress, the \nCalifornia State Senate and Assembly, the County of Los Angeles, the \nMayor's office, the City of Los Angeles, YMCA, and the American Red \nCross.\n  The number of small businesses continues to rise exponentially both \nin California and across the country. I look forward to working with \nMr. Barreto to see that our small businesses flourish. I am pleased to \nsupport his nomination.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nHector Baretto to the position of Administrator for the Small Business \nAdministration.\n  First, I want to take this opportunity to thank the Small Business \nand Entrepreneurship Committee Chairman Kerry and Ranking Member Bond \nfor working so diligently on issues affecting small businesses. Small \nbusinesses, always important to our communities and our economy, have \ntaken new and heightened importance in our changing economy.\n  The position for which Mr. Baretto has been nominated for, \nAdministrator of the Small Business Administration, has probably never \nhad as much significance as it does in the current economy. Small \nbusinesses are now, more than ever, a source of the innovation that is \ncritical to the continued growth of the economy. In my state, one of \nthe largest high-tech companies, Microsoft, was a small business not so \nlong ago. As we have watched our unemployment figures drop now for \nseveral years, small businesses have been the largest community \ncontributing to job creation.\n  In fact, many of the leading high-tech companies in America were \nsmall businesses only years ago--or remain small businesses today. But \nalong with the great successes, there are many small businesses with \ngreat ideas that have yet to get a foothold in our economy. These \ncompanies, many minority- and woman-owned, need the assistance of the \nSmall Business Administration.\n  I was alarmed when the administration presented its first budget with \ndeep cuts in SBA funding. Fortunately, Senators Kerry and Bond were \nable to restore much of that money in the Senate Budget Resolution and \nI would hope that as Administrator, Mr. Baretto would work to forestall \nany future efforts by others in the administration to impair SBA's \nability to fulfill its important mission.\n  The President's budget requested no money for the SBA's new markets \nventure capital program and the National Veterans' Business Development \nCorporation just when it is getting started in its efforts to help \nveterans, particularly service-disabled veterans, who want to start or \nexpand their businesses and develop a plan to become self-sustaining by \nfiscal year 2005. The President's budget freezes funding for the \nWomen's Business Centers at $12 million and the Women's Business \nCouncil at $750,000. The Council is very helpful to the Congress, \nmonitoring and researching the contribution of women business owners \nand the obstacles they face, including increasing their access to \ngovernment contracts loans, and venture capital.\n  These programs have been extremely valuable to the small business and \nentrepreneurial communities. I hope that as Administrator, Mr. Baretto \nwill defend these programs and help the administration understand their \nsignificance for veterans, women, and minorities. I think expanding and \ndiversifying the pool of small business owners is one of the most \nsignificant areas in which the SBA contributes, and an\n\n[[Page S8194]]\n\narea in which I believe the Small Business Administration can do more.\n  I congratulate Mr. Baretto and urge Senators to vote to confirm him \nas Administrator of the Small Business Administration.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Madam President, small businesses are the backbone of \nthe American economy. They create two of every three new jobs, produce \n39 percent of the gross national product and are responsible for more \nthan half of the Nation's technological innovation.\n  Our Nation's 20 million small businesses provide dynamic \nopportunities for all Americans. Therefore, I believe we need a strong \nadministrator to ensure that the SBA functions effectively on behalf of \nAmerica's small businesses.\n  Mr. Barreto is a native of Kansas City, MO who has demonstrated a \nbelief in the entrepreneurial spirit of small business owners.\n  As Chairman of the Board for the Latino Business Association, Mr. \nBarreto has shown his commitment to providing Latino Americans with \nbusiness opportunities, education, and technical assistance.\n  He also serves as the Vice Chairman of the Board of the United States \nHispanic Chamber of Commerce. In this capacity, Mr. Barreto is \nsuccessfully representing the interests of the Hispanic business \ncommunity by strengthening national economic development programs and \nincreasing business relationships between the corporate sector and \nHispanic owned businesses.\n  I am pleased that the President has put forward a nominee with such a \nstrong record of leadership and commitment to promoting the success of \nsmall businesses. I supported Mr. Barreto's nomination in the Senate \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, and I am similarly \npleased to support his nomination here on the floor of the United \nStates Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is my understanding that we are now in \nexecutive session; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Pending before the Senate is the nomination of Hector \nBarreto; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Barreto nomination is the pending \nnomination.\n\n\n              Vote on the Nomination of Hector V. Barreto\n\n  Mr. REID. We have had no request for a rollcall vote. I ask that we \nmove forward on the vote at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back on the nomination?\n  Mr. REID. On this nomination I don't think there is any time to yield \nback. If there is, I ask unanimous consent that it be yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is, Shall the Senate advise and consent to the \nnomination?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Vote On The Nomination Of Wade Horn\n\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding that now the confirmation of the \nnomination of Wade Horn would be the next matter before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. There are 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. REID. The time of the Senator from Minnesota has been yielded \nback. I ask unanimous consent that the 2\\1/2\\ minutes controlled by the \nminority be yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

LENHARDT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the day before yesterday I met for the first \ntime Alfonso Lenhardt. I met him in the majority leader's office. We \nwere standing there alone after some niceties. I asked him: What is the \npin on your lapel? He said: It is a Purple Heart. It is a medal for \nbeing injured in combat. He didn't say that, but that is what the \nPurple Heart stands for.\n  I mention that because I have a lot of affection for the Senate. I \nhave a lot of affection for this Capitol complex. One of the main \nreasons I have so much affection is that I worked nights as a Capitol \nHill policeman while going through law school. I can remember walking \nthrough Statuary Hall, never having had any understanding of who those \ngreat men were in the true sense of the word. I had the opportunity of \nmeeting Everett Dirksen. I remember walking on the floor. I was the \npoliceman assigned to the Ohio Clock, as it is called. I was there when \nthis man with long, white hair and a wonderful voice, Senator Everett \nDirksen, came by. He was asked to comment on the first hydrogen \nexplosion of a nuclear device by the Soviet Union. I stood there and \nlistened to him.\n  I have fond memories of not only my congressional experience but also \nas a young man working as a Capitol policeman. My boss was the Sergeant \nat Arms. The Sergeant at Arms of the House and the Senate are very \nimportant positions.\n  I mention meeting with General Lenhardt because I think we should \nunderstand what a great choice this man is to be the Sergeant at Arms \nof the U.S. Senate. He is a professional in the true sense of the word. \nPrior to some preliminary issues, Senator Daschle never knew the man. \nHis very fine chief of staff, Pete Rouse, and our very excellent \nSecretary of the Senate, Jeri Thomson, went through the process and \ncame to Senator Daschle with a number of people. This is the person \nthat Senator Daschle chose. What a great choice. He is a professional.\n  One of the jobs he had in the U.S. Army was to be the commanding \ngeneral of the organization that takes care of national security and \nlaw enforcement programs.\n  In 1997, after more than 31 years of domestic and international \nexperiences in national security and law enforcement, he retired from \nthe U.S. Army. His responsibilities in the military were significant. \nHe is a two-star general. I am told that he could have had a third \nstar, but he decided to retire prior to doing that.\n  His last position with the Army was as commanding general of the U.S. \nArmy Recruiting Command. There were over 1,800 separate locations of \nwhich he was the leader. He managed an Army installation consisting of \n130,000 acres of training areas, administrative and logistical \nfacilities, and support operations for over 23,000 civilian employees, \nmilitary retirees, soldiers, and family members.\n  He also served as the senior military police officer for all police \noperations and security matters throughout the Army's worldwide sphere \nof influence.\n  So to have him at the Senate, having the responsibility, among other \nthings, for the security of this Capitol complex, says it all. He \ncertainly has had\n\n[[Page S8196]]\n\nthe experience. This man not only has had an outstanding military \ncareer, but he has a bachelor of science degree in criminal justice \nfrom the University of Nebraska, a master of arts degree in public \nadministration from Central Michigan University, and a master of \nscience degree in the administration of justice from Wichita State \nUniversity. He also completed executive programs at Harvard \nUniversity's Kennedy School of Government and the University of \nMichigan Executive Business School.\n  He has been active in public service. This is a man who is \noutstanding. Those who watch the Senate proceedings on C-SPAN or who \nvisit the Capitol, to see this historic site, may not realize all the \nwork that goes into running the U.S. Capitol. The responsibilities are \nenormous. Unless something goes wrong, we take them for granted.\n  Senator Daschle has done some very fine things during his 7 years as \nDemocratic leader, and he has done some great things during his short \ntime as majority leader, but I think there is nothing that I have been \nmore impressed with than his selection of General Alfonso Lenhardt as \nthe Sergeant at Arms of the U.S. Senate. I hope everyone in the Senate \nwill have the opportunity to meet this man and to recognize what a fine \nperson Senator Daschle has selected.\n  He is going to be our protocol officer and our chief law enforcement \nofficer. He will also be the administrative manager for most of the \nSenate's wide-ranging support services. We could not have a better \nperson.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/25/senate-section/article/S8196-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8196-S8198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senate recently passed the Patients' \nBill of Rights and we are anxiously awaiting action by the House. The \nPatient Protection Act, or the Patients' Bill of Rights, is something \nwe have spent a great deal of time on in the Senate.\n  As Senator Daschle indicated, it was one of our top priorities. We \nhad a great deal of difficulty getting it through the Senate. It took \nus a good number of years to do that, but after 4 or 5 years of debate, \nwe finally got a Patient Protection Act passed by the Senate. We are \nnow waiting for the House to take similar action.\n  The President says he will veto it. And that is the way the \nlegislative process works. We have to do the best we can to advance \npublic policies that we think strengthen this country. We have done \nthat under the leadership of Senator Daschle, with the cooperation of \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle. We passed a real Patient \nProtection Act or a real Patients' Bill of Rights. Let me describe why \nthat is important and what it does.\n  All of us have had lengthy debates about what is happening to health \ncare in this country, as more and more Americans have been herded into \nthese groups called managed care organizations. They were created, in \nsome cases, for very good reasons, to try to reduce the cost of health \ncare and control and contain the cost of health care.\n  But in recent years, the for-profit organizations that have become \npart of the managed care industry have, from time to time, taken \nactions with respect to patient care that have much more to do with \ntheir bottom-line profit than it has to do with patient care.\n  So we had a debate about a Patient Protection Act that says the \nfollowing:\n  One, you ought to be able to know all of your medical options for \ntreatment, not just the cheapest option for medical treatment. That \nought to be a fundamental right for patients.\n  Two, if you have an emergency, you ought to have a right to go to an \nemergency room. Sound simple? Yes, it is simple. But it is not always \nthe case in this country that with an emergency, you are going to get \nreimbursement for emergency room treatment by a managed care \norganization.\n  Three, you have a right to see a specialist when you need one for \nyour medical condition. Does that sound simple and pretty \nstraightforward? Sure, but it doesn't happen all the time.\n  You have a right to clinical trials. You have a right to retain, for \nexample, the relationship you have with your oncologist who has been \ntreating you for breast cancer for 7 years. Even if your employer \nchanges health care organizations, you have a right to continue to see \nthe same oncologist who has been treating you for cancer for 7 years.\n  Those are the kinds of provisions we put in the Patient Protection \nAct. Let me describe why we did it. We did it because in this country \ntoo often patients are discovering that what they believed they were \ncovered for in their medical or health care plan was not in fact \ncovered at all.\n  I have told the story of the woman who went hiking in the \nShenandoahs. She fell off a 50-foot cliff and sustained very serious \ninjuries. She was unconscious. She had multiple broken bones and was in \nvery serious condition. She was brought to an emergency room on a \ngurney unconscious. She survived after a long convalescence, only to \nfind out that the managed care organization said they would not pay for \nher emergency room treatment because she had not had prior approval for \nemergency room care. This is a woman hauled into an emergency room \nunconscious, told that she should have gotten prior approval for \nemergency room care.\n  Does that literally cry out and beg for some kind of legislative \nattention? Yes, it does. It is just one piece of the Patient Protection \nAct providing that, if you have an emergency, you have a right to \nemergency room treatment.\n  There are so many other examples. For instance, the issue of what is \nmedically necessary. I have held up pictures on the floor of young \nchildren born with terribly deformed facial features, being told that \nthe correction of that radically deformed facial feature is not \n``medically necessary,'' and therefore the insurance they thought they \nhad with the managed care organization would not cover it.\n  I have told the story often of my colleague, Senator Reid of Nevada \nand I, holding a hearing in the State of Nevada on this subject, where \nwe heard from a mother of a young boy named Christopher Roe who died at \nage 16. Christopher had cancer. This young boy fought cancer valiantly \nbut lost his life on his 16th birthday. In the process of fighting \ncancer, they also had to fight in order to get the treatment he needed. \nHe didn't get it in time. It is an unfair fight to ask a 16-year-old \nboy to fight cancer and have to fight the insurance company at the same \ntime.\n  His mother held up a picture of young Christopher, a big colored \nposter picture, and cried at the end of her testimony as she described \nher son looking up at her from the bedside asking: Mom, how can they do \nthis to a kid? What he was asking was: How can they do this? How can \nthey not provide the treatment I need to give me a chance to live? That \nboy died at age 16.\n  I have told that story. I have told many other stories, including the \nstory of Ethan Bedrick. Ethan had a very difficult birth and was born \nwith very serious problems because the umbilical cord had shut off his \noxygen. A doctor had decided, after evaluating him, that he had only a \n50-percent chance of being able to walk by age 5 if he got certain \nrehabilitative services. A 50- percent chance for this little boy to be \nable to walk by age 5 was ``insignificant,'' and, therefore, the \nservices were denied.\n  Does it sound bizarre? Does it sound like a system with which we are \nacquainted? Not to me. This all sounds just Byzantine, that decisions \nare made about health care on what is medically necessary, what is an \nemergency, what kind of treatment is available, what kind of treatment \nis necessary. Some decisions have been made with an eye toward the \nbottom line of the corporation providing the health care. And that is \nwrong because human health is not a function of someone's bottom line.\n  We had a woman who suffered a very serious brain injury. She was \nstill conscious. She was in an ambulance, and she asked the ambulance \ndriver to take her to the furthest hospital. There was one closer. She \nwanted to go to the one that was a bit further away. This is someone in \nan ambulance with a brain injury. She survived and later was asked: Why \ndid you not want the ambulance to drop you off at the nearest hospital? \nShe said: Because I understood the reputation of that hospital. It was \ntheir bottom line, their profit; I did not want to be presented on a\n\n[[Page S8197]]\n\ngurney with a brain injury and be looked at by a doctor who thought in \nterms of profit and loss. Doctors wouldn't do that, but a health care \nsystem determined by profit and loss, how much would this cost? I \nwanted someone to see me and determine they wanted to fight for my life \nregardless of cost.\n  That is what people have been concerned about with respect to managed \ncare. Not all managed care organizations have done this. Some are \nwonderful. Some have done a great job. Some have not. Some have taken a \nposition that jeopardizes people's health. They have said to people: \nHere is your option for medical treatment, not giving them all the \noptions that might be available to them, only describing the cheapest \noption that would be available to be delivered by the health care \norganization.\n  Is that fair to people in this health care system? The answer clearly \nis no.\n  So we have had a fight in the Senate the last 3, 4, 5 years. We have \na managed care organization that is big, strong, well financed, and \nthey very aggressively oppose what we are trying to do. On the other \nside are doctors, the American Medical Association. They want to \npractice medicine in the hospital room. They want to practice medicine \nin the clinic. They don't want to practice medicine only to find out \nthat some young fellow 1,000 miles away, working as a junior accountant \nfor an insurance company, who hasn't yet shaved twice a week, is making \ndecisions about health care that the doctor is going to deliver in the \nhospital room.\n  That is not the kind of health care they are dedicated to provide the \nAmerican people. They didn't study in medical school for the purpose of \nhaving somebody 1,000 miles away, who knows very little about health \ncare, tell them how they ought to treat a patient.\n  So we have a battle between the managed care organization, that has \nspent a great deal of money, putting ads all over television to try to \ndefeat it, and doctors, patients, and other health groups saying: We \nneed this.\n  It was long past the time to get this done, and we finally did it. We \nfinally got it done. We got it through the Senate after a number of \nyears. Now it waits in the House for action. We read day after day of \nreasons that somehow it is not quite getting done. The big industries \nthat have something at stake are making all the efforts they can to try \nto defeat the legislation. And if we get it through the House of \nRepresentatives--and we should; there is no excuse for this Congress \nnot passing this legislation--the President says he will veto it.\n  He has a right to veto it. I must say, though, what we have enacted \nin the Senate is almost exactly what they have for law in the State of \nTexas. I know President Bush vetoed it first when he was Governor of \nTexas, but later it became law without his signature in Texas. What we \nare trying to do for the country says essentially the same as exists in \nthe State of Texas with respect to a patients' protection act.\n  Again, let me say that we have a lot of issues in this country. We \nsink our teeth into a good number of them throughout the year in the \nSenate.\n  This is a critically important issue for us to get done this year. \nThis issue is very important. We have a responsibility to continue \napplying pressure in this circumstance to the House. I hope the \nAmerican people will apply pressure to the House and say: Get this \ndone. Do this bill. Bring it up for a vote, pass it, and send it to the \nPresident.\n  The President says he will veto it. I don't know that that is the \ncase. I hope when he looks at this bill, he will understand this is the \nright bill for the American people. It is the right thing to do.\n  It is very interesting to me that as we look at all of the challenges \nwe face in this country, we have had some great successes, and almost \nevery step of the way we have had people who have said: Not me, help me \nout, this won't work. All of us come from towns and have friends who \nare there sitting around being crabby all day long, those who describe \nwhat won't work.\n  I come from a town of 300 to 400 people. I spent most of my formative \nyears there. Three or four people there were always crabby about \nthings, and they said, ``This won't work,'' or, ``This will never do.'' \nBut the rest of the town was out doing things. They paved our Main \nStreet while others said it could not be done. It got done because the \nbuilders and the doers decided to make it happen.\n  The same is true in the Senate. It doesn't matter what the issue is, \nit doesn't matter whether it is Social Security, workers rights, \nminimum wage, we have people in this body who have opposed everything \nfor the first time, and it doesn't matter what it is. Those who \nprogressively want to make changes strengthen this country. It is our \nburden to say, here are our ideas, here is what we must do to \nstrengthen our country.\n  We have done that. A Patient Protection Act is just one more step in \na series of things that we know must be done to help the American \npeople deal with a health care system that has increasingly moved \ntoward managed care and has increasingly empowered the bigger interests \nand taken away from the American people and the individuals who need \nhealth care the opportunity to fight back. That is what the Patient \nProtection Act or Patients' Bill of Rights is about.\n  Now we have passed that legislation. We have had good leadership in \nthe Senate, and in the last couple of months we have passed legislation \ndealing with that Patients' Bill of Rights and a number of other things \nthat have been welled up for a long while in the Senate. But now it is \ndone. It is up to the House to do the same. I call on the President to \njoin us. I urge the House to pass this bill, and then I urge the \nPresident to sign the bill. Let this bill work for the American people.\n  I know the Senator from Nevada, who attended a hearing with me that I \nreferenced recently, cares a great deal about this issue. I know that \nat the hearing in the State of Nevada I heard exactly what I had heard \nat hearings I held in New York, Minnesota, and elsewhere. I held \nhearings as chairman of the Democratic Policy Committee on this issue. \nIt didn't matter where you were, you would hear the same story; that \nis, that patients in this country expect the kind of health treatment \nthey were promised by their health care plan, when they get sick and \nneed health care. Too often they discover that that kind of delivery of \nhealth care service is not available to them when they need it.\n  We have, as I indicated, a number of challenges facing us this year. \nThis is but one. I think it is one of the most important challenges. I \nhope in the not-too-distant future the House of Representatives will \ntake action, as the Senate has already done, and we will see a Patient \nProtection Act become law in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have said before that the Senator from \nNorth Dakota has spent a great deal of time on the Patients' Bill of \nRights, developing a foundation so that the legislation could pass. It \nwas Senator Edwards' legislation, along with Senators Kennedy and \nMcCain. But the real foundation for that legislation came as a result \nof the work that Senator Dorgan did around the country as the chairman \nof the policy committee, holding hearings all over America. He \nmentioned Las Vegas. There was a dramatic hearing held in Las Vegas, \nwith people complaining about how they had been mistreated or not \ntreated. Not only did we have patients coming in, we had physicians \ncoming in and telling us how they could not render care that they, in \ntheir expertise, training, and experience, indicated needed to be done, \nand their managed care entity would not let them do it. There are cases \nwhere a doctor has been pulled off the case because his recommendations \nfor treatment were not what the HMO or the managed care entity wanted.\n  I have great respect and admiration for the Senator from North Dakota \nfor helping us lay a foundation so that we could pass successful \nlegislation. All eyes are now upon the House of Representatives, to \nmake sure they pass legislation that is in keeping with what we did \nover here. They are trying to spin this, saying the legislation in the \nSenate is all about lawyers.\n  The legislation that passed in the Senate of the United States had \nnothing to do with lawyers and everything\n\n[[Page S8198]]\n\nto do with patients. Out of a bill that contains 100 percent substance, \n2 percent dealt with lawyers and 98 percent dealt with patients.\n  I look forward to the bill passing in the House. Also, I have such \ngreat admiration and respect for Dr. Norwood, who has been willing to \nstep beyond the pale. He has been willing to go beyond what most of the \ntime happens in partisan politics. Congressman Norwood, a Republican, \nhas said he can't do what his leadership has asked him to do. He \nbelieves in a Patients' Bill of Rights, and he has been a leader. I \nhave such great respect for him.\n  I express my appreciation to the Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/25/senate-section/article/S8198-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE DEPARTURE OF ROBERT D. FOREMAN\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to pay \ntribute to Robert D. Foreman who has served as a health advisor to me \nfor the past 8 years. Rob came to my staff after distinguished service \nin the House of Representatives, in the Executive Branch, and in a \nnational trade association.\n  I suppose that Rob's experience staffing Medicaid and Medicare issues \nfor me, and earlier for our colleagues on the House Interstate and \nForeign Commerce Committee, now called the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee, have prepared him well for his new assignment as President \nGeorge W. Bush's Director of the Office of Legislative Affairs at the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services. I am confident that he will \nbe a great asset to Secretary Thompson, Administrator Scully, and the \nPresident as they work to preserve and strengthen Medicare, and \nconfront the many challenges facing the Center for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services, CMS.\n  Rob is able to grasp complex issues and use his keen sense of humor \nto bring together parties with differing views on pending legislation. \nWith his research and command of the legislative process, he has helped \nus make significant contributions during the past eight years on many \nkey pieces of legislation including the defeat of the Health Security \nAct and enactment of the Children's Health Insurance Program, the \nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the \nBalanced Budget Act amendments and subsequent revisions, and the \nSkilled Nursing Facility legislation.\n  I also have been able to count on Rob to be a powerful advocate for \nthe disabled, and the less fortunate, and to be my liaison with my \nDisability Advisory Committee in Utah. He also has been a tireless \nadvocate for Native Americans and has enhanced my work on the Committee \non Indian Affairs.\n  For those who have been blessed to work with Rob, they understand \nthat beneath the soft-spoken, dedicated work of this kind man is the \ncaring heart of a true gentleman. He is a man you can genuinely trust, \na man of his word, a man of integrity. He seeks not just to do his job, \nbut to do it well. He came to his office each morning not to work, but \nto serve. His gentle nature is equaled only by his loyalty and work \nethic.\n  I am grateful to Rob for his efforts, for his personal sacrifices, \nand for the many nights and weekends he spent ensuring that work on \nthese vital issues was complete. I want to publicly thank him for all \nof his many contributions. I wish him the best as he confronts this new \nchallenge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/25/senate-section/article/S8198-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RETIREMENT OF JESS ARAGON\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today to call to your attention the \nretirement of one of our country's finest public servants. Jess Aragon, \nthe Budget Officer of the Department of Labor's Employment and Training \nAdministration, is leaving after 33 years of Federal service. In his \ncapacity as Budget Officer, he controlled the formulation, \njustification, and execution of some $10 billion of our taxpayers' \nfunds in a manner that set him apart for his professionalism and \ncourtesy. He has personally assisted the Appropriations Committee time \nand time again, and has been especially helpful when the chips were \ndown and information was desperately needed to make our bills and \nreports come together.\n  A native of Albuquerque, NM, Jess' career began with a four-year \nstint in the Air Force. Following this, he entered public service with \nthe New Mexico State Employment Security Agency, after which he joined \nthe Department of Labor. He and his wife, Myra, are retiring to San \nJuan, PR, and I, and the other members and staff of the Appropriations \nCommittee, wish them all the best, and offer a heartfelt thanks for a \ncareer devoted to serving the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/25/senate-section/article/S8198-3", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

The Local law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred December 8, \n1994 in Medford, OR. A man who said he thought their lifestyle was \n``sick'' killed two prominent lesbian activists, who had been domestic \npartners for many years.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance.

Mr. President, when Americans see people in need, their \nfirst instinct is to help. It is the kind of attitude that makes our \nNation great. But imagine if you had the knowledge and the tools to \nhelp someone in need--but weren't permitted to lend a hand.\n  Health care professionals all across our country are prevented from \ndonating their services in the free clinics that serve those most \ndesperate for medical care, because these practitioners do not have \nmalpractice coverage that will cover their work in volunteer clinics. \nToday, I urge Secretary Tommy Thompson and his Department of Health and \nHuman Services to finish a job that Congress started 5 years ago and \nsolve this problem once and for all.\n  For several years now, doctors and dentists in Oregon have been \ncalling me, saying they want to give back to their communities by \nvolunteering in free clinics, but are not allowed to do so. I also have \nbeen contacted by an organization--Volunteers in Medicine--that \noperates free clinics across the country. They know of many health care \nproviders who want to volunteer but cannot.\n  When Congress passed the Health Insurance Portability and \nAccountability Act, or HIPAA, in 1996, one small provision was \nincluded, aimed at helping health care providers who wanted to \nvolunteer in free clinics but were concerned about malpractice claims. \nSection 194 of HIPAA would let free clinics\n\n[[Page S8200]]\n\napply to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to have health \nproviders certified and given immunity from malpractice claims.\n  This small provision could be a big help to the uninsured and those \nwho count on free clinics for health care. The problem is, this \nprovision of HIPAA has been overlooked and regulations for this \nsection--detailing how the legislation should be implemented--were \nnever written.\n  I am sending a letter to Secretary Thompson calling on him to get \nthose regulations written and published as soon as possible. This \nshould not be difficult. Legislation passed in 1992, which extended the \nTort Claims Act coverage to volunteers in community health centers, can \nserve as a model.\n  Congress did the right thing in 1996 in recognizing this problem, but \nwe need to finish the job. Two things need to happen now. We need those \nregulations published, and Congress needs to appropriate funding for \nthe provision.\n  This will not solve the problems of the more than 40 million \nAmericans without health insurance, but it sure could make a big \ndifference in making care more accessible. It could make a big \ndifference in the lives of the many health professionals who want to \ngive back to their communities.\n  I again want to urge Secretary Thompson today to get these \nregulations published as soon as possible. For my part, I intend to \nstay on the job to assure his Department has funding for this \nprovision.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/25/senate-section/article/S8200-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

WAITE\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise \ntoday to pay special tribute to an outstanding soldier who has \ndistinguished himself in his service to our Nation. Colonel Jeffrey A. \nWaite will take off his uniform for the last time this month as he \nretires from the National Guard on July 31st, 2001, following 32 years \nof service.\n  Colonel Waite is a fifth generation Missourian who makes our State \nproud. He began his career by enlisting in the Missouri Army National \nGuard in 1969 and continued to excel as he climbed through the ranks to \nColonel. He imparted his love of the State and to the military to his \nson, who is now the sixth generation of Waite's to serve our Nation's \nmilitary. He is a proud Missourian and American.\n  Colonel Waite completed his initial training at Ft. Bragg, NC and \nAberdeen Proving Ground, MD in the spring of 1970 and was commissioned \nthrough the Missouri Military Academy Officer Candidate School as a \nSecond Lieutenant of Field Artillery in 1972. He holds a bachelor of \nscience degree in business administration from Southwest Missouri State \nCollege and a master of science in business administration from Boston \nUniversity. In addition, his military education includes the Ordinance \nOfficer Basic and Advanced courses, U.S. Marine Corps Staff Course, \nU.S. Army Command and General Staff Course, the Air War College, and \nthe Army War College.\n  Throughout his career, Colonel Waite has held a variety of positions \nat nearly every level of the Army National Guard. He entered active \nduty with the National Guard ``Captains to Europe'' program where he \nserved abroad in Giessen, Germany with the 19th Maintenance Battalion \nas an Armament Maintenance Officer and Battalion Logistics Officer. \nColonel Waite is also to be recognized for his service as Assistant \nProfessor of Military Science, Hofstra University, an important program \nfor developing the soldiers of our future.\n  Throughout his career, Colonel Waite's level of commitment and \nservice has been recognized and rewarded through numerous decorations \nand awards. Colonel Waite has demonstrated the utmost patriotism and \ndedication and has consistently gone above and beyond the call of duty.\n  Colonel Waite's retirement represents a loss to the both the National \nGuard Bureau and the Department of Defense. Throughout his career, \nColonel Waite made innumerable long-term positive contributions to both \nthe military and our Nation. On behalf of the citizens of Missouri and \na grateful Nation, we wish Colonel Jeffrey A. Waite, his wife Lori, and \nfour children all the best for a happy retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/25/senate-section/article/S8200-3", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8200-S8201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO MOUNTAIN VALLEY MEDICAL CLINIC\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, right now in my home state of \nVermont, a very special institution, the Mountain Valley Medical \nClinic, MVMC, in Londonderry, VT, is celebrating 25 years of service. \nRural clinics such as Mountain Valley, play a critical role in \ndelivering health care, especially in States as rural as Vermont.\n  Twenty-five years ago, it was not unusual for communities such as \nLondonderry, to receive health care through a single practitioner, who \nserviced the region. In 1976, as Londonderry's sole practitioner, Dr. \nElizabeth Pingree, was retiring, the impending lack of health care in \nthe area became a real concern. A group of involved citizens recognized \nthat people would either be forced to drive great distances to be seen \nby a physician, or they would go without care. The entire community \nresponded by coming together to create the Mountain Valley Medical \nClinic.\n  The founding fathers, and mothers, of Mountain Valley recognized the \nrapidly expanding need for improved and broader health care services in \nthe area. With tireless energy, enthusiasm and dedication, these key \nindividuals succeeded in generating widespread support throughout the \nneighboring communities. They raised funds, developed plans, created a \nboard of volunteers, and opened a state-of-the-art, comprehensive, \nhealth care facility to serve area residents and visitors. \nAdditionally, they created an infrastructure that served all citizens \nregardless of their ability to pay.\n  Since opening its doors in 1976, more than 300,000 patients have \nvisited this clinic for care. Over the recent decade, more than 11,000 \nper year have sought medical assistance. Much of the cost of the care \nhas been curtailed by Medicare, Medicaid, or provided without \nreimbursement. Staying true to its mission, the dedicated staff and \nvolunteer Board of Directors balanced financial losses, each and every \nyear, with the generous support of the community.\n  As a model rural health care facility, Mountain Valley reminds us \nthat bigger, faster, cheaper, and fancier, do not necessarily translate \nto better health care. In fact, many part-time residents in this \ncommunity consider Mountain Valley to be their primary care provider, \neven though, or perhaps because, they reside in large cities up and \ndown the east coast. I wish other institutions could follow the example \nof Mountain Valley Health Clinic.\n  As this noteworthy institution celebrates its 25th anniversary, it \nremains one of a kind. It is unique among its peers throughout the \ncountry for its philosophy and independence, but most of all, because \nit is the product of so many remarkable people and ideas. It is truly \npart of the communities it serves. Residents and visitors in the \nMountain Valley service area have much to be proud of, and grateful \nfor, with the steadfast medical care given\n\n[[Page S8201]]\n\nby the professionals and staff at Mountain Valley Medical \nClinic.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/25/senate-section/article/S8201-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO COMMISSIONER ROBERT W. VARNEY\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to an esteemed colleague and dear friend, Robert W. Varney, \nCommissioner of the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services, \nNHDES, on being appointed Regional Administrator for the Environmental \nProtection Agency, EPA--New England.\n  Mr. Varney has served the Granite State as Commissioner of NHDES \nsince July of 1989, having been appointed by three Governors, Judd \nGregg, Steve Merrill and Jeanne Shaheen, with the unanimous approval of \nthe Executive Council. Mr. Varney was responsible for the great task of \noverseeing all of New Hampshire's air, water and waste programs issues. \nHe is recognized nationally as an environmental leader, and has \npresided over countless prestigious environmental committees and \norganizations, including President of the Environmental Council of the \nStates, ECOS, the National Organization of State Environmental \nCommissioners and has served on the National Environmental Justice \nAdvisory Council.\n  While his national recognition is commendable, Mr. Varney's prowess \nin the New England region has been demonstrated by his high ranking \npositions on numerous regional organizations such as the Gulf of Maine \nCouncil on the Marine Environment, the Ozone Transport Commission, the \nNew England Governors Conference Environment Committee, and the New \nEngland Interstate Water Pollution Control Commission, just to name a \nfew. In June 2000, his efforts to partner with the private sector were \nrecognized when he was presented with the Paul Keough Environmental \nAward for Government Service by the Environmental Business Council of \nNew England.\n  As former Chairman and current ranking member of the Senate Committee \non Environment and Public Works, and one time Chairman of the Superfund \nSub-committee, I have had the pleasure of working quite closely with \nMr. Varney on a wide range of issues. On numerous occasions I have \ndepended on his far-reaching environmental expertise to testify before \nCongress on key issues such as the dangers of the fuel additive MTBE, \nthe current status of superfund cleanup activities and on successful \nstate environmental programs.\n  With the help of Mr. Varney's leadership, New Hampshire has become, \nand continues to be, a front-runner in exploring innovative, low-cost \ntechnologies while reaping the benefits of developing successful \nFederal and State relationships. I commend Mr. Varney for his exemplary \nservice to New Hampshire, and look forward to watching the success that \nwill follow him in this next endeavor. New Hampshire, New England and \nthe Nation are truly fortunate to have such a dedicated environmental \nleader take on the vitally important role of EPA Regional \nAdministrator, and I am certain he will execute this duty with \ncomparable distinction. It is with pleasure that I extend my deepest \ncongratulations and hope for future success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/25/senate-section/article/S8201-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/25/senate-section/article/S8201-3", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/25/senate-section/article/S8201-4", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  At 10:46 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 468.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to provide \nthat certain sexual crimes against children are predicate crimes for \nthe interception of communications, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the Internet has dramatically changed the \nlives of the American people. The way in which we work, live, play, and \nlearn has been forever changed. The benefits this new technology has \nbrought to us are truly innumerable. Unfortunately, however, the \ntechnology has also created some fearful problems. In particular, the \nInternet is fast becoming an increasingly popular means by which \ncriminals pursue their nefarious activities.\n  Perhaps no criminal activity is as nefarious as sex crimes directed \nat children. And alarmingly, the Internet has proved to be a boon for \nthese sexual predators. Before the Internet, these deranged individuals \noperated in the open, lurking near parks or schools in an effort to \nlure children. Now they are able, with almost absolute anonymity and \nfrom the security of their homes, to reach our children over the \nInternet.\n  The result is frightening. According to State and local law \nenforcement officials, the Internet has brought an explosion in sexual \npredator and child pornography activity. Since 1995, the FBI alone has \ninvestigated more than 4,900 cases involving persons traveling \ninterstate for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual relationships \nwith minors and persons involved with the manufacture, dissemination \nand possession of child pornography.\n  According to the Bureau, computers have rapidly become one of the \nmost prevalent communications devices with which pedophiles and other \nsexual predators share sexually explicit photographic images of minors \nand identify and recruit children for sexually illicit relationships.\n  This fact is not lost on the public. When asked about cyber-crime, a \nmajority of Americans pointed to child pornography as their biggest \nconcern. The Pew Internet & American Life Report Survey found that 92 \npercent of Americans are concerned about child pornography. Americans \nare rightly concerned that the Internet does not become a haven for \nthose who would commit these horrific crimes.\n  The Anti-Sexual Predator Act of 2001, which I am introducing today, \nprovides much-needed tools to investigators tracking sexual predators \nand child pornographers. The legislation will be particularly useful to \ninvestigators tracking sexual predators.\n  Although in many cases much of the initial relationship between these \nsexual predators and their child victims takes place online, the \npredators will ultimately seek to have personal contact with the child. \nThus, the communications will move first to the telephone, and then to \nface to face meetings. The telephone calls between the perpetrators and \nthe victims therefore represent a dangerous step in the luring of the \nchild. And the more access the sexual predator is allowed to the child \nvictim, the greater the chance that the predator will succeed in \nconvincing the child to continue the ``relationship'' and agree to \npersonal meetings.\n  As the laws stand today, investigators do not have access to the \nFederal wiretap statutes to investigate these predators. Absent this \nauthority, law enforcement officers, upon discovery of the on-line \nrelationship, are left to attempt to gain information about the \nrelationship from an often uncooperative or resentful child who \nbelieves that he or she is ``in love'' with the perpetrator. Providing \nwiretap authority not only will aid law enforcement's efforts to obtain \nevidence of these crimes, it will also help them stop these crimes \nbefore the predator makes physical contact with the child.\n  The Anti-Sexual Predator Act of 2001 will add three predicate \noffenses to the Federal wiretap statute. This addition will enable law \nenforcement to intercept wire and oral communications relating to child \npornography materials, the coercion and enticement of individuals to \ntravel interstate to engage in sexual activity, the transportation of \nminors for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity.\n  To be sure, law enforcement will still need to obtain authority from \na court in order to obtain a wiretap, and the court will authorize the \nwiretap only if the government meets the strict statutory guidelines \nlaid out in Title III. Thus, this legislation does nothing to undermine \nthe legitimate expectations of privacy of law-abiding American \ncitizens.\n  This legislation fills a gap in our arsenal against child \npornographers and sexual predators. I know we all share this goal, and \nI urge my colleagues to join me in expeditiously acting on this \nimportant legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1234\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reduce criminal gang activities; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Criminal Gang \nAbatement Act of 2001, a bill to give law enforcement additional tools \nto fight the scourge of gang violence.\n  This legislation builds on and improves the Violent Crime Control and \nLaw Enforcement Act of 1994, the first Federal statute to address \ndirectly the problem of criminal gangs.\n  I am delighted that Senator Hatch joins me in introducing this bill \nand I thank him for his hard work in helping develop the legislation.\n  I know that this bill will be familiar to my colleagues. It is \nsimilar to legislation that was included in the Juvenile Justice bill \nin the last Congress.\n  The Senate passed the Juvenile Justice bill overwhelmingly. \nUnfortunately, it did not become law. That is why Senator Hatch and I \nare introducing this gang legislation separately.\n  Mr. President, I care deeply about solving the problem of gang \nviolence and crime.\n  I worked extensively on this problem when I was Mayor of San \nFrancisco and have long considered it one of my top priorities.\n  I am often struck by how vicious gang crimes can be, and how damaging \nthey are to the victims and to the surrounding community.\n  Let me give you a couple of recent examples from my own home city of \nSan Francisco.\n  Last year, gang members tried to rob a passerby with an assault \nweapon from their car. When the victim resisted, the gang shot the \nvictim 17 times. The victim survived but will never walk again.\n  Only two months before that assault, two rival gangs had a shootout \nin San Francisco's Mission District. An innocent bystander was caught \nin the crossfire and shot through both legs.\n  A brave eyewitness gave law enforcement the name of one shooting \nsuspect, who was then arrested. The gang then tracked down the witness, \nput a 9 millimeter automatic to his head, and threatened to kill him \nfor cooperating with the police.\n  I would like to explain how this legislation will help deter and \npunish such crimes, and why Congress should act quickly to pass it.\n  First, the bill makes it a separate Federal crime to recruit persons \nto join a criminal street gang with the intent that the recruit \nparticipate in a Federal drug or violent crime.\n  The penalty is up to 10 years in jail. The offender can also be held \nresponsible for reimbursing the government's costs in housing, \nmaintaining, and treating the minor until the age of 18.\n  The purpose of this provision is to deter criminal gang recruitment.\n  Such recruitment has continued to grow and grow every year.\n  Even while crime has been dropping generally, the number of criminal \ngangs and gang members has spiraled.\n  The 1999 Justice Department survey of gangs, the most recent \navailable, found that the number of gang members has increased 8 \npercent just from 1998.\n  In fact, the growth of criminal gangs in the country over the last 20 \nyears, has been extraordinary.\n  Twenty years ago, the gang problem was centered in Los Angeles and \nChicago. Today, though, there are gangs in all 50 States and the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  In 1980, there were gangs in 286 jurisdictions. Today, they are in \nover 1500 jurisdictions.\n  In 1980, there were about 2000 gangs. Today, there are over 26,000 \ngangs.\n  In 1980, there were about 100,000 gang members. Today, there are \n840,500 gang members.\n  Let me read from a Department of Justice publication entitled ``The \nGrowth of Youth Gang Problems in the United States: 1970-1998'' that \nwas just released a few months ago:\n\n       Youth gang problems in the United States grew dramatically \n     between the 1970's and 1990's, with the prevalence of gangs \n     reaching unprecedented levels. The growth was manifested by \n     steep increase in the number of cities, counties, and States \n     reporting gang problems. Increases in the number of gang \n     localities were paralleled by increases in the proportions \n     and populations of localities reporting gang problems. There \n     was a shift in regions contains larger numbers of gang \n     cities, with the Old South showing the most dramatic \n     increase. The size of the gang-problem localities also \n     changed, with gang problems spreading to cities, villages, \n     and counties smaller in size than at any time in the past.\n\n  And as gangs have increased, so have all forms of youth violence.\n  That is because youngsters who join gangs are much more likely to \ncommit violent crimes than similarly situated youngsters who are not in \ngangs.\n\n[[Page S8208]]\n\n  Research shows, for example, that young people who join gangs are \nfour to six times more likely to engage in criminal behavior when they \nare gang members than when they are not.\n  And it is also because gang members are responsible for a large \nproportion of violent crime. They don't just commit one violent crime \nbut many.\n  One study found, for example, that gang members, who were 14 percent \nof sample, reported committing 89 percent of all serious violent \noffenses in the area.\n  Enacting this bill would give law enforcement an important tool to \ndeter criminal gang recruitment, thus reducing gang crime.\n  The bill makes it a separate Federal crime to use a minor to commit a \nFederal violent crime, and sets penalties for doing so.\n  The penalty is twice the maximum term that would otherwise be \nauthorized for the offense or, for repeat offenders, three times the \nmaximum penalty.\n  The bill also increases the minimum penalties for persons using \nminors to distribute drugs.\n  Currently, both first-time and repeat offenders can receive a minimum \nof only a year.\n  Under the bill, a first-time offender will receive at least 3 years \nand a repeat-offender will receive at least 5 years.\n  These provisions are intended to deter gangs from recruiting \nyoungsters to commit crimes.\n  Gangs recruit minors because they know that children are often not \nfully aware of the consequences of their actions.\n  Gangs also know that, if the child is caught, he or she will probably \nreceive lighter punishment than an adult.\n  Gangs commonly start new recruits as drug lookouts or runners.\n  Once the youngsters get older, gangs encourage them to engage in more \nviolent activity.\n  And young recruits often commit violent crimes to gain the gang's \nrespect and improve their status within the gang.\n  I am very troubled by the fact that many youngsters, some barely in \ntheir teens, are lured into gangs by older children and start a life of \ncrime even before they start high school.\n  One study of eighth graders in 11 cities, found that 9 percent were \ncurrently gang members and 17 percent said that they had belonged to a \ngang at some point in their lives.\n  According to California law enforcement, the average age of a new \ngang recruit in Los Angeles is 11, in San Diego 12-15, and in San \nFrancisco 15.\n  In Alabama, it is 12-14. In Virginia, it is 13. In Ohio, it is 16.\n  In gangs such as the Latin Kings, babies of gang members are \nconsidered gang members from birth.\n  A South Carolina law enforcement officer told us that he recently \nlooked into the case of one six-year-old child, who was found wearing \ntypical gang attire, holding a gun and beeper, and tattooed with the \nphrase ``Thug Life.''\n  I believe that we need to punish gang recruitment of children very \nseverely. This bill would do that.\n  The bill increases the penalties for gang members who commit drug or \nviolent crimes and who use physical force to tamper with witnesses, \nvictims, or informants.\n  The bill also generally directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to \nincrease penalties for criminal street gang members who commit crimes.\n  There is a strong link between gangs and drugs. By fighting gangs, we \ncan help reduce the supply of illegal drugs in this country.\n  According to the 1999 Justice Department gang survey, almost half of \nyouth gang members sell drugs to generate profits for the gang.\n  A survey of California law enforcement by my staff found that gang \nmembers in the States' largest cities are involved in 50 to 90 percent \nof all drug offenses.\n\n  This is confirmed by gang members themselves.\n  For example, in one survey of State prison inmates who were gang \nmembers, almost 70 percent said that they had manufactured, imported, \nor sold drugs as a group.\n  Worse, the DOJ 1999 gang survey found that about 40 percent of youth \ngangs are ``drug gangs,'' that is, gangs organized specifically to \ntraffic in drugs.\n  This is an increase from the 34 percent reported for 1998. The \nincrease was particularly pronounced in rural areas.\n  There is also a close correlation between gangs and violent crimes.\n  For example, gangs commit about half of all violent crimes in \nCalifornia's major cities. In some areas of Los Angeles, such as South \nCentral and East Los Angeles, gangs account for 70-80 percent of all \nviolent crimes.\n  The increased penalties in this legislation will help reduce drug and \nviolent crimes, including threats against witnesses and informants.\n  Currently, under the Federal gang statute, 18 U.S.C. 521, gang \nmembers can only get enhanced penalties for gang crimes that involve \ndrugs or violence.\n  The penalty is up to an additional 10 years in jail.\n  This bill allows enhanced penalties for crimes that are often \ncommitted by gang members but which may not involve drugs or violence.\n  These crimes include distributing explosives, kidnapping, extortion, \nillegal gambling, money laundering, obstruction of justice, and \nillegally transporting aliens.\n  The crimes act as ``predicate'' crimes permitting an additional \ncharge of participating in a criminal gang.\n  The Federal gang statute is sort of similar in design to the criminal \nRICO statute. That statute permits an additional RICO charge where the \ndefendant, as part of his or her criminal conspiracy, commits two or \nmore predicate acts.\n  The bill ensures that, for gang offenses, offenders can get a \nsentence up to 10 years greater than the maximum term they receive for \ntheir most serious offense. They can also forfeit property derived from \nthe offense.\n  The offenses added by the bill are those commonly pursued by gangs.\n  One study of gangs in various counties, for example, found that: 44-\n67 percent of gang members reported being involved in auto theft; 34-48 \npercent in intimidating or assaulting witnesses or victims; and 4-10 \npercent in kidnapping.\n  Other studies have found that gang extortion is also common.\n  Drug gangs commonly use booby traps, that sometimes include \nexplosives, to protect their cultivation or manufacturing sites from \nlaw enforcement authorities and the public.\n  Numerous gangs illegally launder their illicit drug profits.\n  These include Russian and West African criminal gangs as well as \nstreet gangs such as the Bloods, Crips, Gangster Disciples, and Latin \nKings.\n\n  Alien smuggling and harboring is especially prevalent in San \nFrancisco, Los Angeles, Boston, and New York.\n  Among the worst offenders is the brutal Fuk Ching gang.\n  After a police crackdown in New York, law enforcement reports that \nFuk Ching began to branch out to Chicago, Maryland, and western \nPennsylvania.\n  The changes made by this legislation should help reduce drug and \nviolent crimes.\n  The Travel Act allows Federal prosecutors to charge certain \ninterstate crimes such as extortion, bribery, and arson, and for \nbusiness enterprises involving gambling, liquor, drugs, or \nprostitution.\n  This statute was passed in 1961 with Mafia-related criminal activity \nin mind.\n  This legislation amends the Travel Act to enable law enforcement to \nrespond more effectively to the growing problem of organized, highly \nsophisticated, and mobile criminal street gangs.\n  While the Travel Act currently allows law enforcement to target some \nactivities, such as drug trafficking, the list is not complete.\n  The list needs to be updated to better reflect interstate crimes \noften committed today by gang members.\n  Thus, the bill amends the Travel Act to include crimes such as drive-\nby shootings, serious assaults, and intimidating witnesses.\n  In California's largest cities, gang members commit 80-100 percent of \nall drive-by shootings and around 50 percent of violent crimes.\n  The numbers are similar for other states as well.\n  A recent survey in Illinois, for example, found that 50 percent of \nthe jurisdictions in that state face a serious problem of gang drive-by \nshootings.\n\n[[Page S8209]]\n\n  The bill also increases the maximum penalty for most violations of \nthe Travel Act from 5 years to 10 and authorizes the death penalty for \ncertain homicides that technically do not qualify as murder.\n  Defendants who commit violent crimes covered by the act or who try to \nintimidate or retaliate against witnesses can get 20 years. And, if \nthey kill someone, they can get life imprisonment or the death penalty.\n  The bill should ensure that prosecutors can use the Travel Act to act \nagainst crimes caused by the new Mafia: organized street gangs.\n  The bill would increase the penalties for using or attempting to use \nphysical force to intimidate witnesses.\n  The bill would increase the maximum punishment for this crime from 10 \nyears to 20 years.\n  The bill would also create a crime of threatening to use physical \nforce against a witness.\n  Such a threat could be punished by up to 10 years.\n  Violent crimes by gang members often go unpunished because witnesses \nare afraid that, if they testify, gangs will kill or hurt them or their \nfamilies.\n  For example, the Philadelphia deputy district attorney testified \nbefore Congress in 1997 that a very high number of the unsolved \nhomicides in Philadelphia were unsolved due to gang intimidation.\n  One study found that intimidation of victims and witnesses was a \nmajor problem for 40-50 percent of prosecutors.\n  A similar study determined that witness intimidation occurs in at \nleast 75 percent of violent crimes in gang-dominated neighborhoods.\n  Recently, DOJ estimated that witness intimidation has been growing \nsince 1990 and is now a factor in about two-thirds of violent crimes \ncommitted in some gang-dominated neighborhoods.\n  The bill would help deter and punish victim and witness intimidation \nby gangs.\n  The bill amends several criminal statutes to address violent crimes \nfrequently or typically committed by gangs.\n  Crimes include carjacking, assault, manslaughter, racketeering, \nmurder-for-hire, and fraud against the United States.\n  These amendments make it easier for prosecutors to prove these crimes \nby eliminating or modifying the intent requirement for the crimes or by \nincreasing the penalties for violations.\n  The bill permits the Attorney General to designate high intensity \ninterstate gang activity areas, HIIGAs, and authorizes $100,000,000 for \neach of 7 years for these task forces.\n  These provisions are modeled after similar provisions creating high \nintensity drug trafficking areas, HIDTAs.\n  HIDTAs are joint efforts of local, State, and Federal law enforcement \nagencies whose leaders work together to assess regional drug threats, \ndesign strategies to combat those threats, and to develop initiatives \nto implement the strategies.\n  HIDTAs are based on an equal partnership between different law \nenforcement agencies.\n  HIDTAs integrate and synchronize efforts to reduce drug trafficking.\n  They eliminate unnecessary duplication of effort and maximize \nresources.\n  And they improve intelligence and information sharing both within and \nbetween regions.\n  HIDTAs are necessary because drug trafficking tends to be \n``headquartered'' in certain areas of the country, from which it \nspreads to other areas.\n  Moreover, drug traffickers have been highly organized and developed \nsophisticated interstate and international operations.\n  However, both of these points are true for criminal gangs generally.\n  While criminal street gangs flourish in certain urban areas such as \nLos Angeles and Chicago, they typically also use these cities as bases \nto invade more rural locales.\n  In addition, many gangs have gone from relatively disorganized groups \nof street toughs to highly disciplined, hierarchical ``corporations,'' \noften encompassing numerous jurisdictions.\n  The Gangster Disciples Nation, for example, developed a corporate \nstructure.\n  They had a chairman of the board, two boards of directors, one for \nprisons and one for streets, governors, regents, area coordinators, \nenforcers, and ``shorties,'' youth who staff drug-selling sites and \nhelp with drug deals.\n  From 1987 to 1994, this gang was responsible for killing more than \n200 people. Moreover, one-half of their arrests were for drug offenses \nand only one-third for nonlethal violence.\n  In 1996, the Gangster Disciples Nation and other Chicago-based gangs \nwere in 110 jurisdictions in 35 States.\n  Southern California-based gangs are equally well-dispersed.\n  In 1994, gangs claiming affiliation with the Bloods or Crips, both of \nwhom are based in Southern California, were in 180 jurisdictions in 42 \nstates.\n  As a result of such dispersal, violent criminal gangs can be found in \nrural areas.\n  For example, Washington State law enforcement told us about one gang \nmember that they traced from Compton, California to San Francisco, then \nto Portland, Seattle, and Billings, Montana, and finally Sioux Falls, \nSouth Dakota.\n  The Justice Department has found that, from the 1970s to the 1990s, \nthe number of small cities or towns, those with populations smaller \nthan 10,000, with gangs increased by between 15 to 39 times.\n  This is a larger relative increase than for cities with populations \nlarger than 10,000.\n  In the 1999 National Youth Gang Survey, law enforcement estimated \nthat almost 1 of every 5 of gang members in their area were migrants \nfrom another area.\n  In fact, 83 percent of respondents said that the appearance of gang \nmembers in more suburban or rural areas was caused by migration of \ngangsters from central cities.\n  Gang members even travel to countries such as Mexico and El Salvador.\n  The Logan Heights Gang in San Diego, for example, is currently \nemployed by the Arellano-Felix Cartel to help guard drug shipments in \nMexico.\n  The Logan Heights Gang has also been linked to the killing of \nCardinal Juan Pasados-Ocampo in Guadalajara in 1993.\n  As gangs have spread into rural areas and become more interstate and \ninternational, it has become more important than ever to ensure \ncoordination between local, state, and federal law enforcement to \ncombat gangs.\n  The HIDTA program has worked well and provides a good model for the \nhigh intensity interstate gang activity area program that this bill \ncreates.\n\n  I expect that the high intensity interstate gang activity area \nprogram will help reduce the gang problem in the same way that the \nHIDTA program has helped reduce the drug problem.\n  The bill also allows serious juvenile drug offenses to be Armed \nCareer Criminal Act predicates.\n  This provision ensures that career criminals do not escape higher \nsentences just because their most serious drug offenses occurred when \nthey were a juvenile.\n  Under this legislation, all armed career criminals will get up to the \nmaximum statutory maximum of 15 years in jail, time which may be not \nreduced through suspension or probation.\n  The bill makes the gang statute consistent with the Supreme Court's \nrecent opinion in Apprendi v. United States.\n  In that decision, the Supreme Court held that any fact that increases \nthe penalty for a crime beyond the statutory maximum must be treated as \nan element of the offense.\n  This decision has caused some problems for law enforcement in \nprosecuting gang crimes.\n  This is because the Federal gang statute has been treated as a \nsentence enhancement statute, not a stand-alone criminal offense \nstatute.\n  Before Apprendi, prosecutors would charge gang members with drug and \nother crimes.\n  If they were convicted, they would then ask the court to enhance the \ngang member's sentence because of his or her membership in a criminal \ngang.\n  On many occasions, this sentence enhancement would go beyond the \nstatutory maximum for the underlying offenses.\n  In light of Apprendi, this bill rewrites federal law to ensure that \nprosecutors can charge gang members for a separate offense under the \nfederal gang statute.\n\n[[Page S8210]]\n\n  In doing so, the bill also makes it easier for prosecutors to charge \ngang members by reducing the membership requirement for a criminal gang \nfrom a minimum of five members to a minimum of three members.\n  The bill authorizes $50,000,000 for 5 years to make grants to \nprosecutors' officers to combat gang crime and youth violence.\n  This money will help implement this legislation by ensuring that law \nenforcement has the money to prosecute gang members.\n  This is important legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to act quickly to pass it.\n  I would also ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and an \naccompanying section-by-section description be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1236\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

In \n     addition, if the individual who was recruited is a minor, the \n     defendant may be held liable for any costs incurred by the \n     Federal, State, or local government for housing, maintaining, \n     and treating the minor until the age of 18.\n       The term ``criminal street gang'' is amended in section 5 \n     of this bill.\n\n\n                               Section 3\n\n       Prohibits the intentional use of minors to commit a crime \n     of violence or to assist in avoiding detection or \n     apprehension for such an offense. Any first-time offender \n     shall be subject to twice the maximum term of imprisonment \n     and fine that would otherwise be authorized for the offense. \n     For any second or subsequent conviction under the section, \n     the offender is subject to three times the maximum penalty.\n\n\n                               Section 4\n\n       Amends 21 U.S.C. 861 to increase the minimum penalty to \n     three years for any first-time offender who employs or uses a \n     minor to distribute, receive, or avoid detection of a \n     controlled substance in violation of the title or title III. \n     The minimum punishment for a repeat offender is increased to \n     five years.\n\n\n                               Section 5\n\n       Amends 18 U.S.C. 521 to transform it from a penalty \n     enhancement provision to an offense and, in so doing, also \n     redefines the term ``criminal street gang'' to reduce the \n     membership requirement from ``5 or more persons'' to ``3 or \n     more persons.'' The rewriting of section 521 is in response \n     to Apprendi v. United States, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), in which \n     the Supreme Court held that any fact that increases the \n     penalty for a crime beyond the statutory maximum, other than \n     for a prior conviction, must be treated as an element of the \n     offense.\n       The proposed amendment establishes ten predicate offenses \n     in subsection c. Those offenses are: a Federal felony \n     involving a controlled substance for which the maximum \n     penalty is not less than 5 years; a Federal felony crime of \n     violence; an offense under newly created section 522; an \n     offense under section 844, (importation, manufacture, \n     distribution, and storage of explosive materials; an offense \n     under sections 875 or 876, kidnapping and extortion; an \n     offense under section 1084 or 1955, illegal gambling; an \n     offense under section 1956, money laundering, to the extent \n     it relates to an offense involving a controlled substance; an \n     offense under chapter 73 of title 18, obstruction of justice; \n     an offense under section 274(a)(1)(A), 277, or 278 of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act, illegal transportation of an \n     alien; and a conspiracy, attempt, or solicitation to commit \n     an offense described above.\n       Any person who commits one of the predicate offenses while \n     participating in a criminal street gang with the intent of \n     promoting the felonious activities of the gang, and who has \n     been convicted within the past five years of one of the \n     predicate offenses, faces an additional 10-year consecutive \n     sentence for the predicate crime. The bill also provides for \n     the forfeiture of any property derived directly or indirectly \n     from the offense.\n       The bill also amends 18 U.S.C. 3582(d) to allow the court \n     to include as part of the sentence for any person convicted \n     under section 521 or 522 an order requiring the offender \n     while in prison to not associate or communicate with a \n     specified person upon a showing of probable cause that the \n     association or communication is for the purpose of enabling \n     the offender to be engaged in illegal activity.\n\n\n                               Section 6\n\n       Amends 18 U.S.C. 1952 to increase the maximum penalty for \n     traveling in interstate or foreign commerce or using any \n     facility in interstate or foreign commerce to distribute the \n     proceeds of any unlawful activity or for promoting, managing, \n     establishing, carrying on of any unlawful activity from five \n     years to ten. In addition, the bill authorizes the death \n     penalty for any person convicted of traveling, or using any \n     facility, in foreign or interstate commerce to commit any \n     crime of violence to further an unlawful activity, if that \n     act of violence results in death. Conspiring to violate the \n     section is treated the same as an actual or attempted \n     violation.\n       The bill amends the section to include new subsection b, \n     which provides that any person who travels in interstate or \n     foreign commerce or uses any facility in interstate or\n\n[[Page S8213]]\n\n     foreign commerce with the intent to delay or influence the \n     testimony of or prevent from testifying a witness in a State \n     criminal proceeding or who seeks to cause any person to \n     destroy, alter or conceal evidence and thereafter performs, \n     or attempts or conspires to perform, an act described above \n     shall be imprisoned not more than 20 years, fined, or both, \n     and if death results, may be imprisoned for any term of years \n     or for life, or be sentenced to death.\n       The proposed section also amends redesignated subsection c \n     by amending ``unlawful activity'' to include assault with a \n     deadly weapon, assault resulting in serious bodily injury, \n     shooting at an occupied dwelling or motor vehicle, and \n     intimidation of or retaliation against a witness, \n     victim, juror, or informant.\n       Finally, the bill directs the United States Sentencing \n     Commission to amend the Federal Sentencing Guidelines to \n     provide an appropriate increase in the offense level for \n     violations of the newly amended section.\n\n\n                               Section 7\n\n       Amends 18 U.S.C. 1512 to increase the penalties for the use \n     of physical force or the threat of physical force with the \n     intent to influence, delay, or prevent the testimony of any \n     person in an official proceeding.\n       The bill increases the maximum term of imprisonment for the \n     use of physical force against any person in violation of the \n     section from 10 years to 20 years. In the case of the use of \n     the threat of physical force against any person, the \n     individual may be imprisoned for not more than ten years. \n     Identical penalties are assessed for those who conspire to \n     commit any offense under the section.\n\n\n                               Section 8\n\n       This section amends various sections of title 18 to address \n     violent offenses frequently or typically committed by gangs. \n     Most of the amendments either eliminate a mens rea \n     requirement or increase the penalty for a violation.\n       Subsection a amends 18 U.S.C. 2119 by eliminating the \n     requirement that the offender intend to cause death or \n     serious bodily harm during a carjacking in order to violate \n     the section.\n       Subsection b amends: 1. 18 U.S.C. 113(a)(3), dealing with \n     assaults within the maritime and territorial jurisdiction of \n     the United States, by striking the requirement that the \n     offender intend to do bodily harm when assaulting a person \n     with a dangerous weapon; 2. 18 U.S.C. 1112(b), dealing with \n     manslaughter within the maritime and territorial jurisdiction \n     of the United States, by increasing the maximum penalty for \n     voluntary manslaughter from ten years to twenty; 3. 18 U.S.C. \n     1153(a), which deals with offenses committed within Indian \n     country, by including within the list of offenses subject to \n     the same law and penalties as all other persons ``an offense \n     for which the maximum statutory term of imprisonment under \n     section 1363 of this title is greater than five years''; 4. \n     18 U.S.C. 1961(1)(A) by including within the definition of \n     ``racketeering activity'' the illegal activities specified in \n     the section that ``would have been chargeable'' under State \n     law ``except that the act or threat, other than gambling was \n     committed in Indian country, as defined in section 1151 of \n     this title, or in any other area of exclusive \n     Federal jurisdiction''.\n       Subsection c amends: 1. 18 U.S.C. 1958(a), dealing with \n     murder-for-hire, by bringing within the scope of the section \n     those who travel, or use any facility, in interstate or \n     foreign commerce with the intent that a felony crime of \n     violence against the person be committed in violation of the \n     laws of any State or the United States. As it currently \n     stands, the section applies only to those who intend that a \n     murder be committed; 2. 18 U.S.C. 1959, which deals with \n     violent crimes in aid of racketeering. The bill increases the \n     penalty for violating various subsections of section 1959. \n     The maximum punishment for threatening to commit a crime of \n     violence is increased from five to ten years; for attempting \n     or conspiring to commit murder or kidnapping is increased \n     from ten to twenty years; and for attempting or conspiring to \n     commit a crime involving maiming, assault with a dangerous \n     weapon, or assault resulting in serious bodily injury is \n     increased from three to ten years. The amendment also \n     incorporates the definition of ``serious bodily injury'' set \n     forth in section 2119 of the title as the term was previously \n     undefined within the section.\n       Subsection d amends 18 U.S.C. 371, dealing with \n     conspiracies to commit offenses against or to defraud the \n     United States. The bill strikes the second paragraph of \n     section 371, dealing with conspiracies involving \n     misdemeanors. A second subsection is added that provides that \n     if two or more persons conspire to commit any offense against \n     the United States, and one or more such persons acts on the \n     conspiracy, each shall be subject to the same penalties as \n     those prescribed for the most serious offense that was the \n     object of the conspiracy, except that the penalty of death \n     shall not be imposed.\n\n\n                               Section 9\n\n       Amends the term ``conviction'' in 18 U.S.C. 924(e)(2)(C), \n     part of the Armed Career Criminal Act, to include an act of \n     juvenile delinquency involving serious drug offenses.\n\n\n                               Section 10\n\n       Requires the United States Sentencing Commission to amend \n     the Federal sentencing guidelines to eliminate the policy \n     statement in section 5K2.18 dealing with sentence enhancement \n     for gang crimes. As with the amendment to 18 U.S.C. 521 in \n     section 5 of the bill, the deletion is in response to the \n     recent decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 \n     (2000).\n       Instead of the to-be-deleted and no longer appropriate \n     policy statement, the proposed amendment directs the \n     Commission to provide a base offense level for offenses \n     described in 18 U.S.C. 521 and 522 that reflects the \n     seriousness of the offenses-including an appropriate \n     enhancement for any offense described in section 521 \n     committed by a member of a criminal street gang in connection \n     with the activities of the gang. The guidelines are also to \n     include an appropriate enhancement for a person who, in \n     violating section 522, recruits, solicits, induces, \n     commands, or causes another person residing in another \n     State to be or remain a member of a criminal street gang, \n     or who crosses a State line with intent to violate section \n     522.\n\n\n                               Section 11\n\n       Permits the Attorney General to designate an area as a high \n     intensity interstate gang activity area. The Attorney General \n     makes such designation upon consultation with the Secretary \n     of the Treasury and the Governors of the appropriate States. \n     In making such designation, the Attorney General considers \n     the extent to which gangs from the area are involved in \n     interstate or international criminal activity, the extent to \n     which the area is affected by the criminal activity of gang \n     members who are located in, or have relocated from, other \n     States or foreign countries, the extent to which State and \n     local law enforcement agencies have committed resources to \n     respond to the problem of criminal gang activity in the area, \n     the extent to which a significant increase in the allocation \n     of Federal resources would enhance local response to gang-\n     related criminal activity in the area, and any other criteria \n     deemed appropriate.\n       After such designation, the Attorney General may provide \n     assistance to the area by facilitating the establishment of a \n     regional task force, consisting of Federal, State, and local \n     law enforcement, for the coordinated investigation, \n     disruption, apprehension, and prosecution of criminal \n     activities of gangs and gang members in the area. In \n     addition, the Attorney General may direct the detailing from \n     any Federal department or agency, subject to the approval of \n     the head of that department or agency of personnel to the \n     high intensity interstate gang activity area.\n       The bill authorizes $100,000,000 for each of fiscal years \n     2002 through 2008. Sixty percent of the appropriation is to \n     be used to carry out the activities described above. The \n     remainder is to be used to make grants for community-based \n     programs to provide crime prevention and intervention \n     services that are designed for gang members and at-risk youth \n     in the designated areas. The bill further requires the \n     Attorney General to ensure that not less than 10 percent of \n     the amounts spent each fiscal year are used to assist rural \n     States.\n\n\n                               Section 12\n\n       Amends the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of \n     1994, 42 U.S.C. 13862, to permit additional uses for grants \n     made by the Attorney General under the section. The \n     additional uses are: to hire additional prosecutors; to \n     provide funding to enable prosecutors to address drug, gang, \n     and youth violence problems more effectively; to provide \n     funding to assist prosecutors with funding for technology, \n     equipment, and training; and to provide funding to assist \n     prosecutors in their efforts to engage in community \n     prosecution, problem solving, and conflict resolution \n     techniques through collaborative efforts with police, school \n     officials, probation officers, social service agencies, and \n     community organizations.\n       The bill authorizes the appropriation of $50,000,000 for \n     each of fiscal years 2002 through 2006 to carry out the \n     subtitle.\n\n\n                               Section 13\n\n       Amends 18 U.S.C. 5033 so that government officials, other \n     than the arresting officer, may advise juveniles of their \n     rights, notify the Attorney General, and notify the \n     juvenile's parents of the juvenile's detainment and rights. \n     This provision clarifies a provision that has been \n     interpreted in an overly literal manner by the Ninth Circuit \n     and is now causing numerous problems for law enforcement in \n     that circuit. See United States v. Juvenile (RRA-A), 229 F.3d \n     737, 748 (9th Cir. 2000) (Trott, J., dissenting).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 1237. A bill to allow certain individuals of Japanese ancestry who \nwere brought forcibly to the United States from countries in Latin \nAmerica during World War II and were interned in the United States to \nbe provided restitution under the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Wartime Parity and \nJustice Act of 2001, the Senate companion bill to H.R. 619. Among other \nthings, the bill provides restitution to Latin Americans of Japanese \nancestry who were brought to the United States, then interned in \nImmigration and Naturalization Service camps during World War II.\n  Between December, 1941, to February, 1948, more than 2,000 men,\n\n[[Page S8214]]\n\nwomen, and children of Japanese ancestry were relocated from thirteen \nLatin American countries to the United States. During World War II, the \nUnited States had these individuals shipped to the United States to be \ntraded with the Japanese Government for American prisoners of war. Of \nthis number, approximately 800 were traded for American prisoners of \nwar. The remaining individuals were placed in internment camps \nthroughout the United States.\n  The governments of those thirteen Latin American countries cooperated \nwith the United States because they received millions of dollars in \nmonetary compensation for their assistance. Much like their Japanese \nAmerican counterparts in the United States, these people were selected \nmerely because of their ethnic origin.\n  The big difference, however, is that the United States made an effort \nto redress the wrong committed against the Japanese Americans. The \nCivil Liberties Act of 1988, signed into law by President Reagan, \nallowed for monetary compensation of $20,000 and an apology from the \nUnited States Government to all Japanese Americans interned in camps \nthroughout the country. More than 120,000 Japanese Americans were \nplaced into these internment camps because they were a ``threat'' to \nnational security. To this day, not one case of sabotage or espionage \nby Japanese Americans during World War II has been uncovered by the \nUnited States Government.\n  Japanese Latin Americans were not an eligible class under the Civil \nLiberties Act of 1988 even though they suffered under the same \nconditions experienced by their Japanese American counterparts.\n  In 1996, Japanese Latin Americans sued the United States Government \nin Mochizuki v. the United States of America. Through the settlement of \nthis case, the Japanese Latin Americans were eventually awarded $5,000 \neach, along with a letter of apology signed by President Clinton. The \nsettlement agreement explicitly allows for further action by Congress \nto fund Japanese Latin American redress, in light of the fact that \nJapanese Americans were allowed $20,000 under the Civil Liberties Act \nof 1988.\n  My bill will allow us to correct this inequity by offering $20,000 to \neligible Japanese Latin Americans. The Japanese Latin Americans who \nchose to accept their $5,000 award would be offered up to an additional \n$15,000 each. This bill would also reauthorize the educational mandate \nin the Act to continue research and education efforts, ensuring the \ninternees' experiences will be remembered, and hopefully, to prevent \nrecurrences.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself and Mr. Dayton):\n  S. 1238. A bill to promote the engagement of young Americans in the \ndemocratic process through civic education in classrooms, in service \nlearning programs, and in student leadership activities, of America's \npublic schools; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I hope that colleagues will support a \nbill I am introducing today: the Hubert H. Humphrey Civic Education \nEnhancement Act. Senator Dayton joins me as an original co-sponsor of \nthis legislation. As a co-sponsor of Senator Dodd's electoral reform \nbill, I look forward to a debate later this year on a strong electoral \nreform measure that will ensure that all Americans who wish to vote be \nable to do so easily and without facing acts of intimidation and to do \nso using equipment that ensures all votes will be counted. However, as \nwe think about reforming the methods through which our democracy is \npracticed on Election Day, we should focus attention on an issue that \narguably presents a challenge to the vibrancy of that democracy that is \neven more fundamental: the decline of young Americans' engagement in \npublic affairs. Turning the tide on political detachment by young \npersons through a new commitment to civic education in our public \nschools is the purpose of the Humphrey Act.\n  Civic knowledge, civic intellectual skills, civic participation \nskills, and civic virtue on the part of the American citizenry are all \ncrucial for the vitality of a healthy representative democracy. But, \nthere is growing evidence that many of our younger citizens are lagging \nin all of the components necessary for their effective engagement in \npublic life as they enter adulthood. Because all these skills and \nvalues are vital to effective citizenship, a multifaceted approach to \nenhancing civic education in our Nation's elementary and secondary \nschools, expressed in the Humphrey Act, is a true national priority.\n  There are numerous pieces of evidence for a crisis in civic education \nthat threatens the future vibrancy of our democracy. The most recent \nnationwide survey of incoming college freshmen conducted by the Higher \nEducation Research Institute at the University of California at Los \nAngeles reports that only 28.1 percent of the students entering college \nin the fall of 2000 reported an interest in ``keeping up to date with \npolitical affairs.'' This was the lowest level in the 35 year history \nof the survey. In 1966, 60.3 percent of students reported an interest \nin political affairs. In addition, the 1998 National Assessment of \nEducational Progress, NAEP, Civics Assessment revealed startling \nresults in terms of American students' competence in civics at grade \nlevels 4, 8, and 12. At each grade level the percentage of students \nshown to be ``Below Basic'' outnumbered the percentage in the ``At or \nabove Proficient'' and ``Advanced'' levels combined. Thirty-one percent \nof fourth-grade students, thirty percent of eighth-graders, and thirty-\nfive percent of high school seniors were ``Below Basic'' in their \ncivics achievement. And, a 1999 study published by the Lyndon B. \nJohnson School of Public Affairs at The University of Texas at Austin \nshowed that the introduction of mandated state assessments in other \nfields, but typically not in civics, has resulted in a reduction in the \namount of class time spent on civics.\n  Moreover, in the years after leaving high school, young Americans are \nbecoming less engaged in the democratic process. While 50 percent of \nAmericans between the ages of 18 and 25 voted in 1972, only 38 percent \nof that age group voted in 2000. And, according to a Harvard University \nsurvey published in 2000, 85 percent of young people now say that \nvolunteer work is better than political engagement as a way to solve \nimportant issues. It is this evidence that links this effort directly \nto any serious electoral reform effort. Therefore, it is time for a \nserious national response to all of these troubling indicators on the \ncivic health of those that we are relying upon to be thoughtful, active \ncitizens in the years ahead. The vibrancy of American elections of the \nfuture depend upon our revitalizing civic education today.\n  It is most appropriate that this legislation focused on enhancing \ncivic education would also serve as a memorial to one of the great \nMinnesotans of the twentieth century, Hubert H. Humphrey. As a \npolitical scientist, Mayor of St. Paul, United States Senator and as \nVice President of the United States, Hubert H. Humphrey exemplified \nthoroughly the application of civic knowledge, civic intellectual \nskills, civic participation skills, and civic virtue in our \nrepresentative democracy. As a teacher of political science at \nMacalester College, Hubert Humphrey made the case to students that, to \nbe effective citizens, they must be informed about the political \nprocess and be analytical about the issues of their time as they take \nstances on them. By becoming active in party politics and, eventually, \nby running for office, Humphrey was a role model of a participant in \nthe democratic experience at the local, State, and national levels. His \nbelief in promoting public service was also shown in his nonstop work, \nbeginning in his first campaign for President in 1960, in envisioning \nand supporting the Peace Corps program. Finally, Hubert Humphrey stood \nfirm in his principles on so many occasions, exemplifying the civic \nvirtue that is a crucial ingredient of complete citizenship. His moving \noratory supporting President Truman's civil rights proposals at the \n1948 Democratic National Convention helped to shift his political party \nand, eventually, the entire nation on one of the fundamental issues of \nhis time. He showed fortitude in speech after speech and vote after \nvote on the floor of this Senate in expressing his heartfelt duty to \nsupport America's neediest citizens. As he put it: ``The moral test of \ngovernment is how that\n\n[[Page S8215]]\n\ngovernment treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; \nthose who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are \nin the shadows of life, the sick, the needy and the handicapped.'' \nThere simply is no more worthy person to memorialize in a new \nsignificant national commitment to civic education than Hubert H. \nHumphrey.\n  Recognizing that there is no single answer to revitalizing civic \nengagement in young Americans, the Humphrey Act includes five sections, \neach centered on bettering a different aspect of civic education in the \nelementary and secondary schools of America. Together, these five \ncomponents of the Humphrey Act offer a thoughtful step forward in \nAmerican civic education.\n  First, in decades past, new and veteran teachers in the field of \nsocial studies had high-quality professional development opportunities \nmade available to them through programs funded by the federal \ngovernment as part of the National Defense Education Act, the Education \nProfessional Development Act, the National Science Foundation, and \nother programs designed by the Department of Education. In recent \nyears, most of these federally-funded opportunities, particularly \nhelpful for new teachers, have disappeared. Social studies teachers, \nmost of whom are now nearing retirement age, have told me how crucial \nthese programs, generally in the format of summer institutes, were in \naiding their ability to excite and inform their students about civics. \nWe need to offer the same opportunities to younger civics teachers and \nthe same benefits of good civics teachers to their students. Therefore, \nthe Humphrey Act authorizes, at $25 million annually, summer Civics \nInstitutes to promote creative curricula and pedagogy. The \nestablishment of a new set of university and college campus-based \nsummer institutes for teachers of all grades focused both on enlarging \nthe teachers' knowledge of specific content as well as helping them to \nteach civics in exciting ways is a way that the Federal Government can \nplay a role in quickly making a difference in enhancing the civics \nclassroom for America's students.\n\n  Next, when high in quality, service learning programs have been shown \nto increase student efficacy in public affairs and to enhance students' \nknowledge of how government works and how social change can be brought \nabout. For instance, according to a 1997 study, high school students \nwho participated in service learning programs have been shown to be \nmore engaged in community organizations and to vote than their \nnonparticipant counterparts 15 years after their service learning \nexperiences. I know that many of my colleagues have heard stories from \nstudents and educators engaged in service learning that add depth to \nthis data. I will recount just one description of a recent school-based \nservice learning program in Huntsville, Alabama, coordinated by the St. \nPaul-based National Youth Leadership Council, that exemplifies the \npower of service learning as a force in civic education. After the 8th \ngrade students on a field trip to a historic cemetery discovered that \nit had been ``whites only,'' a second field trip discovered the burial \nsite for the town's African-Americans in the 19th century. That \ncemetery was found to be in a deplorable state, with vandalized \nheadstones, unmarked graves, and poorly kept records. The students key \nquestion: ``What are we going to do about it?'' This led to the \ncreation of the African American History Project and any number of \nlearning experiences emanating out of this service to accurately \nrehabilitate the cemetery: Math classes platted the unmapped cemetery; \nhistory students undertook oral histories; research on those buried in \nthe cemetery took students to the court records and to the pages of a \n19th century black newspaper. One of the results of the endeavor was \nthe development of a curriculum on the history of African-Americans in \nHuntsville for third-graders by the middle-school students with the \nassistance of their teachers. In this case, service and learning were \nalmost entirely interwoven.\n  It is crucial, however, to connect service learning experiences to \nclassroom civics curriculum to long-term payoff in terms of promoting \nstudents' involvement in public affairs. The Humphrey Act would \nincrease the authorization of funds for the school-based Learn and \nServe Program and would authorize Service Learning Institutes dedicated \nto training/retraining service learning teachers. Raising the \nauthorization level of the school-based Learn and Serve program to $65 \nmillion would allow an expansion of a program for which the funding \nlevels have been flat in recent fiscal years and would enhance states \nand local districts to more sharply link service learning programs to \ncivic knowledge and engagement. Moreover, presently there is little \nmoney left for the professional development of new service learning \ninstructors, including mid-career teachers who are interested in being \nretrained in service learning. Therefore, it is important to develop a \nsummer campus-based Service Learning Institutes program, to parallel \nthe Civics Institutes program. Great strides have been made in the \nfield of service learning in recent years even with a limited federal \ninvestment; it is time for this national investment to increase in the \ninterest of the future vitality of our democracy.\n  Third, we should do more to encourage local schools' innovation in \nthe development of community service programs that explicitly link \nvolunteer activities to social change in their communities. Therefore, \nthe Humphrey Act incorporates provisions of a bill introduced in the \nHouse of Representatives by Representative Lindsey Graham to make \nspending on community service programs an allowable use of funds for \ndistricts under the ``innovative programs'' section of the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act. Specifically, it would allow local schools \nto use federal money to fund community service programs which ``train \nand mobilize young people to measurably strengthen their communities \nthrough nonviolence, responsibility, compassion, respect, and moral \ncourage.'' I applaud the philosophy and work of Do Something, an \nnational organization founded in 1993 guided by the principle that \nyoung people could change the world if they believed in themselves and \nhad the tools to take action. Using a project-centered approach, Do \nSomething recognizes young people as effective leaders and, in the \nprojects that they have promoted in hundreds of communities linking \nstudents and caring educators together, they have helped young persons \nturn their ideas into action. This section of the Humphrey Act would \npromote the work of Do Something and other local community service \nendeavors in schools all over the country.\n  Next, our Nation's public middle and high schools often miss \nopportunities to develop and support student governments that are \nviable voices for students in the operations of those schools. A 1996 \nstudy by the National Association of Secondary School Principals showed \nthat fewer than half of high school students believed that their \nstudent government ``affects decisions about co-curricular \nactivities.'' Barely one-third expressed confidence in those \ngovernments' ability to ``affect decisions about school rules.'' We \nshould also be concerned about the decline in participation in student \nleadership activities. Between 1972 and 1992, student government \nparticipation fell by 20 percent and work on student publications fell \nby 7 percent. Effective, innovative student government in which the \nrepresentatives of the students are connected to the decision-making \nprocesses in the school do more than simply enhance the experiences of \nthose who are in the elected student leadership positions. It also \nsends the message to those leaders' constituents that participation in \npolitics and government can truly make a difference in one's daily \nlife. Dynamic student leadership experiences can make a difference in \npromoting the civic education within America's middle-schools and high \nschools. Therefore, this bill develops a competitive grants program to \nprovide funding for school districts to use in strengthening student \ngovernment programs. In a similar manner, student engagement in local \nor state government activities or on school boards can be crucial in \nallowing young persons to experience first-hand early in their lives \nthat participation does indeed matter. At present, in some communities, \nhigh school students are explicitly involved in the activities of city \ngovernment and school boards; we should do all we can to make that more \ncommon. The grant programs in this\n\n[[Page S8216]]\n\nportion of the Humphrey Act, therefore, also may be used to develop \ninnovative programs for student engagement in governmental activities.\n  Finally, while a variety of civics education enhancement programs \nhave been implemented through Federal Government efforts and at the \nstate and local level, no comprehensive, national research exists on \nthe short- and long-term efficacy of such programs in encouraging civic \nknowledge and other learning or in promoting civic engagement. This \ncontrasts with the extensive research on the effectiveness of different \napproaches to the teaching of reading and mathematics that has driven \ndecisions about curricula in those fields. Therefore, the final section \nof the legislation authorizes the Department of Education's Office of \nEducational Research and Improvement, OERI, to carry out an extensive \nfive-year research project on the frequency and efficacy of different \napproaches employed in civic education, with attention given to their \neffectiveness with different subgroups of students. These include \ntraditional classroom-based civics education, the federally-funded ``We \nthe People . . . the Citizen and the Constitution'' curricular program, \nexperiential learning programs such as the Close Up program, service \nlearning, student government, as well as more innovative programs such \nas the ``public works'' approach to civic engagement, designed by the \nHubert Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs at the University of \nMinnesota, that involve work on common projects of civic benefit with a \nfocus on bringing together individuals with ideological, cultural, \nracial, income, and other differences in carrying out the project. So \nthat we make wise curricular and funding decisions in the future we \nneed to know which approaches, and combinations of approaches, to civic \neducation are the most effective in achieving the outcomes we expect.\n  We should celebrate the efforts of all who have been involved in the \ncivic education of America's students. This bill does not denigrate \ntheir efforts. But, because the engagement in public affairs by our \nyoung people is so important for the long-term health of our democracy, \nit is time to take a step forward in establishing a comprehensive new \nfederal commitment to civic education. The Humphrey Civic Education \nEnhancement Act combines new commitments to the professional \ndevelopment of civics teachers, an increase in funding for school-based \nservice learning and the professional development of service learning \nteachers, local innovation in community service programs in schools, \nand an encouragement of a revitalized student involvement in student \nleadership programs and in local government. I am proud that a broad \nrange of organizations recognize the need for this legislation and have \nendorsed this bill. These include the National Council of the Social \nStudies, the State Education Agency K-12 Service-Learning Network, the \nNational Youth Leadership Council, Do Something, the National Community \nService Coalition, Earth Force, Youth Service America, the American \nYouth Policy Forum, the National Association of Secondary School \nPrincipals, and the National Association of Student Councils.\n  Hubert Humphrey said, ``It is not enough to merely defend democracy. \nTo defend it may be to lose it; to extend it is to strengthen it. \nDemocracy is not property; it is an idea.'' Let us extend democracy \nand, in so doing, create a new generation of civic engagement. I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to memorialize Hubert H. Humphrey and his \nlife of civic engagement with the passage of this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HAGEL (for himself, Mr. Ensign, and Mr. Lugar):\n  S. 1239.

A bill to provide for the acquisition of land and \nconstruction of an interagency administrative and visitor facility at \nthe entrance to American Fork Canyon, Utah, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Timpanogos \nInteragency Land Exchange Act of 2001.\n  Before I explain the details of my legislation I would like to share \nwith my colleagues a bit of the area's history. So everyone understands \nthe lay of the land, Timpanogos Cave is in American Fork Canyon, which \nis a 45-50 minute drive south of Salt Lake City. Now that my colleagues \nhave a general idea of the location let me share some information on \nthe designation of the cave. After being solicited by a group of Utahns \nfamiliar with Timpanogos Cave, President Warren G. Harding, invoking \nthe Antiquities Act, designated the Timpanogos Cave National Monument \non October 14, 1922. It just so happens that today is the 77th \nanniversary of the dedication of the Timpanogos Cave National Monument. \nThe dedication took place on July 25, 1924. The Secretary of the \nInterior at that time, Hubert Work, invited a group of journalists from \nNew York City on a five week tour of the recently created national \nparks and monuments in the west. Ostensibly, the tour had been \norganized to publicize the features of the new parks of the quickly \ngrowing National Park Service. After spending over a month visiting \nNational Parks, the group arrived at Timpanogos Cave National Monument \nof the 25th of July where Mr. Alvah Davison, a noted New York \npublisher, gave the dedication speech.\n  I believe it is fitting on the 77th anniversary of the dedication of \nthe Timpanogos Cave National Monument to introduce legislation that \nwill enhance the unique visitor experience at this site. The Timpanogos \nInteragency Land Exchange Act of 2001 authorizes the exchange of 266 \nacres of United States Forest Service land for 37 acres of private \nland. This newly acquired land will serve as the site for a new visitor \ncenter and administrative offices of the Pleasant Grove Ranger district \nof the Uinta National Forest and the Timpanogos Cave National Monument. \nMy legislation also authorizes the construction of the new interagency \nfacility. This new facility, which will be located near the mouth of \nAmerican Fork Canyon in the town of Highland, UT, will not only benefit \nthe visiting public, but will also result in better coordination \nbetween the NPS and USFS.\n  The land exchange requires the Secretary of Agriculture's approval \nand must conform with the ``Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal \nLand Acquisitions.'' Furthermore, the exchange is being conducted with \na private landowner who is willing to trade his property for various \nUSFS parcels on the Uinta National Forest.\n  The necessity for this legislation is ten years overdue. The original \nvisitor center at Timpanogos Cave was built as part of the NPS's \nMission '66 program. Unfortunately it burned down in 1991. In 1992, as \nan emergency measure, the NPS began use of a 20 foot by 60 foot double-\nwide trailer to serve temporarily as a make-shift visitor center. The \ntrailer still serves today as the visitor center. The trailer is not \nsuitable for the monument's annual visitation of 125,000 people. On \nhigh visitation days the center is easily overrun by the public. \nAdditionally, the center suffers from rock-fall that has caused \nsignificant damage to the roof of the trailer and raises obvious safety \nissues.\n  The NPS will not be the only beneficiary of this new site. As I \nstated before,the Pleasant Grove Ranger District of the Uinta National \nForest will also be getting a new home. Currently, the Pleasant Grove \nRanger District is housed in a 1950's era building that was not \ndesigned for today's staffing requirements or modern day computer and \ncommunications needs. It is simply too small and too outdated. The new \nfacility will meet the space needs of the ranger district and be more \ntechnology friendly. Furthermore, the public now will be able to visit \none conveniently located office to inquire about NPS and USFS \nactivities.\n  I view the Timpanogos Interagency Land Exchange Act of 2001 as simple \nlegislation that will correct a decade old problem. I look forward to \nworking with the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources to move this \nlegislation quickly.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 1241. A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \npermit certain youth to perform certain work with wood products; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce legislation designed to permit certain youths, those exempt \nfrom attending school, between the ages of 14 and 18 to work in \nsawmills under special safety conditions and close adult supervision. I \nintroduced identical measures in the 105th and 106th Congresses. \nSimilar legislation introduced by my distinguished colleague, \nRepresentative Joseph R. Pitts, has already passed in the House twice \nbefore. I am hopeful the Senate will also enact this important issue.\n  As the former Chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services and \nEducation Appropriations Subcommittee, I have strongly supported \nincreased funding for the enforcement of the important child safety \nprotections contained in the Fair Labor Standards Act. I also believe, \nhowever, that accommodation must be made for youths who are exempt from \ncompulsory school-attendance laws after the eighth grade. It is \nextremely important that youths who are exempt from attending school be \nprovided with access to jobs and apprenticeships in areas that offer \nemployment where they live.\n  The need for access to popular trades is demonstrated by the Amish \ncommunity. In 1998, I toured an Amish sawmill in Lancaster County, PA, \nand had the opportunity to meet with some of my Amish constituency. In \nDecember 2000, Representative Pitts and I held a meeting in Gap, PA, \nwith over 20 members of the Amish community to hear their concerns on \nthis issue. On May 3, 2001, I chaired a hearing of the Labor, Health \nand Human Services and Education Appropriations Subcommittee to examine \nthese issues.\n  At the hearing the Amish explained that while they once made their \nliving almost entirely by farming, they have increasingly had to expand \ninto other occupations as farmland has disappeared in many areas due to \npressure from development. As a result, many of the Amish have come to \nrely more and more on work in sawmills to make their living. The Amish \nculture expects youth, upon the completion of their education at the \nage of 14, to begin to learn a trade that will enable them to become \nproductive members of society. In many areas, work in sawmills is one \nof the major occupations available for the Amish, whose belief system \nlimits the types of jobs they may hold. Unfortunately, these youths are \ncurrently prohibited by law from employment in this industry until they \nreach the age of 18. This prohibition threatens both the religion and \nlifestyle of the Amish.\n  Under my legislation, youths would not be allowed to operate power \nmachinery, but would be restricted to performing activities such as \nsweeping, stacking wood, and writing orders. My legislation requires \nthat the youths must be protected from wood particles or flying debris \nand wear protective equipment, all while under strict adult \nsupervision. The Department of Labor must monitor these safeguards to \ninsure that they are enforced.\n  The Department of Justice has raised serious concerns under the \nEstablishment Clause with the House legislation. The House measure \nconferred benefits only to a youth who is a ``member of a religious \nsect or division thereof whose established teachings do not permit \nformal education beyond the eighth grade.'' By conferring the \n``benefit'' of working in a sawmill only to the adherents of certain \nreligions, the\n\n[[Page S8223]]\n\nDepartment argues that the bill appears to impermissibly favor religion \nto ``irreligion.'' In drafting my legislation, I attempted to overcome \nsuch an objection by conferring permission to work in sawmills to all \nyouths who ``are exempted from compulsory education laws after the \neighth grade.'' Indeed, I think a broader focus is necessary to create \na sufficient range of vocational opportunities for all youth who are \nlegally out of school and in need of vocational opportunities.\n  I also believe that the logic of the Supreme Court's 1972 decision in \nWisconsin v. Yoder supports my bill. In Yoder, the Court held that \nWisconsin's compulsory school attendance law requiring children to \nattend school until the age of 16 violated the Free Exercise Clause. \nThe Court found that the Wisconsin law imposed a substantial burden on \nthe free exercise of religion by the Amish since attending school \nbeyond the eighth grade ``contravenes the basic religious tenets and \npractices of the Amish faith.'' I believe a similar argument can be \nmade with respect to Amish youth working in sawmills. As their \npopulation grows and their subsistence through an agricultural way of \nlife decreases, trades such as sawmills become more and more crucial to \nthe continuation of their lifestyle. Barring youths from the sawmills \ndenies these youths the very vocational training and path to self-\nreliance that was central to the Yoder Court's holding that the Amish \ndo not need the final two years of public education.\n  I offer my legislation with the hope that my colleagues will work \nwith me to provide relief for the Amish community. I am pleased to have \nreceived a commitment on the Senate floor from Senator Kennedy, \nChairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, to \nhold a hearing on this issue, and I urge the timely consideration of my \nbill by the full Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Reid, Mr. Nelson \n        of Florida, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Burns):\n  S. 1243. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to treat \nspaceports like airports under the exempt facility bond rules; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I am introducing with my colleagues, \nSenators Murkowski, Reid of Nevada, Nelson of Florida, Inhofe, Warner \nand Burns legislation entitled the Spaceport Equality Act.\n  Currently airports, high speed rail, seaports, mass transit, and \nother transportation projects can raise money through the issuance of \ntax-exempt bonds. The Spaceport Equality Act amends the Internal \nRevenue Code to clarify that spaceports enjoy the same favorable tax \ntreatment.\n  The U.S. aerospace industry manufactures nearly 70 percent of the \nworld's satellites, but only 40 percent of the satellites that enter \nthe atmosphere are launched by this country. Our Nation's spaceports \nare a vital component of the infrastructure needed to expand and \nenhance the U.S. role in the international space arena. The Spaceport \nEquality Act is an important step in increasing our competitive \nposition in this emerging industry.\n  This bill will stimulate investment in expanding and modernizing our \nNation's space launch facilities by lowering the cost of financing \nspaceport construction and renovation. Upon enactment, the bill will \nincrease U.S. launch capacity, and enhance both our economic and \nnational security.\n  The commercial space market is expected to become increasingly more \ncompetitive in the next decade. The ability to have a robust space \nlaunch capability is in our best interests economically as well as \nstrategically.\n  My proposal does not provide direct Federal spending to our \ncommercial space transportation industry. Instead, it creates the \nconditions necessary to stimulate private sector capital investment in \ninfrastructure. This bill offers Congress the chance to help open a new \nage to space, where the States and local communities can themselves \ntake part in space transportation.\n  To be state of the art in space requires state of the art financing \non the ground. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join us in this \nimportant effort by co-sponsoring this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a short summary \nof the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1243\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Spaceport Equality Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SPACEPORTS TREATED LIKE AIRPORTS UNDER EXEMPT \n                   FACILITY BOND RULES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Paragraph (1) of section 142(a) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to exempt facility \n     bonds) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(1) airports and spaceports,''.\n       (b) Treatment of Ground Leases.--Paragraph (1) of section \n     142(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to \n     certain facilities must be governmentally owned) is amended \n     by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(C) Special rule for spaceport ground leases.--For \n     purposes of subparagraph (A), spaceport property which is \n     located on land owned by the United States and which is used \n     by a governmental unit pursuant to a lease (as defined in \n     section 168(h)(7)) from the United States shall be treated as \n     owned by such unit if--\n       ``(i) the lease term (within the meaning of section \n     168(i)(3)) is at least 15 years, and\n       ``(ii) such unit would be treated as owning such property \n     if such lease term were equal to the useful life of such \n     property.''.\n       (c) Definition of Spaceport.--Section 142 of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new subsection:\n       ``(l) Spaceport.--\n       ``(1) In general.--For purposes of subsection (a)(1), the \n     term `spaceport' means--\n       ``(A) any facility directly related and essential to \n     servicing spacecraft, enabling spacecraft to launch or \n     reenter, or transferring passengers or space cargo to or from \n     spacecraft, but only if such facility is located at, or in \n     close proximity to, the launch site or reentry site, and\n       ``(B) any other functionally related and subordinate \n     facility at or adjacent to the launch site or reentry site at \n     which launch services or reentry services are provided, \n     including a launch control center, repair shop, maintenance \n     or overhaul facility, and rocket assembly facility.\n       ``(2) Additional terms.--For purposes of paragraph (1)--\n       ``(A) Space cargo.--The term `space cargo' includes \n     satellites, scientific experiments, other property \n     transported into space, and any other type of payload, \n     whether or not such property returns from space.\n       ``(B) Spacecraft.--The term `spacecraft' means a launch \n     vehicle or a reentry vehicle.\n       ``(C) Other terms.--The terms `launch', `launch site', \n     `launch services', `launch vehicle', `payload', `reenter', \n     `reentry services', `reentry site', and `reentry vehicle' \n     shall have the respective meanings given to such terms by \n     section 70102 of title 49, United States Code (as in effect \n     on the date of enactment of this subsection).''.\n       (d) Exception From Federally Guaranteed Bond Prohibition.--\n     Paragraph (3) of section 149(b) of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 (relating to exceptions) is amended by adding at the \n     end the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(E) Exception for spaceports.--Paragraph (1) shall not \n     apply to any exempt facility bond issued as part of an issue \n     described in paragraph (1) of section 142(a) to provide a \n     spaceport in situations where--\n       ``(i) the guarantee of the United States (or an agency or \n     instrumentality thereof) is the result of payment of rent, \n     user fees, or other charges by the United States (or any \n     agency or instrumentality thereof), and\n       ``(ii) the payment of the rent, user fees, or other charges \n     is for, and conditioned upon, the use of the spaceport by the \n     United States (or any agency or instrumentality thereof).''.\n       (e) Conforming Amendment.--The heading for section 142(c) \n     of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by inserting \n     ``, Spaceports,'' after ``Airports''.\n       (f) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to bonds issued after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                       The Spaceport Equality Act\n\n\n                       Description of Present Law\n\n       Present law allows exempt facility bonds to be issued to \n     finance certain transportation facilities, such as airports, \n     docks and wharves, mass commuting facilities, high speed \n     intercity rail facilities, and storage or training facilities \n     directly related to the foregoing. Except for high-speed \n     intercity rail facilities, these facilities must be owned by \n     a governmental unit to be eligible for such financing. Exempt \n     facility bonds for airports, docks and wharves, and \n     governmentally-owned, high-speed intercity rail facilities \n     are not subject to the private activity bond volume cap. Only \n     25% of the exempt facility bonds for a privately-owned, high-\n     speed intercity rail facility require private activity bond \n     volume cap.\n       Airports.--Treasury Department regulations provide that \n     airport property eligible for exempt facility bond financing \n     includes facilities that are directly related and essential \n     to the servicing of aircraft, enabling aircraft to take off \n     and land, and transferring\n\n[[Page S8224]]\n\n     passengers or cargo to or from aircraft, but only if the \n     facilities are located at, or in close proximity to, the \n     take-off and landing area. The regulations also provide that \n     airports include other functionally related and subordinate \n     facilities at or adjacent to the airport, such as terminals, \n     hangers, loading facilities, repair shops, maintenance or \n     overhaul facilities, and land-based navigational aids such as \n     radar installations. Facilities, the primary function of \n     which is manufacturing rather than transportation, are not \n     eligible for exempt facility bond financing.\n       Public Use Requirement.--Treasury Department regulations \n     provide generally that, in order to qualify as an exempt \n     facility, the facility must serve or be available on a \n     regular basis for general public use, or be part of a \n     facility so used, as contrasted with similar types of \n     facilities that are constructed for the exclusive use of a \n     limited number of nongovernmental persons in their trades or \n     businesses. For example, a private dock or wharf leased to \n     and serving only a single manufacturing plant would not \n     qualify as a facility for general public use, but a hangar or \n     repair facility at a municipal airport, or a dock or a wharf, \n     would qualify even if it is leased or permanently assigned to \n     a single nongovernmental person provided that person directly \n     serves the general public, such as a common passenger carrier \n     or freight carrier. Certain facilities, such as sewage and \n     solid waste disposal facilities, are treated in all events as \n     serving a general public use although they may be part of a \n     nonpublic facility, such as a manufacturing facility used in \n     the trade of business of a single manufacturer.\n       Federally Guaranteed Bonds.--Bonds directly or indirectly \n     guaranteed by the United States (or any agency or instrument \n     thereof) are not tax-exempt. The Treasury Department has not \n     issued detailed regulations interpreting the prohibition of \n     federal guarantees and the scope of the prohibition is \n     unclear.\n\n\n                 Explanation of Spaceport Equality Act\n\n       The Spaceport Equality Act clarifies that spaceports are \n     eligible for exempt facility bond financing to the same \n     extent as airports. As in the case of airports, the \n     facilities must be owned by a governmental unit to be \n     eligible for such financing.\n       The term ``spaceport'' includes facilities directly related \n     and essential to servicing spacecraft, enabling spacecraft to \n     take off or land, and transferring passengers or space cargo \n     door from spacecraft, but only if the facilities are located \n     at, or in close proximity to, the launch site. Space cargo \n     includes satellites, scientific experiments, and other \n     property transported into space, whether or not the cargo \n     will return from space. The term ``spaceport'' also includes \n     other functionally related and subordinate facilities at or \n     adjacent to the spaceport, such as launch control centers, \n     repair shops, maintenance or overhaul facilities, and rocket \n     assembly facilities that must be located at or adjacent to \n     the launch site. The term ``spaceport'' further includes \n     storage facilities directly related to any governmentally-\n     owned spaceport (including a spaceport owned by the U.S. \n     Government.\n       It is intended that spaceports shall be treated in all \n     respects as serving the general public and will therefore \n     satisfy the public use requirements contained in present \n     Treasury Department regulations. It is also intended that the \n     use of spaceport facilities by the federal government will \n     not prevent the spaceport facilities from being treated as \n     serving the general public, will not prevent the spaceport \n     from being treated as owned by a government unit, and will \n     not otherwise render such facilities ineligible for exempt \n     facility bond financing. In addition, the amendment specifies \n     that payment by the federal government of rent, user fees, or \n     other charges for the use of spaceport property will not be \n     taken into account in determining whether bonds for \n     spacesports are federally guaranteed as long as such payments \n     are conditioned on the use of such property and not payable \n     unconditionally and in all events.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. \n        Chafee, Ms. Collins, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Breaux, Mr. \n        Torricelli, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Graham, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Kerry, \n        Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Corzine).\n  S. 1244. A bill to amend titles XIX and XXI of the Social Security \nAct to provide for FamilyCare coverage for parents of enrolled \nchildren, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it's a privilege to join Senator Snowe \nand Senator Rockefeller and many others in introducing the Family Care \nAct of 2001 to expand health coverage to millions of families.\n  Families across America get up every day, go to work, play by the \nrules, and still cannot afford the health insurance they need to stay \nhealthy and protect themselves when serious illness strikes. Family \nCare is a practical, common-sense solution for millions of hardworking \nfamilies, and it deserves to be a national priority.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will provide health \ninsurance to millions of Americans. And it does so without creating a \nnew program or a new bureaucracy. It builds on the existing Children's \nHealth Insurance Program. By allowing children and their parents to be \ncovered, we can reduce the number of uninsured Americans by one-third.\n  Four years ago we worked together, Republicans and Democrats, to \nexpand coverage to uninsured children in families whose income is too \nhigh for Medicaid but not enough to afford private health insurance. \nThe Children's Health Insurance Program has already brought quality \nhealth care to over 3 million children, and many more are eligible.\n  Our bill is an important step to build on that initiative. Over 80 \npercent of children who are uninsured or enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP \nhave uninsured parents. Expanding CHIP to cover parents as well as \nchildren will make a huge difference to millions of working families.\n  We also need to do more to help sign up the large number of children \nwho are already eligible for health coverage but have never enrolled. \nThe numbers are dramatic. Ninety-five percent of low-income uninsured \nchildren are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP. If we can sign up these \nchildren, we can give almost every child in America a real chance at a \nhealthy childhood.\n  Our legislation includes steps to make it easier for families to \nregister and stay covered. Patients will enroll, and will enroll their \nchildren, too.\n  We also know that many families lose coverage because complicated \napplications and burdensome requirements make it hard to stay insured. \nOur bill sees that families will have a simple application and that \nthey won't have to enroll over and over again. It also makes sure that \nfamilies they aren't excluded because that have simple assets like \ncars.\n  I am pleased that this legislation has so much support in the Finance \nCommittee. In addition to Senator Snowe, we have the support of every \nsingle Democrat in that committee. I hope that we can move on this \nlegislation before the August recess.\n  These are long-overdue steps to give millions more Americans the \nhealth coverage they deserve. It's a significant step toward the day \nwhen every man, woman and child in America has affordable health \ncoverage. The Nation needs both, and I'm hopeful that Congress will \nenact both as soon as possible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and letters of \nsupport be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1244\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

We are pleased that you and your colleagues have \n     put this measure forward and we look forward to working with \n     you in the coming months to ensure that the bill's provisions \n     become law.\n       In addition to the important expansion of coverage options \n     under Medicaid and SCHIP, including those for pregnant women \n     and immigrant children and their families, we strongly \n     endorse the numerous components of the legislation that will \n     make getting enrolled, and staying enrolled, in Medicaid and \n     SCHIP simpler for children and families. By expanding the \n     types of entities that are able to perform presumptive \n     eligibility determinations, consolidating application and \n     enrollment procedures and providing for automatic \n     redetermination of eligibility, states can ensure that \n     children and families have seamless access to quality care.\n       We appreciate your continued attention to the health care \n     needs of our nation's children. If we can be of assistance in \n     your efforts, please do not hesitate to contact me at (202) \n     347-8600.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Graham Newson,\n\n                                                         Director,\n     Department of Federal Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                American Hospital Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 24, 2001.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Chairman, Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n         Pensions, U.S. Senate, Russell Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Kennedy: The American Hospital Association \n     (AHA), which represents 5,000 hospitals, health care systems, \n     networks, and other providers of care, shares your goal of \n     expanding access to health care coverage for the nation's \n     over 42 million uninsured Americans. As you know, eight out \n     of every 10 uninsured persons lives in a working family. Ten \n     million of the uninsured are children. The uninsured are \n     concentrated disproportionately in low-income families. And \n     while health care coverage by itself does not guarantee good \n     health or access to appropriate health services, the absence \n     of health care coverage is a major contributor to poor \n     health.\n       AHA supports an array of legislative proposals that would \n     expand coverage to low-income people, including those that \n     would build on current programs such as Medicaid and the \n     State Children's Health Insurance Program (S-CHIP), and those \n     that would use changes in the tax code to bolster coverage. \n     Therefore, AHA strongly supports the objective of your \n     bipartisan legislation, the Family Care Act of 2001, \n     sponsored with Senator Snowe. Your legislation embraces, as \n     one option, expanding state options to allow coverage of the \n     parents of children covered by S-CHIP. We support provisions \n     that would improve state options for Medicaid coverage for \n     children, pregnant women, and those making the transition \n     from welfare to work. Furthermore, we applaud your provisions \n     that would simplify applications, increased outreach \n     activities, and create state grant programs to encourage \n     market innovation in health care insurance. AHA believes \n     these are good first steps toward lowering the number of the \n     uninsured.\n       In addition to expanding public programs, AHA supports \n     other measures that utilize the tax code to make health care \n     insurance more affordable for low-income working families. \n     Toward that end, AHA also supports the bipartisan REACH Act \n     drafted by Senators Jeffords, Snowe, Frist, Chafee, Breaux, \n     Lincoln and Carper; and the bipartisan Fair Care for the \n     Uninsured Act (S. 683) sponsored by Senators Santorum and \n     Torricelli. Both of these bills would establish refundable \n     tax credits to help low-income families purchase health care \n     insurance.\n       Our nation's hospitals see every day that the absence of \n     health coverage is a significant barrier to care, reducing \n     the likelihood that people will get appropriate preventive, \n     diagnostic and chronic care. AHA supports your efforts to \n     help more low-income families to get the health care coverage \n     they need and deserve. We thank you for your leadership and \n     we look forward to working with you to advance the Family \n     Care Act of 2001.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Rick Pollack,\n     Executive Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                         Children's Hospitals,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, July 24, 2001.\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     Hon. Olympia Snowe,\n      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy and Senator Snowe: On behalf of the \n     National Association of Children's Hospitals (N.A.C.H.), \n     which represents over 100 children's hospitals nationwide, I \n     want to express our strong support for your introduction of \n     the ``FamilyCare Act of 2001.''\n       As providers of care to all children, regardless of their \n     economic status, children's hospitals devote more than 40% of \n     their patient care to children who rely on Medicaid or are \n     uninsured, and more than three-fourths of their patient-care \n     to children with chronic and congenital conditions. These \n     hospitals have extensive experience in assisting families to \n     enroll eligible children in Medicaid and SCHIP. They are \n     keenly aware of the importance of addressing the challenges \n     that states face in enrolling this often hard to reach \n     population of eligible children.\n       In particular, N.A.C.H. appreciates your efforts to \n     simplify and coordinate the application process for SCHIP and \n     Medicaid, as well as to provide new tools for states to use \n     in identifying and enrolling families. We strongly support \n     your provision guaranteeing continuous 12-month eligibility \n     for children and parents, which will address one major \n     problem in assuring coverage for eligible children.\n       N.A.C.H. also applauds your provisions that continue \n     children's coverage as the first priority of the SCHIP \n     program, including (1) requiring states to first cover \n     children up to 200% of poverty and eliminating waiting lists \n     in the SCHIP program before covering parents, and (2) \n     requiring every child who loses coverage under Medicaid or \n     SCHIP to be automatically screened for other avenues of \n     eligibility and if found eligible, enrolled immediately in \n     that program.\n       N.A.C.H. further supports your legislation's provision to \n     give states additional flexibility under SCHIP and Medicaid \n     to cover legal immigrant children. In states with high \n     proportions of uninsured children, such as California, Texas \n     and Florida, the federal government's bar on coverage of \n     legal immigrant children helps contribute to\n\n[[Page S8232]]\n\n     the fact that Hispanic children represent the highest rate of \n     uninsured children of all major racial and ethnic minority \n     groups. Your provision to ensure coverage of legal immigrant \n     children would be extremely useful in improving this \n     situation.\n       N.A.C.H. greatly appreciates your efforts to provide all \n     children with the best possible chance at starting out and \n     staying healthy. We welcome and look forward to working with \n     you to pass the ``FamilyCare Act of 2001.''\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Lawrence A. McAndrews,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               March of Dimes,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 24, 2001.\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: On behalf of more than 3 million \n     volunteers and 1600 staff members of the March of Dimes, I \n     want to commend you for introducing the ``Family Care Act of \n     2001.'' The March of Dimes is committed to increasing access \n     to appropriate and affordable health care for women, infants \n     and children and supports the targeted approach to expanding \n     the State Children's Health Insurance Program contained in \n     the Family Care proposal.\n       The ``Family Care Act of 2001'' contains a number of \n     beneficial provisions that would expand and improve SCHIP. \n     The March of Dimes strongly supports giving states the option \n     to cover low-income pregnant women in Medicaid and SCHIP \n     programs with an enhanced matching rate. We understand that \n     Family Care would allow states to cover uninsured parents of \n     children enrolled in Medicaid and SCHIP as well as uninsured \n     first-time pregnant women. SCHIP is the only major federally-\n     funded program that denies coverage to pregnant women while \n     providing coverage to their infants and children. We know \n     prenatal care improves birth outcomes. Expanding health \n     insurance coverage for low-income pregnant women has \n     bipartisan support in both the House and Senate.\n       The March of Dimes also supports Family Care provisions to \n     require automatic enrollment of children born to SCHIP \n     parents; automatic screening of every child who loses \n     coverage under Medicaid or SCHIP to determine eligibility for \n     other health programs; and distribution of information on the \n     availability of Medicaid and SCHIP through the school lunch \n     program. The March of Dimes also supports giving states the \n     option to provide Medicaid and SCHIP benefits to children and \n     pregnant women who arrived legally to the United States after \n     August 23, 1996, and to people ages 19 and 20. The National \n     Governors Association recently endorsed this proposal as part \n     of its legislation policy platform.\n       Finally, we commend you for raising issues such as the \n     elimination of assets tests in Medicaid and CHIP for parents \n     and children as well as providing for guaranteed continuous \n     12-month eligibility for parents and children enrolled in \n     Medicaid and CHIP. While controversial, we hope states would \n     voluntarily adopt these provisions which would provide the \n     kind of continuity that is so important for keeping families \n     insured.\n       We thank you for your leadership in introducing the \n     ``Family Care Act of 2001'' and are eager to work with you to \n     achieve approval of this much needed legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Anna Eleanor Roosevelt,\n       Vice Chair, Board of Trustees; Chair, National Public \n     Affairs Committee.\n     Dr. Jennifer L. Howse,\n       President.\n\n\n                              The Catholic Health Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 24, 2001.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: On behalf of the Catholic Health \n     Association of the United States (CHA), the national \n     leadership organization of more than 2,000 Catholic \n     healthcare sponsors, systems, facilities, and related \n     organizations, I write to thank you for your efforts to \n     expand health coverage for uninsured low-income families. CHA \n     shares your commitment to the goal of accessible and \n     affordable care for all, and we strongly support the ``Family \n     Care Act of 2001'' as an important step toward that goal.\n       The ``Family Care Act of 2001'' would allow states to \n     extend Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Program \n     (SCHIP) coverage to parents of children already eligible for \n     these programs. Most of these individuals are working but do \n     not have incomes sufficient to afford the high cost of \n     private insurance. Family Care is a cost-effective way to \n     address this problem. Not only would it reduce the number of \n     uninsured parents but it would also improve enrollment of \n     uninsured low-income children in Medicaid and SCHIP at a time \n     when more than 10 million children still do not have health \n     coverage. While a number of states have already initiated \n     efforts to expand SCHIP to parents and to eliminate \n     enrollment barriers, much more needs to be done. Moreover, \n     the additional funding called for in your bill is essential \n     if states are to proceed with the assurance of federal \n     support for their coverage expansion efforts.\n       We are also pleased that your bill would address gaps in \n     Medicaid and SCHIP coverage for pregnant women and legal \n     immigrants.\n       Catholic hospitals and healthcare systems provide inpatient \n     and outpatient care in 48 states and more than 360 local \n     areas. Every day we see the impact that lack of health \n     insurance has on families' access to coordinated and high-\n     quality health care. With a substantial federal surplus, \n     Congress and the administration simply must make addressing \n     this problem a national priority. We applaud your leadership \n     in introducing the ``Family Care Act of 2001'' and look \n     forward to working with you and your colleagues to advance \n     this important bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                       Rev. Michael D. Place, STD,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       Childrens Defense Fund,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 24, 2001.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: We are taking this opportunity to \n     thank you for your work on the FamilyCare Act and your \n     intention to introduce the bill in the current Congress. This \n     proposal has the strong support of the Children's Defense \n     Fund because it provides and strengthens health care coverage \n     for uninsured children and their parents. Building on the \n     successes of Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance \n     Program (CHIP), this legislation will increase coverage for \n     uninsured children, provide funding for health insurance \n     coverage for the uninsured parents of Medicaid and CHIP-\n     eligible children, and simplify the enrollment process for \n     Medicaid and CHIP to make the programs more family friendly.\n       We look forward to working with you for passage of the \n     FamilyCare Act by the Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Gregg, Haifley,\n                                  Deputy Director Health Division.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY:\n  S. 1247. A bill to establish a grant program to promote emotional and \nsocial development and school readiness; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce the Foundations \nfor Learning Act. I want to thank my son, Patrick for his leadership in \ndeveloping this legislation. This bill is an extremely important piece \nof legislation that addresses the whole child's early development.\n  There is no question that healthy emotional and social development \nare critical to school success. The development of curiosity, self-\ndirection, the ability to cooperate with peers and to exhibit self-\ncontrol are essential before a child can be ready to learn. Children \nwhose lives are threatened by socioeconomic disadvantage, violence, \nfamily disruption and diagnosed disabilities are at a severe \ndisadvantage in the classroom. There is no question these children \ncannot perform at their highest academic potential.\n  While we are all concerned about reading readiness and children's \nreadiness to learn, we cannot ignore the underlying factors that enable \nthem to learn. We know that children cannot learn when they are hungry \nor sleepy, but rarely do we stop to think about their emotional ability \nto learn. Children who are angry, afraid or cannot control their own \nemotions, or have no sense of self-direction, and ability to resolve \nconflicts with peers are not ready to learn either.\n  Last month, a national study reported that children who receive more \nthan 30 hours per week of non-parental child care exhibit higher levels \nof aggressive behavior than those who spend less than 10 hours per week \nin comparable settings. The study called national attention to the \nquality of child care that parents entrust the care of their young \nchildren to. It also rekindled the Nation's interest in the early years \nand how these years contribute to a young children's development. As we \ndebate investments in early care and education, we must not \nunderestimate the need to look at the social and emotional readiness of \nthe child that leads to later academic readiness.\n  Studies are showing that increasing numbers of children are \nunprepared to cope with the demand of school, not because they lack the \nacademic tools, but because they lack the social skills and emotional \nself-regulation necessary to succeed. In a survey of kindergarten \nteachers, 46 percent said that at least half of their class had \ndifficulty following directions, 34 percent reported half of the class \nor more had difficulty working as part of a group, and 20 percent said \nat least half of the class had\n\n[[Page S8233]]\n\nproblems with social skills. Is it a surprise that children who cannot \nfollow simple directions and get along with their peers cannot learn to \nread?\n\n  According to the latest data, 61 percent of children under age 4 are \nin regularly scheduled child care. With such a high percentage of our \nyoungest children in child care and with such certainty as we have that \nearly care and education has a long-lasting if not permanent impact on \nan individual's social and academic development, we cannot deny the \nnecessity of ensuring that those providers are equipped to work with \nall of our children including those with emotional and behavioral \nproblems.\n  Neither can we deny that the most important relationship in a child's \nlife is the one with his or her parents. It is absolutely essential to \nthe child's future success that the parent-child relationship be as \nhealthy as possible. Without a close, dependable relationship with a \nhealthy and responsible adult, a child's potential for growth could be \nseverely and permanently impaired. We must provide high quality \neducation and support not only for children but also for their parents.\n  The goal of this legislation is to enable all children to enter \nschool ready to learn by focusing on the social and emotional \ndevelopment of children ages 0-5. The bill would accomplish this by: \nproviding family support initiatives such as parent training and home \nvisitation to provide intensive early interventions to families of at-\nrisk children; providing consultations and professional development \nopportunities for child care workers and hiring of behavioral \nspecialists by early childhood service providers and the development of \ncurriculum for use in early childhood settings; providing early \nintervention services to at-risk children to promote their emotional \nand social development; and by developing community resources and \nlinkages between early childhood service providers to enhance the \nquality of services to children.\n  This bill will help communities lay the foundation for school \nreadiness by providing funding to integrate emotional and social \ndevelopment support services into early childhood programs and \nstrengthening the capacity of parents to constructively manage behavior \nproblems.\n  Study after study had shown that intervention can work to increase \nthe quality of early care and educational experiences that children \nreceive. Study after study has shown that financial resources are \nessential to improving quality of early care and education. Study after \nstudy has shown that investments in young children can save costs of \nadolescents' incarceration tomorrow. Investing in young children is \nwell worth the investment. If we're serious about adequately preparing \nour children for school and for life, we must provide communities, \nfamilies, child care providers with the necessary resources to support \nthe development of a healthy whole child.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting and pushing this \nimportant legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Reed, Mr. Jeffords, \n        Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Dayton, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, Mr. Levin, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Durbin, Ms. Stabenow, \n        Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Corzine, and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 1248. A bill to establish a National Housing Trust Fund in the \nTreasury of the United States to provide for the development of decent, \nsafe, and affordable, housing for low-income families, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, our Nation is facing an affordable housing \ncrisis. Recent changes in the housing market have limited the \navailability of affordable housing across the country while the growth \nin our economy in the last decade has dramatically increased the cost \nof housing that remains. That is why, along with sixteen cosponsors, I \nam proposing to address the severe shortage of affordable housing by \nintroducing legislation that will establish a National Affordable \nHousing Trust Fund.\n  The Affordable Housing Trust Fund that is established in this \nlegislation would create an affordable housing production program, \nensuring that new rental units are built for those who most need \nassistance extremely low-income families, including working families. \nThe goal is to create long-term affordable, mixed-income developments \nin areas with the greatest opportunities for low-income families. \nSeventy-five percent of Trust Fund assistance will be given out, based \non need, through matching grants to states. The States will allocate \nfunds on a competitive basis to projects that meet Federal \nrequirements, such as mixed-income projects and long-term \naffordability, and to address local needs. The remainder of the funding \nwill be competitively awarded by the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, HUD, to intermediaries such as the Enterprise Foundation, \nwhich will be required to leverage private funds. A portion of the \nTrust Fund will be used to promote home ownership activities for low-\nincome Americans.\n  Funding for the Trust Fund would be drawn from excess revenue \ngenerated by the Federal Housing Administration and Government National \nMortgage Administration beyond the amounts necessary to ensure their \nsafety and soundness. These Federal housing programs generate billions \nof dollars in excess income, which currently go to the general Treasury \nfor use on other Federal priorities. It is time to stop taking housing \nmoney out of housing programs. These excess funds should be used to \nhelp alleviate the current housing crisis. According to current \nprojections, approximately $5.7 billion will be available for the Trust \nFund in the first year and $2 billion will be available each year \nthereafter.\n  The need for affordable housing is great. While many Americans have \nbenefitted from the growing economy over the past decade, it has also \nfueled a dramatic increase in the cost of housing. Many working \nfamilies have been unable to keep up with these increases. HUD \nestimates that more than five million American households have what is \nconsidered ``worst case'' housing needs. Many of these families are \nspending more than half their income for housing or are living in \nseverely substandard housing. Since 1990, the number of families who \nhave ``worst case'' housing needs has increased by 12 percent, that's \n600,000 more American families that cannot afford a decent and safe \nplace to live. Recent growth in our economy also has squeezed many \nworking families out of tight housing markets across the country. On \naverage, a person needs to earn more than $11 per hour just to afford \nthe median rent on a two-bedroom apartment in the United States. There \nis not one metropolitan area in the country where a minimum wage earner \ncan afford to pay the rent for a two-bedroom apartment. This hourly \nfigure is dramatically higher in many metropolitan areas, an hourly \nwage of $22 is needed in San Francisco; $21 on Long Island; $17 in \nBoston; $16 in the D.C. area; $14 in Seattle and Chicago; and, $13 in \nAtlanta.\n  Mikala Bembery is a single mother with two boys who now lives in \nFramingham, MA. Her family's housing story is not unique for many low-\nand moderate income families in Massachusetts and across the nation. In \n1995, Mikala lost her full-time job and could not make the rent on the \nfair market apartment in which she and her children lived. While \nshe quickly got a part-time job, for the next two years, the Bembery \nfamily was forced to live with friends or in rooming houses because \nthey did not initially qualify for either a shelter or a Federal \nSection 8 subsidy. Finally, after appealing HUD's decision and months \nof delay, Mikala was given a Section 8 voucher for her family. You \nwould think that obtaining a Section 8 voucher would allow the Bembery \nfamily to find affordable housing. However, because there is a dramatic \nshortage of affordable housing in Massachusetts, it took several months \nof searching to find a new apartment for her family. Every available \napartment was viewed by hundreds of people and landlords were able to \npick and choose whom they wanted. Because of Mikala's strong work \nhistory, she and her family were finally able to move into a new \napartment two years after she lost her full time job. Although, Mikala \nkept working and her children stayed in school throughout their ordeal, \nthis family is still struggling to rebuild their lives.\n\n[[Page S8234]]\n\n  Working families in this country are increasingly finding themselves \nunable to afford housing. A person trying to live in Boston would have \nto make more than $35,000, annually, just to afford a 2-bedroom \napartment. This means teachers, janitors, social workers, police \nofficers and other full time workers may have trouble affording even a \nmodest 2-bedroom apartment.\n  At the same time, there has been a tremendous decline in the \navailable stock of affordable housing. Between 1993 and 1995, there was \na 900,000 decline in the number of affordable rental units available to \nvery low-income families. From 1996 to 1998, there was another 19 \npercent decline in the number of affordable housing units. This \namounted to a dramatic reduction of 1.3 million affordable housing \nunits available to low-income Americans. Making matters worse, many \ncurrent affordable housing providers are deciding to opt-out of their \nSection 8 contracts or are prepaying their HUD-insured mortgages. These \ndecisions have limited further the availability of affordable housing \nacross the country. Many more providers will be able to opt-out of \ntheir Section 8 contracts in the next few years, further limiting the \navailability of affordable housing in our nation. This decline has \nalready forced many working families eligible for Section 8 vouchers in \nBoston, Massachusetts to live outside the City there is no affordable \nhousing available.\n  The loss of affordable housing has exacerbated the housing crisis in \nthis country, and the Federal Government must take action. We have the \nresources, yet we are not devoting these resources to fix the problem. \nDespite the fact that more families are unable to afford housing, we \nhave decreased federal spending on critical housing programs over time. \nBetween 1978 and 1995, the number of households receiving housing \nassistance was increased by almost three million. From 1978 through \n1984, we provided an additional 230,000 families with housing \nassistance each year. This number dropped significantly to 126,000 \nadditional households each year from 1985 through 1995.\n  In 1996, this Nation's housing policy went all the way back to square \none--not only was there no increase in families receiving housing \nassistance, but the number of assisted units actually decreased. From \n1996 to 1998, the number of HUD assisted households dropped by 51,000.\n  During this time of rising rents, increased housing costs, and the \nloss of affordable housing units, it is incomprehensible that we are \nnot doing more to increase the amount of housing assistance available \nto working families. Unfortunately, President Bush and Republicans in \nthe Congress have again failed to assist working families in obtaining \ndecent affordable housing. From fiscal year 1995 to fiscal year 1999, \nRepublicans in control of the Congress diverted or rescinded more than \n$20 billion from federal housing programs for other uses.\n  This year, many Republicans in the Congress and the Bush \nAdministration have supported more than $2 billion in additional cuts \nfor the Department of Housing and Urban Development budget. These cuts \ninclude terminating the Drug Elimination Program, reducing funding for \nthe Community Development Block Grant, and funds incremental Section 8 \nvouchers for 53,500 fewer families. Thankfully, under the leadership of \nthe Democrats in the Senate and Chairman Barbara Mikulski, the worst of \nthese cuts have been restored in the Senate FY 2002 VA-HUD and \nIndependent Agencies Appropriations bill. Nevertheless, we still have \nmuch more work to do. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts is expected to \nreceive a reduction in federal assistance at a time when my State has \nthe greatest need. The future is even bleaker. These reductions at HUD \nfollow the enactment of a tax plan that will make it almost impossible \nfor any significant increases in the HUD's budget over the next decade. \nWe need to bring housing resources back up to where they belong and the \nNational Affordable Housing Trust Fund will provide desperately needed \nfunds to begin production of affordable housing in the United States. \nEnacting the Housing Trust Fund legislation is an important step in the \nright direction to add resources to housing and to help begin producing \nhousing again.\n  We can no longer ignore the lack of affordable housing, and the \nimpact it is having on families and children around the country. It is \nnot clear to me why this lack of housing has not caused more uproar. \nHow many families need to be pushed out of their homes and into the \nstreets, before action is taken. I believe it is time for our Nation to \ntake a new path, one that ensures that every American, especially our \nchildren, has the opportunity to live in decent and safe housing. \nEveryone knows that decent housing, along with neighborhood and living \nenvironment, play enormous roles in shaping young lives. Federal \nhousing assistance, has benefitted millions of low-income children \nacross the nation and has helped in developing stable home \nenvironments. However, too many children currently live in families \nthat have substandard housing or are homeless. These children are less \nlikely to do well in school and less likely to be productive citizens. \nBecause of the positive affect that this legislation would have on \nAmerica's children, the Trust Fund was included in the Act to Leave No \nChild Behind, a comprehensive proposal by the Children's Defense Fund \nto assist in the development of our Nation's children.\n  I also believe that our Nation deserves a program that would assist \nin maintaining the affordable housing stock that already exists. I am \nworking with Senator James Jeffords in developing legislation to help \npreserve our affordable housing stock. It is my hope that this \nlegislation will be taken up and passed this Congress so that we can \navoid losing any more affordable units. However, we must also focus on \nproducing additional housing, which is exactly what this Housing Trust \nFund will do.\n  I urge you to support this legislation which restores our commitment \nto providing affordable housing for all families. We can no longer turn \nour backs on those families who struggle every day just to put a roof \nover their heads.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the National \nAffordable Housing Trust Fund Act of 2001. This is an important piece \nof legislation that will help address the lack of affordable housing \navailable in our Nation today.\n  For far too long we have neglected our Nation's stock of affordable \nhousing, allowing too many properties to fall by the wayside. Between \n1995 to 1997 the nation lost 370,000 affordable rental units, nearly 5 \npercent of the housing available to low-income families. These homes \nwere lost to deterioration, demolition, or simply because landlords \nopted out of Federal programs in order to secure more lucrative rents.\n  Unfortunately these units were not replaced at a pace adequate enough \nto address the need. Our most vulnerable populations, the low-income, \nthe elderly, and working families, have been left with the difficult \ntask of finding an apartment or a house that they can afford. Roughly \nfive million households in the United States have ``worst case'' \nhousing needs. These families are spending over 50 percent of their \nincomes on rent alone, leaving precious little to put groceries on the \ntable, gas in their cars, or buy clothes for their kids.\n  In my home State of Vermont, the situation is no different. \nProduction of new housing has stalled, prices for rental units have \ndramatically increased, and rental vacancy rates are at an all time \nlow. The competition for housing, any housing at all, is so great that \nmany low and middle-income families must stay in hotels, school dorms, \nand homeless shelters until they can find a permanent place. This \nresults in a huge personal and emotional loss to the families and \ndrives up the needs for additional State and Federal social services \ndollars to help these people in their time of crisis.\n  For those fortunate enough to find an apartment available for rent, \nfew are able to afford the rent that the market demands. It is \nestimated that the average person would have to earn over $11 dollars \nper hour to afford a two bedroom apartment at the Fair Market Rent.\n  While Vermont has a dedicated community of State officials, no profit \norganizations, advocates and affordable housing developers working to \nensure\n\n[[Page S8235]]\n\nthe housing needs of our State's population are met, the resources are \nsimply not available to construct the number of units necessary to \nalleviate the problem. As a result the number of homeless families in \nthe state are rising.\n  In Chittenden County, Vermont's most populous region, the number of \nfamilies seeking services from homeless shelters has risen 400 percent \nin three years, over half of these families are working families, \nunable to afford a place to live even while holding down a job. This is \na trend we see spreading throughout the state. We cannot allow this to \ncontinue.\n  The creation of a National Affordable Housing Trust Fund will go a \nlong way to help address this situation. By harnessing revenues \ngenerated by other Federal housing programs, States, communities and \nnon-profit organizations, will be able to leverage local funds for new \nhousing construction in the most needy areas.\n  I cannot think of a time in recent history when it has been more \nimportant to reaffirm the federal government's commitment to the \nhousing needs of this country, and I am proud to rise as a cosponsor of \nthis bill. There is a long road ahead of us in our endeavor to create a \nNational Affordable Housing Trust Fund, and I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to ensure that the final product is fair and \nequitable to all regions of the country, including rural and small \nstates.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \n        Dodd, Mr. Dayton, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 1249. A bill to promote the economic security and safety of \nvictims of domestic and sexual violence, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, along with my colleagues, Senators \nMurray, Schumer, Dodd, Dayton, Clinton and Inouye, I am introducing \nlegislation that if adopted would have a most profound and even life-\nsaving effect on people who are victims of domestic and sexual violence \nand their families. It is called the Victims' Economic Security and \nSafety Act. Similar to the Battered Women's Economic Security and \nSafety Act, which I introduced last session, the legislation \nacknowledges that the impact of domestic and sexual violence extends \nfar beyond the moment the abuse occurs. It strikes at the heart of \nvictims' and their families' economic self sufficiency. As a result, \nmany victims are unable to provide for their own or their children's \nsafety. Too often they are forced to choose between protecting \nthemselves from abuse and keeping a roof over their head. This is a \nchoice that no mother should have to make. Nor should any person face \nthe double tragedy of first being abused and then losing a job, health \ninsurance or any other means of self sufficiency because they were \nabused.\n  In response to this cycle of violence and dependence, and in response \nto domestic and sexual violence's devastating impact on a victim's \nfinancial independence, this legislation would help to ensure the \neconomic security of victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and \nstalking so they are better able to provide permanent safety for \nthemselves and their children and so they are not forced, because of \neconomic dependence, to stay in an abusive relationship. In the fight \nagainst violence against women, and after the passage of the Violence \nAgainst Women Act of 2000, this legislation is a next, critical step.\n  The link between poverty and domestic and sexual abuse is clear. For \nexample, according to the United States Conference of Mayors, domestic \nviolence is the fourth leading cause of homelessness. A 2000 study \nconducted by the Manpower Research and Development Corporation of \nMinnesota's welfare program, the Minnesota Family Investment Program, \nshowed that 49 percent of single-parent long term recipients were in \nabusive relationships while they were receiving or had recently been \nreceiving MFIP benefits. A 1998 GAO study found that when compared with \nwomen who report never experiencing abuse, women who report having been \nabused experience more spells of unemployment; greater job turnover; \nand significantly higher rates of receipt of welfare, Medicaid and food \nstamps.\n  Economic dependence is a clear reason people who are in abusive \nrelationships may return to abusers or even may not be able to leave \nabusive situations in the first place. Abusers will go to great lengths \nto sabotage their partner's ability to have a job or get an education \nso that their partners will remain dependent on them. If we want \nbattered women and victims of sexual violence to be able to escape the \ndangerous, often life-threatening situations in which they are trapped, \nthey need the economic means to do so. Yet, victims of domestic and \nsexual violence face very serious challenges to self-sufficiency every \nday.\n  Multiple studies of domestic violence victims who were working while \nbeing abused found that as many as 60 percent of respondents said they \nhad been reprimanded at work for behaviors related to the abuse, such \nas being late to work, and as many as 52 percent said they had lost \ntheir jobs because of the abuse. Almost 50 percent of sexual assault \nsurvivors reported they had lost their jobs or were forced to quit in \nthe aftermath of the assaults. A study from the National WorkPlace \nResource Center on Domestic Violence found that abusive husbands and \npartners harass 74 percent of employed battered women at work.\n  The effects of this are felt not only by the victims of such abuse \nand their families, but also by employers and the nation as a whole. \nFrom the perspective of employers, a 1999 CNN report found that 37 \npercent of domestic violence victims said that domestic violence \nimpacted their ability to do their job and 24 percent said it caused \nthem to be late from work. A survey of employers confirmed this--49 \npercent of corporate executives said that domestic violence harmed \ntheir company's productivity. The Bureau of National Affairs has \nestimated that domestic violence costs employers between $3 billion and \n$5 billion in lost time and productivity each year. Ninety-four percent \nof corporate security and safety directors at companies nationwide rank \ndomestic violence as a high security concern, and homicide continues to \nbe the leading cause of death of women in the workplace. The United \nStates Department of Labor, in 2000 reported that Domestic Violence \naccounted for 27 percent of all incidents of workplace violence.\n  More generally, prior to 1994, the Congress gathered years of \ntestimony and evidence as to the negative impact of gender violence in \nthe national economy and found that gender violence costs the economy \n$10 billion per year.\n  Victims need to be able to deal with these problems without fear of \nbeing fired and without fear of losing their livelihoods and their \nchildren's livelihoods. Corporations, too, need to be able to ensure \ntheir employee's safety and productivity. That is the goal of this \nlegislation. VESSA would help break down the economic barriers that \nprevent victims from leaving their batterer or abuser, protect victims \nfrom violence in the workplace and mitigate the negative economic \neffects of violence on employers and on the national economy.\n\n  The bill would provide emergency leave for employees who need to \naddress the effects of domestic and sexual assault. That way, if a \nvictim had to go to court to get a restraining order or leave work to \nfind shelter, the victim could take limited leave without facing the \nprospect of being fired, demoted or financially penalized.\n  The bill would also extend unemployment compensation to people who \nare forced to leave their job to provide for their safety or their \nchildren's safety. As mentioned above, homicide is the leading cause of \ndeath for women in the workplace, 15 percent of these deaths are due to \ndomestic violence, 11 percent of all rapes occur at the workplace. \nThese grim statistics do not begin to address the many women that are \nphysically injured or otherwise harassed at work each day. Often, the \nonly way to escape that kind of brutal stalking is for a victim to \nleave her job so she can relocate to a safer place. In circumstances in \nwhich a victim is forced to leave a job to ensure her own safety, \nunemployment compensation should be available to her, so that she does \nnot have to make the terrible choice of risking her safety to ensure \nher livelihood.\n\n[[Page S8236]]\n\n  Further, VESSA would prohibit discrimination in employment against \nvictims because of domestic and sexual assault. Victims should not be \nfired or passed over for promotions for reasons beyond their control. \nMaintaining a victim's dependence is the insidious goal of an abuser. \nThe abuser must never be rewarded for his crime and a victim should \nnever face severe punishment because of being abused.\n  The bill would also prohibit insurance providers from discriminating \nagainst such victims because of a history of domestic and sexual \nassault. Such discrimination only forces people to lie about their \nvictimization and avoid medical treatment until it is too late. It \npunishes victims for a perpetrator's crime.\n  Finally, the bill recognizes the positive role that companies can \nplay in helping victims of domestic and sexual violence at the same \ntime that they can increase their own productivity. It would provide a \ntax credit to businesses that implement workplace safety and education \nprograms to combat violence against women.\n  For women attempting to escape a violent environment, this \nlegislation could be a lifeline. I urge that all my colleagues support \nit so that we can help ensure that no more women are forced to trade \ntheir family's personal safety for their economic livelihood. I urge \nthat my colleagues support it so that no more women have to face the \ndouble violation of first being assaulted and second losing their job \nor their self-sufficiency because of it. In what seems to many like a \nhopeless situation, we can take very strong actions to improve the \nsafety and the lives of the millions of victims of domestic and sexual \nviolence. The cycle too many people face can end. Today we have the \nopportunity not just to help victims escape violence, but also to \nprovide for so many people a light at the end of a very dark tunnel. \nToday we can give victims hope that they will not only survive, but \nthat they will be able to maintain or regain their independence and \nhave a safe, happy and productive future. I urge my colleagues to join \nme in support of this bill and to cosponsor this bill.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am proud to join with my colleagues, \nSenators Wellstone and Schumer, to introduce the Victims Economic \nSafety and Security Act, VESSA. VESSA will help our country take the \nnext step forward to protest victims of domestic violence. In 1994, our \ncountry took a dramatic step forward by passing the historic Violence \nAgainst Women Act, VAWA. This landmark legislation brought together \nsocial service providers, victim advocates, law enforcement, and the \ncourts to respond to the immediate threat of violence. VAWA has been a \nsuccess in meeting the immediate challenges. But there is still work to \nbe done.\n  Between 1993 and 1998 the average annual number of physical attacks \non intimate partners was 1,082,110. Eighty-seven percent of these were \ncommitted against women. According to recent government estimates, more \nthan 900,000 women are raped every year in the United States. Women who \nare victims of abuse are especially vulnerable to changes in \nemployment, pay, and benefits. Because of these factors they need legal \nprotection.\n  Today, it's time to take the next step. Our bill will protect victims \nwho are forced to flee their jobs. Today a woman can receive \nunemployment compensation if she leaves her job because her husband \nmust relocate. But if that same woman must leave her job because she's \nfleeing abuse, she can't receive unemployment compensation. That's \nwrong, and our bill will protect those victims.\n  Our bill will also protect victims by allowing them unpaid time to \nget the help they need. Today, a woman can use the Family Medical Leave \nAct, FMLA, to care for a sick or injured spouse. But a woman cannot use \nFMLA leave to go to court to stop abuse. Our bill will correct these \nfatal flaws.\n  Finally, our bill will protect victims of domestic violence from \ninsurance discrimination. Insurance companies have classified domestic \nviolence as a high risk behavior. That punishes women who are victims. \nOnce again, women must sacrifice their economic safety net if they \nchoose to come forward and seek help from violence. Title IV of VESSA \nwould prohibit discrimination in all lines of insurance against victims \nof domestic violence, stalking and sexual assault.\n  I am proud of the guidance we've received from advocates in crafting \nthis legislation. I want to thank them for their efforts and their \ncommitment to breaking the cycle of violence. I want to particularly \nacknowledge the efforts of the advocates in Washington State who have \nprovided invaluable input in drafting this legislation. Without the \ngrassroots support for our communities, we couldn't have passed VAWA in \nthe first place. Their support and leadership will help us take this \ncritical next step in passing VESSA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/25/senate-section/article/S8236-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8236-S8238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1063.

SHORT TITLE AND FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) This Title can be cited as the `Iraq Petroleum Import \n     Restriction Act of 2001.'\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (i) the government of the Republic of Iraq:\n       (A) has failed to comply with the terms of United Nations \n     Security Council Resolution 687 regarding unconditional Iraqi \n     acceptance of the destruction, removal, or rendering \n     harmless, under international supervision, of all nuclear, \n     chemical and biological weapons and all stocks of agents and \n     all related subsystems and components and all research, \n     development, support and manufacturing facilities, as well as \n     all ballistic missiles with a range greater than 150 \n     kilometers and related major parts, and repair and production \n     facilities and has failed to allow United Nations inspectors \n     access to sites used for the production or storage of weapons \n     of mass destruction.\n       (B) routinely contravenes the terms and conditions of UNSC \n     Resolution 661, authorizing the export of petroleum products \n     from Iraq in exchange for food, medicine and other \n     humanitarian products by conducting a routine and extensive \n     program to sell such products outside of the channels \n     established by UNSC Resolution 661 in exchange for military \n     equipment and materials to be used in pursuit of its program \n     to develop weapons of mass destruction in order to threaten \n     the United States and its allies in the Persian Gulf and \n     surrounding regions.\n       (C) has failed to adequately draw down upon the amounts \n     received in the Escrow Account established by UNSC Resolution \n     986 to purchase food, medicine and other humanitarian \n     products required by its citizens, resulting in massive \n     humanitarian suffering by the Iraqi people.\n       (D) conducts a periodic and systematic campaign to harass \n     and obstruct the enforcement of the United States and United \n     Kingdom-enforced ``No-Fly Zones'' in effect in the Republic \n     of Iraq.\n       (E) routinely manipulates the petroleum export production \n     volumes permitted under UNSC Resolution 661 in order to \n     create uncertainty in global energy markets, and therefore \n     threatens the economic security of the United States.\n       (ii) further imports of petroleum products from the \n     Republic of Iraq are inconsistent with the national security \n     and foreign policy interests of the United States and should \n     be eliminated until such time as they are not so \n     inconsistent.\n\n     SEC. 2.

TERMINATION/PRESIDENTIAL CERTIFICATION.\n\n       This Act will remain in effect until such time as the \n     President, after consultation with the relevant committees in \n     Congress, certifies to the Congress that:\n       (a) the United States is not engaged in active military \n     operations in enforcing ``No-Fly Zones'' in Iraq, supporting \n     United Nations sanctions against Iraq, preventing the \n     smuggling by of Iraqi-origin petroleum and petroleum products \n     in violation of UNSC Resolution 986, complying with United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 687 by eliminating \n     weapons of mass destruction, or otherwise preventing \n     threatening action by Iraq against the United States or its \n     allies; and\n       (b) resuming the importation of Iraqi-origin petroleum and \n     petroleum products would not be inconsistent with the \n     national security and foreign policy interests of the United \n     States.\n\n     SEC. 4. HUMANITARIAN INTERESTS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the President should \n     make all appropriate efforts to\n\n[[Page S8247]]\n\n     ensure that the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people are \n     not negatively affected by this Act, and should encourage \n     through public, private, domestic and international means the \n     direct or indirect sale, donation or other transfer to \n     appropriate non-governmental health and humanitarian \n     organizations and individuals within Iraq of food, medicine \n     and other humanitarian products.\n\n     SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       (a) ``661 Committee.'' The term 661 Committee means the \n     Security Council Committee established by UNSC Resolution \n     661, and persons acting for or on behalf of the Committee \n     under its specific delegation of authority for the relevant \n     matter or category of activity, including the overseers \n     appointed by the UN Secretary-General to examine and approve \n     agreements for purchases of petroleum and petroleum products \n     from the Government of Iraq pursuant to UNSC Resolution 986.\n       (b) ``UNSC Resolution 661.'' The term UNSC Resolution 661 \n     means United Nations Security Council Resolution No. 661, \n     adopted August 6, 1990, prohibiting certain transactions with \n     respect to Iraq and Kuwait.\n       (c) ``UNSC Resolution 986.'' The term UNSC Resolution 986 \n     means United Nations Security Council Resolution 98, adopted \n     April 14, 1995.\n\n     SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The prohibition on importation of Iraqi origin petroleum \n     and petroleum products shall be effective 30 days after \n     enactment of this Act.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 1155. Mr. BROWNBACK submitted an amendment intended to be proposed \nby him to the bill S. 723, to amend the Public Health Service Act to \nprovide for human embryonic stem cell generation and research; which \nwas referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions, as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. PROHIBITION ON HUMAN CLONING.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Human \n     Cloning Prohibition Act of 2001''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) some individuals have announced that they will attempt \n     to clone human beings using the technique known as somatic \n     cell nuclear transfer already used with limited success in \n     cloning sheep and other animals;\n       (2) nearly all scientists agree that such attempts pose a \n     massive risk of producing children who are stillborn, \n     unhealthy, or severely disabled, and considered opinion is \n     virtually unanimous that such attempts are therefore grossly \n     irresponsible and unethical;\n       (3) efforts to create human beings by cloning mark a new \n     and decisive step toward turning human reproduction into a \n     manufacturing process in which children are made in \n     laboratories to preordained specifications and, potentially, \n     in multiple copies;\n       (4) creating cloned live-born human children (sometimes \n     called ``reproductive cloning'') begins by creating cloned \n     human embryos, a process which some also propose as a way to \n     create embryos for research or as sources of cells and \n     tissues for possible treatment of other humans;\n       (5) the prospect of creating new human life solely to be \n     exploited and destroyed in this way has been condemned on \n     moral grounds by many, as displaying a profound disrespect \n     for life, and recent scientific advances indicate that there \n     are fruitful and morally unproblematic alternatives to this \n     approach;\n       (6)(A) it will be nearly impossible to ban attempts at \n     ``reproductive cloning'' once cloned human embryos are \n     available in the laboratory because--\n       (i) cloning would take place within the privacy of a \n     doctor-patient relationship;\n       (ii) the transfer of embryos to begin a pregnancy is a \n     simple procedure; and\n       (iii) any government effort to prevent the transfer of an \n     existing embryo, or to prevent birth once transfer has \n     occurred would raise substantial moral, legal, and practical \n     issues; and\n       (B) so, in order to be effective, a ban on human cloning \n     must stop the cloning process at the beginning; and\n       (7) collaborative efforts to perform human cloning are \n     conducted in ways that affect interstate and even \n     international commerce, and the legal status of cloning will \n     have a great impact on how biotechnology companies direct \n     their resources for research and development.\n       (c) Prohibition on Human Cloning.--\n       (1) In general.--Title 18, United States Code, is amended \n     by inserting after chapter 15, the following:\n\n                      ``CHAPTER 16--HUMAN CLONING\n\n``Sec.\n``301.
