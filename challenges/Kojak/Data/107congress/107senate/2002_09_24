Madam President, I want to take a moment to recognize \nthe guest Chaplain, Cecil Washington, from Topeka, KS. He has traveled \nhere with his wife Audrey to be the guest Chaplain today. She is in the \ngallery.\n  I have had the pleasure of knowing Reverend Washington for many \nyears. He has a distinguished record as not only a dedicated and caring \nminister but as a fellow traveler, helping those in need along the way \nin many places, as I have seen him do in Kansas and across the country.\n  Reverend Washington is deeply rooted in the Topeka community. He is \ncommitted to nurturing and guiding individuals in taking command and \ncontrol of their lives.\n  In fact, Reverend Washington founded and is director of the Prayers \nAnswered, Lives Saved Recovery Group, or PALS. This organization \nprovides Bible-based, Christ-centered addiction support for all \nsubstance abuse users.\n  His organization has helped countless individuals redefine their \nlives and begin to make positive life choices for themselves and their \nloved ones.\n  Reverend Washington also knows the importance of self-sufficiency. He \nis the past president of Jobs Partnership of Topeka. He has worked \ntirelessly to help see that the individuals with whom he works develop \nthe skills necessary to become self-sufficient and sustain their \nindependence.\n  In addition, Reverend Washington has served in many capacities in the \nState of Kansas. He is the past Chaplain of both the State house of \nrepresentatives and the State senate of Kansas. He has also served on a \nnumber of advisory committees and boards.\n  Currently, Reverend Washington is the pastor and founder of the New \nBeginning Missionary Baptist Church in Topeka, KS. He founded this \nchurch in March of 1998, which has a very expansive and growing \ncongregation.\n\n[[Page S9056]]\n\n  Finally, Reverend Washington is a sought-after minister, lecturer, \nand is the author of the book ``The Triple Solution For Our Double A \nProblem,'' published in 2001. It is probably a good book for everybody \nto read to get a triple solution to double problems.\n  I am proud to have him here today. As I mentioned, he is joined by \nhis wife.\n  I encourage Members of the Senate, as they come to the Chamber, if \nthey get a chance, to meet Reverend Washington. I think they will be \nblessed. He has shared quite a testimony.\n  Some of you may recognize that he used to sing with Marvin Gaye, the \nFour Tops, and the Supremes. He has a voice, as you heard, and gave \nthat for the ministry that the Lord might use it in another way. He is \nquite an individual and has been a good friend. I am glad to have him \nhere as the guest Chaplain.\n  I have a statement I ask unanimous consent be printed in the Record \nfrom Congressman Jim Ryun of the second district in Kansas, which \nserves the Topeka area.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Statement of Representative Jim Ryun of Kansas\n\n       I am pleased that Pastor Cecil Washington is with us today \n     and am grateful for his willingness to open the Senate \n     Chamber in prayer.\n       Pastor Washington is an exemplary citizen and a strong role \n     model. His contributions to the State of Kansas are \n     commendable and I applaud him for his service.\n       Pastor Washington currently is the pastor of the New \n     Beginning Baptist Church in Topeka, KS, and previously served \n     as the Chaplain of the Kansas House of Representatives. \n     Pastor Washington, thank you for being here.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of H.R. 5005, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5005) to establish the Department of Homeland \n     Security, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Lieberman amendment No. 4471, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n       Byrd amendment No. 4644 (to amendment No. 4471), to provide \n     for the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security, \n     and an orderly transfer of functions to the Directorates of \n     the Department.\n       Lieberman/McCain amendment No. 4694 (to amendment No. \n     4471), to establish the National Commission on Terrorist \n     Attacks Upon the United States.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4644\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. There are several speakers who will support my amendment, \nand each speaker has been allotted 5 minutes.\n  Will the Chair kindly remind each speaker when 4 minutes of the 5 \nhave elapsed?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair will do so.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor up to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, thank you very much.\n  I am pleased to be here to support the amendment offered by my \ncolleague, the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd. This is a very \nimportant subject, the subject of homeland security. In some areas, if \nwe make a mistake in the United States Congress, we waste money or some \nother inconvenience occurs or something important happens. But this is \na case where if we make a mistake, the safety of the American people is \nat stake. So homeland security is critically important.\n  I have watched with great interest Senator Byrd's presentation of his \namendment. Let me say this about my colleague from West Virginia. Much \nhas been said about him. Let me say today that I think he is old-\nfashioned. That is right, I think he is old-fashioned. I think he \nbrings to the floor, with this amendment, the values and virtues of \nbeing old-fashioned, saying: Yes, let's do it, but let's do it right.\n  I know that is old fashioned to some. We live in kind of a turbo-\ncharged world. We want what we want, and we want it right now. We are a \nworld of fast food, Jiffy Lube, 1-hour cleaning, and Minute Rice. We \nwant it this instant.\n  Senator Byrd brings to us a version of legislative home cooking, \nsaying: Let's put all this together the right way. Let's make sure it \nis seasoned the right way because the safety and security of this \ncountry depends on it.\n  Senator Byrd's amendment does not change the deadlines by which we \nwill provide homeland security, but he sets up weigh points by which we \ncan work with the executive branch to create this new Department of \nHomeland Security. After all, we are talking about putting 170,000 \npeople in a single agency--one single agency.\n  Some would say: Well, that is pretty easy to do. It is not easy to do \nat all. The development of a bureaucracy is always at odds and always \ncreates tension with efficiency and effectiveness. Take a look at what \nhas happened in recent days, the stories about the CIA and the FBI and \nthe kind of work that was done, or not done, with respect to what they \nknew and did not know leading up to September 11.\n\n  It is very important we have agencies put together and locked \ntogether in a way that protects this county's interests, and especially \nthat we have accountability. And that is where the Byrd amendment is so \nimportant.\n  The Byrd amendment will guarantee the accountability of all of the \nDepartment's activities because it will be assigned to one person. One \nperson will be accountable for this agency as it is constructed: the \nSecretary of Homeland Security. I think that is very important to \nunderstand.\n  We are talking about putting together agencies, such as the Coast \nGuard, the Customs Service, Border Patrol, Transportation, security, \nSecret Service. This is a very big project.\n  Now, let me talk, just for a moment, about two very specific areas I \nam concerned about because they are part and parcel of this and why it \nis so important we get it right.\n  Port security in this country, homeland security/port security: We \nare going to spend $7 to $8 billion defending against an \nintercontinental ballistic missile that is going to come in at 14,000 \nmiles an hour. People are worried a terrorist or a rogue nation is \ngoing to get ahold of an ICBM, so we will spend $7 to $8 billion on \nthat in the Defense bill this year. But it is far more likely that a \nweapon of mass destruction will come into a port, in a container, on a \ncontainer ship, and pull up to that port at 2 miles per hour.\n  We have 5.7 million containers coming into our ports every year and \n5.6 million are not inspected. Dealing with that has to be a part of \nhomeland security. That is why we have to get this right.\n  What Senator Byrd is suggesting in this amendment is not that we \nshould delay the creation of homeland security. It is that, as we move \nalong to the 13 months, we, in fact, create weigh points so we can \nmeasure what we are doing, what the President is doing, what the \nadministration is doing.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 4 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. It is very much like when you learn to fly. I learned to \nfly with a private plane once. When you fly, you fly the weigh points \nyou establish out there. This legislation says: Yes, let's have a \nHomeland Security Department. Let's meet the deadline, do it on time, \nbut let's do it right. And it establishes weigh points by which the \nCongress becomes a full partner with the administration in developing \nand making sure that we implement properly the Homeland Security \nDepartment.\n  If we make a mistake here, it is about the security of the United \nStates of America. This is not about wasting money. It is about this \ncountry's security. That is why this amendment is so important.\n  People say: Well, this amendment guts the bill coming out of the \ncommittee. It does not do anything of the sort. This bill improves it. \nAnd this bill gives Congress the role it ought to have with the \nadministration to make homeland security work for the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Maryland is recognized for up to 5 minutes.\n\n[[Page S9057]]\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I rise in support of the Byrd \namendment and urge my colleagues to back this very important amendment. \nBut I also rise to thank the very able Senator from West Virginia for \nhis firm and constant leadership on this very important issue. I \nparticularly appreciate the careful way in which he has formulated this \namendment.\n  This amendment actually would achieve the establishment of the \nDepartment within the same timeframe that is contained in the bill \nbrought from the committee.\n  The only difference is it would do it in stages and would give the \nCongress a continuing role to examine carefully how this is being done, \nhow the directorates are put into place, and would give us a better \nchance to carefully examine the full range of implications of many of \nthe important principles, including worker protections, civil \nliberties, privacy, secrecy, and which functions to transfer and how \nthey should be transferred.\n  This is an enormous undertaking. The Senator from West Virginia has \nmade a singular contribution in developing the potential ramifications \nand consequences of that with which we are dealing.\n  Senator Byrd is given to quoting Roman history. A lot of my \ncolleagues tend to consider that as interesting but not always directly \nrelevant. I disagree. I think he reaches back and draws out lessons \nwhich are of extreme importance to us. I particularly like the quote he \nused in this debate of Gaius Petronius Arbiter, who was an adviser to \nNero:\n\n       We trained hard . . . but it seems that every time we were \n     beginning to form into teams, we would be reorganized. I was \n     to learn later in life that we tend to meet any new situation \n     by reorganizing; and a wonderful method it can be for \n     creating the illusion of progress while producing confusion, \n     inefficiency, and demoralization.\n\n  What an apt quotation as we consider the important issue before us \ntoday.\n  The Baltimore Sun ran an editorial actually concluding that they were \nagainst establishing the Department of Homeland Security. Senator \nByrd's amendment does not do that. Senator Byrd is prepared to \nestablish the Department, but he wants to be very careful in how we do \nit. The Sun, in that editorial, pointed out that in trying to establish \nthis Department, we are taking the focus off the need for tighter \noversight of the Nation's security systems; that shifting 22 Federal \nagencies and 170,000 employees is a massive undertaking, and it needs \nto be done very carefully.\n  That is what the Senator from West Virginia has stressed again and \nagain. We need congressional involvement which will help to ensure that \nwe will craft the best possible legislation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 4 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Additional oversight is required in order to assure \nthat this is done in the right manner. We have agencies with multiple \nfunctions. Some relate to homeland security; some do not. How are we \ngoing to accommodate that complexity? The Byrd amendment, by requiring \nfurther timely participation of the Congress, will give us the \nopportunity for additional scrutiny to ensure that a massive \ngovernmental reorganization is done carefully and effectively. We do \nnot want to create chaos and confusion which will set us back in our \nefforts to deal with homeland security.\n  The Senator from West Virginia has underscored how carefully we did \nthe National Security Act that reorganized the Department of Defense. \nThat is not being done in this instance. I very strongly support this \namendment and urge my colleagues to back it.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Sun editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, Sept. 23, 2002]\n\n                              Boondoggled\n\n       At the risk of sounding heretical, it's time to pull the \n     plug on the plan to create a Department of Homeland Security. \n     Better yet, drive a stake through its heart.\n       Months of debate have made clear that this bureaucratic \n     boondoggle offers no promise of making the homeland more \n     secure. Worse, it takes the focus off the need for tighter \n     oversight of the nation's security systems.\n       President Bush offered the most sweeping government \n     reorganization in a half-century largely as a political and \n     public relations tactic. He was trying to counter Senate \n     Democrats who were advancing similar legislation of their \n     own.\n       He timed the unveiling of his plan to drown out the \n     testimony of FBI Agent Coleen M. Rowley, who was blowing the \n     whistle on the security failures of her hidebound agency that \n     blinded it to clues of the Sept. 11 attacks.\n       Shifting 22 federal agencies and 170,000 workers into a new \n     department will cost billions but will do nothing to solve \n     the problems Agent Rowley addressed. What's needed is greater \n     sharing, and coordination and synthesis of the security \n     information collected by the myriad agencies.\n       But this new department would not even include the FBI and \n     the CIA, which are the two premier intelligence gatherers. \n     Nor is there any guarantee that greater sharing would take \n     place between them if they were together.\n       The FBI, and Drug Enforcement Administration and the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service are already grouped \n     together in the Justice Department, and they don't have a \n     system for streamlined communications. As Agent Rowley told \n     Congress, the various offices of the FBI didn't even share \n     information with each other.\n       For the nation's security apparatus to become more \n     efficient, the psychology and culture of those competitive \n     and turf-protective agencies must change. Moving boxes around \n     on an organizational chart and creating cement edifices to \n     house them will do nothing but create more pork-barrel booty \n     for lawmakers eager for new facilities in their home states.\n       Rep. Steny H. Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat who opposes \n     creation of the department, contends the homeland security \n     oversight job could be done by upgrading the White House \n     advisor post now held by Tom Ridge. The main reason Senate \n     Democrats starting pushing the idea of a new department was \n     their frustration with Mr. Ridge's refusal to submit to their \n     questioning on the grounds that he was a confidential \n     presidential aide.\n       Few lawmakers have openly opposed this sacred cow. The \n     proposal whisked through the House in a matter of hours \n     before the summer recess. It is bogged down in the Senate \n     largely because of a partisan dispute over worker rules.\n       Mr. Bush is taking advantage of the opportunity to mow down \n     longstanding worker rights and protections, saying he needs \n     greater flexibility to hire, fire and move workers around.\n       That alone is a good reason to deep-six this plan. Civil \n     service laws may well need some updating to attract and \n     retain a quality work force. But the changes should be \n     carefully applied throughout the government to avoid creating \n     a class system in which workers at some agencies are treated \n     better than those at others.\n       This Congress will leave much unfinished business. With any \n     luck, that will include this pointless bureaucratic \n     reshuffling.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Minnesota is recognized for up to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I am pleased to support the Byrd \namendment. I thank Senator Joseph Lieberman for his fine work. He was \ntalking about a Department of Homeland Security long before the \nadministration and understood the need.\n  I believe the Byrd amendment is a key improvement.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for 10 seconds?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I want to underscore what the Senator said. Senator \nLieberman has done fine work on this legislation. It is no detraction \nfrom Senator Lieberman's fine efforts to support the Byrd amendment. In \nfact, I think the two can be perceived as being complementary.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator from Maryland. His remarks \nreinforce what all of us believe.\n  The Byrd amendment would allow for a more orderly transition of \nauthorities to a new Homeland Security Department than the underlying \nbill would otherwise provide for. I support the underlying bill, and I \ncommend the chairman of the Government Affairs Committee and others for \ntheir work on it. Long before the Administration concluded that a \nsingle new Federal department could best protect our domestic security, \nthe committee and its chairman, Senator Lieberman, developed the \nframework for such a department. Now that framework is essentially the \nbill we have before us. It is a good framework, but I believe this \namendment is a key improvement.\n  This bill authorizes the largest reorganization of Federal Government \nfunctions undertaken in half a century. While we have been debating the \nbill for several weeks, I agree with the Senator from West Virginia \nthat it is a task that warrants deliberation and care. It is the right \nof Congress to participate deeply both in creating the\n\n[[Page S9058]]\n\nframework for this needed new department, but also in overseeing key \ndetails of the transition to it. Indeed, in my view, we have not only \nthe right to participate. We have an obligation.\n  The Byrd amendment would allow immediate creation of a new Homeland \nSecurity Department. It would immediately establish the superstructure \nof the Secretary and the six directorates as outlined by the Lieberman \nsubstitute, and then require that the administration submit three \nseparate legislative proposals to transfer agencies and functions to \nthe new Department. This would give Congress the opportunity to gauge \nand modify how the new Department is being implemented, while it drafts \nlegislation to transfer additional functions and agencies and would \nprovide Congress with additional means to head off problems that \ntraditionally plague and delay massive reorganizations. What's more, \nunder the Byrd amendment, Congress would be required to act on these \nlegislative proposals within 13 months on enactment, which is roughly \nthe same time period outlined by the Lieberman plan.\n  Once the Department of Homeland Security is established, the \nSecretary will submit legislative proposals and recommendations for the \norderly transfer of agencies and functions, based on the Department's \nactual needs in carrying out its mission.\n  Through additional involvement in the implementation of agency \ntransfers and reorganizations, Congress will be able to exercise \nmeaningful oversight after the enactment of homeland security \nlegislation.\n  The Byrd amendment gives Congress a much-needed opportunity to review \nmore thoroughly the details of the reorganization during the one-year \ntransition period established in the Lieberman bill.\n  Congress can use this time to consider specific agency transfers, \nworker protection policies, new intelligence authority, and \nconstitutional protections, instead of handing off unresolved questions \nfor the President and the Secretary to answer.\n  Under the Byrd amendment, Congress will receive better information \nfrom the administration during the implementation the Lieberman bill, \nincluding the criteria used by the administration in choosing which \nagencies and functions to transfer into the Department.\n  The Byrd Amendment guides us towards a more rational approach for \nundertaking the task of creating the new department, and I support it. \nProtecting the American homeland is not just President Bush's \nresponsibility. It is our responsibility as well. And it is the \nresponsibility of future presidents and future Congresses. So we must \nmake sure that we do everything within our power now to create the very \nbest structure to protect our's and future generations.\n  As I have said, Madam President, the Byrd amendment will allow for \nthe immediate creation of a new Homeland Security Department. It is \nimportant to understand that. There is no delay, and we have the same \nbasic legislative time period of 13 months. Once the Department of \nHomeland Security is established, the Secretary will submit legislative \nproposals and recommendations for the orderly transfer of agencies and \nfunctions based on the Department's actual needs in carrying on its \nmission. Through additional involvement in the implementation of the \nagency transfers and reorganizations, Congress will be able to exercise \nmeaningful oversight after the enactment of homeland security \nlegislation.\n  That is what is so important about the Byrd amendment. It guides us \ntoward a more rational approach to the undertaking of the task of \ncreating a new Department. I support it.\n  Protecting the American homeland is not just President Bush's \nresponsibility or any President's responsibility; it is our \nresponsibility as well. It is the responsibility of future Presidents \nand future Congresses.\n  We must do everything within our power now to create the very best \nstructure to protect our future and that of our children and \ngrandchildren. I believe the Byrd amendment is a positive contribution.\n  Senator Byrd plays a key, indispensable role. Senator Byrd has been \non the floor week after week calling on all of us to exercise our \nconstitutional responsibility; talking about the importance of \nlegislative involvement, the importance of checks and balances, the \nimportance of deliberation, the importance of understanding full well \nthe consequences of what we do.\n  The Senator from West Virginia deserves a tremendous amount of credit \nfor his exceptional work as a Senator. I am very pleased to support the \namendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from California is recognized for up to 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I thank Senator Byrd for allowing me to \ntake some of this time. It is truly an honor for me to rise on behalf \nof his amendment.\n  If ever there has been a more fierce, more forthright defender of the \nConstitution and the responsibilities we have as Senators, I can think \nof none other.\n  Clearly, what we have before us is a bill crafted by Senator \nLieberman which is far better than what has come out of the House, far \nbetter than what the administration put forward. There is no question \nin my mind that Senator Lieberman has taken us forward.\n  I have to say, as someone who has been in office for many years, I \nhave come to be very skeptical about a huge reshuffling of agencies in \nGovernment and huge moves without lots of time to look at the \nramifications. My belief is that in moving so quickly to such a large \nreshuffling, we are going to bring about less accountability, not more, \nin terms of how this Government functions.\n  Senator Byrd is saying, yes, we need to create this Department. Let's \nbring forward some of the best and brightest people to begin to put it \ntogether. But let's slow down; let's take a deep breath. Let's make \nsure what we are doing is going to result in more protection for the \nAmerican people, more efficiency on behalf of these departments, not \nless.\n  I am also very concerned about the movement away from rights for \npeople who will work in this Department. Senator Lieberman has been \nvery strong, and I hope he will prevail, but I am very concerned that \nmore than 40,000 people in this new Department who do not deal directly \nwith national security--they may be, for example, a secretary, a file \nclerk, someone who works in that Department--are going to lose worker \nprotections.\n  I have said before, and I will reiterate it today, that it is a very \ncynical move, I believe a grab of power on behalf of this \nadministration, to do that to these people. Doesn't the President have \nmore things to occupy himself--and I know he does--than worrying about \nwhether a secretary or a file clerk has the ability to say to the \npeople who supervise her, through her union, through her bargaining \nunit: I need a better salary; I need better health care; explain to me \nwhat my work rules will be? I do not think any President--this one or \nany future one--should interfere with that. It is very important that \npeople have their dignity.\n  On the one hand, we have the President saying he is creating this new \nDepartment and it is so important; on the other hand, what is the first \nthing he wants to do? He wants to strip away the rights of people.\n  In California over the weekend, I spoke to working men and women, \nmaybe about a thousand of them. I pointed out to them what I have \npointed out in this Chamber--and others have pointed it out, too--that \nthe real heroes of 9/11 were not politicians, were not any Senators or \nMembers of Congress. Certainly not. And certainly not anyone sitting in \nthe Oval Office or in the Old Executive Office Building.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 4 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, do I have 1 minute remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, the real heroes of 9/11 were working men \nand women, and they did not look at their watch and say: Gee, am I \nworking overtime? They just went into those burning buildings. That is \nimportant.\n  Mr. President, when I first read the details of the President's \nHomeland Security Department proposal, I was concerned. And when the \nHouse leadership passed the President's proposal without so much as a \nsecond glance, I was dismayed.\n\n[[Page S9059]]\n\n  Instead of a creating a blueprint for enhanced domestic security and \nmore efficient Government, the President and a handful of others have \ncreated a patchwork proposal.\n  The legislation created by Senator Lieberman stands in distinct \ncontrast to the House-passed bill.\n  I believe the amendment proposed by Senator Byrd builds upon and \nstrengthens the good work of Senator Lieberman and his committee. The \nByrd amendment provides for the creation of a Department of Homeland \nSecurity--just as the Lieberman bill does. But, instead of immediately \nmoving agencies into the new Department's directorates, the \nadministration would be required to come back to Congress--and to the \nrelevant House and Senate oversight committees--with detailed \nlegislative proposals before any transition actually occurs.\n  Many questions remain unanswered about this Department of Homeland \nSecurity. The Byrd amendment would require the President and his \nadvisors to address these questions before agencies are moved into the \nnew Department.\n  If we grant the administration the statutory powers it is demanding \nwithout first passing the Byrd amendment and making it part of the \nfinal bill we send to the President, we will lose the support, I \nbelieve, to get it right.\n  The Byrd amendment would also ensure that the implementation of the \nDepartment occurs in a more thoughtful way, with more openness and less \nsecrecy.\n  I will conclude in this way: I am proud to support Senator Byrd's \namendment. I hope my colleagues will do so, too. It retains the checks \nand balances that are so important and that our Founders told us we \nmust do. It also will result in a Department that will be well thought \nout and that means it will, in fact, protect the people of this country \nin a much better way than we are being protected today.\n  I thank the Chair very much and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Washington, Ms. Cantwell, is recognized for up to 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I rise today in support of the Byrd amendment to \nensure the proper deliberation and congressional oversight in the \ncreation of the Department of Homeland Security. While I applaud the \nchairman and ranking member for working to develop changes in our \nFederal system to better harden our defenses against potential \nterrorism targets, and to create effective, integrated protections, we \nmust not allow the task of government reorganization to distract us \nfrom our vulnerabilities.\n  I think it is particularly timely that we are on the floor debating \nhow to protect ourselves from the future of any kind of 9/11 attacks \nwhile the Intelligence Committee is discussing the implications of its \nreport that demonstrates how the primary weakness is not the fact we \ndid not have a 170,000-person Federal agency.\n  Instead, we are learning that the men and women of our intelligence \ncommunity neither have the resources nor the adequate mechanisms in \nplace to communicate and to share information and to connect the dots \nbefore an attack happened.\n  I urge my colleagues to remember, while creation of a Homeland \nSecurity Department is an important step, which I believe is about \nhardening our targets and creating redundancy, we cannot ignore the \nprimary challenge we are facing in intelligence gathering.\n  Similarly, any forward movement in strengthening our homeland \nsecurity must not also distract us from our constitutionally mandated \nresponsibilities to provide the necessary oversight and adequate \ndeliberation in the enormous process of creating a new Department.\n  Make no mistake, we are currently considering some giant and \nunprecedented changes to our Federal system:\n  We are radically reshaping our Federal Government to meet new goals.\n  We are contemplating dramatic--and I think fundamentally unwise--\nchanges to important civil service laws.\n  We are deliberating substantial changes to the roles and missions of \nmany important agencies that provide important functions for our \ncountry.\n  We are even considering unprecedented changes in the relationship \nbetween Congress and the administration by handing over substantial \naspects of our constitutionally derived authority to shape and form the \nfunctions of Government.\n  Despite the enormity of this effort and its implications, some have \ncriticized the Senate for not rushing this legislation through this \nbody. I submit that these critics are wrong. We are accountable to our \nconstituents for good, thoughtful legislation--not the rate at which we \npass a bill.\n  Our Founding Fathers created an ingenious system of Government that \nstresses deliberation as the only rational method to ensure sound \ndecisionmaking.\n  This piece of legislation--perhaps the most important, wide-ranging \nlegislation that has come before the Senate in recent years--deserves \nthoughtful consideration that is absolutely necessary in putting \ntogether this new agency.\n  That is exactly what Senator Byrd is proposing that we do. I thank \nthe distinguished President pro tempore for his effort in stressing the \nimportance of this responsibility.\n  The Byrd amendment will strengthen Senator Lieberman's bill by \nsending the message that this body is committed to creating a \nDepartment of Homeland Security with a mission to protect the American \npeople and with the clear determination that we will act responsibly in \ndoing so because we want to get it right. This is critically important \nbecause it would require the implementation of the new Department to be \nconsidered by Congress.\n  The Byrd amendment ensures that the important first step is followed \nby a process that will ensure that Congress and the Nation are involved \nin asking the right questions when it comes to the specific details of \nthis reorganization, including the specific agencies and \nresponsibilities that need to be transferred, the personnel strategies \nthat need to be implemented, and a wide array of other logistical \nissues.\n  Any reorganization of this magnitude is difficult and complex. I can \ntell you, having been in the private sector, I have seen a lot of \nreorganizations in the private sector that don't go as smoothly as \npeople want them to. And on a much larger scale, this proposal, I \nbelieve, deserves the kind of attention this amendment gives it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 4 minutes.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I think there are two fundamental \nexamples in this bill. One of them is the Coast Guard--I am sure my \ncolleague from Washington will expound on this--which is being \ntransferred. The critical mission of that agency needs to be secured \nand understood as that agency is transferred. The other is an important \nopportunity within the National Institute of Standards and Technology \nwith the Computer Security Division--again, a key mission that is being \nmet for the private sector in creating technology standards that may be \ntransferred, and that mission may be lost.\n  In summary, it is critically important that we not rush to make these \nchanges and then believe we have delivered service to the American \npeople. Let them be sure we are involved in guaranteeing that this \nagency is hardening our targets and strengthening our redundancy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Washington, Mrs. \nMurray, is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, for the past several weeks we have been \ntalking about the proposal to create a Department of Homeland Security. \nI think it is very clear that there are a lot of details that still \nneed to be worked out.\n  I thank Senator Byrd for his leadership and his patience in raising \nthe questions that must be raised to improve our security and our \nsafety.\n  I want to make sure we don't just ``do something'' about security, \nbut that we do the right thing. Let's face it, it takes time to get the \nsimple things right. I have been working with the Transportation \nSecurity Administration now for months on airline security and we still \nhave not worked out all of the issues. It took a long time for us to \nget the National Guard to deploy to our northern border. In creating \nthis new Department, I want to make sure we get it right.\n\n[[Page S9060]]\n\n  Three weeks ago, I spoke on the Senate floor and raised a number of \nquestions, and at this point I am still troubled by the lack of answers \nI have received. There are many different ways to set up this \nDepartment. The President has offered one way. His proposal was created \nin a short amount of time by a few officials meeting at the White House \nin secret. We don't know how the President's proposal will balance the \nsecurity and the economic needs of the American people.\n  As I have stated before, I have two major concerns. First, we have \nnot yet figured out how to fulfill our traditional missions and the new \nsecurity missions at the same time. If we combine these various \nagencies into one massive Homeland Security Department, how are we \ngoing to meet the traditional mission?\n  Just look at the Coast Guard. Since September 11, the Coast Guard has \nshifted resources away from their traditional missions to homeland \ndefense. That is an appropriate response, but it comes at a cost. What \nthe shift in resources means to the average American is that the Coast \nGuard is now spending less time interdicting drugs and illegal \nimmigrants, enforcing fishery and marine safety laws, and protecting \nour marine environment. Yet the need for the Coast Guard to perform \nthese vital missions is as important today as it was before the attack \non our country.\n  Unfortunately, we have not figured out how to effectively carry out \nboth missions at the same time. I would like to know how one massive \nDepartment, focused primarily on security, will more effectively \naddress all of our safety and security needs.\n  Secondly, I am very concerned about how this new Department will \nfunction. The administration has asked for unprecedented power and \ncontrol over this proposed Department. The President wants to change \nthe personnel rules so he can have what he calls flexibility. From what \nI understand, the administration already has flexibility under current \nlaw.\n  In addition to dramatic new controls over workers, the administration \nwants the power to move money around without congressional input. From \nwhat I have seen so far, that is pretty scary news for families in my \nState of Washington.\n  Right now, I can fight to make sure that the needs in my State are \nbeing met. But if the administration gets this unprecedented authority, \nthen accountants in the Office of Management and Budget will decide \nwhat is important to the people in my home State. If that happens, my \nconstituents are going to lose out--at a cost to their safety and their \nsecurity.\n  So we need to better understand and define all of the missions in the \nvarious agencies. We need to make sure they continue to fulfill their \ntraditional missions. That is why I support the Byrd amendment. It will \nallow us to move forward in a pragmatic manner that allows us to do \nthis right. It is essential for our economic security and our future \nsafety.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Byrd amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Lieberman, is recognized to speak for up to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, for literally more than a year now, the bipartisan \nmembership of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee has been \nworking to strengthen our homeland security, particularly and intensely \nafter the events of September 11 which showed the extent to which the \ndisorganization of Federal homeland security activities created \nvulnerabilities of which the terrorists took advantage.\n  The amendment offered by the great Senator from West Virginia is the \nmost direct challenge the committee's work will face in this debate \nbecause it puts at issue the question not only of the approach the \ncommittee has taken in creating the Department but whether we in the \nSenate believe it is urgently necessary to have a Department of \nHomeland Security, a better organized Federal Government to protect the \nAmerican people anytime soon.\n  This amendment will retain the basic administrative structure of the \nDepartment as we have proposed, but that is all. The amendment \nnominally sets up the same six directorates as the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee proposal, but that is where the similarity ends.\n  Here is an example: We created a directorate for emergency \npreparedness and response. Our Committee proposal transfers six \ndistinct agencies, or sets of programs, and includes more than seven \npages of legislative text specifying the missions and operating \nprovisions of the directorate. The parallel provision in Senator Byrd's \namendment, section 134, found on page 37 of that amendment, consists of \nnot seven pages but seven lines of text. Three creates the directorate, \nand four authorizes an Under Secretary to run it. But that is all. No \ngoals, no missions, no duties, no programs, no personnel, no \ndirectorate in any real sense. That is the approach taken by this \namendment for all of the directorates, with the exception of \nImmigration, where the amendment does not disturb our provision to \ntransfer and restructure the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n  For example, our provisions regarding a new division of intelligence \nwould immediately begin building a potent new capability to analyze all \ninformation regarding terrorist threats and disseminate the information \nto help prevent or protect against attacks.\n  The Intelligence Directorate in the Byrd amendment is an empty room \nwith a name on the door, awaiting future legislation to give it staff \nand purpose; and so it would remain, I fear, indefinitely, because \nthere is no effective termination point, no effective implementation \npoint in the amendment's structure.\n  Section 139 of the Byrd amendment calls for the Secretary of the new \nDepartment to submit to Congress over the course of the next year a \nseries of legislative proposals for these shell directorates, including \nrecommendations for the transfer of authorities, functions, personnel, \nassets, agencies, or entities, all of which would fill them up and give \nthem some meaning.\n  Those recommendations are to be submitted to Congress at least 4 \nmonths apart, beginning no sooner than February 3, 2003--next year. \nThat means that, at best, Congress would have the administration's \nproposals a year from now--a year to recreate proposals that we have \nbefore us today.\n\n  The amendment states that Congress should take action on these \nproposals within 13 months of enactment of the underlying homeland \nsecurity legislation. But even if this deadline were heeded, it means \nonly that Congress would take some action. Congress could reject one or \nmore of the proposals or vote to study the matter further. The fact is \nthat it is very hard to bind a future Congress to do anything. So at \nthe end of the year, under the committee's proposal, that is the \ndeadline for this Department to be fully up and running. Thirty days \nafter the President signs legislation under our proposal, the new \nSecretary would have the power to start getting the Department running. \nA lot of it would start rapidly, but it would all be done within a \nyear.\n  Within a year, under the Byrd amendment, there is nothing but the \nhope that Congress will react to the proposals the administration will \nhave sent it. So with the exception of immigration functions, there \nwould be no assurance in the end that anything would ever be \ntransferred into the new Department. It could indefinitely remain a \nbare-bones proposal with no meat on its skeletal frame whatsoever.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nVermont is recognized to speak for up to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, let me begin by commending Senator \nLieberman for leading this debate. I appreciate the hard work the \nSenator from Connecticut, the Governmental Affairs Committee, and the \nstaff put into this important legislation.\n  I rise today to support the amendment of the homeland security \nlegislation that has been proposed by my colleague from West Virginia, \nSenator Byrd.\n  I am concerned about the path we are proceeding down to create this \nnew Department, and I doubt that the result of this flawed process will \nadequately address the intelligence failures that were revealed so \ntragically on September 11, 2001.\n  Congress must not cede its constitutional role and responsibilities \nto the\n\n[[Page S9061]]\n\nexecutive branch in this dramatic Government reorganization. Congress \nmust remain engaged in this effort to ensure it results in a \nfunctioning, effective agency.\n  This mandate is made clearer when we compare the current process with \nsimilar reorganizations in the past.\n  For instance, comparisons have been drawn between this legislation \nand the creation of the Department of Defense. But the creation of the \nDepartment of Defense involved a collaborative process between the \nexecutive branch and the Congress. And the executive branch agencies \naffected by the proposed Department were participants in the process.\n  Thus, the Department of Defense was founded upon discussion, debate, \nand compromise.\n  This cooperative approach to developing a workable new Department \ncontrasts starkly with the way the administration developed its \nhomeland security draft legislation.\n  A small group of advisers working in secret within the White House \ndeveloped President Bush's proposal. Members of Congress and \nSecretaries of the affected cabinet agencies were reportedly not even \ninformed about the proposal until the days before it was unveiled.\n  And even now, rather than working with Congress to develop consensus \non this legislation, the administration insists it will veto any \nproposal that does not closely resemble its own.\n  Of specific concern, the administration's proposal does not place \nenough emphasis on correcting what went wrong prior to September 11. I \nfirmly hope that we, as a Nation will develop a comprehensive plan to \naddress the shortcomings in our intelligence gathering and \ncommunication efforts.\n\n  Because of the similarity of the September 11 attacks and the attack \non Pearl Harbor over 60 years ago, we should remember the finding of \nthe Joint Congressional Committee that investigated Pearl Harbor.\n  That Committee found that ``. . . the security of the Nation can be \ninsured only through . . . centralization of responsibility in those \ncharged with handling intelligence.''\n  I hope we will learn our lesson after the tragic events of September \n11. Correcting intelligence failures must be the hallmark of any new \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  This reorganization will affect the lives of everyday Americans for \nyears to come. Because the President's proposal does not adequately \naddress intelligence failures, and because the administration refuses \nto enter into a constructive dialogue with the Congress regarding \nlegitimate disagreements, we have a constitutional responsibility to \nact.\n  Therefore, I support Senator Byrd's amendment to the homeland \nsecurity legislation. The Byrd amendment will go along way toward \nensuring Congress continues to play a constructive role in shaping the \nnew Department as this process moves forward.\n  I commend the Senator from West Virginia for his help and assistance \nin helping us all to better understand this problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). Under the previous \norder, the Senator from Michigan is recognized to speak for up to 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I acknowledge, as other colleagues have, \nthe important work of the Senator from Connecticut. Senator Lieberman \nwas the first to outline the reasons for bringing together all of the \nessential functions of Government that relate to homeland security. I \nknow he has put literally hundreds of hours into this effort, and we \nthank him for that.\n  I support the Byrd amendment as an addition to this effort, not as a \ndetraction, because I believe what Senator Byrd has articulated is a \nvery important part of the way we put together a Department of Homeland \nSecurity. I think it is essential. So while I support the homeland \nsecurity effort, I believe it is important to move forward along the \ntimelines and with the checks and balances that Senator Byrd so \nthoughtfully has put together.\n  Simply put, the mission of this Department is too important to be \nrushed into law. I know the Senator from Connecticut would say that \nafter months and months it does not seem like rushing; that there has \nbeen a tremendous amount of effort that has gone into this. But as that \nis said, I also know it is a huge task bringing together 170,000 \nemployees, and there are many questions about the various departments, \nso this is something that will take continued time and thoughtfulness \nto be able to put together.\n  There are many questions that remain, and if the public is to have \nconfidence in the new Department, those questions need to be answered. \nFor instance, why are certain agencies being transferred into the new \nDepartment? What criteria are the administration using to determine \nwhat agencies should be transferred? Almost all of these agencies being \ntransferred have other functions not related to homeland security, \nwhich is of great concern in Michigan--this has been raised in a number \nof contexts--and how will those functions be separated? How will they \nbe affected?\n\n  In Michigan, we have concerns about the Coast Guard, which is a very \nimportant part of our operations not only in fighting terrorism but we \nwant to make sure there are sufficient resources to deter terrorists \nfrom coming into our country by boat. We also know there is a critical \nrole in search and rescue operations and ship inspections. We want to \nmake sure in Michigan we do not lose resources for those essential \ncivilian functions as well as the important efforts to fight terrorism.\n  In earlier discussions about the Homeland Security Department, the \nDepartment of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection System, \nor APHIS, would have been moved to the Homeland Security Department. \nWhile it is reasonable that the border inspection mission of APHIS \nwould be a part of the new Department, it is also critical the domestic \nmission of protecting animal and plant health, and ultimately the \nhealth of American consumers, remains within the Department of \nAgriculture. If the full transfer of APHIS comes up again, I would like \nto debate and vote on that.\n  Those are the kinds of issues I am concerned about. We have workforce \nquestions. There are a number of issues that have been raised which I \nbelieve need our continual input, and that is why I support the \ntimeframe that has been put together in the Byrd amendment to create \nthe Department without delay but then to come back to the Congress, \nreceive input, take it step by step to make sure we are, in fact, doing \nit right. That is what the Byrd amendment is all about. It is about \ncreating this Department with input feedback, coordination, and \ncooperation that is going to enable us to do this huge job.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 4 minutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I believe the Byrd amendment is a more disciplined \nprocess that will help us create a Department that is cohesive, \nresponsive, and effective with its duties and missions clearly defined. \nI urge my colleagues to join with so many of us in supporting the Byrd \namendment.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Under the order that was entered last night, Senator Byrd \nhad requested 10 minutes. We all thought it was 5 minutes, but I think \nit is appropriate he have the 10 minutes. Therefore, I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Lieberman be extended another 5 minutes to balance \nout that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from West Virginia is \nrecognized to speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it is my understanding Senator Thompson \nwants to speak. I ask the Chair to alert me when I have consumed 4 \nminutes and when I have consumed 5 minutes. I hope by the time I use 5 \nminutes Mr. Thompson will be in the Chamber so the other side can be \nheard, I can then speak, and then Mr. Lieberman can close out the \ndebate.\n  I congratulate Mr. Lieberman, the Governmental Affairs Committee, and \nall of the staff members of that committee. They have worked hard, they \nhave worked long, and they have produced a bill that is, in my \njudgment, a great improvement over the House bill.\n  My amendment only addresses title I of the Governmental Affairs bill. \nThe other titles are not touched by my amendment.\n\n[[Page S9062]]\n\n  What does my amendment do? My amendment substitutes for title I in \nthe Lieberman bill in a way that provides congressional oversight and a \nsystematic and orderly process by which the agencies are transferred \ninto the new Department.\n  My amendment provides for the creation of a Department of Homeland \nSecurity. My amendment provides for the same superstructure as does the \nLieberman amendment: in other words, the same directorates in title I \nand the same number of Under Secretaries, Assistant Secretaries, and so \non. Those are how the two titles, title I in the Lieberman bill and \ntitle I in the Byrd amendment, are the same. What is the difference, \nthen? The difference is my amendment provides for an orderly process \nwhereby, in every 120 days over the next 13 months, there will be a \ntransfer of agencies into the Department. So these will occur at 120-\nday intervals, unlike the Lieberman bill, which provides for the \nwholesale transfer over the next 13 months; it could come early, it \ncould come late, it could come earlier than 90 days after the passage \nof the bill, or it could come as late as the close of the transition \nperiod, which is 12 months following the first 30 days.\n\n  Mr. Lieberman says the Department will be up and running in 13 months \nunder his legislation. But his legislation requires only that agencies \nbe transferred by the conclusion of the 13 months. It doesn't say they \nwill be up and running. His bill in that respect is exactly like my \namendment. Both the Lieberman bill and the Byrd amendment provide for \nthe conclusions of the transfers of agencies over the 13 months--by the \nend of the transition period, which is the end of the 13 months.\n  Neither his bill nor my amendment provides that the Department will \nbe ``up and running,'' as the distinguished Senator has said. No \nlegislation can guarantee when the Department will be ``up and \nrunning.'' It will likely be years, which is why Congress needs to \nensure a continuing role for itself.\n  So there will be an orderly process under the Byrd amendment, and the \nchaos that will occur under the Lieberman proposal will be avoided.\n  Congress is kept involved under the Byrd amendment, which means that \nthe Lieberman committee will be kept involved. My amendment provides \nfor the protection of employee rights, privacy, and civil liberties. \nHow does it do that? Because Congress stays involved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 4 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Congress is involved. Mr. Lieberman's committee will be involved time \nand again--once, twice, three times. So Congress will be there, looking \nover the shoulder of the agencies, so to speak, looking over the \nshoulder of the administration, looking over the shoulder of the \nPresident. The President has said he needs flexibility.\n  We hear that worker rights will be challenged, will be jeopardized. \nThat is not true under my amendment because of the fact that Congress \nwill always be there, looking over the shoulders of those who would be \nacting to constitute the agency transfers.\n  Time and again, the workers' rights will be under surveillance \nbecause Congresses will not pass this bill and then walk away, as would \nbe the case in the Lieberman bill, in which instance the Congress would \npass the bill now, and then for the next 13 months----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Over the next 13 months, Congress would walk away to the \nsidelines.\n  So under my amendment, we are not going to say: Mr. President, here \nis the bill. You take it. Just report back to us from time to time and \nlet us know how it is working. Congress is not going to relegate itself \nto a zero. Congress is going to be involved. Congress will be there to \nprotect worker rights, to protect privacy, to protect civil liberties.\n  So I urge the Senators to vote for my amendment. I reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I yield up to 5 minutes of the time I \nhave to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues again for their \neloquent statements on behalf of their positions. I think the issue \nwith regard to this amendment has been well clarified because of those \nstatements. I think it is pretty obvious now that there is almost \nunanimity that we need to proceed with the homeland security bill--\nunanimity in this body. There is disagreement as to whether we ought to \nget about doing it or whether we should delay it. I think that is the \nfundamental issue with regard to this amendment.\n  This amendment that has been offered by the Senator from West \nVirginia would basically postpone the implementation of the new \nDepartment for at least a year. The President's proposals in the House \nand Senate bills all establish directorates. They list \nresponsibilities, transfer funds to agencies.\n  Senator Byrd strikes from the Lieberman substitute all language \nspelling out responsibilities and transfers of functions for each \ndirectorate, leaving only language establishing each directorate under \nan Under Secretary. Instead, he requires the administration to provide \nlegislative proposals in the future, no sooner than February of 2003 \nfor border and transportation, no sooner than 120 days later for \nintelligence and for critical infrastructure, and no sooner than 120 \ndays after that for emergency preparedness and science and technology.\n  The overall thrust is to delay implementation of this bill. The \nquestion we have to ask ourselves is whether we believe, in the \nexercise of our responsibilities as representatives of the people of \nour States, that that is the thing to do, that is where we are. I \nsuggest we already have legislative proposals before us that the \nSenator from West Virginia would have the administration produce \nsometime next year.\n  We in government, especially those in the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, have been watching and listening and discussing for years \nthe way the Government in many respects is dysfunctional. It has been \ncreated and added onto little by little over the years. It needs \nreorganization in the worst sort of way. We have been listening and \nwatching and discussing the fact that the threat to our country from \nrogue nations and from terrorists is growing and growing and growing. \nThis is not new information to any of us.\n  The disorganization of government and the growing threat of \nespecially nuclear proliferation have been things that have been before \nthis body for years and years and years. Unfortunately, it takes \nsomething like September 11 to get us activated so we even have a \ndiscussion such as this.\n  Now we have a proposal that says essentially we are moving too fast, \nalthough commissions started telling us 2 years ago what we needed to \ndo. We started having hearings a year ago with regard to what we needed \nto do, and we have had 18 hearings on homeland security in the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee alone and dozens of other hearings in \nthe House and the Senate.\n  Is it really too rapid? Are we really moving too fast? Is that a \ncriticism that is a just accusation to this body: That we are speeding \nthis thing along, at long last, after all the information and hearings \nand GAO reports that you could stack as high as your head about the \nproblems with Government and the way it needs to be reorganized and \nneeds to be more efficient, that we have too much waste and fraud and \nabuse and mismanagement and overlap and duplication--for years and \nyears, and nobody paid any attention to it?\n\n  Now we are finally getting around to addressing some of this, and the \nissue before us is whether or not we need to wait at least another year \nbefore we even start doing those things. I suggest we do not. I suggest \nwe need to get on about it. I suggest obviously there are going to be a \nlot of twists and turns in the road.\n  We have seen amendments to the Department of Energy Act recently. We \nhave seen DOD amendments in 1985, major amendments, Goldwater-Nickles. \nMajor pieces of legislation creating major departments or consolidated \ndepartments always produce the need to revisit those issues at a \nsubsequent time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I ask for an additional 1 minute.\n\n[[Page S9063]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may continue.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I suggest Congress is not going to lose its oversight. \nIt has been under Congress's oversight, I might add, that this \nduplication, waste, fraud, abuse, mismanagement, and civil service \nsystem, which the Brookings Institution and representatives there say \nfails and underwhelms in every task it takes--it has been under our \nsupervision that that has been created. With the appropriations process \nand the oversight process, if we do it correctly--not the way we have \nnecessarily done it in the past; if we do it correctly--Congress will \nhave a firm hand as we go down the road in the creation and the \nimplementation of this new Department.\n  It is not because we are moving too fast or because of any structural \ndeficiencies that Congress has not had the proper hand. It is because \nwe just simply have not done it. I suggest it is about time we did it. \nThe creation of this Department is the first step in that regard.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Byrd amendment.\n  I had a conversation recently with Alexander Giacco, the former \nchairman of the board of Hercules, Incorporated. Mr. Giacco, although \nnot taking a position on this amendment, impressed upon me the \ndifficulty of wholesale organizational change, of the importance of \ngetting such a structural upheaval right, and it is his comments which \nin part guide my vote this morning.\n  Senator Byrd has it right. Senator Byrd warned us months ago that a \nDepartment of Homeland Security was needed, but that the way to create \nsuch a massive new structure was not to rush into a new flow chart \nwithout asking questions first. The way to do this job right is to be \ndeliberate, to be thoughtful, and to ask the tough questions about how \nour Federal agencies will interact so as to better protect the Nation. \nSenator Byrd's amendment gets us to a new Department as quickly as does \nthe President's proposal and as does the proposal reported favorably by \nthe Committee on Governmental Affairs in July.\n  It is important for us first to understand all that has been done \nsince September 11 to boost our homeland defenses. In the 12 months \nsince the attacks, the President and the Congress have moved with \ndispatch. The President created the Office of Homeland Security and \nselected the able Tom Ridge as its head. I was proud to work with my \ncolleagues on the Judiciary Committee to draft the USA Patriot Act. \nThat bill was a long overdue strengthening of our laws against terror. \nIt increased the ability of law enforcement to share information, \nfacilitated the sharing of information from criminal investigations, \nand reconsidered the wall that has in the past prevented the FBI and \nthe CIA from working effectively together.\n  The FBI has expanded its terrorist threat warning system. A new five-\nlevel homeland security alert system has been created. Ninety-three \nantiterrorism task forces have been created in U.S. Attorney offices \naround the country. INS and Customs are working together to increase \ntheir cooperation in border enforcement. The FBI now provides \ninformation, on a daily basis, to terrorism task forces nationwide as \nwell as to the CIA and the Defense Department. Director Mueller is in \nthe process of revamping the entire FBI so that its primary focus is \nthe prevention of terrorism. The INS and the State Department have \ntogether developed a Consolidated Consular Database, a database that \nincludes visa information and photographs for aliens seeking entry into \nthe U.S.\n  We have created an entire new agency, the Transportation Security \nAdministration. Its sole mission is to protect the Nation' s \ntransportation systems. TSA has deployed federal passenger screeners to \n122 airports. They have hired more than 32,000 new Federal security \nscreeners. These screeners will be in all 429 commercial airports by \nNovember 19. Ultimately, TSA will hire some 54,000 Federal passenger \nand baggage screener workers. This represents a wholesale change from \nthe way the country organized its airport security systems prior to \nSeptember 11.\n  Congress, with the leadership of Senator Byrd, has passed an \nemergency supplemental spending bill designed to increase the resources \navailable to our States and localities and so the country can better \nprevent and respond to terror threats.\n  The President's proposal was developed extremely rapidly, after \nmonths of Administration claims that a Homeland Security Department was \nnot necessary, and by a tiny number of people with little to no \nexpertise in security matters. In contrast, the chairman of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee has been at this issue for over a year, \nSenator Lieberman rightly alerted us to the recommendations of the Hart \n/ Rudman Commission and others even before September 11. His committee \nheld a series of hearings over the past year to determine how best to \nrestructure and reorganize Federal agencies so that they are best \npositioned to respond to terror.\n  It is much more important that we do this right rather than doing \nthis quickly. Imagine the impact on our country if we get this massive \njob wrong. Reorganizations are hard work, and if history is any guide \nour first effort often needs to revisited. Modern management principles \nteach that the agencies and functions of the executive branch should be \ngrouped together based on their major purposes or missions. The \nNational Security Act of 1947 created the Department of Defense, the \nCentral Intelligence Agency and the National Security Council. Even \nthis well thought out proposal has required serious congressional \ntinkering: Congress made further amendments to the organization of our \nnational security agencies in 1949, 1953, 1958, and in 1986.\n  Senator Byrd's amendment builds on the work of the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs. The amendment retains the overall administrative \nstructure as envisioned by the committee: six new directorates, each \nheaded by an Under Secretary. A new Directorate of Immigration Affairs \nis created, and recommendations made by Senators Kennedy and Brownback \nto reform the INS are adopted there. The new Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity is required to submit to Congress recommendations for \nstructuring the other five directorates. The first recommendation would \nbe received by Congress no later than February of next year. Congress \nis required to take action on all of the administration's proposals by \n13 months from after the legislation goes into effect. The Department \nwould be in place in 13 months time at the latest, the same timeframe \nenvisioned by Senator Lieberman's proposal.\n  The Byrd amendment gives us an orderly process under which agencies \nare transferred into the new Department. The Governmental Affairs bill \nrequires that agencies are transferred to the new Department over a \ntransition period lasting 13 months. But neither the Byrd Amendment nor \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee's bill guarantees that a new \nDepartment will be ``up and running'' in just over a year's time. In \nfact, the General Accounting Office has testified that Congress should \nnot expect ``meaningful and sustainable results'' from the new \nDepartment for at least 5 years, and perhaps as long as 10 years, due \nto the inherently slow nature of transitioning so many agencies into \none new structure. Timing of the creating of a new Department is thus \nnot an issue under either proposal.\n  Senator Byrd's proposal guarantees that the new Department will be \ncreated with increased congressional oversight over its functions. \nCongress will not be able to pass this bill and walk away. Rather, we \nwill be forced to more closely scrutinize these proposals to better \nensure that the new Department will function effectively. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Byrd amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has 4 minutes \n19 seconds.\n  Mr. BYRD. There remain 4 minutes 19 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Chair inform me when I have 1 \nminute remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n\n[[Page S9064]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Tennessee and \nothers have claimed that my amendment would delay the implementation of \nthe Department.\n  The exact opposite is true. My amendment will provide in an \ninordinate way the expeditious functioning and the expeditious \ntransfers of the various agencies in the Department.\n  Let me say this, too. The people who are going to protect this \ncountry under a new Homeland Security Department are protecting this \ncountry today. They are on the borders every night. They are at the \nports of entry. They are at the airports. We saw only recently the FBI \narrest of six persons of Yemeni descent. According to the FBI, they \nconstitute a terrorist cell. So the FBI is out there doing its job. We \ndon't have a Department of Homeland Security. It didn't keep the FBI \nfrom doing its work. These people are out there every night and every \nday, 24 hours a day. So the work is going forward. Even if we never \ncreate a Homeland Security Department, these people are out there, and \nthey are performing their work, and doing it admirably.\n  The argument has been made that Senators should oppose my amendment \nbecause it would undo the work of the Governmental Affairs Committee \nand force the Senate to readdress issues that have already been \ndecided. But the Senate has not decided these issues, and they won't be \ndecided even if we pass the Lieberman bill.\n  Of the 80-plus Federal agencies that currently have homeland \nsecurity-related functions, we don't know why 28 of those agencies and \noffices were chosen by the administration and endorsed by the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee to be transferred to this new \nDepartment. We don't know how the administration will reorganize these \nagencies once they are transferred.\n  We don't even have a budget for this new Department. So we have no \nidea about the costs associated with implementing it or how the \nadministration plans to pay for this Department. We don't know if and \nby how much worker protection will be curtailed within this new \nDepartment.\n  Yet the Lieberman bill would have the Congress grant the statutory \npowers to the administration to create this Department and require only \nthat the President report back to the Congress and to the American \npeople after these decisions have already been made. The Congress would \nwalk away from this new Department and require only that the President \nlet us know how everything turns out.\n  My amendment seeks to create a process by which the Congress would \nretain control over the implementation of the new Department. It seeks \nto ensure that this Department is not left to languish in a limbo of \nchaos and confusion.\n  My amendment seeks to ensure that the Congress thoroughly consider \nwhat we are doing before granting broad authority to the administration \nwith regard to such fundamental concerns as civil service protections \nand the privacy rights and civil liberties of the American public.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 3 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I will tell you what is delaying the work of homeland \nsecurity--the intransigence on the part of the President. He had an \nopportunity to sign an appropriations bill that would provide $2.5 \nbillion for homeland security--a total of $5.1 billion. He had an \nopportunity to sign it as an emergency. All it needed was his name. He \nhad 30 days in which to consider it. He steadfastly refused to sign his \nname. This is money that is awaiting the President's signature to go \nthroughout this country to aid the people at the local level in making \npreparations to avoid another terrorist attack, and to ameliorate the \neffects of such attacks if they occur.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 \nseconds for each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I urge Senators to cast their vote today. I \nknow most of the other side, if not all on the other side of the aisle, \nwill probably vote against this amendment. We are going to lose on this \namendment, but I thank those who have spoken for it. I thank those who \nwill vote for it.\n  Let me say to you that it is not how it looks today; it is how your \nvote will look 1 year from today. I urge all Senators to support my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate this amendment being put forward. I \noppose it intensely. I have great respect for the sponsor. But I \nappreciate it being put forward because, more than any other amendment \nthat we have heard or will hear on this bill, it frames the issue. The \nquestion that Senator Byrd's amendment forces every Senator to answer \nis, Do you want to create a Department of Homeland Security anytime \nsoon? Do you have a feeling of urgency about the disorganization of our \nFederal Government's response to the terrorist threat, and do you want \nto respond to it anytime soon?\n  With all respect, this amendment eviscerates the proposal that came \nout of our committee, the bipartisan proposal. As I have said earlier \nin the debate, it builds a house and leaves only the attic with a few \npeople up on top. It creates an army to protect America and the rest of \nthe world against terrorism with a few generals and no soldiers \nunderneath.\n  To say that it strengthens our proposal is like telling somebody who \nowns a house that you are strengthening their house by removing the \nfoundation. It puts at issue what we have done.\n  I do not see how anyone can vote for this amendment and say they are \nfor adopting and creating a Department of Homeland Security soon. The \nquestion is, What happens after 13 months? Under our bill, as Senator \nByrd has said, all of the agencies that are going to be part of the new \nDepartment have to be transferred within 13 months. To me, that means \nthey are going to be operating together as a whole Department, but they \nhave to be transferred.\n  What happens under the amendment? All that has to happen in 13 months \nis that Congress has to act in some way, if Congress 13 months from now \ndecides that it wants to act. It is kind of a moral invocation, if you \nwill. It is not enforceable by anyone. That is why I say that \nultimately not only does the amendment eviscerate the bill but it has \nno end point to it.\n  Senator Byrd is right. There are Border Patrol and other agencies out \nthere right now, but are they talking to each other? Are they \ncoordinating their strategies? Are they integrating their databases? \nAre they meshing their command structures? Are they working adequately \nwith State and local officials with the purpose of making every \ndecision on every agency stronger and more effective to protect our \nNation? The answer is no.\n  In a Dear Colleague letter that Senator Byrd sent, he said similar \nthings to what he said on the floor. He said that the ``amendment seeks \nto create a process by which the Congress would retain control over the \nimplementation of this new Department.'' But it does so at a very high \ncost. The cost is no guarantee that the Department would be created \nanytime soon.\n  I stress that the underlying proposal which came out of our committee \ndoes, in fact, protect the right of Congress to oversee and have great \ninfluence over the implementation of this new Department, first, and \nmost significantly, through the appropriations process, and, second, we \nspecifically rejected a call by the White House for broad authority to \nreorganize the components of the new Department notwithstanding what \nthe law says now. We have said in this bill that you can only do what \nthe law allows. If you want to change the law, you have to come back to \nthe place where laws are made; that is, the Congress. We have required \nthat every 6 months the new Secretary come back to Congress and make \nrecommendations to us about any changes he or she wants to make in this \nDepartment.\n\n  So the issue is clear, and the moment of truth has arrived for \nSenators. Do we want to create a Department of Homeland Security now? \nIf you do, I respectfully suggest that you must vote against this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n\n[[Page S9065]]\n\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Madam President, I join my colleagues today in this \nspecial presentation to acknowledge the distinguished Senator from \nSouth Carolina for his decades of service in this Senate.\n  America has changed in many ways in the 48 years since James Strom \nThurmond was first elected to the Senate. But some things have not \nchanged. Among them are Senator Thurmond's fierce determination to do \nwhat he regards as the right thing for the people of his beloved South \nCarolina.\n  While Senator Thurmond and I often reach different conclusions and \ncast different votes, I admire his devotion to his State, to our \nNation, and to this Senate. In recent years, fulfilling that obligation \nhas seemed at times to require an extraordinary exercise of will or \nlove or both.\n  Someday another Senator will sit in Senator Thurmond's seat, but it \nis hard to imagine anyone ever filling his shoes. He is, as I have said \nbefore, an institution within an institution.\n  He has been alive for almost half the history of the United States. \nTheodore Roosevelt was President when he was born. He was 17 years old \nwhen American women secured the right to vote. He is one of only a few \nAmericans alive who received votes from Civil War veterans. He has \nlived through the term of 18 of America's 43 Presidents and served as a \nSenator under 10 of them.\n  His long and distinguished career is remarkable for its many \nsuccesses, both in and out of the Senate.\n  In 1996, Senator Thurmond became the oldest person ever to serve in \nthe Senate.\n  In 1997, he became the longest serving Senator.\n  In 1998, he became one of only three Senators, in addition to our \ncolleague, Senator Robert Byrd, ever to cast 15,000 votes in this \nSenate.\n  In addition, Senator Thurmond has served as a senator in the South \nCarolina State Legislature and as Governor of that great State. He has \nbeen a senior member of both the Democratic and Republican parties and \na Presidential candidate of a third party. There is not another \nAmerican, living or dead, who can make that claim.\n  He has also served our country in uniform. Senator Thurmond entered \nthe U.S. Army for the first time in 1924. Twenty years later, he \nvolunteered for service in World War II, and on June 6, 1944, at the \nage of 43, he took part in the first wave of the D-Day invasion, the \nairdrop of American troops on Normandy Beach.\n  I am told that Senator Thurmond wanted to parachute into Normandy \nBeach, but another officer who clearly did not know with whom he was \ndealing, decided Senator Thurmond was too old to jump out of an \nairplane. So Senator Thurmond piloted a glider instead, landing, with \nthe rest of his company, behind enemy lines.\n  Senator Thurmond is today a retired major general in the Army \nReserves, the President pro tempore Emeritus of the Senate, a member of \nthe South Carolina Hall of Fame, and a recipient of more honors and \nawards than any of us can name, including the prestigious Presidential \nMedal of Freedom.\n  Simply said, we will never see another like him.\n  I join my colleagues this morning in our heartfelt expression of \ngratitude to Senator Thurmond for his decades of service. We wish him, \nhis family, and staff our very best in his future, whatever life may \nhold beyond the 107th Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, today the Senate takes time to celebrate \nthe life and career of one of its most outstanding Members who, though \nalways a loyal son of South Carolina, has become, indeed, a nation's \ntreasure. It is not enough to say Senator Strom Thurmond has lived his \nlife well. It has been an extraordinary life.\n  Again and again today, we will hear points made about various \naccomplishments in his life. Senator Daschle has already noted many of \nthem, but there is so much that can be said about this particular \nSenator that words are almost inadequate.\n  As I was thinking about him over the weekend, I thought about his \nlife and what he has done and what he has seen and the little acts he \ndoes on a human personal basis.\n  First, when one thinks about it, his is a life that has included \nbeing an educator, a judge, a soldier, yes, a general, Governor, a \nPresidential candidate--in fact, when I was 7 years old, Senator \nThurmond was already running for President and carried my State as well \nas four others, I believe--and a U.S. Senator where he has served so \nadmirably as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, and President pro tempore.\n  I remember in my first couple of years in the Senate, Senator \nThurmond\n\n[[Page S9066]]\n\nwas managing a bill on the floor. I believe it was a crime bill. I \nremember he got right out in the center aisle and gave a fantastic \nspeech, with energy, all the enthusiasm one would expect from a much \nyounger man, but then he was young in spirit, and he made us all feel \ngood about what we could do as the years went by.\n  He has been a philanthropist. He has practiced what he has preached. \nThe record is replete with scholarships and examples of generosity from \nthis Senator, what he has done for others on a financial basis but, \nmore importantly, at times, on a very personal basis, and I will talk \nabout that in a moment.\n  Obviously, he has achieved the ultimate in life also as a proud \nfather. Watching him with his sons and his daughters is a marvelous \nexperience for all of us.\n  He truly has achieved the rank of statesman. Some serve their country \nas teachers, jurists, or as State or local officials, but Senator \nThurmond has been all of those and so much more: A counselor to \nPresidents, a warrior in the cause of freedom, not to mention a \nhumanitarian, a staunch patriot, and a faithful friend. I do not think \nwe will ever see a life in history such as that of Senator Strom \nThurmond; he has served his country in so many ways.\n  His public career spans the days of Franklin Roosevelt and the \npresent President, George W. Bush. Senator Thurmond knew the veterans \nof the greatest war. He was there. He saw it in real time. He knows the \nsoldiers of our current war on terrorism, and today, as a member of the \nArmed Services Committee, he works to make sure they have what they \nneed to do the job because he understands the importance of their job \nin the defense of freedom.\n  When I was born 60 years ago, Senator Thurmond was already a judge \nand well on his way toward a governorship and his candidacy for \nPresident. Yet here we are today as colleagues in this great \ninstitution. I know I am not alone in feeling humbled by his presence.\n  In the days to come, the newspapers will emphasize his extraordinary \npolitical career, but the epic that is Strom Thurmond is far too grand \nto be summed up as an enduring politician and to leave it at that. No, \nwe know better. After all, it is not many of us who have a room in this \nCapitol named for us while we are still here to use it.\n  Another Senator from South Carolina, John C. Calhoun, in his time was \ndescribed this way:\n\n       As a Senator, he was the model of courtesy. He listened \n     attentively to each one who spoke, neither reading nor \n     writing when in his seat.\n\n  At one time or another, I believe every Senator in this Chamber has \nbeen touched by Senator Thurmond's courtesy, and we will honor him if \nwe continue to follow his example in that regard. Hardly a day goes by, \nwhen Senator Thurmond is on the floor, that he does not call me over \nand offer support and offer a piece of candy for my beautiful wife. He \nreassures me what a beautiful lady she is and what a credit she is to \nthis Senator from Mississippi.\n  I wonder sometime, too, if we all appreciate and even our pages \nrealize that a great man of history walks among us every day, but he \ndoes it in such a humble way and such a generous way. How many of us \nhave taken the time to not only acknowledge these pages who are seeing \nhistory in the making and are working for us to make the institution \nlook better, but taken the time to bring them to the dining room for a \nmeal?\n  I always loved it when I was in the dining room and Senator Thurmond \ncame with a whole string of pages right behind him treating them to \nlunch. It was like a hen with her biddies behind her, a beautiful \nsight--a little thing, but typical of Senator Thurmond.\n  There are the calls he has made when friends have had trouble in \ntheir family or illnesses or deaths. There are stories of Senator \nThurmond calling people or even going to the house of one of his former \nstaff members after she had had a baby. Knocking on the door, he came \nto congratulate her and to get a look at this newborn baby. Over and \nover, that is the kind of man he has been.\n  So while he has had these great achievements, he has kept that common \ntouch. In fact, I think the greatest story about Senator Thurmond is \nnot list of achievements but the fact he has never wavered in \ndefending, protecting, and working for the principles he believes in \nand the importance of keeping that human touch, that personal touch.\n\n  Senator Thurmond is a different case in many ways. He is, of course, \nof a different generation and he exemplifies its strengths just as he \nhas worked to leave behind its shortcomings. During his last Congress \nwith us, it was sometimes difficult to remember that at the start of \nWorld War II, a mere youngster of 39, he actually resigned his office \nas a judge. He was with the 82nd Airborne Division and landed in the \nNormandy Invasion on D-day.\n  Half a century ago, GEN Douglas MacArthur addressed the Congress and \ndelivered his famous line about old soldiers:\n\n       They never die, they just fade away.\n\n  Well, Senator Thurmond decided to do neither. He resolved to keep \nworking for his country, devoting all of his experience, all of his \nwisdom, all of his energy to that task. We have been blessed and \nenriched by his determination. He has been here every day, and I have \nnot checked the record, but I think he has been here for every vote \nthis year, which is typical of the sheer iron will that has been the \nexample of his great life.\n  He has seen the defeat of nazism, the collapse of communism, and the \nbringing down of the Iron Curtain. He has been an important part of \nmaking all of that possible. He has worked with Presidents repeatedly \nto support their efforts to do what needed to be done for our country.\n  It has been 213 years since George Washington was inaugurated as \nPresident and the first Congress assembled to write laws for the new \nNation. Senator Thurmond has seen more than 99 of those years. It \nreemphasizes the fact we are still a young country. This great Republic \nis still very young in the annals of history, and this one man has seen \nalmost half of those years. He is an institution, a senior statesman, \nbut he is much more than that. He is a patriot. He loves this country \nof ours in an old-fashioned way, a simple and deep way that seemed to \nhave gone out of style a few decades ago but a way we have relearned \nduring this past year.\n  Our centennial Senator's life is a part of the rich rolling tapestry \nthat is America's history. This soldier who fought at Normandy, this \ncold war warrior who helped Presidents overcome communism, has lived to \nwitness a new enemy of freedom strike at us and all that we hold dear. \nHe saw the tragedy last September that still tears at our hearts, but \nhe saw, too, the resurgence of what he cherished most: Pride in \nAmerica, devotion, honor and sacrifice for America. I do not know of \nany other Senator who will earn this title, but it seems to be \nappropriate to refer to Senator Thurmond as our centennial Senator. He \ncould have very easily been an inspiration perhaps for that great quote \nthat is attributed to Teddy Roosevelt back in 1910 that sums up, I \nbelieve, the greatness of this Senator.\n\n       It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out \n     how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could \n     have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is \n     actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat \n     and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs and comes up short \n     again and again, who knows the great enthusiasms, the great \n     devotions, and spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the \n     best, knows, in the end, the triumph of high achievement and \n     who, at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring \n     greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and \n     timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.\n\n  Senator Thurmond has been in the arena. He has been dusty and sweaty \nand, yes, probably even bloody, but he still stands, the rock from \nSouth Carolina, a great Senator, a great man, a great friend. The \nSenate will not quite be the same when we convene next year, but we \nwill all be better because of the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Senator Thurmond, you are the best. You are an institution, but more \nthan that you are a great friend. We love you and we wish you many more \nhappy days in your next career.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, the distinguished minority leader has \nnoted Strom's comment about the beauty of his wife Patricia. Strom has \nalso done that to my wife Peatsy. I think the record ought to be made \nhere\n\n[[Page S9067]]\n\nthat for Strom Thurmond, all women are beautiful.\n  Madam President, as the longest serving junior Senator in the history \nof the Senate, it is my distinct honor and privilege to pay tribute to \nthe longest serving senior Senator and the longest serving Senator in \nthe history of the Senate. The story is told about a Washington matron \nat one of these evening receptions, how she rushed up to a Spanish \nAmbassador and allowed:\n\n       Mr. Ambassador, this bull fighting, the No. 1 sport in your \n     country, I think it is revolting.\n\n  After a pause, the Ambassador turned to the matron and said:\n\n       Madam, you are mistaken. Bull fighting is our No. 2 sport; \n     revolting is our No. 1.\n\n  That has been the record of J. Strom Thurmond in the field of public \nservice. He has definitely been a revolutionary with respect to public \nservice. At age 29, he served as the youngest county superintendent of \neducation in the history of our State; thereupon, being elected as the \nyoungest State Senator from his home county; thereafter, as the \nyoungest circuit judge presiding, being elevated there in the year \n1938.\n  When Germany declared war, just a few days after December 7--Germany \ndeclared war first on us before we declared war on Germany--Strom \nThurmond, as a presiding circuit judge, took off those robes and \nvolunteered for service in World War II. He was exempt from service \nunder our judiciary rules in the State of South Carolina, but he didn't \nhesitate. And as has been noted here, made the invasion on D-day, June \n6, 1944, in Europe and served in five campaigns with valor and courage, \ncoming back to retire as a major general in the U.S. Army.\n  In 1948, he organized the only really successful third party movement \nin this country as a States Rights Party, and as a candidate for \nPresident he carried South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, and \nLouisiana--he carried four States.\n  Thereafter, in 1954 he was the first--and I take it the only--Senator \never elected to the Senate as a write-in candidate. Then, in 1964, \nhaving been a Democrat, he changed parties. He saw the future of the \nState of South Carolina and the South in the Republican Party, and he \nhas led the move ever since.\n  There is no question in my mind that he has had the most \ndistinguished of service up here, serving as the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, chairman \nof the Veterans' Affairs Committee, and the President pro tempore of \nthe Senate. But I think people back home know Strom best of all for his \nconstituent service. Whether it is the job found for a constituent, or \nhelping a family get a relative admitted to the hospital, or sending a \nletter to the deceased's family, or helping when the soldier is brought \nback home, or whatever it is, you can count on Strom. I can tell that \nto you right now. He has made his fame looking out for the people of \nhis home State.\n  It has been noted that Strom was born when Teddy Roosevelt was \nPresident. Elihu Root, who was the Secretary of State for Teddy \nRoosevelt, once remarked that:\n\n       Politics is the practical art of self government and \n     someone must attend to it if we are going to have self \n     government.\n\n  And he made the cogent observation:\n\n       The principal ground for reproach against any American \n     citizen is that he is not a politician. In representative \n     America, every citizen counts.\n\n  Heaven knows, Strom Thurmond of South Carolina has counted at every \nparticular turn, during illustrious service of some 70 years. I think \nhe is the living example that the best politics is no politics. It is \nmy privilege to pay tribute to him now. I am sure I am going to have \nthe opportunity many times hereafter as we both move along. But it has \nbeen a distinct pleasure to serve as his junior Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I have listened attentively to every word \nthat has been spoken today about this colleague of ours. Those words \nhave been true. I well remember when I first came to the Senate, I \nremember Strom Thurmond's late wife used to sit in the gallery up here \nand listen to the debates. She was a beautiful woman. I remember very \nwell the day she passed away. I remember coming to the Senate and \nseeking out Strom Thurmond, and here he was, sitting in the back row. I \nwalked up to his desk, and he stood, and I said:\n\n       Strom, I'm so sorry to hear about your great misfortune.\n\n  And he stood with that stoic way of his and thanked me and sat down.\n  I also remember when Erma and I lost our grandson Michael. It was 20 \nyears ago. I remember the funeral service, and I remember who was \nthere. I recall who came to share in the greatest sorrow of my life.\n  Some of my colleagues were there. Howard Baker was there, the \nmajority leader. The then-Governor of my State of West Virginia, Jay \nRockefeller, was there. Who else? Who else? No other Senator, with the \nexception of one--Strom Thurmond. He came.\n  I have seen him at funeral homes of others who were the relatives of \nSenators and some who were not relatives of Senators. I have seen Strom \nThurmond there.\n  I shall never forget when Strom met with tragedy in his life not many \nyears ago when he gave up the prized possession, a daughter. I went to \nSouth Carolina to be with Strom and to share his sorrow.\n  Then, just a few days ago, a message came into my office. Strom had \ncalled my wife. She had an operation--appendectomy. Who called to \nexpress concern for her and to wish her an early recovery? That man--\nStrom Thurmond.\n\n     'Tis the human touch in this world that counts,\n     The touch of your hand and mine.\n     Which means far more to the fainting heart\n     Than shelter and bread and wine.\n     For shelter is gone when the night is o'er\n     And bread lasts only a day,\n     But the touch of the hand and the sound of the voice\n     Sing on in the soul alway.\n\n  Strom Thurmond, in a few more weeks, will be the first sitting United \nStates Senator to become a centenarian.\n  What an amazing record. What an amazing man. In his 100 years on this \nEarth, he has been a teacher, a coach, an attorney, a judge, a \nGovernor, a soldier, a college professor, an author, a lawmaker at both \nthe State and Federal levels, a delegate at six Democratic National \nConventions and six Republican National Conventions, and a U.S. Senator \nwho has served 47 years in this Chamber and cast more than 15,000 \nvotes.\n  That is more votes than soldiers that Flaminius lost at the Battle of \nLake Trasimeno in the year 217 B.C.\n  Senator Thurmond was born into the Old South, His hometown of \nEdgefield was the home of the cane swinging Representative Preston \nBrooks, who gained a place in history for beating a northern Senator \nwho had insulted his family and his state. Senator Thurmond's \ngrandfather, George Washington Thurmond, was with General Lee at \nAppomattox when Lee surrendered to Grant. His father, Judge J. William \nThurmond was a lieutenant of the legendary South Carolina Senator \n``Pitchfork'' Ben Tillman, whom I used to read about before I came to \nthe arena of politics. A product of the Old South, Senator Thurmond \nemerged to become an important leader in the New South.\n  Senator Thurmond's amazing life has spanned twentieth century \nAmerica. When he was born, the Wright brothers had yet to make their \nhistoric, heavier-than-air manned flight. He has lived to see manmade \nvehicles reaching the outer limits of our universe. What a change in a \nsingle lifetime. Perhaps an even greater, more monumental change took \nplace right here in the U.S. Senate. When Strom Thurmond was born, on \nDecember 5, 1902, U.S. Senators were not elected by the people of their \nstates, but selected by their state legislatures. The Senate had no \npermanent office buildings; Senators had no professional staffs. Boy, \nwhat a change Strom Thurmond he has lived to see here.\n\n  Even more amazing is how his life and career have mirrored so much of \nthe history of twentieth century America.\n  In 1928, Strom Thurmond, a Democrat at the time, was elected to his \nfirst political office, superintendent of schools, Edgefield County, \nSouth Carolina--when Calvin Coolidge was president. Those were the days \nof mechanically-sliced bread.\n  In 1932, he was elected to the State Senate of South Carolina--that \nwas the\n\n[[Page S9068]]\n\nyear Franklin Roosevelt was elected President of the United States.\n  How well I remember the days when the coal miners of West Virginia \nmarched--over 100,000 strong. John L. Lewis, the leader of that great \nUnited Mine Workers Organization, had his picture in every miner's \nhome. Strom Thurmond was there.\n  It was Roosevelt's Administration that marked the emergence of the \nDemocratic Party as the majority party. I remind my colleagues that \nSenator Thurmond was a Democrat in those days.\n  In 1942, Strom Thurmond volunteered for service in World War II--the \nwar that marked the emergence of the United States as a superpower. I \nmight point out that Senator Thurmond could have stayed safely on the \nsidelines of that conflict. He was beyond draft age and, as a judge, he \nheld a draft-exempted status. Yet he volunteered to put himself in \nharm's way and heroically served his country.\n  On June 6, 1944, paratrooper Strom Thurmond took part in the D-Day \ninvasion that began the Allied liberation of Europe from Nazi tyranny \nand the defeat of worldwide fascism.\n  In 1946, like so many other World War II veterans, including Richard \nNixon and John F. Kennedy, Strom Thurmond returned home to a career in \npublic service. While Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Nixon were elected to \nCongress that year, Mr. Thurmond was elected governor of his beloved \nSouth Carolina.\n  In 1948, Governor Strom Thurmond ran for president as a States Rights \nDemocrat, carrying 4 states and winning 39 electoral votes. This means \nthat President Harry Truman's great upset victory over Thomas Dewey in \nthe 1948 presidential election included the defeat of Strom Thurmond.\n  In 1954, Strom Thurmond was elected to the Senate as a write-in \ncandidate. Imagine that. No other Senator was ever elected as a write-\nin candidate to this body. This made him the first and only person in \nU.S. history elected to the Senate in this manner. He is the only \nperson ever elected to any major office in the United States in this \nmanner.\n  In 1957, Senator Strom Thurmond set a record for the longest \nindividual speech ever delivered in the Senate--24 hours and 18 \nminutes, from August 28 to August 29, 1957.\n  In 1964, Senator Thurmond switched from the Democratic Party to the \nRepublican Party--our loss, your gain--a move that marked the beginning \nof the ``southern strategy'' that has reshaped the Republican Party.\n  In 1981, when Ronald Reagan became President, Senator Thurmond was \nchosen as Senate President pro tempore, placing him third in the line \nof succession to the Presidency. And in the early days in the history \nof this country, it would have been the Vice President and then Strom \nThurmond, because he would then have been second in line of succession \nto the Presidency.\n  On March 8, 1996, Senator Thurmond, at the age of 93, 93 years and 94 \ndays--oh, to be 93 years again--93 years and 94 days, became the oldest \nperson ever to serve in the Senate.\n  On May 25, 1997, he became the longest serving Senator in the history \nof the Senate, surpassing the record of 41 years and 10 months held by \nCarl Hayden.\n  He is a man with whom I have never had a cross word in this Senate--\nnever.\n  On December 31, 1997, Senator Thurmond's colleague, Senator Ernest \nHollings, became the longest serving junior Member of the Senate, 31 \nyears and 53 days, surpassing the ``junior'' record of Senator John \nStennis.\n  In 1998, Senator Thurmond became the second Senator ever to cast \n15,000 votes.\n  As I have said, what an amazing life. What an amazing life. What an \namazing career. There is none other like it.\n  But I am pleased and I am proud to point out that throughout it all, \nSenator Thurmond has always remained a man of his word, a devoted \nfather, and a Senator ready to defend his State, his country, and his \nvalues, as a distinguished leader, who is revered in his home State of \nSouth Carolina--a State that has built statues in his honor, a State \nthat has named buildings in his honor, a State that has named roads and \ndams and lakes in his honor.\n  Foremost, Senator Thurmond has remained a southern gentleman of the \nfirst order: charming, polite, optimistic, friendly, courteous, and \nenduring.\n  May God bless you, Senator Thurmond. May God bless you always.\n  This is a man. Whence cometh another?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I am sort of humbled to be following my \ngreat friend from West Virginia and the statement he has just made.\n  When I came to the Senate 34 years ago, this true southern gentleman \nwas among the first to make me welcome. I came from a fairly new State. \nSenator Thurmond had already served for 14 years as a Senator when I \njoined the Senate. He was generous with his time, helping this young \nWesterner to become familiar with the traditions of the Senate, sharing \nhis knowledge of procedures, and some of the pitfalls, and emphasizing \nthe importance of maintaining a sense of dignity.\n  I soon learned that the gracious Strom Thurmond was extending to me \nfriendship, which is part and parcel of this man. His courtly manners \nand his helpfulness were legendary even then.\n  Today, all these years after he gave me that first crushing \nhandshake, he remains the dignified, gallant gentleman of whom I became \na friend in 1968. He continues to demonstrate the spirit that has given \nhim the courage to beat the odds, overcome obstacles, and deal with \nsome of life's toughest challenges.\n  As he prepares to leave us, after almost a half century of serving \nthe people of South Carolina and our Nation, I just want to take a few \nmoments to look back on the personal relationship I have had with \nSenator Thurmond.\n  While we share a bond of serving in the military during World War II, \nSenator Thurmond far surpassed any of my experiences. He landed, as \npeople have already said, on D-day in Normandy. He served in both the \nEuropean and Pacific theaters. And he earned an astounding 18 \ndecorations, including the Legion of Merit and the Bronze Star for \nValor.\n  When my first wife Ann died in a plane crash that I survived, Strom's \nhelping hand was there, ready to assist always. The counsel and support \nhe offered were born from the experience of his own tragedy 8 years \nearlier, when he lost his wife Jean. While he understood the importance \nof dealing with my grief, he lobbied me to find a new partner in life, \nas he had done.\n  When Catherine and I were married, Strom made sure she had a great \nwelcome as the Senate's newest spouse. And when our Lily--now a senior \nat Stanford, who visited the Senate from time to time when she was a \ntoddler--returns to these halls, she always makes sure to see Uncle \nStrom. As a matter of fact, there is not a day goes by that Strom does \nnot ask me: How is Lily? And last night, Madam President, Lily, now a \nsenior at Stanford, sent me an e-mail. I would like to read from it. I \nquote:\n\n       When I think about some of my earliest memories, I always \n     come back to images in my head of entering the big white \n     Capitol to see you and your friends. Because, of course, I \n     didn't know anything about the important roles of the people \n     I knew or the grandness of the Capitol. What I really \n     remember is going to see friends like ``Uncle Strom'' and \n     running in circles around the patterns of the tiles by the \n     entrance to the floor. I can't think of how many times I saw \n     Strom's familiar face and ran to give him a big hug, hearing \n     his voice calling, ``Lily, look how big you've grown,'' or, \n     ``Miss Lily, you're such a pretty girl!'' Seeing Uncle Strom \n     was always a highlight of my trips to the Capitol, and once I \n     got to know Julie, being with her also made some long nights \n     of political gatherings much more fun! Julie, like her \n     father, is such a generous, caring, and warm person, and I \n     feel lucky to have gotten to know her, Nancy, and Uncle \n     Strom.\n\n  Madam President, Lily had a great many birthday parties here in the \nSenate. At that time, I was the whip, the assistant leader, and Uncle \nStrom was always at the top of her guest list, which she prepared \nherself.\n  I think we can all testify to Strom's sweet tooth. He never saw a \nbirthday cake or a scoop of ice cream he did not like.\n  I will leave it to others, who will also pay tribute to Strom today, \nto tell of his many accomplishments. They will note he has many titles \nin his 100 years: From teacher to coach to superintendent of education; \nfrom second lieutenant to general; from attorney at law to judge; and \nfrom Governor to\n\n[[Page S9069]]\n\nSenator. Those titles were all earned through dedication and hard work, \nand they are hallmarks of his distinguished career. I respect those \ntitles. But there is one that is more important to me than all the \nothers, and that is the title I used first: Friend. We are all the \nricher for having Strom Thurmond in our midst. To be able to count him \nas a friend is the greatest privilege of all.\n  So I am here today, Senator Thurmond, to say thank you for your \ndedication, your patriotism, your generosity of spirit, but, most of \nall, on a very personal basis, for your friendship.\n  Thank you, Strom.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, there are some times even in the Senate \nwhen enough words cannot be said. Senator Thurmond has probably made \nmore history than many of us will ever see. He has experienced more \nhistory than most of us will ever know. Every member of the Senate \nwould be proud to tell our grandchildren that ``I served with Strom \nThurmond.'' Because the senior Senator from South Carolina has been \nsuch a force in politics for over 50 years, I would like to tell my \ngrandparents that I served with Strom Thurmond.\n  He always did his duty and he spent the better part of a century \nshaping the greatest nation on earth.\n  There isn't a history teacher alive who wouldn't like to bring their \nclass to Senator Thurmond's office to see a portrait of history laid \nout on his walls. One would think that to live and perform at the ripe \nyoung age of 99, one would be wise to pace oneself. Instead, Senator \nThurmond has put in a professional marathon, but at the pace of a 100-\nyard dash. He is the Lance Armstrong and Cal Ripken of pubic service \nwith over 15,000 votes. Alternatively, I would rather say that Cal \nRipken is the iron man Strom Thurmond of Major League Baseball.\n  In his book, ``Great Political Wit,'' our former colleague Bob Dole \ndescribed Senator Thurmond's 90th birthday. At that festive event, \nSenator Thurmond noted that, ``all evening, people had been coming up \nto him to express the hope that they would be present for his 100th \nbirthday. To which Senator Thurmond replied, ``if you eat right and \nexercise regularly, I don't see any reason why you shouldn't be around \nto see it.''\n  In terms of ethics and duty, he remains old fashioned. He believes \nthat the real ``woman's place'' is sitting next to him testing his \ncharm, and his grip.\n  If there is a more extraordinary resume in a Congress full of honor \nand achievement, I cannot imagine. In his career, he has responded to \nthe titles of: teacher, coach, Lieutenant, Counselor, superintendent \nJudge, General, Governor, Senator and President Pro Tempe.\n  When Ted Williams set down his bat to go defend his country during \nWorld War II, Judge Thurmond set down his gavel, at age 40, to join the \n82nd Airborne that landed on Normandy Beach. Before he returned to the \nbench he had battled his way across France, Belgium, Holland, \nLuxembourg, Czechoslovakia, and Germany and finished in the \nPhilippines.\n  Few in the history of this country have dedicated so much energy on \nbehalf of the country they loved. And through it all, it seemed that \nthe senior Senator had energy in reserve.\n  I had my staff dig up the Senator's first floor statement which \noccurred on January 28, 1955. He spoke directly after Senators Long and \nHumphrey. He was speaking eloquently but directly and succinctly on the \nneed to meet the threat of communism head on. This was in relation to \nan authorization of force to protect Formosa, requested by President \nEisenhower. Let me read his final paragraph: ``Our earnest prayer is \nfor peace. If war should come, it would not the result of any \naggressive act on the part of the United States. But war might come as \na result of any display of weakness, of disunity, or of heslitation. I \nshall cast my vote on the side of firmness, for unity and for \ndecision.''\n  As near as I can tell, his approach to and commitment to the security \nof free people has not deviated since that first floor statement.\n  We are all grateful for the distinguished tenure of Senator Thurmond; \ngrateful to the people of his State for sending him here, and grateful \nto his family for sharing him. His retirement is well-deserved and I \nhope he now has more surplus time to build up his pushups and pull ups \nso he can return to fighting shape again.\n  Additionally, after 36 years in the Senate, some of us are getting \ntired of calling Chairman Hollings ``junior.''\n  It is my high honor and privilege humbly to thank our still young-of-\nheart Strom and wish him a busy retirement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, after hearing the remarks of the \nSenator from Alaska, I have to say I am very sorry that my children, \nBailey and Houston, will not have the chance to have birthday parties \nwith Strom Thurmond since he will be leaving this year. I know it was a \nrich part of Lily Stevens' heritage and probably why she is a student \nat Stanford today. She had such an upbringing and she learned a lot \nthroughout her early life.\n  It is a privilege to be able to add to the accolades to Senator Strom \nThurmond. So much has been said already today, but it is fitting that \nthe first retiring Senator in this cycle who does get floor tributes be \nSenator Strom Thurmond. There is no one like him. There never has been, \nand there never will be.\n  On December 5, Strom Thurmond will celebrate his 100th birthday. To \ngive you some perspective, Strom Thurmond was born the same year as \nThomas Dewey, Charles Lindbergh, and the nation of Cuba, which gained \nits independence from Spain. Strom was 14 when Lenin overthrew Czar \nNicholas in Russia. Strom was 15 when a young, left-handed pitcher \nnamed Babe Ruth led the Red Sox to their last World Series victory. \nStrom was 17 when women earned the right to vote, and now he has served \nwith 24 of the 31 women to ever hold a seat in the Senate.\n  On November 3, 1954, Strom became the only Senator ever to be elected \nas a write-in candidate. He is the oldest sitting and the longest \nserving Senator in U.S. history. I doubt his record will be broken in \nthe near future--maybe never.\n  During my own tenure in the Senate, a mere 9 years by comparison, I \nhave been touched by Strom Thurmond's presence. South Carolina and \nTexas hold a rich heritage together. Strom often reminds me that \nWilliam Barret Travis, a Texas hero who commanded the forces at the \nAlamo, hailed from Strom's home county in South Carolina.\n  Another South Carolinian who made his way to the wild west of Texas \nwas Thomas Jefferson Rusk. Thomas Rusk was the first Senator from Texas \nto hold my seat. He was one of the heroes of the battle of San Jacinto \nwhich liberated the Republic of Texas. Senator Rusk's family was living \nin a rented home in South Carolina when he was born. The home, which \nbelonged to John C. Calhoun, would later become the site of Strom's \nalma mater, Clemson University.\n  An even more important connection is our States' contributions to the \nNation's Armed Forces. I have been proud to stand side by side with \nStrom in supporting our men and women in uniform and ensuring that they \nhave every available resource to do the job we ask them to do.\n  In his almost 50 years in the Senate, Strom Thurmond has accomplished \na great deal. But his greatest legacy is his enduring support for those \nwho serve in uniform. I was privileged to work with Strom when he was \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee. He focused on a host of \nimportant issues, such as military health care and quality of life for \nservice members and their families. In 1998, we named the Defense \nauthorization bill the Strom Thurmond Defense authorization bill in \nrecognition of his lifelong commitment to the defense of our Nation.\n  When the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, Strom was a 40-year-old \ncircuit judge who would have been forgiven most certainly if he had \ndecided to spend the duration of the war guarding the homefront. Not \nStrom. Even though he was exempt from the draft, he volunteered for \ncombat and went on to become a highly decorated officer.\n\n  At the age of 42, LTC Strom Thurmond became the oldest man to help \ntake the beach of Normandy on D-day.\n\n[[Page S9070]]\n\nHis unpowered glider was shot down behind enemy lines, and he survived \nby taking shelter in an apple orchard.\n  Given the casualties on that dreadful day on Normandy's beach, Strom \nThurmond probably considered a long and fruitful life to be measured in \ndays, not decades. Soldiers who survived the horrific days at Normandy \nor Guadalcanal or Iwo Jima often say that every day thereafter is a \nfree day.\n  Fifty years later, in defiance of every insurance actuary who ever \nbuilt a calculator, or more aptly a slide rule, Strom Thurmond skipped \nthe 50th anniversary celebration of that brief but memorable flight. I \nremember because I was here at the 50th anniversary of Normandy. There \nwas a huge celebration of the Members of Congress who had participated \nin that particular part of our war effort. But, there was one Senator \nmissing from that 50th anniversary at Normandy. It was Strom Thurmond. \nStrom Thurmond, who was 92 at the time, missed the 50th anniversary \nbecause that was the weekend of his son's graduation from high school. \nThink about it.\n  Strom has always known what matters. He has always focused on what is \nimportant. He continues to do that today.\n  He continued to serve after the war in the Reserves, rising to the \nrank of major general. His whole life has been a tradition of service. \nFrom World War II to the Governor's mansion and ultimately to the halls \nof the Senate, he has always made public service his top priority.\n  In the final scene of the movie ``Saving Private Ryan,'' the movie's \nnamesake returns 50 years after that battle to the grave at Normandy of \nthe captain who gave his life to save Private Ryan. In one of the \nmovie's most touching scenes, Ryan tells the long-dead captain that he \nhas tried to honor his sacrifice by living a good life. That scene \ncaptures the essence of what we as a nation owe to those who have \nfought for our country and our freedom: to honor their sacrifice by \ntrying to lead a good life and by doing everything we can to keep our \ncountry free and at peace.\n  Strom has truly honored his comrades who fell that dreadful day and \nall those who have worn the uniform since. He has been good, as he has \nalso been great. He has led the Senate to keep our military strong \nthrough the generations.\n  For those of us who have served with Strom in the Senate, he has been \nthe senior Senator from South Carolina during our entire careers, \nincluding of course, Fritz Hollings. Fritz must be the oldest, longest \nserving junior Senator in the history of the Senate. That will surely \nchange.\n  And that change is going to take some getting used to. Having Strom \nThurmond gone, will make this a different place for all of us, \nparticularly the Senate pages. Strom Thurmond has always been \nparticularly attentive and sweet to the Senate pages, probably \nthroughout his career. I have seen it time and time again where he has \ntaken the pages for lunch or for ice cream to talk to them so that they \ncan ask him questions. I truly believe if you ever took a poll of the \nSenate pages, their favorite Senator would always be Strom Thurmond.\n  He is a legend. He is an institution. More important, Strom Thurmond \nis the heart and soul of the Senate. We honor him today.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor my good friend and \ncolleague, Strom Thurmond. I am proud to be his colleague and friend. \nWhat a great American. After my election to the Senate, he was there to \ngreet me.\n  When we think about institutions, we think about established \norganizations that are dedicated to public-service and advancement of \nscience or culture. Institutions are created not by single people, but \nrather by the collective group that share ideals and values which are \ninherent to their cause. But while institutions are defined by the \nideas that created them in the first place, it is individuals that \ntruly identify the institution.\n  Just as John Glenn personifies the achievements of NASA, just as \nMartin Luther King Jr. embodies the Civil Rights movement, just as \nAlbert Einstein represents the science of physics, the U.S. Senate is \nsymbolized by Senator Strom Thurmond. Today we honor the gentleman who \nhas spent nearly half his life in the Senate, a man who people cannot \nhelp but mention whenever the Senate is brought up in conversation.\n  While his accomplishments in this body merit enough attention, what \ntook place before his foray into national politics is just as \nnoteworthy. From graduation at Clemson University, to becoming a State \nSenator in South Carolina followed by confirmation as Circuit Judge, \nSenator Thurmond dedicated his life to public service. After signing an \nage waiver so that he could parachute onto the beaches of Normandy, \nStrom continued service in the U.S. Army as a reservist to eventually \ngain the rank of Major General after 36 years in the military. Somehow \nhe even found time to run for governor of South Carolina and serve for \n6 years.\n  We have ceremonies for men who were veterans in World War II and were \ninvolved in the D-Day invasion in France. We have ceremonies for former \nGovernors who are elected and serve their states with distinction. We \neven hold ceremonies for those fortunate enough to serve in the armed \nservices for 36 years. And today we hold a day of celebration for a man \nwho accomplished not one but all of these feats, and then was elected \nas a write-in candidate on his way to serving in the U.S. Congress \nlonger than any other human being. Yet many of his past accomplishments \nare overlooked because of his remarkable service in his nearly 50 years \nin the Senate. It is a testimony to his nature and the impact he has \nhad on American politics that we sometimes fail to mention the first \npart of his life.\n  As we honor Strom Thurmond today, I would like to thank him \npersonally for not only his dedication to serving the people of South \nCarolina, but also for his leadership in the Senate and for being a \nfriend. It has been a privilege to serve on the Armed Services \nCommittee with Mr. Thurmond, and we all know about his hard work and \ncommitment to our military that he has displayed over the years. Thank \nyou also, Senator Thurmond, for your dedication to this institution \nthat we serve in today, an institution that will bare your mark for \nyears. But more importantly, thank you for your service to the United \nStates; you certainly are a centenarian for the ages.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to join in \npaying tribute to Senator Strom Thurmond. Senator Thurmond will \ncelebrate his 100th birthday on December 5 and has the most remarkable \nrecord of longevity in the Senate of any Senator in history.\n  I was disappointed when Strom decided not to run for reelection last \nyear, but I can understand his views on the subject. He has been really \na paragon of agility and sturdiness, taking steps two at a time, coming \nup to the Senate Chamber--until very recently. Strom continues to have \na very firm handshake and he continues to have an agile mind and he \ncontinues to make all the votes. So that is one of the reasons why I \nquestioned his decision not to run for reelection. I had watched \nSenator Thurmond over the years, and when I was elected to the Senate \nin 1980, I looked forward to meeting him. But I did not have to await \nmy arrival in the Senate to have my first contact with Senator Thurmond \nbecause one day late in November, I was sitting in my den and the phone \nrang. There was a deep southern voice: I would like to speak to Senator \nSpecter.\n\n  I said: This is he.\n  He said: This is Senator Thurmond.\n  I said: What a great pleasure to hear from you, Senator Thurmond.\n  He said: I called to ask if you would be willing to support me for \nPresident pro tempore.\n  I said: Senator, I thought the position of President pro tempore was \nautomatically the senior member of the party in power, and I know that \nis you, sir.\n  He said: That is true, but I do not like to take anything for \ngranted.\n\n[[Page S9071]]\n\n  I said: Senator Thurmond, you may be assured I will support you for \nPresident pro tempore. And I did.\n  I would like another chance to do that. Maybe we will have a chance \nto support him for President pro tempore after the November elections.\n  When I joined the Senate, I selected the Judiciary Committee, which \nis right in line with my own training and interests. Senator Thurmond, \nof course, was the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Regrettably, \nwhen there were efforts to form a quorum, members were usually very \nlate. I made it a point to arrive on time. When I did that the third \ntime in a row--the chairman has to arrive on time--when I did that the \nthird time in a row, Senator Thurmond asked what I was doing there on \ntime. Then he thanked me, congratulated me, and said I might even start \na precedent.\n  In 1982, when there were two Pennsylvanians up for confirmation, \nJudge Mansman and Judge Caldwell, I was there to present them to the \ncommittee. Senator Thurmond was presiding as chairman. He asked them a \nquestion. He said to them: If confirmed, do you promise to be \ncourteous? I thought to myself: Why would he ask the question, If you \nare confirmed, do you promise to be courteous? Not surprisingly, both \nnominees said yes.\n  Then Senator Thurmond said: Because the more power a person has, the \nmore courteous a person should be. I have not heard a more profound \nstatement in my 22 years in the Senate. Not that there is a whole lot \nof competition for profound statements around here.\n  When Senator Thurmond does not appear at Judiciary Committee \nhearings, I ask the question. I have had many nominees comment to me \nafter a number of years how they thought that was a very significant \nquestion. If any judge is listening now, that is the hallmark of a \njudge. Judges have a lot of reasons to be out of sort with lawyers who \nare not prepared, or witnesses who are unresponsive, but there is \nenormous power in that black robe with a lifetime appointment, and \nSenator Thurmond had his finger right on it.\n  There are a lot of vignettes I could tell, but Senator Allen has come \nto the floor, so I will limit myself to a couple more.\n  When Senator Howard Baker was the majority leader, we used to have \nall-night sessions, a very stark contrast from now when we hardly have \nday sessions. One evening we had a finance bill before us. It was 1982. \nIt was 11:45 p.m. The floor was crowded with Senators. Nobody had any \nappointments left at 11:45 p.m. Senator Baker stood behind that podium \nand said: Amendments, like mushrooms, grow overnight, so we are going \nto stay and finish the bill. I have consulted with the chairman--\nSenator Dole of the Finance Committee--and we worked through the night. \nThere were maybe three, four rollcall votes, a lot of amendments taken, \na lot of amendments dropped. We walked out at 6:30 in the morning into \nthe sunshine with a complete complex finance bill.\n  If we did that tonight, we would finish homeland security by morning. \nIn any event, that is one of the occasions I went down to the \nrestaurant, which was kept open. I made it a point to find Senator \nThurmond's table and have a bowl of soup and to hear great stories \nabout Senator Thurmond's career in Washington, DC. He talked about \nLyndon Johnson as a Senator, and that young fellow, John Kennedy, who \ncame to the Senate, about the heroes and the legends of the Senate, \nbecause he has seen them all.\n  One story he told, which I thought was especially interesting, was \nabout the inaugural parade on January 20, 1949. Senator Thurmond had \nrun for President and had carried four States and almost threw the \nelection into the House of Representatives. In the parade, after \nPresident Truman was elected and Vice President Alben Barkley was \nelected, Strom came down with his wife riding in an open-top car, \nprobably dressed in a cutaway. I am not sure about that. Maybe I will \nask Strom to yield for a question here. When he passed the reviewing \nstand, he stood up and tipped his hat. Vice President Alben Barkley \nstarted to raise his hand and, as Strom told the story, Truman grabbed \nhis hand and pulled it down and said: Don't you wave to that SOB. I \nmight be more explicit but somebody might want to have it stricken from \nthe Record as being an inappropriate statement.\n  One more short story. In a Judiciary Committee hearing on one \noccasion, Strom did not want to see a quorum reached because he did not \nwant legislation to be passed out of the committee. So he stood right \noutside the Judiciary Committee door over in 226. He wanted to be right \nthere poised to go into the room in the event there was a quorum so he \ncould obstruct whatever it was he did not want to happen.\n  Ralph Yarborough, a Senator from Texas, came up and grabbed hold of \nStrom and tried to pull him into the hearing room. Strom--I do not know \nexactly what the wrestling maneuver was, but Yarborough ended up on the \nfloor in a Strom Thurmond scissor. Strom did finally agree to release \nSenator Yarborough with Yarborough's promise he would not go into the \nhearing room.\n  As the story goes, Yarborough went into the hearing room. Strom \nshould never have released him. He probably would still be there if \nStrom had not been so generous.\n  Senator Thurmond has been an example in many ways as his political \nphilosophy has advanced. He is a great advocate for African Americans, \nconstituents--the wall of his office ought to be memorialized and left \nintact. He has so many plaques and commemorative memorabilia.\n  It has enabled me to tell a story on the stump which has been \nsomewhat useful both from a political and humorous point of view, and \nthat is, when running for reelection, I say: If I am reelected in 2004 \nwhen I am next up and decide to run again 6 years later in 2010, and \ndecide to try again 6 years after that in 2016, and run again in 2022, \nand then run again in 2028, at that point, I will be younger than \nSenator Strom Thurmond is today.\n  People are always amazed at the thought of running in 2028. So they \nthink it is not too bad to run in the year 2004 for a fifth term. They \nare always very much impressed by Senator Strom Thurmond.\n  So, Strom, I join my colleagues in saluting you for a fabulous career \nand wish you 100 more years of continued good health.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, three score and 10 years ago our \ncolleague, Strom Thurmond, first won elective office when he was chosen \nto serve in the South Carolina House of Representatives. He has been \nfigure of influence in--and on behalf of--his home State ever since.\n  The longest-serving Senator in the history of this body, he will be \nretiring at the end of this Congress, and today we have the opportunity \nto recount our own experiences with this American legend.\n  Senator Thurmond had been in the Senate 26 years when I arrived in \n1983, a brand-new member of the Armed Services Committee. He never \ntreated me as the neophyte, just-learning-the-ropes newcomer that I \nwas. From the start, I was his colleague, and he was mine. His long \nhistory of work on national defense is based on his love of this \ncountry, and his own experiences on the battlefield. Somebody thought \nhe was too old to be a paratrooper for the Normandy Landing. It is part \nof his extraordinary resume that he got an age exemption, and \nparachuted in on D-Day.\n  There is no one quite like him. I have appreciated his friendship \nfrom my first day here, and, with my colleagues, will feel a great pang \nof loss when the new Congress opens in January and he will not take his \nseat as a Senator from South Carolina.\n  I think all of us recall those lines from ``Hamlet'' when we think \nabout our friend and his remarkable life. ``He was a man, take him for \nall in all/I ensure shall not look upon his like again.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak for as much time as I may consume. I estimate I will need 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in saluting the senior \nSenator from South Carolina, Mr. Thurmond, as he prepares to celebrate \nhis 100th birthday. James Strom Thurmond is not just a man who is loved \nby\n\n[[Page S9072]]\n\nthe people of South Carolina, who elected him to a remarkable eight \nterms to the Senate, but he is a man who is respected and admired by \nthis body and institution in which he serves.\n  Others who have spoken, who are much more senior to me, have \nrecounted his distinguished careers, stories, the elections, the \nchanges in our country over the years, and also the positive changes in \nSenator Thurmond as he has moved forward with America and the times, in \nmaking sure that all Americans have opportunities in education, to \ncompete and succeed in life.\n  I find it interesting that he was the first person in 1954 to ever be \nelected to a national office by a write-in vote. The people of South \nCarolina elected Strom Thurmond to the Senate by a write-in vote. At \nthat time, I was not paying too much attention to politics since I was \nonly 2 years old when he won that election.\n  There are a lot of stories to tell and a lot of impressions have been \nmade in the short time I have been in the Senate. I knew I had come to \na very special place when the first meeting of the Republican Senate \ncaucus was singing happy birthday for Senator Thurmond's 98th birthday, \nand I was thinking of all the stories of Strom Thurmond, this living \nlegend. That day we also had a very rancorous debate on different \npositions, the policy chairman, the Senate Republican chair. There were \npeople giving nominating speeches and seconding speeches, and it was \ntough to choose among friends, but we finally decided who the policy \nchair was and the Republican Senate chair. There were all of these \ncontests and seconding speeches.\n  At the end, Leader Lott said: We have to also elect the Senate \nPresident pro tempore and, of course, that is going to be Strom \nThurmond. There were no nominating speeches and no seconding speeches. \nEveryone rose and said ``aye.''\n  Strom then stood up, and this was the extent of Strom's speech: Thank \nyou all. You are darn smart people. And that is how Strom was easily \nelected.\n  There are so many memories of Strom Thurmond in the Allen family. I \nremember my mother always talking about dancing with Strom Thurmond. \nWhenever we bring up the Senate, she says: I danced with Strom \nThurmond. She says it every time I bring up the Senate, and this was \nback in the 1970s. I know there are a lot of ladies' hearts that have \nfluttered over the years with the wonderful privilege of dancing with \nStrom Thurmond.\n  My wife's family, the Brown family, is from South Carolina. Of \ncourse, he is revered as a hero in South Carolina, as he is all across \nthe country but especially in South Carolina. Any time any of that \nfamily in South Carolina had a wedding, a birthday or a birth, Strom \nThurmond was there congratulating them on that wonderful event.\n  I also have the privilege of being assigned to an office in the \nRussell building that is in the same hallway as Strom Thurmond. I see \nStrom as he makes it to every vote. I see him on the elevator as we go \nto the trolley to get to the Chamber. He is always smiling. He is \nalways cheerful. He is always in a good mood.\n\n  This year we all were blessed with those good South Carolina peaches \nto make sure we are all getting a good healthy diet. I was commenting \nabout the great peaches and I said, most of my staff took those \npeaches, and Strom said: Well, get that boy another bag of those South \nCarolina peaches. So our family was able to enjoy those wonderful \npeaches.\n  Last year, we had the national D-day memorial in Bedford County, VA, \nwhich had the highest per capita loss of life in the D-day invasion. It \nwas a wonderful event. The President was there. The Ambassador from \nFrance was there. It was a wonderful ceremony. Strom Thurmond was \nthere. Strom Thurmond was one of those brave soldiers who obviously \nstormed those beaches and fortunately survived the Normandy invasion on \nD-day. I will say the President received a slightly bigger cheer, but \nevery single person who was there, those thousands and thousands of \npeople loved seeing Strom Thurmond, a true American hero, in Bedford \nfor that celebration and dedication of the national D-day memorial.\n  The point is, Strom Thurmond is an inspiration to many of us for many \ndifferent reasons. While we all aspire to achieve such longevity, we \nadmire Strom Thurmond for a life lived fully and in the advancement of \npublic service. As Senator Thurmond reaches his centenarian status \nlater this year, on behalf of all the good people of Virginia, I offer \nmy best wishes to him, his family, and his constituents.\n  There will never be another Strom Thurmond. Nevertheless, I hope and \npray God will continue to bless America with people who have Strom \nThurmond's cheerfulness and devotion, and I surely hope we are blessed \nwith people of his character.\n  It is great to be a Senator from Virginia, but it is truly an honor \nto serve with Senator Thurmond. I shall always and forever cherish the \nmemories of your smiling, twinkling eyes which reveal your happy heart. \nYou have been a great soldier, a great Senator, and a great leader. I \nthank God for blessing us with people of your character.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is consent required to make my remarks?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to proceed \nfor 7 minutes in my tribute to our retiring Senator, Mr. Thurmond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, what is perhaps more amazing than Strom \nThurmond's record length of service in the Senate is how he made it \nhere in the first place.\n  Strom Thurmond was the first and only American ever elected to the \nSenate as a write-in candidate. The dizzying prospect of waging a \nwrite-in campaign strikes fear into any aspiring or incumbent \npolitician. After all, getting voters to the polls is one thing. \nGetting voters to go the extra mile and write in a name not listed on \nthe ballot is a wholly different beast.\n  So once one knows that in 1954, Strom was able to inspire a majority \nof South Carolina voters to write him into the Senate, and into the \nhistory books, it makes perfect sense why he also ended up as our \nNation's longest serving Senator.\n  Today, of course, it is Strom's record-setting tenure that has \ncaptivated American political and popular culture. Turn the page of any \nmagazine or the dial of any radio and, eventually, you will find \nAmericans holding up Strom as the benchmark to near-immortality.\n  For years, Senator Thurmond has attributed his age-defying \nachievements to ``diet, exercise, and an optimistic attitude.'' Well, I \ndug a little deeper reading old clips on the advice he has given to \nfriends and colleagues so I could try and piece together a more \nspecific and exhaustive answer.\n  After sleuthing around a bit, here is the ``simple'' formula I can \npass along: Begin your mornings with 20 minutes of calisthenics, 50 \npushups, 10 minutes of weightlifting, and 20 minutes on a exercise \nbike. Oh, and swim a half mile twice a week; eat half of a banana, four \nprunes, a handful of grapes, blueberries, peaches, egg whites, a glass \nof Orange Juice, and a glass of prune juice; inherit good genes; \nabstain from fried or fatty foods. But eat lots of chicken, fish, and \nall kinds of seafood; abstain from caffeine; abstain from sugars; \nabstain from smoking.\n  But beneath all the rubble surrounding ``Strom's Secrets,'' one \ningredient stands out above all others. In an editorial celebrating the \nSenator's 99th birthday, the Rock Hill Herald revealed Strom's secret \nto longevity as ``his determination to serve South Carolina as long as \nhe's able.''\n  I believe that this sentiment more than the prune juice or the push-\nups best explains Strom's record-setting service to South Carolina, \nfrom a small-town school superintendent among the peach groves of tiny \nEdgefield, SC, to almost a half a century in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, as I said, the year Senator Thurmond came to this body \non a write-in--a most astonishing thing because no other Senator in \nAmerican history has ever been elected to the Senate by a write-in--I \nwas playing Little League baseball in Augusta, GA, across the Savannah \nRiver from Senator Thurmond's hometown of Aiken. I confess I was not \nfollowing politics all that carefully at age 12, but\n\n[[Page S9073]]\n\nI do remember my parents talking about Senator Thurmond's astonishing \naccomplishment right across the river in South Carolina, having been \nelected to the Senate on a write-in ballot.\n  As I grew older and began to pay attention to Government and politics \nin America, I began to realize Strom Thurmond was something quite \nspecial. When I came to the Senate in 1984, 40 years after my parents \ntelling me about Senator Thurmond winning on a write-in, I knew \ninstantly I was in the presence of a legend, as we all have been who \nhave had the privilege of being a Member of this body at the same time \nas the senior Senator from South Carolina.\n  There will literally never be another American like Senator Thurmond. \nWe all know he was too old for World War II, he did not have to go, but \nat age 42, as Senator Allen just made reference to, Senator Thurmond \nwas there on D-day. In fact, he was in one of those gliders the night \nof D-day. Last year, we had an opportunity to see ``Band of Brothers'' \non HBO about the 101st and its experience from D-day through the end of \nwar. I watched every segment of that. In addition to what I was viewing \non the television screen, I thought mostly about our colleague and his \nharrowing experience of going in the night of D-day on a glider. He did \ncrack up, and as we all know, he was able to walk away and survive the \ncrackup and survive the war and become an American hero.\n  Not many of us are ever going to be legends, and almost none of us \nare going to be legends in our own time. The Senator from South \nCarolina has lived long enough to observe his own legendary status, \nwhich is a truly remarkable thing. We will never, ever, see another \nStrom Thurmond. He is unique in the annals of American history.\n  I want to say to you, Senator Thurmond, as a son of the South myself, \nsomebody who was born in Alabama and then migrated north to Kentucky--\nmost people think of Kentucky as south, but for us it was north--and \nhaving lived in Georgia when you were first elected on a write-in, I \nwant to say to you that you have been an inspiration to me and an \ninspiration to many of us in the deep South who have been so proud of \nyou and your enormous accomplishments over the years.\n  I extend my congratulations to Senator Thurmond on his pending \nbirthday, reaching 100 years of age. In fact, I had the Today show on \nthis morning and Willard mentioned you, Senator Thurmond. He is working \nup to celebrating your 100th birthday in December and, of course, \nfinishing up your term. You have had a truly remarkable career that \nwill never be equaled in this body. My congratulations to you and our \nbest wishes for the future.\n  So, Senator, today I raise my voice--joining the chorus of so many \nother voices--to pay my fondest farewell to your tireless and timeless \ndedication to serving the families of the great Palmetto State.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/24/senate-section/article/S9073-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9073-S9082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO SENATOR STROM THURMOND\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I apologize. I was not able to be here this \nmorning when the Senators expressed their words and thoughts about our \nwonderful colleague, Strom Thurmond, who is retiring from the Senate \nthis year. I wanted to join in the particular tribute in saying to him \nand the people of South Carolina and the rest of our colleagues \nsomething we all feel, regardless of the disagreements we may have had \non substantive policy matters, Strom Thurmond is truly an American \ninstitution in many ways.\n  I cannot even begin to imagine the U.S. Senate without this \nremarkable individual in our presence. For nearly 50 years--almost a \nquarter of the life of this country--through 10 Presidential \nadministrations, Strom Thurmond has been an institution in the Chamber \nof the Senate. Eight Senators serving today were not yet born when \nStrom Thurmond was first elected to the Senate in 1954.\n  It is not the fact that Senator Thurmond has served the Senate longer \nthan any other Senator in our Nation's history that makes him unique. \nIt has been, in my view, Strom Thurmond's fascinating journey through \nlife that makes him unique. His story is truly a unique American story.\n  In the course of his nearly 100 years, Strom Thurmond has been a \nteacher, judge, combat hero, Governor, winner of the Presidential Medal \nof Freedom, and, of course, a Senator. In more than 20 years of our \nserving together, I have not always agreed with Senator Thurmond, as I \nknow many of my colleagues have not over the years, but he has always \nbeen a true embodiment of the ``way of the Senate,''--always \nthoughtful, always respectful, and always deliberative. In short, he \nhas been a great Senate colleague.\n  My father, Senator Thomas Dodd, served with Senator Thurmond for 12 \nyears. I have served with him for 20. That is 32 of his almost 50 \nyears. They, too, had their differences, but they had tremendous \nrespect for one another and were very good friends. My family will \nalways think of Strom Thurmond not simply as a friend but as a loyal \nfriend to the Dodd family.\n  I believe that no matter what your ideology or political persuasion, \none cannot look upon the life of Strom Thurmond without concluding that \nit is in so many ways so remarkable.\n  What else can you say about a man who, at the age of 42, took a leave \nof absence as a Circuit Judge in South Carolina to volunteer to \nparachute behind enemy lines with the 82nd Airborne Division during the \nNormandy D-Day invasion, for which he was awarded 5 Battle Stars for \nBravery in Combat?\n  What else can you say about a man who has dedicated his entire life \nto public service, to the service of his country?\n  While never neglecting to be a stalwart in support of the state and \npeople of his beloved South Carolina, there are literally dozens upon \ndozens of schools, buildings, parks, and streets in South Carolina \nnamed after their senior Senator. Senator Strom Thurmond has never \nfailed to put America first.\n  He has always treated public service to America as a sacred \nresponsibility. In this respect, Strom Thurmond is a very, very rare \nbreed.\n  Senator Thurmond was born at the dawn of the 20th century, born to a \nvery different time; to a very different America.\n  Over the past century, America has grown as a Nation. Over the past \ncentury, America has become a more free, a more fair, and a more \ncompassionate nation.\n  And, over the past century, Senator Thurmond has also grown.\n  Senator Thurmond once said, ``People evolve. They reach a higher \ntruth in life.''\n  Strom Thurmond lived through the entire 20th century, a century which \nbegan with two world wars and ended with a triumph of democracy.\n  It was a century of enormous political and social upheaval, but it \nwas also a century of enormous progress and enlightenment.\n  Strom Thurmond was not just witness to the entire 20th century, he \nwas a full participant.\n  His journey mirrored America's journey.\n  And now, at the dawn of a new century, Strom Thurmond is still a \nparticipant in America's journey.\n  In closing I would just like to tell Strom Thurmond that his lifetime \nof service to his country, and his nearly 50 years in the United States \nSenate, is greatly appreciated, and will be sorely missed.\n  Strom, it is an honor and a privilege working with you, and I will \nmiss you very, very much.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, several of our colleagues made some \nremarks concerning our esteemed friend and colleague, Senator Strom \nThurmond. I wish to join them in that effort.\n  Strom Thurmond, by the end of this year, will complete 48 years in \nthe Senate--eight terms in the Senate. I will be completing four terms, \nand it is mind-boggling to think someone would complete eight, 48 years \nin the Senate. He was elected to the Senate in 1954 and has served this \nbody with great distinction and honor during that time.\n  Prior to that time, he was also Governor of South Carolina. Even \nbefore that, he was one of the heroes, in my opinion, who actually \nhelped liberate Europe going into Normandy. He actually parachuted into \nNormandy behind enemy lines. He earned 18 decorations for his service, \nincluding the Purple Heart.\n\n[[Page S9074]]\n\n  He is an outstanding hero, American, Governor, Senator, serving 48 \nyears in the Senate. He has had a wealth of experience.\n  I remember my first contact with Senator Thurmond is when he called \nme to congratulate me upon my election in 1980 and urged me to serve on \nthe Judiciary Committee, which I respectfully declined, but I found it \nwas hard to turn down Strom Thurmond. He has been a very close \nconfidante and friend.\n  My daughter had the privilege of working for him for a short period \nof time, and she considers that a highlight in her career as well.\n  He served both as chairman of the Armed Services Committee and also \nthe Judiciary Committee. He served with distinction and honor. He has \nbrought great pride to the Senate. He is the Senator's Senator, and I \njoin my colleagues in saying that we have the greatest esteem and \nrespect for Senator Strom Thurmond.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Senator Strom Thurmond achieved more \nbefore middle age than many of us achieve in a lifetime. Born in 1902, \nSenator Thurmond in 1933 was already a State senator in South Carolina. \nIn 1938, he was a State court judge. From 1942 to 1946, he served in \nWorld War II, landing on the beach in Normandy on D-day with the 82nd \nAirborne Division and earning numerous decorations, medals and awards. \nIn 1947, the year he turned 45, he was the Governor of South Carolina. \nIn 1954, when he was elected to the Senate, he already had a full \nhistory of serving the public, especially the people of his beloved \nhome State of South Carolina. In the Senate, Senator Thurmond has \ndemonstrated a keen political instinct and achieved a legendary \nreputation for constituent service. The people of South Carolina know \nSenator Thurmond will treat them royally--a standard I try to emulate \nfor my own constituents. Senator Thurmond's imprint on the Senate is \nwith this institution forever.\n  Senator Thurmond is responsible for one of the highlights of my \nSenate service. In 1980, soon after I was first elected to the Senate, \nSenator Thurmond was becoming chairman of the Judiciary Committee. He \nasked me to join the committee. I explained I wasn't a lawyer, but he \nexplained I didn't need to be. Senator Thurmond promised to get me good \nstaff to help me with the technical points of Judiciary Committee work. \nHe delivered on that promise, and I thoroughly enjoy serving on the \nJudiciary Committee. I hope to continue serving on that committee as \nlong as I'm a member of the Senate, although of course I won't serve as \nlong as Senator Thurmond. I appreciate Senator Thurmond's support of me \nas a freshman Senator, and an unknown quantity, by giving me the \nopportunity to join his committee. I hope I haven't disappointed him.\n  As a farm State Senator, I seek like-minded Senators to support the \nsurvival of family farmers. Senator Thurmond has always supported any \nefforts to advance this cause. He comes from a largely agricultural \nState, and he understands how family farmers not only feed the world, \nbut also make up part of the fabric of American life. I'm grateful to \nhave served with Senator Thurmond over the years, and to continue \nserving with him.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak in honor of my good \nfriend--and legend--the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, \nStrom Thurmond.\n  From the moment Strom Thurmond set foot in this Chamber in 1954, he \nhas been setting records. He was the only person ever elected to the \nSenate on a write-in-vote. He set the record for the longest speech on \nthe Senate floor, clocked at an astounding 24 hours and 18 minutes. He \nis the longest serving Senator in the history of the Senate. As he \napproaches his 100th birthday, he is also the oldest serving Senator. \nMany of my colleagues will recall the momentous occasion in September \nof 1998 when he cast his 15,000th vote in the Senate. With these and so \nmany other accomplishments over the years, he has appropriately been \nreferred to as ``an institution within an institution.''\n  In 1902, the year Strom Thurmond was born, life expectancy was 51 \nyears--and today it is 77 years. Strom continues to prove that, by any \nmeasure, he is anything but average.\n  He has seen so much in his life. To provide some context, let me \npoint out that, since his birth, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, Alaska \nand Hawaii gained statehood, and 11 amendments were added to the \nConstitution. The technological advancements he has witnessed, from the \nautomobile to the airplane to the Internet, literally span a century of \nprogress. Conveniences we have come to take for granted today were not \nalways part of Strom Thurmond's world. Perhaps this explains why, \nduring Judiciary Committee hearings, he has been heard asking witnesses \nwho were too far away from the microphone to ``please speak into the \nmachine.''\n  The story of his remarkable political career truly could fill several \nvolumes. It began with a win in 1928 for the Edgefield County \nSuperintendent of Schools. Eighteen years later, he was Governor of \nSouth Carolina. Strom was even a Presidential candidate in 1948, \nrunning on the ``Dixiecrat'' ticket against Democrat Harry Truman.\n  I must admit, Mr. President, that he has come a long way in his \npolitical career, given that he originally came to the Senate as a \nDemocrat. I am happy to say that wisdom came within a few short years \nwhen Strom saw the light and joined the Republican Party.\n  When I first arrived in the Senate in January of 1977, he was my \nmentor. As my senior on the Judiciary Committee, it was Strom Thurmond \nwho helped me find my way and learn how the committee functioned. He \nhas not only been a respected colleague, but a personal friend, ever \nsince.\n  During his tenure as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Strom \nThurmond left an indelible mark on the committee and the laws that came \nthrough it. He became known and respected for many fine qualities and \npositions--his devotion to the Constitution, his toughness on crime, \nhis sense of fairness.\n  He is also famous for his incredible grip. Many of us in this Chamber \nhave experienced Strom Thurmond holding our arm tightly as he explains \na viewpoint and asks for our support. I might add that this can be a \nvery effective approach.\n  Strom is also known to have a kind word or greeting for everyone who \ncomes his way, and for being extremely good to his staff. Despite his \npower and influence, he has never forgotten the importance of small \nacts of kindness. For example, whenever he eats in the Senate Dining \nRoom, he grabs two fistfuls of candy. When he returns to the floor of \nthe Senate, he hands the candy out to the Senate Pages. Unfortunately, \nit is usually melted into a kaleidoscope of sugar by then! I have a \nfeeling that the Pages prefer it when Strom takes them out for ice \ncream.\n  Strom Thurmond is truly a legend--someone to whom the people of South \nCarolina owe an enormous debt of gratitude for all his years of \nservice. Clearly, the people of South Carolina recognize the sacrifices \nhe has made and are grateful for all he has done for them. In fact, you \ncannot mention the name Strom Thurmond in South Carolina without the \naudience bursting into spontaneous applause. He truly is an American \npolitical icon.\n  Abraham Lincoln once said that ``The better part of one's life \nconsists of friendships.'' With a friend like Strom Thurmond, this \nsentiment couldn't be more true. I am a great admirer of Strom \nThurmond, and I am proud to call him my friend.\n  Mr. President, one final note about Strom Thurmond: He is a great \npatriot. I am grateful for his work with me over the years in support \nof a constitutional flag amendment. A decorated veteran of World War II \nwho fought at Normandy on D-day, Strom Thurmond loves this country. Let \nme close by saying that this country loves him, too.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate my dear \nfriend and colleague Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina for his \n48 years of service to this country.\n  Senator Thurmond was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1954, as the \nfirst person in U.S. history to be elected to a major office by a \nwrite-in ballot. As the longest serving Senator in the Senate, Strom \nhas been a part of a lot of firsts in our Nation's history and he has \ncontributed to every major policy issue facing this country for the \nlast half century. He is a true legend.\n  Strom has been a respected authority on military issues. He served in\n\n[[Page S9075]]\n\nWorld War II, fighting in 5 battles, including the Normandy Invasion, \nand received 18 decorations, medals, and awards, including the Purple \nHeart, the Bronze Star for Valor, and the Legion of Merit With Oak Leaf \ncluster. In 1959, Strom attained the rank of major general. He has been \na member of the Senate Armed Services Committee since 1959. His \nexpertise in military issues has been a great benefit to our men and \nwomen in uniform.\n  His love for the state of South Carolina has been a guiding force in \nhis life. He has been a coach, an educator, an attorney, a State \nsenator, a judge, a Governor, and, most importantly, an impeccable \nleader for the people of South Carolina.\n  Strom has not only been a remarkable Senator, but an even better \nAmerican. I know I speak for all my colleagues here in the Senate when \nI say that he will be missed.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, it is with great pride and honor that I \nrise today amongst my fellow colleagues to honor one of America's \nfinest citizens, Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina.\n  When I look at Strom's career and all that he has accomplished \nthroughout his life, I often find myself wondering how one man could \npossibly do so much in just one lifetime. Strom Thurmond truly deserves \nthe title of Renaissance man. He has been a farmer, a teacher, a \nlawyer, a judge, an author, a Governor, a war veteran, a major general \nin the U.S. Army Reserves, a State senator, a U.S. Senator, a Democrat, \na Dixiecrat, a Republican, a husband and a father.\n  Since 1954, when he ran and won a seat in the Senate as a write-in \ncandidate, Strom Thurmond has worked tirelessly and selflessly for the \npeople of South Carolina and the citizens of this great Nation, casting \nmore than 15,000 votes in his time in the Senate.\n  I now ask that my fellow members of the Senate join me in thanking \nand honoring our good friend and colleague for all that he has done \nthroughout his life and throughout his tenure in the Senate. His \nbrilliance, leadership and unmatched wit will be sorely missed by this \nlegislative body and by the entire Nation. But we will always hold on \nto the many memories and stories he left behind.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the senior \nSenator from South Carolina, Mr. Strom Thurmond. Not only is Senator \nThurmond the oldest Member ever to serve in the Senate, and the longest \nserving member, his entire life has been dedicated to service to his \ncountry. At the age of 21, in 1924, Senator Thurmond was commissioned a \nsecond lieutenant in the U.S. Army Reserves. At the age of 26, he was \nserving as the Superintendent of Education in Edgefield County, SC. \nFrom there he went on to serve as a State Senator, and then as Circuit \nJudge of South Carolina, a position he left to serve his country during \nWorld War II. For his military service, he earned a total of 18 \ndifferent medals, decorations, and awards. He served as the Governor of \nSouth Carolina, and while serving, he ran for President as the head of \nthe third party States Rights Democrats. He received 39 electoral \nvotes, the third largest ever for an independent party candidate. Then \nin 1954, he was elected to the Senate as a write-in candidate, the \nfirst person ever to be elected to the Senate as a write-in candidate.\n  Senator Thurmond's career as a member of the Senate has been not only \nlong but distinguished. He served as either chairman or ranking member \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee for 12 years and he served as either \nchairman or ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee for 6 \nyears. In fact, he has served on the Armed Services Committee for the \nlast 43 years, where he has been a leader in promoting a strong \nnational defense.\n  So while we do well to recognize his extraordinary years of service \nto the Senate, it is worth remembering that Senator Thurmond is the \nperfect example of a true statesman a man who has dedicated his life to \nserving his country in any way possible, in all branches of government, \nin times of war and in times of peace. Senator Thurmond has set an \nexample not only as a great Senator, but as a great citizen of this \ncountry, and it is for that reason that we are here to pay tribute, to \ndemonstrate our respect, and to offer our thanks.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am pleased to take this opportunity to \npay tribute to the remarkable life of Senator Strom Thurmond of South \nCarolina.\n  On December 5, 2002, Senator Thurmond will turn 100 years old, \nanother amazing milestone for an indefatigable public servant. \nThroughout his historic years of service in the Senate, he has \ndistinguished himself through his energy, his spirited patriotism, and \nhis dedication to excellence. Every Member of this body counts him as a \nfriend and as an inspiration.\n  Beginning his public service career in 1923 as a teacher and athletic \ncoach, he became the superintendent of education in Edgefield County, \nSC. He was elected to the State senate at the young age of 31 and later \nserved as a Circuit Judge of South Carolina.\n  He left the judicial bench in 1942 to fight in World War II where he \nparachuted into Normandy on D-day with the 82nd Airborne Division. He \nserved in the Civil Affairs section of the First Army headquarters \nwhere he was awarded five Battle Stars, the Legion of Merit with Oak \nLeaf Cluster, a Bronze Star for Valor, the Purple Heart, the Belgian \nOrder of the Crown, and the French Croix de Guerre. Upon his return to \nSouth Carolina, he served as Governor before he was elected to the \nSenate in 1954.\n  Strom Thurmond's career as a Senator has been distinguished by love \nof his country and all the possibilities he has envisioned for it. His \nlongevity and strength are a result of his determination to further his \nideals, his commitment to personal fitness, and his devotion to serve \nthe people of South Carolina.\n  Senator Thurmond's influence has been felt throughout the Senate, but \nit has been particularly noteworthy in his leadership on the Armed \nServices, Judiciary, and Veterans' Affairs Committees. In recent years, \nas President Pro Tempore, he set an example for us all with his \nthoughtful wit, his constancy, and his obvious love for the Senate and \nits institutions.\n  Senator Thurmond is a statesman whose retirement from this Chamber \nwill leave the Senate a diminished place. I am pleased to join with my \nSenate colleagues in acclaiming his lifetime of service to America.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in congratulating the \nsenior Senator from South Carolina, our esteemed colleague and a \nlegendary public servant, as we honor his service to America and his \nbeloved constituents in South Carolina.\n  When the 107th Congress adjourns sine die later this year, it will \nend another chapter in the life and legendary public service of Senator \nThurmond. For almost 48 years, Strom Thurmond has been an important \nperson in the life of the Senate. Indeed, December 24, 2002, will mark \nthe 48th anniversary of Senator Thurmond arrival in the Senate after \nhis election as a write-in candidate, a feat that itself is historic \nand unprecedented. December 5, 2002, also marks another marvelous \nmilestone, Senator Thurmond's 100th birthday. In considering these \ntruly remarkable events, it is humbling to recall that Senator \nThurmond's service in the Senate is longer than the period of time that \nHawaii has been a State.\n  It is even more remarkable to consider Senator Thurmond's \naccomplishments outside of the Senate: attorney, state legislator, \njudge, decorated World War II hero and participant in the D-day \nlanding, Governor of South Carolina, husband, and father.\n  I have had the privilege of serving with Senator Thurmond during the \n12 years I have been in the Senate, the last quarter of his remarkable \ntenure, and we serve together on the Armed Services and Veterans' \nAffairs Committees. As Chairman Emeritus of both Committees, Senator \nThurmond has earned a well-deserved reputation as a determined and \npowerful advocate for our Nation's men and women in uniform and our \nveterans. His commitment to improve services, benefits, and quality of \nlife for servicemembers and veterans, and their families, is \nunwavering.\n  On a personal note, our former colleague, Senator Bob Dole, Majority \nLeader Daschle, and others have spoken about emulating Senator \nThurmond's diet and exercise regimen as a way of enjoying similar \nlongevity. I\n\n[[Page S9076]]\n\nwould like to share with my colleagues one of Senator Thurmond's \ndietary secrets: he has a fondness for Hawaiian macadamia nuts. I can \nthink of no better testimonial for the health benefits of macadamia \nnuts then the gentleman from South Carolina!\n  I thank our leaders for scheduling this time for the Senate to honor \nthe remarkable life and times of a great American patriot and a \ngentleman of the Senate, Senator Strom Thurmond.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor my colleague from \nSouth Carolina and to wish him a happy 100th birthday.\n  For the better part of the 20th century, Strom Thurmond devoted his \nlife to public service service to the people of South Carolina, service \nto his country in World War II, and service in the Senate.\n  He began his career as a teacher and coach. He became superintendent \nof education in Edgefield County. He landed at Normandy on D-day with \nthe 82nd Airborne Division, and returned home to become Governor of \nSouth Carolina.\n  In 1954, Strom Thurmond became the first Member of the Senate to win \nelection as a write-in candidate. He has spent most of his life giving \nback to the people and the places that have given him so much in life.\n  As a U.S. Senator, no one has had a more distinguished career than \nStrom Thurmond. For more than 48 years, he has been a champion for our \nveterans. Time and time again, he has fought to strengthen their \neducation and rehabilitation benefits, and to provide them with the \nbest health care and housing.\n  In the last year, he continued to do more for our military. He filed \nlegislation to ensure that disabled veterans have access to service \ndogs so that they can lead a more independent life. He has reached \nacross the aisle to end the limit on Junior ROTC programs with our \ncolleague Senator Graham from Florida.\n  He secured education benefits for our brave men and women serving in \nAfghanistan in Operation Enduring Freedom. Each effort has brought more \nhonor and dignity to the courageous men and women who give so much of \nthemselves so that we can live in freedom.\n  Just as he began his career as a teacher in 1923, I know that he was \nso very proud to support last year's ``No Child Left Behind Act.'' He \nunderstands that the best place to open a child's mind and heart to the \nopportunities that surround him or her is through education.\n  I want to take this moment to thank Senator Thurmond for supporting \nNew York during this difficult year. In the wake of massive terrorist \nattacks, Senator Thurmond stood by the people of New York and the \npeople of New York are grateful for his assistance as the city \nrebuilds.\n  Today, it gives me great pleasure to honor Strom Thurmond and to \nexpress my sincere gratitude and appreciation for all that he has done \nto improve the lives of the people he represents in South Carolina and \nevery American.\n  We are honored for his years of service and wish him a very happy \nbirthday.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am honored to join my colleagues in \nthis tribute to Senator Thurmond and his extraordinary record of \nservice to the people of South Carolina and the Nation.\n  As the longest serving member of the United States Senate in history, \nthe Senator from South Carolina cast his first vote in January 1955--\nwhen seven of his current colleagues were not even born. His election \nin 1954 was an American first. Senator Thurmond was the first person \never elected to a major office as a write-in candidate.\n  Senator Thurmond came to this body half a century ago as a man of \nhumble origins with a teacher's background and a legal education given \nto him by his father, and he has never stopped teaching and learning.\n  In the years since he first came to the Senate, he has cast over \n15,000 votes, and he has always stood up for his beliefs with a \npassionate conviction. Over the years, many of us have often disagreed \nwith him on specific issues, but we have always had great respect for \nhis ability and dedication.\n  Senator Thurmond has served our country with great dedication in the \narmed forces as well, from his early days as a Second Lieutenant in the \nArmy Reserve in 1924 to his outstanding service in the 82nd Airborne \nduring World War II. He volunteered for service immediately after the \nattack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, and piloted a glider onto the beaches \nat Normandy in 1944, earning five battle stars and numerous over medals \nfor his courage in combat.\n  I have had the honor to serve for many years with Senator Thurmond on \nboth the Armed Services Committee and the Judiciary Committee in the \nSenate, and we often worked together to meet the important challenges \nfacing our Nation.\n  Two decades ago, as members of the Judiciary Committee, we worked \ntogether for a period of several years to reform and improve the \nfederal sentencing system. Our proposal was eventually enacted as the \nSentencing Reform Act of 1984.\n  Prior to the 1984 Act, federal sentencing was famously characterized \nby Judge Marvin Frankel as a system of ``law without order.'' Judges \nhad unreviewable discretion to sentence defendants to lengthy periods \nof incarcertaion--or no incarceration at all. Gross disparities in \nsentencing were common, even within the same federal courthouse. Too \noften, those disparities were related to the race or the economic \nresources of the defendant.\n  Some thought the answer to that problem was mandatory sentencing \nlaws. But Senator Thurmond and I developed the fairer and more \neffective approach of sentencing guidelines that is used today.\n  Senator Thurmond and I came to the issue from different perspectives, \nbut we agreed on the goal of fair sentencing laws. It took several \nyears of debates, but Senator Thurmond and I stood together. Our ideas \nprevailed, and I am proud to have worked with him on this important \nreform of the Nation's criminal justice system.\n  We have worked together on the Armed Services Committee as well. \nSenator Thurmond has never forgotten the responsibility of the 82nd \nAirborne to be America's Guard, and to go ``All the Way'' in protecting \nthe rights of our men and women in uniform and our Nation's veterans.\n  From the Strom Thurmond Institute at his alma mater, Clemson \nUniversity to Strom Thurmond High School to Interstate Highway 20, also \nknown as Strom Thurmond Highway, the Senator from South Carolina has \nbeen honored by communities in his state and by the American people as \nwell. I know that all of us in the Senate commend him, as he retires \nthis year, for his long and distinguished service to the Senate and the \nNation.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it has been heartwarming to hear the \neloquent remarks about the accomplishments and career of our \ndistinguished colleague from South Carolina.\n  He has been my friend and colleague in the Senate for twenty-four \nyears. It has been a high privilege and honor to work with him and to \nlearn from his example of dedicated service to the citizens of his \nstate.\n  As this session of the Senate nears an end, it is hard to imagine \nthat it will be Senator Thurmond's last term as a United States \nSenator.\n  Since 1964, he has worked hard to strengthen and protect our country \nand defend the principles on which it was founded. He can be assured \nthat his has been a successful and remarkable career.\n  I'm proud to join others today in thanking and commending him for his \ntruly outstanding record of public service.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, born nearly a century ago, when Mark Twain \nwas alive and Teddy Roosevelt was still President, Strom Thurmond has \nled a life of public service unmatched in the modern history of \nAmerica. He has been a friend to all of the more than 400 Senators with \nwhom he has served. And he will forever be a symbol of what one person \ncan accomplish when they live life to the fullest.\n  Strom Thurmond has served in the Senate for all but four of my 50 \nyears of age. Though that is a remarkable accomplishment itself, we \nshould not forget what Strom accomplished before coming to the Senate.\n  He was a teacher, an athletic coach, and a Superintendent of \nEducation. He studied law under his father, Judge J.\n\n[[Page S9077]]\n\nWilliam Thurmond and became a City Attorney, County Attorney, State \nSenator, and, eventually, a Circuit Court Judge.\n  Though exempt from serving in the military, Strom, who had already \nbeen an army reservist and a commissioned 2nd Lieutenant by the age of \n21, volunteered for active duty on the day we entered WWII. As a member \nof the 82nd Airborne, he parachuted behind enemy lines on D-Day and \nhelped secure the foothold for the Allies to liberate the European \ncontinent.\n  For his distinguished service, Strom was awarded five Battle Stars \nand 18 other decorations, including the Legion of Merit with Oak Leaf \nCluster, the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star for Valor, the Belgian Order \nof the Crown and the French Cross of War.\n  After the war, Strom returned home to South Carolina. He was elected \nGovernor in 1946 and then ran for President of the United States as the \nStates Rights Democratic candidate. Although Harry Truman prevailed, \nStrom won four states and 39 electoral votes. That tally still stands \nas the third largest independent electoral vote in U.S. history.\n  Despite not winning the presidency, Strom was determined to serve in \nWashington. He ran for the Senate in 1954 and became the only candidate \nelected to Congress by a write-in vote in American history. Strom has \nbeen re-elected eight times since. Clearly the people of South Carolina \nvalue principle, character and courage in their leaders.\n  Though it has been more difficult in recent years for Strom to make \nit home to South Carolina, that has not stopped South Carolina from \ncoming to him. And it shouldn't. For decades Strom attended every \ncounty fair, handled every constituent request, and sent a \ncongratulatory note to every high school graduate, many of whom came to \nintern in his office.\n  It has been said that almost 70 percent of South Carolinians have met \nStrom Thurmond face-to-face.\n  Over the course of his long and distinguished career, Strom Thurmond \nhas been a witness to history. As a young man, he knew people who had \nseen Andrew Jackson, and he campaigned for the votes of men who fought \nin the Civil War. He and Herbert Hoover won their first elective office \nin the same year, 1928.\n  But Strom has more than seen history; he has written it. Not only is \nhe the oldest and long-serving Senator, he has served with about one-\nfifth of the nearly 2,000 people who have been members of the Senate \nsince 1789. And he is nearly one half the age of the United States \nConstitution itself.\n  Like the great experiment that is American democracy, Strom Thurmond \nhas certainly faced his trials, both politically and personally. Yet, \nthrough it all, he has always held tight to his principles, always \nupheld his beliefs, and always defended American values at home and \nabroad.\n  Today we say thanks to this giant of a man not only for the history \nhe has witnessed and written, but for the service his life will inspire \nfor generations to come. God bless our friend, our colleague, and the \nSenate's Icon of Time, the senior Senator from South Carolina, Strom \nThurmond.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues today \nin paying tribute to our friend from South Carolina, Senator Strom \nThurmond, who through his 48 years of distinguished service in this \nbody has given special meaning to the term Senior Senator and left an \nindelible mark on the history of this great Nation.\n  Well before Senator Strom Thurmond celebrated his 100th birthday this \nyear, he had become an institution within this institution. To many \nAmerican, that is primarily because of his much-celebrated durability. \nBut to those of us who have the privilege to work with him here in the \nCapitol, it is as much a measure of his inexhaustible amiability, the \ngraciousness and decency that have come to define Strom's way, and his \nextraordinary dedication to the people and the country he serves.\n  Senator Thurmond has been such a fixture here in the Senate, it is \neasy to forget that he led a remarkable public life long before he came \nto Washington. He began his career as a farmer, teacher, and athletic \ncoach. He was superintendent of education in his home county. He was \ntown and county attorney. He was State senator in his great State of \nSouth Carolina. He was a judge. He served in the Second World War, and \nwas part of the Normandy invasion with the 82nd Airborne. He was \nGovernor of South Carolina. And from that position of leadership he \nwent on to run for President in 1948, before getting elected to the \nSenate for the first time in 1954.\n  Since then, Senator Thurmond has had the unique distinction of having \nbeen a delegate to six national Democratic Conventions and six national \nRepublic Conventions. And he has found the time to be reelected to the \nSenate an astounding eight times, serving as an esteemed member of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee since 1959, and as President pro \ntempore of the Senate from 1981-86 and 1995-2001.\n  I have had the honor of serving with Senator Thurmond on the Armed \nServices Committee for more than a dozen of those years, and it is \nreadily apparent why the people of South Carolina--not to mention his \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle--hold him in such high regard. \nQuite simply, every day he is happy to be helping and protecting the \nsecurity of our country. Here in Washington, he has been a fierce \nprotector of his State interests. And at home he has been a gentle and \ncaring friend to his constituents, always ready to listen and willing \nto act on their behalf. It is a testament to that friendship and \nadmiration that at least 20 buildings, centers, rooms, and statues in \nSouth Carolina have been named after him. And that's not counting all \nthe streets and roads that carry the Thurmond name.\n  The long list of these accomplishments would take most Americans 300 \nhundred years to accumulate. Senator Thurmond has gotten them all under \nhis belt in a mere 100. And through it all, Senator Thurmond has grown \nnot only as a public servant and leader, but as a human being. After \nrunning for President as a State's rights candidate, he later supported \nthe renewal of the Voting Rights Act and observance of the Martin \nLuther King, Jr. holiday on behalf of his State. And today, in \nrecognition of all his hard work for all the people of South Carolina, \nhe is beloved throughout his State by constituents of all colors. That \ntransformation sends a powerful message that all of us could become \nbetter Americans and better individuals--and that the United States of \nAmerica, for all its blessings, can always become a better nation.\n  For all this, we honor Senator Thurmond as a man of iron with a heart \nof gold, who has lived a love for his country and all that makes it \nexceptional, and given not just the best of years of life but just \nabout every year of life to make his community and his country a better \nplace. The Senate will just not be the same without him. But today we \ncan and should celebrate the tremendous difference he has made. So we \nthank him for all your service and sacrifice, and wish you a long and \nhealthy retirement. God knows you have earned it.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to address homeland security.\n  No Member of this body can deny that homeland security is of the \nalmost importance at this time. We all agree that protecting Americans \nfrom further deadly terrorist attacks is, without question, our most \nurgent national priority. President Bush and the American people have \ncalled on us to act on his priority.\n  Americans cannot ignore continuing widespread threats made by \nterrorist groups throughout the world. Even in Idaho, a State that is \nmore than 2,000 miles from any of the sites of the terrorist attacks \nthat occurred on September 11, 2001, people are mindful of these new \ndangers that exist. There is a general feeling across the country that \nno one can consider themselves isolated or immune.\n  In securing our Nation and protecting the American people, we need an \napproach that is coordinated, comprehensive, and collaborative; a \nsystem that acts at Federal, State, and community levels. We are \ncapable of creating a Department of Homeland Security that protects the \nUnited States from terrorist threats while preserving American civil \nliberties on which our country was founded. It is incumbent upon us to \ncreate a dynamic, synchronized, and flexible entity, so that we can, \nindeed, facilitate the need for homeland security on a national level,\n\n[[Page S9078]]\n\nwhile at the same time meeting the challenges posed by ever-changing \nthreats made from many different fronts. We do not know where our next \nthreat will materialize and we should not withhold from the President \nthe ability to analyze and respond aggressively and dynamically as the \nsituation commands.\n  To be successful in our endeavor for national safety, the interests \nof the American people must supercede party differences; we must be \nunited as we were last September if we wish to protect the people of \nthe United States. I applaud Senator Gramm and Senator Miller for their \ntireless efforts working toward a bipartisan substitute that truly \nprovides the tools and capabilities needed by those entrusted with \ndefending the people. It is high time that the Senate move forward on \nthis legislation, following the lead of the other body, and respond to \nthe call of the American people.\n  Mr. President, I hope the Senate will support President Bush, \nallowing him the same flexibility given other presidents in times of \nwar. Our quick and aggressive action regarding Homeland Security is \nimperative; we must grant the President the power, flexibility, and \nnecessary resources to guide us through this continuing conflict. For \nas long as terrorism continues to be a worldwide scourge, threats to \nour national security should be met with the fullest and most \naggressive response. I stand with the President in his concerted effort \nto root out this evil and to bring security to our Nation.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nLieberman amendment establishing a commission to examine and report \nupon the facts and circumstances relating to the most catastrophic \nterrorist attack in the history of the United States: the September 11 \nterrorist attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center. I was a \ncosponsor of the legislation upon which this amendment is based and am \neager for the work of the commission to get underway.\n  The senseless attacks of September 11, 2001, made it clear to all \nAmericans that the United States was inadequately prepared for the \nthreats posed in a post-cold-war world. Now that the Soviet Union has \ndissolved and American relations with Russia and China have improved \nmarkedly, disparate religiously motivated non-state actors have \ndistinguished themselves as a clear and present danger to international \nstability and the security of the American homeland. The commission \nthat would be created by this amendment would go a long way in helping \nthe United States identify the causes of the September 11 disaster and \ninform the U.S. Congress as it embarks upon the difficult process of \nreorganizing our government to respond to newly recognized threats.\n  For many families that I have spoken with, the inability of the \ngovernment to provide a full accounting of the events surrounding the \ndeath of their loved ones in the September 11 attacks has added to \ntheir grief. They have requested that the government provide them with \na thorough explanation of the various factors that led to the untimely \ndeaths of their dear relatives. If the public report released by this \ncommission provides some small measure of comfort to these families, \nthen in my view, it is worthwhile.\n  But this commission is important for pragmatic as well as emotional \nreasons. Few people doubt that the terrorist attacks unmasked \nunfortunate weaknesses in the United States homeland security posture. \nIn the weeks and months following the attacks, the Congress moved \nswiftly to address some of the most obvious weakenesses. Consequently, \nthere have already been substantial changes in a variety of areas, \nranging from the formation of the Transportation Security \nAdministration to necessary adjustments in the way that the Department \nof Justice responds to new threats. But our work is far from complete.\n  It would be an unfortunate mistake to believe that the U.S. Congress \nhas already uncovered all of the missteps that allowed the horrific \ntragedy of September 11, 2001 to take place. A commission, composed of \noutside experts and government officials, will provide a nuanced \nanalysis of the myriad events related to the most catastrophic attack \non the United States in history.\n  The work of the Intelligence Committee has been entirely professional \nand profoundly important, but it is insufficient by design. The \nmistakes and miscuss relating to the September 11 attacks are not \nlimited to intelligence failures alone, but run the gamut from foreign \npolicy decisions regarding the use of American forces and aid after the \nfall of the Soviet Union to shortcomings in American law enforcement \nand immigration practices. Ultimately, an effective investigation must \nnot restrict itself simply to the operations of our intelligence-\ngathering agencies. In fact, an effective analysis should not limit \nitself to the Federal Government, but must take an incisive look at \nboth the public and private sector and at the State and national level, \nto generate recommendations that will truly address the specific and \noften esoteric factors that led to the September 11 attacks.\n\n  No committee or commission to date has been given the jurisdiction to \ntake the long view and provide a holistic evaluation of the factors \nrelating to and the issues surrounding the most devastating attack in \nAmerican history. The commission that would be created by this \namendment would provide a level of scrutiny and self-reflection that is \nurgently needed after an event of the magnitude and the scope of the \nSeptember 11 disaster.\n  Just 11 days after Pearl Harbor was bombed in 1941, the U.S. Congress \npassed legislation creating the Roberts Commission, a commission to \ndetermine, in the words of historian Gordon Prange, ``whether \n`derelictions of duty' or `errors of judgment' had influenced the \nJapanese at Pearl Harbor and, if so, who was responsible.'' The \ncommission then made a series of recommendations designed to improve \nAmerican security.\n  The September 11 disaster is no less significant and has no fewer \nramifications than the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor. The President \nhas correctly characterized the international fight against terrorism \nas a war. As we embarked on World War II, we established a commission \nto analyze the Pearl Harbor attack. Similarly, as we embark on the war \non terrorism, we must establish a commission to analyze the September \n11 attacks.\n  It is essential that Congress know what went wrong so the United \nStates can plan for the future. Weaknesses must be shored up, gaps must \nbe filled, and oversights must be rectified.\n  Above all, this amendment would represent an important step in \nrealizing the ultimate goal of all Americans, both Democrat and \nRepublican alike: to ensure that an event like September 11 never \nhappens again.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Senator Lieberman's amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, at the close of the 107th Congress, the \nSenate will lose a legend, a colleague who has served more than 40 \nyears in the U.S. Senate, cast more than 15,000 votes and achieved the \nrecord as the longest-serving Member in this body.\n  Perhaps most notably, our colleague, on his retirement, will have \ncompleted the lengthiest record of public service on behalf of our \ncountry. Senator Thurmond has served his community as an educator; the \nState as State senator, judge, and Governor; and our Nation in World \nWar II in both the European and Pacific theaters, an Army Reservist for \n36 years, as a candidate for President and as U.S. Senator. This record \nof service spans a period of more than 80 years.\n  Remarks by Senator Thurmond at the time of his swearing-in ceremony \nfor his seventh term in 1997 express succinctly his views and \ncommitment to public service. At the time he said, ``there is no more \nrewarding endeavor than public service, and without question, the more \nthan 40 years I have spent in the U.S. Senate have been among the \nhappiest of my life.''\n  As I review Senator Thurmond's record of service, and reflect on his \nservice in the Senate and to our country, few Americans have had the \nopportunity to witness and shape history as he has. Senator Thurmond's \nachievements in the military and on defense matters serve to underscore \nthis point.\n  Senator Thurmond is a veteran who served in World War II during some \nof the most difficult combat of the war. He parachuted into Normandy on \nD-Day with the 82nd Airborne Division, earning 5 battle stars and 18 \ndecorations including the Purple Heart, the\n\n[[Page S9079]]\n\nLegion of Merit, Belgian Order of the Crown and French Croix de Guerre \nduring his service. Following WW II, Senator Thurmond continued his \nmilitary career by serving in the Army Reserves for many years. During \nthis period, he attained the rank of major general.\n  Knowing the face of battle, Thurmond never forgot the importance \nmaintaining a strong defense and especially of taking care of our \nmilitary personnel. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee \nsince 1959, and chairman of the committee for a number of years during \nthe 1990s, Senator Thurmond made certain that the needs of our military \nwere met. He had a special concern for junior enlisted personnel and \nnon-commissioned officers along with the welfare of their families.\n  This concern was clearly demonstrated by his efforts during Senate \nconsideration of the National Defense Authorization Act of FY 1999. In \nthis Act, a number of provisions were incorporated that significantly \nimprove benefits for military personnel. Were it not for Senator \nThurmond's leadership on military personnel issues, our Armed Forces \nwould unquestionably not be receiving the benefits that they should and \nare entitled to receive. I am pleased that the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for FY 1999 bears his name. It is a fitting tribute \nto an individual who cared so much for our military personnel.\n  There is so much that can be said about Senator Thurmond and his many \ncontributions to our country. He was an 82nd Airborne paratrooper with \na remarkable service record in World War II, a disabled veteran, an \neducator, and a distinguished public servant at all levels of \ngovernment. Unquestionably, Senator Thurmond deserves our respect. It \nis my hope that younger Americans will have opportunities to learn \nabout Senator Thurmond's career and accomplishments. I have been \nprivileged to serve with Senator Thurmond and thank him for his \nservice.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to honor South Carolina's senior \nSenator Strom Thurmond. Senator Thurmond will turn 100 on December 5. \nOnly 126 years before Senator Thurmond's birth, the United States of \nAmerica gained its independence; 37 years before Senator Thurmond was \nborn, the Civil War ended; and when he was a year old, Wright brothers \nengineered the first flight from Kitty Hawk. Senator Thurmond made a \ncommitment at an early age to serve the interests and needs of our \nNation. His life is full of our country's history, and he has made our \ncountry his life.\n  Since his days as a school teacher and athletic coach in the early \n1920's Senator Thurmond has continued to be a leader and serve the \ninterests of our country well above his own. Senator Thurmond served on \nactive duty with the U.S. Army in World War II. He was a judge at that \ntime, so he was exempt from military service. But Senator Thurmond \nvolunteered, and as a 41-year-old Lt. Colonel, dropped behind enemy \nlines on D-Day in Normandy with the 82nd Airborne Division. During his \n36 years of distinguished military service in the Active and Reserve \nArmy, he was awarded five Battle Stars and 15 decorations, medals and \nother awards.\n  Senator Thurmond carried his military experience to the Senate and \nquickly became a respected leader advocating a strong national defense \nfor America. As a major general in the U.S. Army Reserve and a WWII \ncombat vet, his contributions to the Armed Service Committee since 1959 \nhave provided a strong voice on the needs of our service men and women \nand a first-hand perspective on the realities of war. Senator Thurmond \nhas also used his experience in law and in the military through his \nlong-standing leadership on the Veterans Affairs and Judiciary \nCommittees.\n  Senator Thurmond will be missed in the Senate as a friend, a leader, \na colleague and for his tremendous contributions to our Nation. He is \nhistory in motion. Senator Thurmond was born during the Presidency of \nanother fearless leader, Theodore Roosevelt. President Theodore \nRoosevelt once said, ``We have got but one life here. It pays, no \nmatter what comes after it, to try and do things, to accomplish things \nin this life and not merely to have a soft and pleasant time.'' Senator \nThurmond's life is an accomplishment of great leadership and \nselflessness. We are all grateful for his service to our country and I \nam proud to have served with him.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in \npaying tribute to Senator Strom Thurmond and honoring him for his \nunparalleled record of public service to this Nation.\n  No Senator serving today can appreciate what this body will be like \nwhen Strom Thurmond leaves at the end of this year because Senator \nThurmond has served longer in this body than any other Senator in \nhistory. His 48 years in the United States Senate have spanned the \nterms of 10 Presidents of the United States, and he keeps pictures of \nall 10 of those Presidents on the wall in his office.\n  Senator Thurmond's extraordinary private and public lives span the \ntwentieth century. He began his political career in 1929 as the \nSuperintendent of Education in Edgefield, SC. In 1933, he became a \nState Senator. In 1946, he was elected Governor of South Carolina. In \n1948, while he was still Governor, he ran for President as a State's \nRight Democrat and received 39 electoral votes, the third best showing \nby an independent candidate in U.S. history.\n  Senator Thurmond was elected to the Senate in 1954 as a write-in \ncandidate, the first person ever elected to major office by this \nmethod. But true to a campaign pledge he made, he resigned in 1956 to \neschew the advantages of incumbency before running successfully for re-\nelection. In 1964, he left the Democratic Party and became a Goldwater \nRepublican, presaging, or perhaps, ushering in, GOP gains in the South. \nHe has served as a delegate to 6 Democratic and nine Republican \nNational Conventions, a distinction I doubt anyone else shares.\n  When I joined the Army Services Committee in 1979, Senator Thurmond \nhad already served on the Committee for 20 years. His love for and \ndedication to the United States military goes back even further, \nthough, to his commission as an Army Reserve second lieutenant of \ninfantry in 1924 at the age of 21. He served with distinction in both \nthe European and Pacific Theaters in the Second World War, receiving \nnumerous decorations that include the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star \nmedal with ``V'' device, the Army Commendation Medal, the Belgian Order \nof the Crown, and the French Croix de Guerre. He landed in a glider on \nNormandy with the 82nd Airborne Division on D-Day, and went on to win 5 \nbattle stars. In 1959, the year that he joined the Senate Armed Service \nCommittee, Senator Thurmond was promoted to major general in the United \nStates Army Reserve.\n  During Senator Thurmond's tenure on the Armed Services Committee, our \nArmed Forces have faced challenge after challenge in Western Europe, \nVietnam, the Middle East, the Caribbean basin, the Persian Gulf, the \nBalkans, and Afghanistan. Through it all, Senator Thurmond has \npersevered in his unwavering support for our men and women in uniform. \nHe steadfast commitment to our national defense has been a rock upon \nwhich we could all rely and has helped ensure that our military has \nalways been ready to answer the call whenever and wherever needed.\n  Senator Thurmond served as Chairman of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee in the 104th and 105th Congresses. I had the honor and \npleasure to serve as his Ranking Member in 1997 and 1998. I know from \npersonal experience how seriously Senator Thurmond treated his duties \nas Chairman and how hard he worked to be fair and even-handed with \nevery Member of the Committee. I am sure that I speak for all of our \ncolleagues in saying just how much we appreciate not only the \ncommitment that Senator Thurmond brought to his duties as Chairman, but \nalso his lifelong dedication to the defense of our Nation and to the \nwelfare of the men and women in uniform.\n  As the Ranking Member of the Armed Services Committee in 1997 and \n1998, it was a great personal pleasure for me to work with Senator \nThurmond in producing the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \nYear 1998 and the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 1999. When Senator Thurmond leaves our Committee and the \nSenate at the end of this Congress, we will miss his warmth, his sense \nof humor, and his\n\n[[Page S9080]]\n\ntremendous dedication to our national security.\n  In my 24 years of service with Strom Thurmond, I have never known him \nto be anything other than unfailingly optimistic, always courteous, and \never-thoughtful of his Senate colleagues and their families. It is a \npleasure to join all of my colleagues today in honoring and thanking \nthis remarkable man, my friend, for his lifetime of service to his \ncountry.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to join my esteemed \ncolleagues in honoring Senator Strom Thurmond and his lifetime of \nservice to South Carolina and our Nation.\n  A career like that of the senior Senator from South Carolina will \nalmost certainly never be duplicated. Although I am the ``senior \nSenator'' from Maryland, my colleague Senator Thurmond was a practicing \nattorney in Edgefield, SC when I was born in 1933. And by that time, \nSenator Thurmond already had begun his distinctive career in the public \ninterest.\n  Born in 1902, Senator Thurmond received his bachelor's degree from \nClemson University in 1923 and was a teacher and athletic coach for 6 \nyears while serving in the U.S. Army Reserves. In 1929, he became the \nSuperintendent of Education in Edgefield County, SC and soon thereafter \nwas admitted to the State Bar, studying law under his father, Judge J. \nWilliam Thurmond. While practicing law, Strom began his political \ncareer as a South Carolina State Senator and Circuit Judge. Senator \nThurmond took a four-year leave of absence from his judicial duties \nfrom 1942 to 1946 in order to serve with the 82nd Airborne Division in \nWorld War II. During the War, Senator Thurmond served in the American, \nEuropean and Pacific Theaters; landed in Normandy on D-Day; and earned \neighteen decorations, medals and awards including, the Legion of Merit \nwith Oak Leaf Cluster, Bronze Star for Valor, Purple Heart, Belgian \nOrder of the Crown, and French Croix de Guerre, during his military \nservice.\n  If Strom's service to our Nation ended in 1946 with his military \ncareer, it would have been a remarkable record of achievement. But his \ncontributions to education, the legal profession, and the military make \nup just the beginning of Senator Thurmond's legacy. From 1947 to 1951, \nStrom was known as Governor Thurmond, as he led his beloved State of \nSouth Carolina. After his 1948 bid for the presidency, Strom returned \nto the practice of law and, in 1954, launched a successful write-in \ncandidacy for election to the U.S. Senate. Pursuant to a promise made \nduring his write-in campaign, Strom resigned from the Senate in April \n1956 to run in the Democratic primary election. Strom was reelected to \nthe Senate in November 1956 and resumed his duties and has been elected \nto the Senate seven more times by the people of South Carolina.\n  Reaching the age of 100, as Senator Thurmond will do this December 5, \nis, alone, a remarkable achievement. The 2000 Census counted just \n50,500 Americans 100 or older. And Strom is a clear example for those \nolder Americans, and citizens of all ages, of the remarkable impact one \nperson can have on our Nation. For most of the past 48 years, Senator \nThurmond has been a fixture and a legend in the United States Senate. \nHe has held positions of power, including President Pro Tempore, and \nCommittee chairmanships. In the Senate, he has worked with ten \nPresidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, \nGeorge H. W. Bush, Clinton, and George W. Bush. He is the longest \nserving Member of the Senate, and cast his 15,000th vote in September \n1998.\n  It goes without saying that throughout his time in this distinguished \nbody, and over the course of his lifetime, Strom has seen our Nation \nchange in remarkable ways. His service in this great deliberative body \nhas given the Senate a perspective and continuity unparalleled in our \nhistory. I am pleased to have had the opportunity to serve with him \nover these many years, and to join my colleagues today in paying \ntribute to a true public servant, Senator Strom Thurmond.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, our colleague Strom Thurmond is retiring \nsoon, and I just wanted to say a few words, on this special day of \nappreciation, about the gentleman from South Carolina. For that is what \nhe is: the consummate gentleman. There is the public Strom that \neveryone knows--the legend--then there is the private Strom, a \ncolleague and collaborator I have always found to be eager to help a \nfellow Senator and accommodate his concerns. I have felt honored to \nwork with him on issues of national defense, foreign policy, and many \nother matters important to the people of the United States. The people \nof South Carolina, in particular, can be very proud of this war hero, \nwho landed in Normandy as a member of the 82nd Airborne Division in \n1942, who was Governor of South Carolina, and who, in the Senate, \ndistinguished himself as chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the \nArmed Services Committee.\n  There are great Strom Thurmond stories--many told by Strom himself, \nof course. For my part, I like to tell the one about his 90th birthday \ncelebration, held here in Washington. One reporter asked if he could \nexpect to see Strom on his 100th birthday. And Senator Thurmond looked \nhim up and down and said: ``Well, you look fit enough to me. If you eat \nright and drink right, you ought to be around to see me then.''\n  He is an inspiration. As everyone knows, he represents continuity in \nthe United States Senate, being, since 1996, its oldest serving member, \nand, since 1997, its longest serving member. Those are for the record \nbooks. But on a personal level, I can say that the Senate will not be \nthe same without his buoyant spirit. I thank him for helping me in so \nmany ways, and for his invaluable service to our country.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I rise to join with my colleagues today in honoring a man \nthe ``Almanac of American Politics'' rightly calls ``the most enduring \nfigure in American politics today'', the Senior Senator from South \nCarolina, the senior member of the Senate, and the longest serving \nsenator in United States history, our colleague Senator Strom Thurmond.\n  I think that any of us who have had the honor of serving in this body \nhave to be in awe of Senator Thurmond's remarkable 48-year tenure. The \nresponsibilities of this job, the demands on one's time and energy, are \nincredible. That Senator Thurmond has continued to engender the trust, \nrespect, and support of the people of South Carolina through nearly \nfive decades in the Senate and nearly seventy years in elective office \nis a testament not only to his storied dedication to his constituents, \nbut to his seemingly-inexhaustible passion for service.\n  Senator Thurmond is quite literally an institution within an \ninstitution. If this were baseball, he would be Babe Ruth larger than \nlife, shattering records, and giving 100 percent effort at every at-\nbat.\n  Even today, I continue to marvel that I am serving along-side this \nlegislative legend. This is a man who was on the floor of this chamber \nwhen I was seven years old, a man who was nominated for President when \nI was one year old, a man who was elected Governor of South Carolina \nbefore I was born. Alive even before the Wright Brothers took flight, \nhe has seen firsthand the greatest single period of societal and \ntechnological change in the history of the world. He would have even \nbeen old enough at age 15 to read first-hand news accounts of the last \ntime the Boston Red Sox won the World Series. Now that is truly \namazing!\n  When you think about it, Senator Strom Thurmond's political life \nspanned the great majority of the 20th century, while he has \nwitnessed--during his more than 36,400 days on earth--nearly half of \nthe history of the United States. It is possible he received votes from \nConfederate war veterans in his bid for the South Carolina legislature \nin 1933. This is an extraordinary figure on the landscape of our land--\na living history class and inseparable from any discussion or \ndissection of the United States Senate.\n  Indeed, Senator Thurmond's tenure has charted many changes in our \ncountry, the world, and American society. In an inspiration to all of \nus, Senator Thurmond has never stopped learning, never stopped drawing \nlessons from experience and from others. He bears the mark that defines \ngreat men and women--the integrity and honesty of an open mind.\n  And there should be no mistake--as if the time Senator Thurmond has \ndevoted to public office is not enough for\n\n[[Page S9081]]\n\nseveral lifetimes, he has also served his country in the crucible of \nwar, gaining an exemption from being ``over age'' so he could don a \nuniform and ultimately participate in the invasion at Normandy on D-\nday.\n  Fittingly, years later, Senator Thurmond would call upon his ``trial \nby fire'' experience as Chairman of the Armed Services Committee--and I \nwas proud to call him ``Chairman'' for much of my time on the \nCommittee. He has always been a champion not only of a strong national \ndefense, but also for the men and women who provide that defense, and \nwe owe him a debt of gratitude that simple words fail to repay.\n  In short, some people live long, but not fully. Senator Thurmond's \nlife, however, is remarkable not only for its apparent disregard for \nsuch trivialities as ``time'', but also--and more importantly--for its \nrichness.\n  The great American writer Henry David Thoreau aspired to, in his \nplain-spoken but powerful words, ``live deep and suck all the marrow \nout of life . . .'' Well, Senator Strom Thurmond personifies that \ndream--making Thoreau's declaration his personal credo, and leaving the \nrest of us to watch in admiration and wonder.\n  So today, as we celebrate Senator Thurmond's century of \ncontributions, let us also celebrate the remarkable story of America's \njourney, for in many ways they are one-in-the-same. Strom, your \ncolleagues wish you all the best--and we thank you for exemplifying \nwhat it means to serve in the greatest Democracy the world has ever \nknown.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay respects to a man who \nhas served his country for the past 78 years. In the year 1924, at the \nage of 21, Strom Thurmond was commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant in the U.S. \nArmy Reserve. Twenty years later, Strom fought valiantly during World \nWar II and amazingly, at the age of 43, he was part of the first wave \nof American soldiers who landed in Normandy during D-day, parachuting \nbehind enemy lines with the 82nd Airborne Division.\n  For his bravery and outstanding service in combat, Strom Thurmond was \nawarded 18 service decorations, awards and medals. In addition to his \nBronze Star for Valor, he received the Legion of Merit with Oak Leaf \nCluster, the Purple Heart. For his merit and heroism during the D-day \ninvasion and subsequent freeing of Belgium and France, he was awarded \nboth the Belgian Order of the Crown and the French Croix de Guerre from \nthe Belgian and French Governments, respectively.\n  After returning from the war, Strom Thurmond began an unprecedented \ncareer in the Senate which has been marked by a dedication to upholding \nthe honor and dignity of the United States Military and America's \nheroic veterans helping to ensure that every veteran has a voice in the \nHalls of Congress and the opportunity and protection commensurate with \nthe dignity and honor with which they served.\n  In 1959, 36 years after he had been commissioned, Strom Thurmond \nretired from the United States Army Reserves a major general of the \nU.S. Reserves, ending an amazing career that spanned two wars and \ncountless acts of personal bravery and leadership. In the Senate he has \nbrought his many years of experience to many debates and, for the last \n30 years, to the Veterans Affairs Committee where his personal \ncommitment to veterans issues has been heralded by all.\n  As a veteran, I have great respect for Senator Thurmond's active role \non the Veterans Affairs Committee and his contributions to make certain \nin words and deeds that our veterans and their families receive the \nbest possible care and that the U.S. Government honors the promise it \nmakes to each soldier who wears the uniform of our country.\n  When Strom Thurmond retires after this year, the Senate will lose a \nman who has seen the arc of the 20th century with his very eyes. From \nfighting in some of the greatest battles in world history to bearing \nwitness to the Great Depression and the Great Society, Strom Thurmond \nhas seen decades pass in which America has fought in war and prospered \nin peace--decades in which America emerged from isolation to lead the \nworld to greater freedom and liberty for all--decades in which American \nmade certain the promises of our forebears and their quest for a more \nequal society.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, like all my colleagues, I rise today to \nhonor the Senior Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Thurmond, who is also \nAmerica's Senior Senator.\n  Some of my earliest memories of working in the Senate with Senator \nThurmond were our efforts on balancing the budget and on the balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution. He was the real father of this \nAmendment, dating back to his early years in the Senate. And he fought \nso hard on this issue because he cared so deeply about us leaving our \nchildren a legacy of opportunity and economic security.\n  Senator Thurmond told me he liked being around young people because \nthey challenged him with new ideas and kept him young.\n  As the ranking member of the Senate Aging Committee, every day I grow \nto appreciate a little more what Senator Thurmond has spent a lifetime \nteaching us: the importance of being young at heart.\n  That positive attitude was evident when, a few years ago, Senator \nThurmond told Reuters he was ready to be a back-up space shuttle crew \nmember for Senator John Glenn, saying: ``I always believed that if NASA \nreally wanted to study the effects of space travel on an older \nAmerican, they should have called me.''\n  Senator Thurmond has spent almost a century, not only as a witness to \nhistory, but as a shaper of history.\n  Today may be Strom Thurmond Day, but if the 20th century was the \nAmerican Century, then it was also the Strom Thurmond Century.\n  Senator Thurmond was 41 years young, when he climbed into glider \nnumber 34 of the 82nd Airborne Division in June 1944 and took part in \nthe Normandy invasion on D-day. Fifty years later, Senator Thurmond \nshowed perspective, when he did not return to Normandy for 50th \nanniversary commemorations because it was more important to attend his \nson's graduation.\n  A few years later he ran for President, against Harry Truman and Tom \nDewey, as the nominee of the States' Rights Democratic Party, and won \n39 electoral votes.\n  A few years after that, he became the only Senator in American \nhistory to be elected by a write-in vote, demonstrating the devotion of \nSouth Carolina voters to Strom Thurmond that has never wavered, as his \ndedication to them has never wavered.\n  Lyndon Johnson said the Senate has show horses and work horses. \nSenator Thurmond has always been a work horse.\n  The experts tell us that one of the keys to a long, healthy life is \nbeing adaptable and being able to renew oneself.\n  Over the years, Senator Thurmond also has displayed a firm foundation \nof principles, in his devotion to family, faith, and freedom.\n  Like all the great persons of history who have had staying power, \nSenator Thurmond has shown that great balance of having a firm moral \nfoundation and being able to renew himself.\n  In fact, he is the only Member of this body to have served in the \nmajority as a Democrat, in the minority as a Democrat, in the minority \nas a Republican, and in the majority as a Republican. That is \nadaptability.\n  I would also add, he has always shown unfailing graciousness to \ncolleagues, to constituents, and to all the Senate staff.\n  I remember our former Senate Republican Leader, Bob Dole, being asked \nwhat his health care plan was. He replied: ``I'm in favor of the \nThurmond plan. I want to do what he does. I used to follow him around \nand if he ate a banana, I ate a banana.''\n  All of us could not do much better than to follow the example of \nStrom Thurmond.\n  In Jack Bass and Marilyn Thompson's biography of Senator Thurmond, \nthey quoted a woman who knew him since boyhood, who said: ``He hasn't \nchanged. Everything he's done has been done to the full. There's no \nhalfway doings about Strom.''\n  Today we honor our colleague, friend, and mentor, for a full career \nof accomplishment, for his full dedication to America and South \nCarolina, and for a full life, in every respect.\n\n[[Page S9082]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I join my colleagues today in recognizing \nthe distinguished Senator from South Carolina and his years of service \nin the U.S. Senate.\n  Strom Thurmond has lived almost one century--his 100th birthday will \nbe December 5th--and he has been a Senator for almost half of that \ntime. He is now finishing his eighth full term, making him the longest \nserving Senator and the oldest Member of Congress. But Senator Thurmond \nis known--and will long be remembered--for much more than his \nlongevity.\n  He has had a remarkable life and career of service to South Carolina \nand the United States, having served as a school superintendent, State \nSenator, judge, and as the Palmetto State's Governor.\n  He entered the Nation's military when he was 21 years old and almost \n20 years later volunteered to serve in World War II. He was among the \nbrave American troops who landed in Normandy on D-day with the 82nd \nAirborne Division, and he received numerous awards for his military \nservice including the Bronze Star for Valor and a Purple Heart.\n  Senator Thurmond has fought no less fiercely in the political arena. \nHe has used his gifts, experience, the power and respect he has earned \nand knowledge of Senate rules and procedures to advocate on behalf of \nhis causes.\n  Although he has switched political parties during his career, serving \nfirst as a Democrat, running for President as a ``States Rights'' \nthird-party candidate in 1948, and becoming a Republican in 1964, he \nhas consistently adhered to his political ideology.\n  I am glad that we have an opportunity to acknowledge his \ncontributions and to reflect on the considerable impact he has had on \nthis body, his party, and the Nation.\n  Senator Thurmond is a living monument but just to make sure his \nservice is recognized, the people of South Carolina, whom he has \nrepresented for so long, have honored him by erecting a monument for \nhim and naming dozens of facilities for him.\n  Senator Thurmond will certainly be missed around here. I bid him \nfarewell and extend my best wishes to him and his family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 12:30 \nhaving arrived and passed, the Senate will now stand in recess until \nthe hour of 2 p.m.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/24/senate-section/article/S9082-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I am surely honored by the generous \nremarks of my colleagues, Senator Daschle, Senator Lott, Senator \nHollings, Senator Byrd, Senator Stevens, Senator Hutchison, Senator \nAllard, Senator Specter, Senator Allen, Senator McConnell, and all \nothers.\n  It is hard for me to believe that it was about 80 years ago that I \nbegan my professional career. Beginning as a school teacher and coach, \nI have enjoyed public service as a County Superintendent of Education, \nattorney, State Senator, State Circuit Judge, military officer, \nGovernor, and Senator. While I have enjoyed each and every job I have \nheld over the years, there is no job I have treasured more than serving \nas a U.S. Senator. I am proud to be a member of this remarkable \nlegislative body and have been blessed to observe nearly a half-century \nof our Nation's history from within this chamber. I still recall the \ncold Christmas Eve, December 24, 1954, when I was sworn in by then \nVice-President Richard Nixon, with my late wife, Jean, by my side.\n  I came to Washington with one priority--to serve this Nation and my \nfellow South Carolinians with integrity and to the best of my ability. \nAs I now enter the final days of my Senate career, with nearly 48 years \nof Senate service, I trust I have accomplished that objective.\n  The U.S. Senate is a special institution in many respects. The six-\nyear term assures that there is the stability within this chamber which \nallows the Senate to be a deliberative body. The great history of this \nbody reflects the great issues of American History. Here we have \ndebated fundamental questions regarding the status of our Union, \nnational territorial expansion, matters of war and peace, social and \neconomic policies affecting every individual, and many other important \nmatters of national interest as well as local issues.\n  Given the esteemed stature of this legislative body, it was with no \nsmall amount of humility that I moved from South Carolina to Washington \nso many years ago. Like every other man and woman who serves in the \nSenate, regardless of party affiliation or ideology, I desired to \nperform my duties with honor, to the best of my ability, and with a \ngoal of making a difference in the lives of my fellow citizens.\n  As Senators, we have many roles to perform in the discharge of our \nduties. There is no other job in the world that allows us to have a \nmore direct impact on improving the lives of individuals and \nstrengthening our Nation. Through legislation, oversight, and old-\nfashioned constituent service, each of us is able to help the citizens \nof our respective States, as well as build a Nation which is stronger \nand better for all who live here. The work we do here benefits millions \nof Americans. One cannot help but take great satisfaction and pride in \nsuch important service.\n  As legislators we are called upon to vote on matters of local concern \nand national interest. I have cast over 16,300 rollcall votes as a U.S. \nSenator. Each vote is cast considering the concerns of my constituents \nand what is right for our Nation. While I have missed a few votes, I am \npleased that I have been present for over 95 percent of all rollcall \nvotes called by the Senate during my time in office.\n  It is the floor debate and the rollcall votes that citizens most \nclosely associate with the work of the U.S. Senate. When visitors come \nto the Capitol, the overwhelming majority of them visit the Senate and \nHouse Galleries to watch their Congress in action. I suspect that most \nAmericans are less familiar with the Committee system, but as we all \nknow, that is where a significant amount of the work of this \ninstitution is accomplished.\n  During my Senate career, I have been privileged to serve on a number \nof Committees in the U.S. Senate. As a member and Chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee I worked hard to help build the finest military \nforce that history has seen. On the Judiciary Committee, which I also \nchaired, my priorities were to safeguard the Constitution, keep the \njudicial branch independent and staffed with well qualified men and \nwomen, and enact sound policies to help make our communities safe. As a \nfounding member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee I have always fought \nto ensure that the men and women of our Armed Forces receive the health \ncare and benefits they deserve. On each of the Committees I served, I \nassociated with Senators who were expert in their areas of oversight, \nwho took their duties as Committee Members seriously, and who were \nexceptional legislators.\n  One of the primary duties of a Senator is to represent and assist \nconstituents. I consider constituent service to be the most significant \naspect of my Senate career. I am pleased that my Senate office has \nhelped hundreds of thousands of South Carolinians interact with a \ngovernment bureaucracy that can sometimes be confusing, unyielding, and \nintimidating.\n  As the calendar draws closer to the day that I walk out of the door \nof Room 217 of the Russell Senate Office Building, I know that pundits \nand historians will examine my career and study my service and \nachievements. I pray that such an examination will determine that I was \na man who rendered a worthy service to the Nation and to my State. I \nhope I am known, above all, as a man who tried to help others. I also \nacknowledge that whatever I have been able to achieve, through my years \nof Senate service, it was largely through working closely with my \ncolleagues.\n\n  No single individual can accomplish what has to be done here without \nrecognizing the contribution of those who served before we arrived. \nWhen I think of the South Carolinians who occupied this seat before me, \nI am humbled. To follow in the footsteps of such distinguished men as \nPierce Butler, Charles\n\n[[Page S9083]]\n\nPinckney, Thomas Sumter, John C. Calhoun, Benjamin Tillman and many \nothers, is indeed an honor.\n  Likewise, much of our own success is due to the colleagues with whom \nwe serve. This is perhaps the greatest aspect of being a Senator--to \nassociate with such fine individuals. I have been so fortunate that in \nmy tenure here I have had the distinction of serving with so many fine \nmen and women. I regret that it is simply impossible to identify each \nand every single Senator with whom I have had the pleasure of serving. \nAs an historical note, 1,864 men and women have served as U.S. \nSenators. I have had the privilege to serve with 410 of these great men \nand women. I have had the distinct opportunity to serve, in some \ninstances, with more than one generation from some great families. I \nnote there are Senators serving today whose fathers were my colleagues \nsome years ago. I am hesitant to recognize individual colleagues, for I \nhave enjoyed my association with every Senator, but a few stand out in \nmy mind.\n  My long-time colleague, Senator Hollings, has served with me for \nnearly 36 years. I greatly appreciate his friendship and extend my best \nwishes to him and his lovely wife, Peatsy.\n  Having served on both sides of the aisle, and having presided over \nthe Senate as President pro tempore for a number of years, I am \nprivileged to have friends in both parties. I enjoyed my association \nwith distinguished Senators such as Richard Russell and Herman \nTalmadge. Bobby Kennedy was a special Senator, whose office was across \nthe hall from mine. I have enjoyed a long and warmhearted association \nwith Robert Byrd and Ted Stevens. Similarly, I have a great respect for \nJoe Biden, with whom I serve on the Judiciary Committee. My neighbor, \nJesse Helms, is a great American and a great friend. Our current \nRepublican leader, Trent Lott, always has a kind word and a friendly \ngreeting. I admire the many genuine heroes who have served in the \nSenate--men like Dan Inouye.\n  In addition, much of the success of individual Senators and of the \nSenate is due to the leadership of the Senate. Distinguished statesmen \nlike Mike Mansfield, Everett Dirksen, Hugh Scott, Howard Baker, Bob \nDole, were great men who served this institution with dedication and \nconcern for the well-being of the Senate and the Nation.\n  As a Senator I have served with ten Presidents, from Dwight D. \nEisenhower to our current capable and dedicated leader, George W. Bush. \nThree of those--John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, and Richard Nixon--were \nSenate colleagues. In the Supreme Court, 108 Justices have served since \nthe formation of the Court in 1790. I am proud to have participated in \nthe advice and consent in the confirmation of 20 of these outstanding \nmen and women, as well as hundreds of judges in the lower courts.\n  Mr. President, today's Senate is much different than when I first \narrived. At that time there were four fewer Senators, for neither \nAlaska nor Hawaii had been admitted to the Union. Our friends from the \n``Aloha'' and ``Last Frontier'' states did not join us until 1959.\n  Not only were there fewer Senators, but the Senate support staff was \nmuch smaller. When I began my Senate service, I was assisted by just \nfour attorneys and three typists. Today, I have over 35 hard-working, \ndedicated staff members. At the end of my first term there were about \n6000 staff serving Members and Committees in the House and Senate. \nToday there are over 18,000 staff in personal and committee offices. An \nadditional 13,000 staff support the Congress in various Congressional \nsupport agencies.\n  This growth in the Senate staff, as well as the increase in the \nlength of the Senate calendar, is a reflection of the growth of the \nFederal government. Both in size and in scope, the Federal government \nhas enlarged its involvement in the life of Americans. I am not \nconvinced, however, that this has always been in the best interest of \nour Nation.\n  There have been significant physical changes to the Capitol complex. \nWhen I first arrived in Washington, the Russell Senate Office Building \nhoused all Senators, staff, committees, and other support personnel and \nfunctions. In 1958 the Dirksen Office Building was completed, and in \n1982 the Hart Office Building was finished. The Capitol building itself \nwas enlarged during my tenure with the east front extension. That \nextension provided additional rooms when it was completed in 1962. As I \ndepart, a great addition is underway with the construction of the \nCapitol Visitor Center. I am proud of my contribution to this effort \nwhich began in earnest just a few years ago as I served as President \npro tempore and Co-Chairman of the Capitol Preservation Commission.\n  Despite all the changes that have occurred in this institution and in \nour Nation, there is one constant--that has been the closeness of the \nSenate family. There are literally thousands of people who work \nquietly, outside the spotlight, to ensure this institution runs \nsmoothly. I express my appreciation to all in the Senate who contribute \nto the success of every Senator and make this institution a community. \nThis family includes the Secretary of the Senate, the Sergeant-at-Arms, \nthe staff of those Officers, the Clerks, Doorkeepers, Capitol Hill \nPolice, the staff of the Senate restaurants, the Attending Physician \nand staff, the cloakroom staff, the Chaplain's office, the \nParliamentarian, the Architect of the Capitol and staff, the \nLibrarians, staff of the Congressional Research Service and the General \nAccounting Office, and many others, too numerous to mention.\n\n  I must also pay tribute to my own staff. A strong, competent, and \ncapable staff is absolutely necessary to any Senator. We could not keep \nup with all our duties, maintain contacts with constituents, or \naccomplish our legislative goals without our staff. Throughout my \ncareer, I have made it a point to hire the best people I could to work \nin my personal office and on my committees. I have enjoyed my \nassociation with literally hundreds of bright, talented and hard-\nworking individuals. I have enjoyed watching them mature in their \npersonal lives and grow in their professional careers. I am proud of my \nstaff. I ask unanimous consent that a list of my current staff be \ninserted in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. THURMOND. Finally, I express my deepest appreciation to my entire \nfamily for their love and support, especially my children. Strom, \nJulie, Paul, and my beloved daughter, the late Nancy Moore, have been \nthe joy of my life. I thank them for their sacrifices and devotion.\n  Mr. President, no matter which side of the aisle we occupy, \nregardless of the issues that may divide us, and despite any political \ndifferences we may have, all of us ran for office and fought to stay \nhere because we want to serve and make a difference. There is no more \nnoble calling than public service, and no more rewarding place to serve \nthan the U.S. Senate. This is truly one of the most unique and special \ninstitutions in the world and the opportunity to serve in this body is \na rare privilege and one which I think all of us value equally.\n  In my public service career, I have served in many different \ncapacities and at every level of government, but none has been more \nmeaningful or gratifying than the time I have spent as the Senator from \nSouth Carolina.\n  When I graduated from Clemson College in 1923, my father gave me a \npaper entitled ``Advice'' which I have always proudly displayed in my \nSenate office and after which I have always tried to pattern my life. \nThe advice which my father gave me, and which I pass on to others \nfollows:\n  Remember your God;\n  Take good care of your body and tax your nervous system as little as \npossible;\n  Obey the laws of the land;\n  Be strictly honest;\n  Associate with only the best people, morally and intellectually;\n  Think 3 times before you act once, and if you are in doubt, don't act \nat all;\n  Be prompt on your job to the minute;\n  Read at every spare chance and think over and try to remember what \nyou have read;\n  Do not forget that ``skill and integrity'' are the keys to success.\n  Mr. President, I leave you, and my friends, with my father's \nuniversal advice and add the following: Always respect and appreciate \nyour tenure in the\n\n[[Page S9084]]\n\nworld's greatest deliberative body; do your absolute best to serve this \nNation with honor and decorum; and strive to keep the U.S. Senate the \nproud, historic and distinguished body of government it has been since \nthe birth of this blessed Nation.\n  As I close out my public service career, I again thank my \nconstituents, my colleagues, my staff and my family. May God bless each \nof you, the U.S. Senate, and God bless the United States of America.\n  I love all of you, and especially your wives.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                   Senator Strom Thurmond Staff List\n\n       Duke Short, Chief of Staff and Administrative Assistant.\n       Holly Richardson, Executive Assistant.\n       Mark Ivany, Personal Assistant.\n       Eliza Edgar, Assistant to the Chief of Staff.\n       Erin Goodin, Receptionist.\n       Walker Clarkson, Receptionist.\n\n\n                          Press/Public Affairs\n\n       Becky Fleming, Press Secretary.\n       Emily Dorroh, Press Assistant.\n\n\n                                Records\n\n       Les Sealy, Office Manager and Systems Administrator.\n       David Black, Assistant Office Manager.\n\n\n                                Projects\n\n       Bill Tuten, Projects Director.\n       John Hawk, Projects Assistant.\n       Kevin Smith, Projects Assistant.\n       Michael Bozzelli, Projects Assistant.\n       Melissa Kiracofe-Low, Projects Assistant.\n\n\n                          General Legislation\n\n       David Best, Legislative Director.\n       Ernie Coggins, Legislative Assistant.\n       James Galyean, Legislative Assistant.\n       Helena Mell, Legislative Correspondent.\n       Ashley Hurt, Legislative Correspondent.\n\n\n                           Military Casework\n\n       Matt Martin.\n\n\n  Judiciary Subcommittee On The Constitution, Federalism and Property \n                                 Rights\n\n       Scott Frick, Chief Counsel.\n       Melinda Koutsoumpas, Chief Clerk.\n\n\n                             Armed Services\n\n       George Lauffer, Military Assistant.\n\n\n                    President Pro Tempore, Emeritus\n\n       James Graham, Staff Assistant.\n\n\n                         Thurmond State Offices\n\n       Columbia: Warren Abernathy, State Director; Jeanie Rhyne; \n     Valerie Gaines; Lind Morris; Michelle Quinn; and Christie \n     Humphries.\n       Aiken: Elizabeth McFarland.\n       Charleston: Patricia Rones-Sykes.\n       Florence: Raleigh Ward and Kathryn Hook (Volunteer).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/24/senate-section/article/S9084-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senator from \nConnecticut is recognized for 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to urge adoption of the amendment offered \nby Senator McCain and ask that the vote be taken by the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator asking for the yeas and nays on \nthe amendment?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to discuss briefly my vote on the \nSeptember 11 Commission. I joined in the amendment proposed by my good \nfriends from Connecticut and Arizona because it is the right thing to \ndo. Sitting as I do on both the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, \nit has become clear to me over the past year that many different causes \ncontributed to the horrific terrorist attacks on September 11. I have \nbecome convinced that we need to take a hard look at how this tragedy \nhappened in order to better understand how we might avoid a similar \ntragedy in the future. Hindsight is, indeed, 20-20, and we may be able \nto profit from a detached and objective analysis of mistakes that may \nhave been made in the days and months before that attack. We need to \nlearn from our mistakes. The stakes are simply too high to bury them.\n  While I believe that a September 11 Commission should be appointed, I \nalso think that the administration should have some voice in its \nmakeup. The amendment establishes a 10-member commission with all of \nthe 10 members appointed by the majority and minority leaders of \nCongress. It is fitting that Congress play a large role in defining the \nmembership of this Commission, but it is striking to me that the \nAdministration has no voice at all. Just as this Commission was \napproved by strong bipartisan support, so too should its task be \napolitical. In this spirit, I would call upon my colleagues to think \nseriously about providing the administration with some role in defining \nthe Commission.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, as a member of the Select Committee on \nIntelligence, I have had reservations about creating an outside \ncommission to investigate 9/11 as called for in this amendment. My \nreservations have essentially been twofold: First, the Intelligence \nCommittees were given the responsibility to look into this very matter, \nso an additional investigation would be duplicative and place \nadditional stress on our intelligence community at a time when its \nresources should be dedicated to fighting the war on terrorism.\n  Second, we had every reason to believe that the joint committee \ninvestigation would do its job that is, find out what went wrong, why \nit went wrong, and how we can reform the intelligence community to try \nto prevent future such failures.\n  Sadly, it appears that the joint committee will fall short of that \ngoal. In the Intelligence Committee, I have expressed serious \nreservations about the direction of the investigation, including the \nallocation of time and resources to holding premature open hearings.\n  Last week, the joint committee held public hearings in spite of not \nhaving completed its investigation. In fact, what was presented last \nweek was only a staff document, not a consensus product of the \ncommittee. Members had no practical input into this interim report.\n  The interim statement from the joint inquiry staff provided \ninformation about what has been done to date, a chronology of events \nleading to the September 11th attacks, and some background information \nabout al-Qaida. This history may be useful, but it does not address the \nquestions that are fundamental to this investigation.\n  In the committee, we heard from more than one witness that at least \nsome of the problems in the intelligence community stem from a \nbureaucratically and politically-induced culture of risk aversion and/\nor an inadequate allocation and improper prioritization of resources. \nYet, it is not evident that the joint committee inquiry is serious \nabout pursuing these fundamental questions.\n  For these and other reasons, it will be difficult for me to concur in \nthe final joint committee product without reservations. We will not \nknow what we haven't been told. Therefore, we will not be able to vouch \nunequivocally for the final product.\n  And, of course, these are the very questions that have led to calls \nfor the creation of a national commission to investigate these matters, \nand, hence, to this amendment. Reluctantly, I have come to the \nconclusion that it is necessary. If its work starts after the Joint \nIntelligence Committee investigation has concluded, there should be no \nduplication or additional stress on the entities required to cooperate \nin the investigation.\n  Mr. President, because of the inadequate course being taken by the \nJoint Intelligence Committee investigation, and because the imposition \nof that investigation on our intelligence apparatus will be ended by \nthe time this commission begins its work, I will support the creation \nof the commission.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I have had the chance to speak about \nthe urgent necessity of this independent commission to review the \ncauses of the tragic events of September 11. It responds to the public \ninterest by creating the best possible Department of Homeland Security \nto close the gaps that existed prior to that. The joint intelligence \ncommittees have done excellent work that led to disclosures that cry \nout to us for further investigation by our intelligence apparatus--and \nsome other aspects of our Government that created the vulnerabilities \nwhich\n\n[[Page S9085]]\n\nenabled the terrorists to strike at us last September 11.\n  There is very little time available.\n  I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to my colleague from Pennsylvania and 2\\1/2\\ \nto the Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut for yielding time.\n  Immediately after 9/11, I opposed the creation of an independent \ncommission because at that time I believed the appropriate \ninvestigation should be conducted by the Intelligence Committees of the \ntwo Houses and that there ought to be a period for the intelligence \ncommunity to regroup after 9/11.\n  As matters have eventuated, it has not been possible for the joint \ninvestigation by the Senate and House Intelligence Committees to be \ncompleted. We are now nearing the interim term, and that is why I now \nbelieve an independent commission would be the thing to do.\n  When the so-called leak occurred and the Intelligence Committees \ninvited the FBI to conduct an investigation, I thought that was very \ninadvisable, and by a letter dated June 24, I wrote to the chairmen and \nvice chairmen of the committees of both Houses saying in effect that it \nwas unwise to have the Intelligence Committees investigating the FBI \nwhen the FBI was investigating the Intelligence Committees; that as a \nmatter of separation of powers, it is highly undesirable to have the \nexecutive branch investigating congressional oversight; but if they \nbelieved it was necessary, a better approach would be to hire \nindependent counsel, as the Judiciary Committee did when a leak \noccurred during the confirmation hearings of Justice Thomas.\n  But it is evident at this point that the Intelligence Committees are \nnot going to finish the job, that there are very vital issues to be \ndetermined as to the lapse on 9/11, and that on the basis of the \ncurrent record, had the dots been connected, there is a veritable \nblueprint where 9/11 might have been prevented and the best approach \nnow is to work through the commission.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my letter be printed in the Record, and \nI thank my colleague from Connecticut and yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 2002.\n     Senator Bob Graham,\n     Chairman,\n     Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\n     Senator Richard C. Shelby,\n     Vice-Chairman,\n     Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\n     Congressman, Porter J. Goss,\n     Chairman,\n     Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.\n     Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi,\n     Vice-Chairwoman,\n     Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.\n       Dear Bob, Porter, Richard, and Nancy. I have noted the \n     press reports of Friday, June 21, 2002, that the two \n     Congressional Intelligence Committees had asked Attorney \n     General John Ashcroft to see if congressional sources were \n     improperly releasing classified information. That article \n     said: ``Asked if lawmakers would be open to interviews and \n     polygraph tests conducted by the bureau, Mr. Goss said, `We \n     will cooperate with the FBI in every way possible'.''\n       For two important reasons, I urge you not to proceed in \n     that manner; but instead to pursue a congressional inquiry, \n     perhaps with outside counsel or through the House and Senate \n     Ethics Committees.\n       My concerns are:\n       (1) I believe it is inappropriate and unwise to have the \n     FBI investigate the Intelligence Committees when the \n     Intelligence Committees are investigating the FBI. That \n     approach raises the inevitable question as to whether there \n     would be reciprocal pulling of punches to avoid a tough \n     inquiry by the other investigators; and\n       (2) I believe it is undesirable and unwise from a \n     ``separation of powers'' consideration to invite the \n     Executive Branch to investigate the Legislative Branch. If \n     there is a prima facie showing of wrongdoing by a member of \n     the Senate or House, then the Department of Justice has the \n     established authority to investigate; but this situation \n     would invite a widespread, open-ended questioning of \n     everybody who had access to the so-called leaked information. \n     In such an inquiry, it might be very difficult for members to \n     decline to be polygraphed; and if members agreed to be \n     polygraphed, that would set a dangerous precedent for the \n     future when the Executive Branch might seek retribution from \n     or pressure on a member.\n       During the 104th Congress when I chaired the Intelligence \n     Committee, the Committee conducted internal inquiries where \n     concerns arose over improper disclosures of classified \n     material. If such an internal inquiry is deemed insufficient, \n     your Committees could proceed to hire outside independent \n     counsel, as the Judiciary Committee did on leaks in the \n     confirmation hearings of Justice Clarence Thomas where \n     Judiciary Committee members were then questioned, or you \n     could ask the House and Senate Ethics Committees to \n     investigate.\n       I know Committee members face a difficult and touchy \n     situation in this matter but I suggest you reconsider an \n     investigation by the FBI with the attendant potential for \n     polygraph tests.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cleland). The Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, 3 months ago I would not have been on the \nfloor supporting the establishment of a commission to look into our \nGovernment's failure to detect and prevent the attacks on September 11.\n  Three months ago I believed very strongly that the Intelligence \nCommittees of the House and Senate were not only capable of examining \nour Government's failures and vulnerabilities but were obligated to do \nso.\n  I believed then that if we dedicated the necessary time and \nresources, we would be able to conduct a thorough and comprehensive \ninquiry. And I think we have made a lot of progress.\n  Now that we are rapidly approaching the end of the year and the end \nof this Congress, I am increasingly concerned that the joint effort of \nthe House and Senate Intelligence Committees will not be able to \ncomplete such an inquiry.\n  Our scope is not broad enough. It is confined to the intelligence \naspects--not to FAA, and not to immigration and other aspects.\n  We now know that our inability to detect and prevent the September 11 \nattacks was not only an intelligence failure of unprecedented \nmagnitude, it was a failure of our entire Government to protect and \ndefend the American people.\n  I am now convinced that an accounting on behalf of the victims, the \nfamilies left behind, and the American people must include a \ncomprehensive examination of how every relevant agency of our \nGovernment performed or failed to perform prior to the attacks.\n  The House and Senate Intelligence Committees have been at work for \napproximately 6 months. We are making progress, but we are far from \ndone.\n  Our Committee began with high aspirations, but we soon stumbled. We \nhad some early staffing difficulties along with some false starts on \nour hearing schedule.\n  Early on, our inquiry turned up only information that provided to us. \nOur separate joint staff was dependent upon the information provided by \nour intelligence agencies, which were reluctant to cooperate fully.\n  While our joint staff was working in the agencies, they were often \nisolated in rooms constantly monitored by agency staff. Agencies \nrefused to circulate the joint staff's contact information and forbade \nthem from meeting with anyone without agency supervision.\n  While our staff was allowed to view large quantities of documents, \nthey were not allowed to make copies of all of them. Therefore, the \nprocess of documenting certain events became very onerous and time \nconsuming.\n  Other agencies refused to allow the joint staff to interview key \nindividuals. They were told that they could speak to supervisors and \nmore senior personnel who often knew few, if any, details.\n  Many of these problems were ultimately worked out, but that took \nprecious time, time we did not have. Some of the problems persist \ntoday. For example, we are often arguing with agencies about who may or \nmay not appear before our committees as late as the day before they are \nscheduled to appear. Witnesses are requested, refused, requested again, \ngranted and then, at the last minute, refused again.\n  There also remains a body of documents that the Director of Central \nIntelligence refuses to allow the committees to retain.\n  Much of the information that we gather is classified. The process of \ndeclassification has taken an inordinate amount of time. Often we are \nstill in the process of determining what we can discuss publicly \nmoments before a hearing.\n\n[[Page S9086]]\n\n  It is this type of interaction that cannot be completely \ncharacterized as uncooperative but is, nonetheless, extremely \ncounterproductive and has slowed the progress of this investigation. We \nare, however, making progress.\n  The staff has reviewed many thousands of documents, but they have \nmany thousands yet to review.\n  They have interviewed many people, but there are many yet to \ninterview.\n  In fact, it is still very difficult even to determine how far we have \ncome, and almost impossible to tell how far we have yet to go.\n  I have been a part of many investigations in my career but none has \nbeen as important as this one. Almost 3,000 Americans have been \nmurdered, and perhaps thousands more innocent lives hang in the balance \nevery day. Our joint investigation must be thorough, comprehensive and \ncomplete. I want it to be a success.\n  To be a success, however, an inquiry needs time and resources. If you \nlimit either one, your chances of success diminish significantly. \nUnfortunately, we have a short supply of both and I am afraid that we \nare beginning to reap the results.\n  From the outset, I argued strongly that our committees should avoid \nsetting arbitrary deadlines. Deadlines are an invitation to \nstonewalling and foot-dragging, and we have seen some of both in our \neffort.\n  I have also said many times that agencies under the congressional \nmicroscope are generally not motivated to cooperate. To be thorough, we \nmust be able to identify and locate relevant information, retrieve it, \nand then analyze it in the context of all of other information we have \ngathered. This is inevitably a difficult and time-consuming \nundertaking.\n  Because we have only one to three staffers actually focusing on any \nparticular agency at any one time--and because so much of our joint \ninquiry staff resources are tied up in producing hearings--it has \nbecome exceedingly difficult to be as thorough and probing as we need \nto be.\n  At this point, I do not believe we will be able to complete the job \nthe American people expect us to do. However, I expect us to do a \ncredible job and to lay the predicate for future investigations.\n  While I continue to work on the joint effort, I believe ours must be \na prelude to a more comprehensive inquiry. Therefore, I intend to \nsupport the creation of a commission, and I urge my colleagues to do \nthe same this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. \nLieberman, has more to say. I don't believe there is anyone speaking in \nopposition to this amendment. The Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, \nwas here earlier this morning to speak about Strom Thurmond. He was \nsqueezed out by the majority leader, the Republican leader, Senator \nByrd, Senator Hollings, and others. I therefore ask unanimous consent \nthat when the Senator from Connecticut finishes his few minutes, \nSenator Dodd be recognized using the 7\\1/2\\ minutes in opposition to \nthis amendment and 2\\1/2\\ minutes, for a total of 10 minutes, to speak \nas if in morning business prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I do not object to my colleague from \nConnecticut speaking. I want Senator Reid to know I would not be \nsurprised to see the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, a cosponsor of \nthe amendment, on the floor hoping to say a few words. I will be \nmindful of that.\n  The creation of a Department of Homeland Security, in which we're now \nengaged, is an urgent investment in the present and future safety of \nAmerica. We need to take this step, and we need to take it now.\n  But even as we do, we must recognize that we're acting on an \nincomplete picture of the problems that need to be fixed. We're relying \non partial and sporadic reports about how the government failed to meet \nthe challenge of securing our homeland pre-September 11.\n  When the new department gets up and running, we owe it to ourselves, \nand to the country we're striving to secure, to give it as complete and \nindependent an assessment as possible of what went wrong before \nSeptember 11 and why. If we don't come to terms with the whole truth by \nlooking back at what happened, we can never move forward with the \nknowledge and confidence we need to set things right.\n  Since September 11, all of us, and particularly the families of the \nvictims, have been subjected to the wrenching process of learning about \ntheir government's failures through a tortuous trickle of leaks and \nsoundbites.\n  All of this has hurt the nation psychologically by increasing anxiety \nand feeding speculation, leaving doubts about whether our government \nhas come to terms with the full scope of the failures that allowed \nthose terrible attacks to succeed. It has also damaged our spirit by \nturning almost every revelation into a regrettable volley of charges \nand counter-charges. And it has hurt us practically by failing to give \nus a clear, clean picture--with perspectives, context, nuance and \nshades of gray--of what agencies failed, how they failed, and why. As \nwe begin to build a Department of Homeland Security, we will need that \npicture to make sure we do it right.\n  I do want to pay tribute to the joint House-Senate Intelligence \nCommittees, which have uncovered valuable and disturbing evidence of \nthe intelligence community's failure to share and capitalize on \ninformation about the hijackers, in the months preceding September 11.\n  As Senator John McCain and I see it, a non-political, blue-ribbon \ncommission would build on the joint committees' work--reviewing their \nfindings and continuing to explore areas they touched on--as part of a \nsober, comprehensive inquiry into all our pre-September 11 \ninstitutional shortcomings.\n  I also must add that I was enormously gratified last Friday when the \nadministration reversed its longstanding opposition to creating an \nindependent commission. Last November, even before we began drafting a \nbill, Senator McCain and I wrote the President inviting him to work \nwith us. Since we never heard back, we introduced legislation in \nDecember. In the intervening months, we held an informative hearing on \nthe proposal, reported it out of the Governmental Affairs Committee, \nwhich I am privileged to chair, and eventually won the backing of 22 \nco-sponsors from both parties. As was the case with creating a \nDepartment of Homeland Security, I welcome the administration's \nsupport--regardless of when it arrives.\n  Since Friday, we have entered into discussions with the \nadministration, which requested a variety of changes. Assuming passage \nof the amendment today, we will gladly continue these talks.\n  This amendment is based on S. 1867, legislation I introduced with \nSenator McCain on December 20 of last year. The legislation has been \nrevised as it made its way through the legislative process. The \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs heard from a distinguished panel of \nwitnesses at a February hearing. The witnesses, all of whom had served \non past commissions, recommended an inquiry by an independent \ncommission into the September 11 terrorist attacks. The bill was \nreported out of committee by voice vote on March 21 of this year. I \nrefer my colleagues to the committee's written report, no. 107-150, for \na fuller explanation of the legislation's, and this amendment's, \ncontext, purposes and justification. The bill reported out of committee \ncontained some changes from our original version. Several of those \nchanges were the result of our discussions with Senator Torricelli, who \nhad introduced a similar bill with Senator Grassley and others. Others \nwere the result of the recommendations of our hearing witnesses and \nextensive consultations with experts.\n  Last Thursday I described several ways in which the amendment we are \nvoting on today differs from S. 1867, the bill that was reported out of \ncommittee. The amendment would ensure an even division between \nRepublicans and Democrats in choosing commission members--with the \nmajority parties in the Senate and the House receiving three picks \neach, while the minority parties in each house get two picks each. This \nis the configuration of an\n\n[[Page S9087]]\n\nequivalent commission recently created by the House, and it has other \nnotable precedent, in the form of the National Commission on Terrorism, \ncreated by Congress in 1999, and headed by former Ambassador Paul \nBremer.\n  There are three other changes from the text of S. 1867. The amendment \nemphasizes that the Commission should build upon the work of \nCongressional committees and other inquiries, especially the joint \ninquiry of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees regarding the \nterrorist attacks. We do not by any means intend this change to suggest \nthat the Commission should avoid looking at specific issues related to \nintelligence just because the Committees had investigated the same \nissues. Rather, the Commission should use the Committees' fine report \nas a resource, as it continues to review the role of the intelligence \ncommunity.\n  The amendment also provides that the Vice Chairperson of the \nCommission, in addition to the Chairperson and others, can issue \nsubpoenas. The amendment envisions a Vice-Chairperson with powers and \nresponsibilities essentially equivalent to that of the Chair. This \nmodel worked very well in the case of the National Commission on \nTerrorism. Finally, the amendment makes technical improvements to the \nbill's alternative subpoena enforcement mechanism.\n  As Senator McCain and I envision it, the commission would have \npurview over a broad range of areas. Of course, it would examine \nintelligence shortcomings, which are at the very core of our failure to \nanticipate September 11th. But it could also scrutinize a variety of \nother factors--law enforcement, immigration and border control, foreign \npolicy, commercial aviation, for example--before recommending reforms.\n  Commission members would be private citizens--not elected officials--\nwith expertise in a range of subjects related to what went wrong on \nSeptember 11th. And the commission would have subpoena power and the \nright to meet in private session. It would also have enough time, a top \nlevel staff, ample investigatory powers, and adequate funding to \nperform its job properly.\n  We are not interested in using this commission to point fingers \nacross the room. I hope and believe that an independent commission will \nmake the government as a whole look in the mirror. After all, it is our \ncommon security, and improving it is our common responsibility.\n  We have a history of learning from history. America's first day of \ninfamy, Pearl Harbor, was followed both by congressional investigations \nand by an independent commission. In the wake of other national \ntragedies--the assassination of President Kennedy, for example, and the \nChallenger explosion--similar independent investigations were launched \nimmediately.\n  In the last two decades, investigative panels were convened after \ndevastating terrorist attacks against U.S. military and diplomatic \nfacilities, including the Marine barracks in Beirut; Khobar Towers in \nSaudi Arabia; U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania; and the USS Cole. \nIn 1989--after months of pressure from Congress and families of \nvictims--the first President Bush created a commission to investigate \nthe Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland.\n  Essential lessons were learned from each of these inquiries, and the \ninquiries represent a recognition in the value of immediately reviewing \nterrorist attacks, to provide vital information about possible \nvulnerabilities which could be corrected. The commission we propose \nwould build on those examples.\n  I have heard the criticism that recommendations of commissions are \nnot followed, and therefore the modest expense in establishing them is \nnot justified. Yet past commissions, with a small investment of \nresources, have had a real impact. Just ask Donald Rumsfeld: the \nCommission to Assess the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States, \nwhich he chaired, recast our assumptions about the ballistic missile \nthreat. What better evidence can there be than the homeland security \nlegislation we are debating today, modeled closely on the \nrecommendations of the prescient Hart-Rudman Commission? The National \nCommission on Terrorism issued a litany of policy prescriptions ranging \nfrom domestic law enforcement to intelligence to foreign policy--a \nnumber of those immediately passed the Senate, and more have been \nimplemented since the September 11 attacks. And if in the past we had \nbeen lulled into complacency that we were safe against terrorism within \nour borders, how can anyone doubt that the enormity of the September 11 \nattacks will not keep this nation focused on what needs to be done?\n  At our Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on the commission bill \nin February, Columbia University Professor Richard Betts, who served on \nthe National Commission on Terrorism, said an independent commission is \nimportant because it would conduct a quote ``sober investigation that \nthe public could have confidence is as objective as humanly possible.'' \nThis is our goal.\n  I have met with families of September 11th victims on several \noccasions, and their desire for this commission is the strongest \nargument I can present on its behalf. The persistent advocacy of \nStephen Push, Kristen Breitweiser, Mary Fetchet, Beverly Eckert, Monica \nGabrielle, and many others--despite their devastating loss--has \ninspired my profound respect.\n  Husbands, wives, and children were murdered on September 11th. Their \nsurvivors need to come to terms with what happened so that they may \nmove on with their lives. The families want answers to questions that \necho in my own mind and heart: Why was such a simple plan so successful \nin achieving its evil goals? What opportunities were missed to prevent \nthe destruction?\n  At a June rally organized by family members in support of this \nlegislation, Mindy Kleinberg, a mother of three who lost her husband, \nAlan, on September 11th, told the New York Times--``I want to be able \nto look into the eyes of my children, and tell them the evil is over \nthere, that they are safe, and that their country is secure. Nine \nmonths have passed, and I still cannot do that. I do not have \nanswers.''\n  Let us help these families--and the nation they represent--find \nclosure. Three thousand men, women, and children of America's family \nwere murdered. We need definitive answers that force us to face what \nhappened and why--answers that will ultimately lead to a stronger and \nbetter America, and an America less tortured by piecemeal speculations \nabout what might have been.\n  President John F. Kennedy said, ``In the long history of the world, \nonly a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom \nin its hour of maximum danger. I do not shrink from this \nresponsibility; I welcome it.''\n  We too must welcome it, with a strong vote in favor of creating this \ncommission so that we might live well-informed and therefore safer \nlives in the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I will stand by what I have said before \nin behalf of the commission.\n  I yield the floor at this point to my friend from Connecticut under \nthe previous order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will keep an eye on the door. If our \nfriend from Arizona comes through the door, I will abbreviate my \nremarks.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dodd are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. DODD. I see my colleague from Arizona on the floor. I know he \nwishes to be heard on this amendment.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleague from Connecticut.\n  Mr. President, are we still going to vote at 2:15?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been extended by 2 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. By 2 minutes. I will take about 3 minutes, if that is OK \nwith my other friend from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Arizona, who has been such a leader in this effort, be \nallowed to speak for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Chair and thank my friend from Connecticut, \nSenator Dodd. And I hope he will always yield to me when I arrive on \nthe floor. I appreciate it.\n\n[[Page S9088]]\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote to create a \ncommission, composed of the most credible people in America, that will \ntell the American people the truth about how our Government was not \nprepared for the threat of catastrophic terrorism last September.\n  To question American policies and practices in the months and years \nbefore September 11 is not to engage in a political witch hunt intended \nto score partisan points against one administration or another. To \nprobe deeply but fairly into American policies predating the terrorist \nattacks is to examine the scale of American leaders' failure to imagine \nand plan for a contingency that was not, in fact, unimaginable. By \nAmerican leaders, I mean the Congress, as well as other branches of \nGovernment. A thorough, nonpartisan investigation would provide an \ninformed basis for the current administration and the Congress to take \nall necessary measures to ensure that our country is prepared to meet \nthe challenges of this age of terrorism.\n  On Friday, the White House announced its support for an independent \ncommission to address ``the panapoly of other important and related \nissues as they may relate to September 11 and ``strengthen our ability \nto prevent and defend against terrorism and protect the security of the \nAmerican public.'' We will continue to work with the administration to \nrefine our legislation and appreciate their support. We look forward to \ncontinuing our dialogue with the White House as the homeland security \nbill moves through conference. We are also pleased to have the support \nof Senators Shelby and Graham, the Senate leaders of the joint \ncongressional investigation into last year's attacks.\n  The attacks on September 11 represented more than a failure of \nintelligence. They highlighted a failure of national policy to respond \nto the development of a global terror network implacably hostile to \nAmerican interests. In 1989, the United States walked away from \nAfghanistan after fighting a proxy war against occupying Soviet forces. \nThe subsequent civil war created the conditions for the rise of the \nTaliban, as the Afghan people submitted to a totalitarian government \nthat imposed order over the chaos of warlord rule. The United States \nstood by passively as the Taliban formed an alliance with Osama bin \nLaden that turned Afghanistan into a sovereign training camp for al-\nQaida to prepare its attacks on America as it built a global network of \nterror. American leaders, including those of us in Congress, watched \nand knew all of this.\n  The United States declined to respond meaningfully to terrorist \nattacks against our interests throughout the previous decade--again, a \nfailure of national policy over the course of successive \nadministrations and many Congresses that encouraged our enemies to \nperceive us as weak and unwilling to defend our interests. The 1993 \nbombing of the World Trade Center; the 1995 and 1996 bombings of \nAmerican targets in Saudi Arabia; the 1998 attacks on our Embassies in \nKenya and Tanzania; the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole--all of these \nattacks were preludes of growing intensity to the attacks against New \nYork and Washington, DC.\n  In retrospect, a pattern becomes clear, a period in which the \npreeminent threat to American national security arose from the ashes of \nwar and chaos in Afghanistan while the United States preoccupied itself \nelsewhere. We need to absorb the lessons of our failure so that, as \nafter other national tragedies such as Pearl Harbor and the Kennedy \nassassination, we can tell those we are privileged to lead that evil \nmen will never perpetrate such horror again. This commission will help \nus do that.\n  I thank my dear friend and colleague, the Senator from Connecticut, \nMr. Lieberman, for his leadership, and I look forward to us completing \nthis job.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, is there time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining in \nopposition.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  I wanted to say a personal word about the extraordinary way in which \nthe families of so many of those who were lost on September 11 have \ntaken their unspeakable losses and personal grief and turned it into \nremarkable, continuing acts of advocacy for action by our Government to \nguarantee, as best any human can, that no other families will suffer \nthe losses that they have suffered.\n  These families have pushed relentlessly, and with such principle and \npurpose, for the creation of this commission to answer the question \nthat they naturally ask, that we all ask but they ask it with a \npersonal poignancy: How could this have happened?\n  Earlier this year, at a rally of family members in support of the \ncreation of just such a commission as our amendment would provide, \nMindy Kleinberg, a mother of three, who lost her husband, Alan, last \nSeptember 11, said:\n\n       I want to be able to look into the eyes of my children and \n     tell them the evil is over there, that they are safe, and \n     that their country is secure. . . . Months have passed, and I \n     still cannot do that. I do not have answers.\n\n  The purpose of this commission is to provide those answers for Mrs. \nKleinberg, for her children, for all the survivors and friends, and for \nall Americans, to make sure their Government is doing everything it \nhumanly can to prevent anything like the tragic attacks of September 11 \nof 2001 from ever happening again.\n  I think this is our best way to do that. I urge the adoption of this \namendment.\n  I yield back the remaining time that I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n4694. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Montana (Mr. Baucus) and \nthe Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have spoken with the minority. I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senator from West Virginia, the President \npro tempore of the Senate, be recognized to speak for up to 1 hour as \nin morning business. I have spoken with Senator Gramm, and he is not \nquite ready to offer his amendment. He said he would be ready at or \nabout 3 o'clock. I ask unanimous consent that at 3:40 p.m. we return to \nthis bill. At that time, Senator Santorum indicated he might be present \nin the Chamber to talk about legislation he has. At that time, we will \nmove forward on the legislation, hoping Senator Gramm is ready to offer \nhis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S9089]]\n\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/24/senate-section/article/S9089-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9089-S9093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         PROGRESS ON THE FISCAL YEAR 2003 APPROPRIATIONS BILLS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, the appropriations process is stalled. To \nuse an overused expression: It is dead in the water. Certain Members in \nthe other body have asserted that progress on the 13 appropriations \nbills for the fiscal year that begins October 1 has been slowed because \nSenate Democrats want to have a spending spree. Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth.\n  Nearly 2 months ago, on July 25, the Senate Appropriations Committee \nreported the thirteenth and final appropriations bill for fiscal year \n2003, the earliest this has been accomplished since 1988. All 13 bills \nare bipartisan, and all 13 bills are fiscally responsible. There was \nnot a single vote in committee against any of the 13 bills. Republicans \nand Democrats on the committee voted for these bills.\n  The bills totaled $768.1 billion and are consistent with the \ncommittee allocation approved by a vote of 29 to 0 in June. The 13 \nbills are consistent with the $768.1 billion allocation that was \napproved by the Senate Budget Committee when it reported its budget \nresolution last March. The bills are consistent with the $768.1 billion \nallocation that was supported by 59 Members of the Senate when the \nallocation was voted on during floor debate on the Defense \nauthorization bill on June 20.\n  The holdup in the appropriations process is because the White House \nis giving marching orders to the House of Representatives. Regrettably, \nthe House Appropriations Committee has reported only 8 of the bills \ncompared to the Senate Appropriations Committee's 13. The House has \npassed only 5 of those 8 bills.\n  I stress that the holdup is not the fault of the House Appropriations \nCommittee chaired by Mr. Young of Florida. It is not the fault of that \ncommittee. They have wanted to do their work.\n  The holdup is a result of the House Republican leadership decision to \nstop all House floor action on appropriations bills. Perhaps the \ndecision is being handed down from on high to the House Republican \nleadership. The House has not adopted an appropriations bill since July \n24. With only 1 week to go before the beginning of the fiscal year, the \nHouse has not passed an appropriations bill in almost 9 weeks.\n  For the record, let me state that there is no scheme in the Senate to \nexplode spending--none. Surely I would have heard about it if there \nwere such. The Senate Appropriations Committee has produced 13 bills \nthat total $768.1 billion plus $2.2 billion in emergency spending for \nFEMA disaster relief, low-income home energy assistance, and funds to \nfight fires. The committee also approved an additional $2.2 billion of \nadvance appropriations for programs to help educate disadvantaged and \ndisabled children. No tricks. As Shakespeare said: There are no tricks \nin plain and simple faith. No hiding the ball; no hat trick here.\n  Our 13 bills have been available for all the world to see for 2 \nmonths. The House is not moving forward as a result of a political \ndispute over the ceiling for spending in fiscal year 2003. The House \nRepublican leadership, in collaboration with the White House, is \ninsisting on the level of $759.1 billion. Yet the House Appropriations \nCommittee has not been able to stretch those dollars far enough to \nwrite their bills.\n  The House Republican leadership has been informed by many members of \ntheir own caucus that they cannot vote for the Labor-HHS-Education bill \nat the levels requested by the President because that bill shortchanges \nAmerica's classrooms and ignores our pressing health care needs. Yet, \ninexplicably, instead of changing course, the House Republican \nleadership has shut the appropriations process down.\n\n  Could it be because, with an election looming some members of the \nHouse want to avoid certain votes? If the Republican leadership has \nforsaken its duty to make careful choices for the American people and \nis driving the Congress toward a long-term continuing resolution, that \nmeans putting the Government on auto-pilot. This is the worst possible \nway to govern. It allows for obfuscation and abuse. It ignores critical \nneeds.\n  In order to cover the politics involved which are the real reasons \nfor the delay, the administration characterizes the $13 billion of \nadditional spending in the Senate bills as ``wasteful spending.'' \nFrankly, this is just simplistic, political rhetoric.\n  The administration tries to point political fingers at the Senate \ncharging that we are spending too much on domestic programs. But where \nis the real growth in spending? The President proposed a 13 percent, or \n$45 billion, increase in spending for our Nation's defense programs. \nLet us note that the $759 billion ceiling forced the House to cut the \nPresident's request for the Department of Defense by $1.6 billion. The \n$768 billion ceiling available in the Senate allowed the Senate to \nrestore $1.2 billion of that cut in DoD and the funds are being used \nfor military readiness programs, for essential military construction \nprograms, and for counter terrorism projects. In addition, the Senate \nwas able to add $375 million to the President's February request for \nnuclear programs at the Department of Energy.\n  The President proposed a 25 percent increase in domestic homeland \nsecurity programs. The $768 billion Senate level permitted the Senate \nto fully fund essential homeland defense investments such as additional \nfirefighting funds, additional funds for port security, State and local \nlaw enforcement, and border security. Unfortunately, the House ceiling \non spending is so low that the House Appropriations Committee has not \neven been able to mark up the Veterans/HUD/Independent Agencies bill \nand the Commerce/Justice/State bill which provide funding for many \nhomeland defense programs. Yet the White House requested these \nincreases, and they are obviously critically important for the security \nof our people.\n  When it comes to domestic programs other than homeland defense, the \nPresident proposed to freeze spending at the FY 2002 levels. That is a \nhard freeze with no adjustment for inflation or for other factors such \nas a growing population or growing unemployment. The $768 billion \nSenate level permitted the Senate Appropriations Committee to increase \ndomestic programs by 2.6 percent. Not 13 percent, not 25 percent, just \n2.6 percent for the domestic programs that serve our Nation.\n  And for what did we use that 2.6 percent increase?\n  We used it to increase funding for veterans medical care by $1.1 \nbillion above the President's request. There are currently over 280,000 \nveterans on waiting lists for VA medical care. The President's request \njust did not adequately fund veterans' needs.\n  If I ever saw a veteran, there sits one in the chair presiding over \nthe Senate of the United States. There is a man who has given \neverything but his life for this country. I would be ashamed to run \nagainst him.\n  With war drums beating all around us, I think we ought to be very \ncareful to send the message to our veterans that we will take care of \ntheir present and future needs.\n  Last year, Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act with broad, \nbipartisan support. But, this law becomes nothing but an unfunded \nmandate on our local governments if the Federal funding is not there \nfor States to implement the new act. It takes money to reduce class \nsizes, to provide teacher training, to invest in new technology and to \ndevelop meaningful assessment tools. The Senate Committee bill \nincreases education funding by $3.2 billion, or 6.5 percent, six times \nthe meager 1 percent increase proposed by the President. Rhetoric is \nfine, but when it comes to our children's education we have to put our \nmoney where our mouth is, as the old saying goes.\n  The Senate used the 2.6 percent increase to make sure that we could \nkeep Amtrak operating. A bankrupt Amtrak would mean that 23,000 \nemployees would be thrown on to the unemployment line. Some 500 \ncommunities served by Amtrak would lose intercity passenger rail \nservice forever, including 130 communities that have no air service \nwhatsoever, and 113 communities that don't even have intercity bus \nservice. It means the termination not just of Amtrak service across the \nNation but also the termination of commuter rail service from Boston to \nCalifornia because many of these services are either operated under \ncontract\n\n[[Page S9090]]\n\nby Amtrak or they run over railroad tracks that are owned by Amtrak. \nSome 1.7 million citizens that ride Amtrak each month will lose \nservice. So will roughly 4.2 million citizens that use those commuter \nrail services each month. If you think the highways are crowded during \nthe morning and evening commuting times, just wait until Amtrak and the \ncommuter rail systems are terminated overnight.\n  Last, January, in the State of the Union, the President said, ``When \nAmerica works, America prospers, so my economic security plan can be \nsummed up in one word: jobs.'' Yet his budget proposed to dramatically \ncut highway spending below last year's level. For every billion dollars \nwe spend on highways, we create 42,000 jobs. The Senate bill provides \nan obligation limit that restores the $8.6 billion cut proposed by the \nPresident's request, saving over 350,000 jobs. The President talks \nabout jobs but the modest increase in domestic spending contained in \nthe Senate bills actually creates jobs.\n  We used the 2.6 percent increase to provide for a $184 million \nincrease above the President's request for the Securities and Exchange \nCommission. If the Congress is serious about rooting out corporate \nfraud, the SEC needs the resources to hire investigators and to fund \nthe newly established Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, as \nauthorized in the Sarbanes-Oxley Corporate Accountability Act of 2002.\n  We used the 2.6 percent increase to increase funding for job-training \nprograms by more than half a billion dollars over the President. This \nis at a time when more than 8 million Americans are unemployed and \nthere has been an increase of more than one million unemployed persons \nin just the last 12 months.\n  We used the 2.6 percent increase to restore over $94 million in cuts \nproposed by the President in Fossil Energy Research and Development \nprograms and provide for a $58 million increase.\n  If the administration wants to reduce the nation's dependence on \nforeign oil, it is not going to do so by cutting our investment in \nfossil fuels, as proposed by the President. At a time when a new war in \nthe Gulf may have long-term implications for this nation's energy \nsecurity, it is vitally important that the United States continue to \nexplore and develop new technologies which allow us to tap our own \nabundant energy supplies. We should have been working on energy \nindependence diligently for the last 20 years. But the oil interests \nthat bankroll politicians have been too strong. Now we see the cost of \nbowing to King Oil.\n  We used the modest increase in domestic spending to increase funding \nby $200 million above the President's request for Head Start. In his \nState of the Union Address, the President stated that: ``We need to \nprepare our children to read and succeed in school with improved Head \nStart and early childhood development programs.'' The Senate bill would \nresult in 17,000 more low-income children being served.\n  We used the 2.6 percent increase to restore over $900 million of cuts \nproposed by the President in Justice Department programs for State and \nlocal law enforcement. With State and local governments cutting their \nbudgets--and they are cutting them. We read about cuts in the budgets \nfor the States of Maryland and Virginia. With State and local \ngovernments cutting their budgets in response to the recent recession, \ndoes the President think that we will make our Nation more secure by \ncutting law enforcement grants to State and local governments?\n  These are just a few examples of how the Senate used the modest $13 \nbillion increase above the House allocation. Is that $13 billion \nincrease excessive? No.\n  Is it wasteful? No.\n  I believe it is prudent. It is thoughtful. It is the result of \ncareful decision making, done on a bipartisan basis. And most of it has \ngone to fund either national defense or homeland security.\n  The choices we make in the Congress about how we allocate the \npeople's money should be based on hard work and careful analysis. It \nshould not be based on a simplistic review of the facts, nor should it \nbe distorted by the save-your-hide mentality--the save-your-hide \nmentality--of an election year. Recently, the Congress approved a $5.1 \nbillion emergency contingency fund, including $2.5 billion for homeland \ndefense programs. Based on the recommendation of Office of Management \nand Budget Director Mitch Daniels, the President chose to cancel that \nfunding, explaining that it was ``wasteful spending.'' Yet, with one \nexception, he chose not to identify the ``wasteful spending.'' Was it \nthe airport security funding or the funding to secure our nation's \nnuclear weapons complex? Was it the funds to train and equip our \nNation's firefighters? Was it the funding for veterans medical care or \nthe funding to fulfill the President's commitment to fight the global \nAIDS epidemic? Which of these programs that protect American lives does \nthe President consider to be ``wasteful''?\n  The President never answered those questions. Instead, the one \nexample of wasteful spending that the President chose to give was $2 \nmillion for a single project, which the President himself has chosen to \nfund in the 2003 budget. If it was wasteful spending in 2002, why is it \nnot wasteful spending in 2003? If it is worth spending in 2003, why not \nspend it in 2002? The rest of the money he did not spend, he gave no \nreason for withholding. It was money for homeland security. It was \nmoney to make us safer here at home. Sometimes, I just have to question \nthe sincerity of an effort on homeland security which seems based \nalmost wholly on sound bites.\n  The President, through his Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget, is currently working with the House Republican leadership to \nforce the funding of the entire domestic side of the Government into a \nlong-term continuing resolution for nearly half the fiscal year. \nSomething is going on. They want to put the education of our children, \nthe care of our veterans, and our investments in homeland security on \nautomatic pilot at last year's funding levels because we are in an \nelection year.\n  Last week, the President's chief economic adviser, Lawrence Lindsey, \nwas asked by a reporter for the Wall Street Journal what he thought the \ncost of the war in Iraq might be and what the impact of that cost might \nbe on our Nation's economy. He responded by estimating that the cost \nwould likely be between $100 billion and $200 billion. How about that. \nThat is just pocket change--small. Oh, somewhere between $100 billion \nand $200 billion. When asked what the impact of that $100-$200 billion \nexpenditure would be on the economy, the President's chief economic \nadviser said, ``That's nothing.'' Nothing.\n  The administration believes that $100-$200 billion of spending on the \nwar on Iraq will have no impact on the economy, but $13 billion more of \nneeded spending on our nation's education, public health, veterans \nmedical care and transportation systems is wasteful.\n  In just 2 years the projected $359 billion surplus for Fiscal Year \n2003 has swung wildly to a projected deficit of $145 billion. The \nSenate Budget Committee estimates that of that $504 billion swing, $404 \nbillion came from reduced revenues or interest payments on those \nreduced revenues. In other words, 80 percent of the lost surplus in \nFiscal Year 2003 came from reduced revenues. Another 5 percent came \nfrom increased defense spending. Another 9 percent of the lost surplus \ncame from expenditures related to the response to the attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001. Approximately 4 percent came from increased \nmandatory spending such as the farm bill. And, how about domestic \nspending? How much of the $504 billion swing in the surplus estimate \ncame from domestic discretionary spending? Just 1 percent.\n  Just 1 percent of that dramatic swing in the surplus estimate for \nFiscal Year 2003 came about from increased discretionary spending. Yet, \nthis small portion of the budget is what the White House political \nmanipulators will endeavor to highlight and blame for every blemish in \nour fiscal picture.\n  The game, of course, is to wrap the bills up, take them behind closed \ndoors--aha, I have been behind those closed doors--take them behind \nclosed doors, where this White House is most comfortable and do deals \nthat benefit the White House. Never mind about the horrendous and \nirresponsible policy of government by continuing resolution. Never \nmind, never mind C.R.s.\n  Let me give you just a few examples of what will happen if we have a \ncontinuing resolution until March, compared to the levels in the bi-\npartisan\n\n[[Page S9091]]\n\nSenate Appropriations Committee-reported bills. Now listen:\n  The number of farm operating loans, during the most important part of \nthe growing season, will be cut from 6,643 to 3,435. That is not all.\n  The number of multi-family homes built in rural America will be \nreduced by 2,500.\n  The number of homes in rural America that will be rehabilitated for \nlow-income families will be reduced by 8,243.\n  The funding to help State and local governments--hear me now. Can you \nhear me now, Governor Wise, down there in Charlestown, WV? Governor \nWise, listen.\n  Funding to help State and local governments develop their capacity to \nrespond to or prevent terrorist attacks would be reduced from $2 \nbillion in the Senate bill to only $651 million under the continuing \nresolution.\n  The Immigration and Naturalization Service is at a critical juncture \nin developing a comprehensive entry/exit system to protect our Nation's \nborders. Only $13.3 million would be available under a CR compared to \n$362 million in the Senate bill, resulting in a significant delay in \nthis system.\n  I should repeat that statement.\n  The Immigration and Naturalization Service is at a critical juncture \nin developing a comprehensive entry/exit system to protect our Nation's \nborders. Only $13.3 million would be available under a continuing \nresolution compared to $362 million in the Senate bill resulting in a \nsignificant delay in this system.\n  The Securities and Exchange Commission would have to terminate all \nhiring, including 100 additional staff funded in the last supplemental \nto investigate corporate fraud.\n  Hear this now. Nuclear plants in Tennessee and Texas will have to lay \noff 240 security guards.\n  Every 6 seconds another person is infected with the AIDS virus. Every \n6 seconds--1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6--another person is infected with the AIDS \nvirus.\n  AIDS has killed more than 25 million people, and at the rate at which \nit is spreading, the number of people to die of AIDS-related causes may \nreach 65 million by the year 2020--just 18 years from now. Each year, \nmother-to-child transmission of the AIDS virus kills half a million \nchildren, and infects another 600,000. On June 19, President Bush \nannounced, with considerable fanfare, a $500 million initiative to save \nchildren from AIDS. He said: ``Today, I call on other industrialized \nnations and international organizations to join this crucial effort to \nsave children from disease and death.'' Yet under a continuing \nresolution, international AIDS funding would be cut by $225 million.\n  Come, my western friends.\n  Critical funding for fighting fires that have been raging across the \nland would be eliminated;\n  $716 million worth of anti-terrorism, force protection projects \nsought by the Defense Department--projects that are designed to better \nprotect our military installations at home and abroad from terrorist \nattack--would be put on hold.\n  More than $1 billion worth of family housing construction projects \nand another $1 billion worth of barracks construction would be stopped \ndead in their tracks. Military personnel and their families, already \nfacing the strains of war, would be dealt further delays in what is \ntheir number one quality-of-life issue.\n  A long-term continuing resolution will severely undermine the ability \nof the new Transportation Security Administration to improve aviation \nsecurity and security in all other transportation modes. Many of the \nrequirements of the new Transportation Security Act are going to \nrequire large expenditures in the first quarter of fiscal year 2003. \nThese expenditures involve continued purchases of explosive detection \nequipment to keep bombs from being placed on our airliners. Funds are \nalso needed to hire new federal screeners and make our nation's \nseaports more secure.\n  A long-term continuing resolution will likely result in the \nbankruptcy of Amtrak. Amtrak is still just barely surviving, managing \nits available cash to survive on a day-to-day basis until Congress can \nprovide it a major necessary cash infusion as part of the \nappropriations process for 2003. If we suspend the completion of the \nappropriations process until the third quarter of the year, Amtrak will \nbe declaring bankruptcy before Christmas. Bye, bye, Santa Claus.\n  A long-term continuing resolution would seriously undermine air \nsafety. Just this past summer, we came within weeks of seeing the FAA \nfurlough air traffic controllers for lack of available funding. A long \nterm continuing resolution at current rates would result in not \nreplacing the hundreds of air traffic controllers, safety inspectors \nand maintenance technicians that would retire or leave the agency \nduring the first half of the fiscal year. The safety of our skies will \nbe left to a continuously dwindling number of controllers. All this \nwould be happening at a time when we are trying to get Americans to fly \nagain after the events of September 11.\n  A long-term continuing resolution would result in the Customs Service \nhaving to defer the hiring of more than 628 inspectors and agents for \nposting at high-risk land and sea ports-of-entry.\n  Come on, now. Hasn't the President been out there talking about how \nwe should ram through this homeland security bill?\n  A long-term continuing resolution would result, as I say again, in \nthe Customs Service having to defer the hiring of more than 628 \ninspectors and agents for posting at high-risk land and sea ports of \nentry.\n\n  A long-term continuing resolution means thousands of FEMA fire \ngrants, grants for interoperable communications equipment, grants to \nupgrade emergency operations centers, grants to upgrade search and \nrescue teams, grants for emergency responder training and grants to \nimprove state and local planning would be delayed for at least 5 \nmonths.\n  Under a long-term CR, the VA health care system will be funded at a \nlevel that is $2.4 billion short of the level proposed in the Senate \npassed fiscal year 2003 VA-HUD bill. Without increased resources, VA \nmay not be able to sustain open enrollment for all veterans.\n  Here it is. Friends, Romans, veterans, lend me your ears.\n  There are currently over 280,000 veterans on waiting lists for VA \nmedical care. Under a long-term continuing resolution, the waiting list \nwill more than double.\n  The VA will schedule 2.5 million fewer outpatient clinic appointments \nfor veterans, and 235,000 fewer veterans will be treated in VA \nhospitals.\n  And these are only the items--I have just named a few--these are the \nonly items which can be known and computed at this time. Only God \nknows--only God knows--what other nasty little problems will result \nfrom the OMB's--the Office of Management and Budget's--interpretation \nof the continuing resolution.\n  If President George W. Bush is planning to take our Nation to war \nagain in the Persian Gulf, the American people should not have to worry \nabout whether we are securing our homeland, whether their children are \nin small classes, with qualified teachers, whether Amtrak will go \nbankrupt or whether our veterans are getting proper care. This \nPresident, so eager for war abroad, should pause for a moment, and lay \naside the war plans long enough to work with the Congress on a prudent \nand responsible level of spending here at home for the American people.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I would like to ask the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia, if he has a minute, a question.\n  The President took office saying he was going to change the tone of \nthe debate in Washington. The Senator has served with a number of other \nPresidents--Democrat and Republican--in the past. I wonder if the \nSenator believes that the tone has been changed for the better or for \nthe worse?\n  If I am not correct, hasn't the Senator attempted, on numerous \noccasions, to work in a constructive and cooperative fashion with the \nWhite House\n\n[[Page S9092]]\n\nin fashioning this budget, this spending plan; and hasn't the Senator \nbeen rebuffed in those efforts?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. May I respond to the distinguished Senator from Minnesota. \nIf the Senator is referring to the numerous occasions on which my dear \ncolleague, Senator Ted Stevens--who sits across the other side of the \naisle--and I sought to have the President send up to the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, as a witness, the distinguished former \nGovernor of Pennsylvania, the Homeland Security Director, Mr. Tom \nRidge, the answer is, yes, yes, yes. And we met with failure in all of \nour efforts.\n  We even wrote to the President, asking that he have Senator Stevens \nand myself come down to the White House and appear before the President \nto make our case.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, may I also ask----\n  Mr. BYRD. May I say, Senator Stevens and I weren't even shown the \ncourtesy of a response from the President. Some of his underlings--I \nhave great respect for them--some of his underlings responded: The \nanswer is no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I appreciate the Senator's candor with regard to the \nnumbers that have been presented here today because it is my \nunderstanding--and I am glad the Senator refreshed my memory--that the \nspending proposals that the administration has sent to the Congress \nwere, in fact, a significant increase, 9 percent, or I believe the \nSenator said a 13-percent increase in discretionary spending from this \nfiscal year over to the next, an unheard of increase in discretionary \nspending.\n  It is also my recollection--I believe the Senator pointed this out--\nthat, with the change in the budget predictions, the country has gone \nfrom looking at surpluses over the next decade to looking at a string \nof deficits over the next decade.\n  It is this Senator's impression that the administration is trying to \nput the blame for this fiscal disarray on the Senate or on the House \nwhen, in fact, it is the administration's own tax and spending \nproposals which have created these deficits for this year and for next \nyear, and for as far as the eye can see, and has caused this financial \nburden to be placed on future generations.\n  It seems to this Senator that this administration is trying, with \nthese tiny little numbers, relatively speaking, to put the blame where \nit does not belong, which is on this body.\n  I wonder if the Senator will comment on that.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. The Senator from \nMinnesota is very perspicacious in his observations.\n  I am at a loss to understand why we should not be working on our \nappropriations bills. Here we have had one on this floor stalled for \nmany days.\n  The distinguished Republican chairman of the House Appropriations \nCommittee and the Democratic ranking minority member over there, and \nthe ranking minority member over on this side of the Capitol, Senator \nStevens, and I have talked about it, moving our bills.\n  We had a meeting a few days ago, and the very able chairman of the \nHouse Appropriations Committee, Mr. Young, from Florida, importuned me \nand my friend, Senator Ted Stevens, to please have a meeting with the \nable Speaker of the House and with the majority leader of the House and \nwith the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee and the ranking \nmember of the House Appropriations Committee--have a meeting and \nexplain to them how necessary it is for us to move, get on these \nappropriations bills, have the conferences, bring back the conference \nreports, show some action, some progress on these appropriations bills.\n  And we got a turndown. We got a turndown, from what I understand \nthrough my staff. The House leadership, for whatever its reasons, did \nnot want to have that meeting.\n  So here we are, marking time. Time is passing. We will soon be at the \nbeginning of a new fiscal year, and the appropriations bills are dead \nin the water. Why?\n  Mr. DAYTON. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank the Chair.\n  On that subject, I say to the Senator, I recall last year, with the \nnew administration, there was considerable delay in the Senate \nreceiving the administration's spending request, so there were delays \nin the process resulting from that. This year I believe the chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee took great measures to assure a timely \ndisposition of these spending bills.\n  It is my understanding that the Senate Appropriations Committee \nreported these measures out in a very expeditious fashion so they could \nall be passed by the Senate and conferenced before the beginning of the \nnew fiscal year.\n  Is that the record as the chairman has lived through it?\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, that is an accurate statement on the part \nof the able Senator from Minnesota. I believe the Appropriations \nCommittee in the Senate completed our 13 appropriations bills almost 2 \nmonths ago--July 25, the earliest since 1988. If the world wants to see \na committee that really operates in a bipartisan way, take a look at \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee.\n  The Republican former chairman, Mr. Stevens, and I and all of the \nmembers on that committee, Democrats and Republicans, work together. \nThe subcommittee chairmen and the ranking members of those \nsubcommittees work together. There is no bickering about politics in \nthat committee.\n  Again, we have reported these 13 appropriations bills, and they have \nbeen just hanging out there. We can't get any movement. We can't get \nany work done. Why? Why all this holdup?\n  Why doesn't the White House, instead of pointing the finger at the \nSenate and saying, they are guilty of wasteful spending, or pointing to \nthe Congress and saying, pass my homeland security bill, why doesn't \nthe White House meet its responsibilities to the American people and \nprovide homeland security by signing those appropriations bills?\n  No, the President apparently was advised by persons who seem to \nprefer to play politics over serving the American people by moving \nthese appropriations bills and enhancing the homeland security of all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. I will gladly yield.\n  Mr. REID. Would the distinguished Senator from West Virginia explain \nto the American people what he and Senator Stevens did so that all 13 \nappropriations bills would be within the so-called budget so that we \nwould not exceed numbers that, if we had come here and passed a budget, \nit would have been the same?\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, the able Senator from Alaska, Mr. \nStevens--a man who is deserving of the title of ``The Alaskan of the \n20th Century''--and I always work together closely. Our subcommittee \nchairmen and our subcommittee ranking members are equally as determined \nto serve their country by moving these appropriations bills along.\n  Senator Stevens and I take the position that if Senators offer an \namendment that puts us over the spending level, over the point where \nthere have to be offsets, there will be offsets. The Senator from \nAlaska and I take a stand together. We will oppose amendments that add \nup to reckless spending. We don't have that in our committee. It is a \nfine example, and I am so proud of the service of Senator Stevens. But \nour subcommittee chairmen and ranking members are just the same.\n  The Senator from Nevada is the chairman of the Energy and Water \nSubcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations. He and Senator \nDomenici work together the same way in their subcommittee.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. All 13 subcommittees, under the direction of Senators Byrd \nand Stevens, made sure that we brought our bills out under the so-\ncalled 302(b) allocations, even though we didn't have them; isn't that \ntrue?\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely true.\n  Mr. REID. So all the Senate bills we passed were not budget busters; \nis that a fair statement?\n\n[[Page S9093]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. None of them were budget busters.\n  Mr. REID. If someone came to the floor and said: The reason we can't \npass appropriations bills is because we haven't passed a budget, would \nit be a fair statement to say that is without basis in fact?\n  I should say, we don't have a budget, but as far as being the reason \nwe don't do appropriations bills, that wouldn't be a very good reason, \nwould it?\n  Mr. BYRD. No. We agreed in the committee that we would have a certain \ntop line. We voted for that top line. It was unanimous, Republicans and \nDemocrats there, and Republicans and Democrats in the Senate voted for \nthat $768 billion top line. Yet the administration insists on standing \nby the $759 billion figure. That is just a $9 billion difference, just \n$9 billion. We are hung up over that $9 billion.\n  Ask the chairman of the Appropriations Committee in the House. He \nknows what the problem is. He knows that the administration has its \nfeet in concrete when it comes to that top line figure. He, the \nchairman on the House side of the Appropriations Committee, knows that \nwe need that top line which we in the Senate have already agreed on, \n$768 billion, if we are to come close to meeting the needs of the \nAmerican people, talking about homeland security also.\n  Mr. REID. What the Senator is saying is for the Defense \nappropriations bill, which was approximately $350 billion, you are \nsaying the other 12 appropriations bills were $9 billion over what the \nOffice of Management and Budget wanted; is that what the Senator is \nsaying?\n  Mr. BYRD. I am saying that is the difference, $9 billion. That is all \nthat is holding us from going forward. Yet Mr. Lawrence Lindsey, the \nPresident's economic adviser, says with respect to what the anticipated \ncost of the war in Iraq will be----\n  Mr. REID. Up to $200 billion.\n  Mr. BYRD. Somewhere between $100 billion and $200 billion, chicken \nfeed. That is nothing, he says. That is nothing. Yet $9 billion is like \na bone in the throat to this OMB Director down here, Mitch Daniels, and \nthe President and the administration. They are hung up on $9 billion. \nBut when it comes to Iraq, no; $100 billion, no, $200 billion, no.\n  Mr. REID. One last question to the Senator from West Virginia, if we \npassed all of our appropriations bills out of here, including the \nDefense bill, passed them and took them to the House, we still have to \ngo to conference; is that not true?\n  Mr. BYRD. That is true.\n  Mr. REID. And maybe if the President made a good case in conference, \nwe would come back with less than $9 billion over the OMB; is that \nright?\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, I suppose if there were a good case made. But the \ngood case has already been made to the contrary that we need that $9 \nbillion more.\n  Mr. REID. But my point is that the process has been going on for 215 \nyears. The House does its work; the Senate does its work. We go to \nconference. There you work out differences. It is my understanding they \nare not letting us pass bills because they are not passing House bills \nthat we can even go to conference.\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely. The House has not passed the appropriations \nbills. The House Appropriations Committee--no fault of the Republican \nchairman of that committee and others on the committee--has not passed, \nhas not reported out all of the 13 bills in the House. The House has \nreported eight bills. The House Appropriations Committee has reported 8 \nof the 13 bills. I am just talking about the reporting out by the \ncommittee.\n  We haven't done very well over here, either, because we are stalled \non the Interior appropriations bill which has been before the Senate \nnow for many days.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Will the Senator yield for one more question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I yield for a question.\n  Mr. DAYTON. From what I understand from the discussion, the Senate \nAppropriations Committee has come out on time and on budget, and yet we \nare hung up in these delays. The Senator who chairs that committee, who \nhas done everything right in order to meet these deadlines, today is on \nthe Senate floor expressing the catastrophic effects that will result \nacross the country from the failure to meet these deadlines.\n  This Senator presides a great deal and has not heard anyone else come \nbefore the Senate to express his dismay at the human consequences of \nthe failure to come to this agreement.\n  I thank the Senator for bringing these matters to the attention of \nthe Senate and ask, as a final question: What can we do now to try to \nstave off these catastrophes?\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I hope the administration will come to its \nsenses and stop playing politics. What I say, I say with great respect \npersonally and individually to the leadership of the House, but for \npolitical reasons the House has not passed an appropriations bill--not \na single one--in 9 weeks.\n  I have been in Congress now 50 years this year, and I don't recall, \nmay I say to the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania over here, \never in any administration, Democratic or Republican, seeing the likes \nof this. The House will not move its appropriations bills. The House is \ngetting orders from on high--from on Mount Olympus, up there with the \ngods. So there we are. We are stalled, dead in the water. Here we are, \nwithin a few days of the new fiscal year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/24/senate-section/article/S9093-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for morning business has expired.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, one quick comment about being stalled. \nI suggest that in defense of my colleagues in the House--and I try to \nbe a defender of them in the Senate--I suspect one of the reasons is \nthat we don't have a budget. It is very hard to mark up appropriations \nbills when you don't have an agreement between the two bodies. I think \nthat is difficult.\n  The fact that the Senate has not passed a budget has put us in a \nsituation where we have been unable to get conference reports--or even \nbills passed, in some cases--because of the uncertainty of what those \nnumbers are.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. BYRD. I will try to put a question mark after it. The House has a \nbill. We, on this side, agreed on it, and we had a vote in the Senate \nnot too long ago. We got 59 votes; we lack 1 vote, or we would have had \na budget. I hope we have another opportunity to vote.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, yes, the House does have a budget, but \nthe Senate does not. The Senate's top line number is higher than the \nHouse's. That is why we go through the budget process, so that we can \nhave agreement between the two bodies on the top line number, and we \ncan apportion the money accordingly. There is a discrepancy between the \ntwo bodies. That is what creates the problem for the House in being \nable to move their appropriations bills--that trap into which they may \nbe entering.\n  That is not the reason I got up to talk. I know the good Senator has \nspent considerable time talking about this, and I respect his opinion. \nI wanted to very politely disagree with some of the conclusions in his \ndiscussion.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I didn't know the Senator disagreed with \nme.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. With the conclusion. My mother always told me to try to \ndisagree without being disagreeable. I am trying to do that at this \ntime.\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, the Senator is talking about mothers now.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I figure I am on solid ground in that regard.\n  Mr. BYRD. Maybe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/24/senate-section/article/S9093-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9093-S9095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE CARE ACT\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I rise to talk about an issue of grave \nimportance. The Presiding Officer is from New York, and she knows of \nthe great tragedy that has befallen her State as a result of 9/11, and \nthe tremendous generosity that has been pouring out to the victims of \nterrorism in New York, northern Virginia, as well as Pennsylvania.\n  What I am sure Members know also is that, as a result of that \ntremendous outpouring of giving, in a lot of other\n\n[[Page S9094]]\n\nareas of the country charitable giving is actually off between 20 and \n25 percent. Overall, charitable giving is up, but it has been \nchanneled--legitimately so--toward the victims of terror.\n  As a result of that, and for other reasons, too, Senator Lieberman \nand I have been working diligently with the President and our \ncolleagues in the House to try to get a bill through the Congress this \nyear because of its timeliness. It is a 2-year bill to try to get \nemergency help to faith-based organizations--but, frankly, if you read \nthe legislation, to all nonprofit organizations that are out there \ntrying to improve our society. This is a bill targeted at charitable \norganizations in an attempt to get more resources to them at a time \nwhen we have economic distress, wartime distress, as the war on terror \ngoes on, and the distress coming from the terrorist attacks in the \nUnited States.\n  We are trying to respond in a compassionate way with resources to the \nvery organizations that really do meet the human services needs. We are \nworking in the Senate on a strong, bipartisan basis to try to find a \nconsensus.\n  Now, this issue of the President's faith-based initiative has \nattracted a lot of controversy. Basically, it is centered around the \nissue of employment discrimination for those who would receive Federal \ndollars, whether they would be allowed to--because they are religious \norganizations--discriminate in employment.\n  Senator Lieberman and I have attempted to build a bipartisan \nconsensus to try to move a bill through the Senate and have chosen to \nset that issue aside, basically. Probably Senator Lieberman and I have \ndifferent views, and there are different views probably on both sides \nof the aisle. We thought this issue was so important, getting these \nresources at a time of economic need, at a time of war, to the \nnonprofit organizations was so important that, even though I believe \nthis hiring discrimination language for nonprofit organizations is \nimportant, I was willing to set it aside. The President has agreed to \nset this aside in order to get bipartisan consensus to really work in \nthe sort of bare bones, or the nuts and bolts, of what the President's \ninitiative was about--getting help to charitable organizations, or to \nthe ``armies of compassion,'' as he terms it.\n  Senator Lieberman and I came up with the CARE Act, and I thank \nSenators Baucus and Grassley. It has moved through the Finance \nCommittee and has broad bipartisan support. It has the Presiding \nOfficer's support and also the majority leader's support. He has \nannounced his support for the legislation. It is, I believe, from most \npeople's perspective, a noncontroversial bill.\n  There are some who I understand have some concerns about the \nlegislation. We have some on our side, and I understand there are some \non the Democratic side of the aisle with specific provisions of the \nbill. Over the past several months, Senator Lieberman and I have been \nworking with our leadership and the Democratic leadership trying to \nclear this legislation so we can get the bill considered on the floor, \nwith some sort of time agreement, because we are close to wrapping up \nthe session, and with some limitation on amendments.\n  I would be perfectly willing to allow for two, three, four, five, or \nwhatever amendments are necessary to meet objections on both sides of \nthe aisle. Frankly, I don't see many objections, per se, to the bill, \nalthough I understand there are some. I also know there are people--\nbecause this is a tax bill--who would like to see a variety of tax \nissues considered on this bill. I am willing, if that is how we will \nreach a consensus, and I think Senator Lieberman will be willing to \ndebate those.\n  We have been informed by the majority leader that he does not want \nthat debate. He would like to limit this to one amendment on each side \nwith a relatively tight time agreement. That was a little bit of a \nheavy lift from our side of the aisle, but I proceeded, with the help \nof the rest of our leadership team, to work through our side of the \naisle to get some amendments in the managers' package, and from that \nside of the aisle also. Yet we came down here with, yes, we can whittle \nit down.\n  In fact, last week we cleared a unanimous consent request for one \namendment on our side--the one by Senator Gramm from Texas, who has an \namendment to a provision that isn't in the CARE Act, but it is in the \npackage on the floor. Senator Gramm would like to have an amendment. We \nsubmitted that to the Finance Committee 2 weeks ago and to the \nDemocratic leader 2 weeks ago. They have been able to review that \namendment. We have been working on a managers' amendment, and last week \nwe were able to get a consensus. I thank Senators Grassley and Baucus \nand their staffs for working diligently in trying to run through and \nget the consensus managers' amendment, which has been shared with my \nRepublican colleagues.\n  It is a rather voluminous amendment, I might add. It is 200-some \npages. That amendment was shared--and I thank the Finance Committee \nstaff--with the Republican leader and with the minority Finance \nCommittee members. We have that amendment. It is my understanding that \namendment has been cleared on both sides.\n  We are at a point now where we have an amendment that has been \navailable for 2 weeks on our side of the aisle. We have been able to \nhold off all other amendments, and I guarantee I have a long list of \nSenators who would like to offer amendments to this bill. But in the \nspirit of trying to pass what I believe is very important legislation--\nand I think most Members would agree getting help to charitable \norganizations during a time of economic stress and war is a good thing \nto do. It is a short period. It is not a long and permanent change to \nthe Tax Code. It is a short period of infusion of resources into the \ncharitable community. We now are at a place where we can try to move \nforward.\n  I know the Senator from Nevada, who is in the Chamber, the Senator \nfrom Connecticut and the Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Daschle, have \nbeen trying to work on the Democratic side of the aisle to clear this \namendment and this bill and try to get unanimous consent.\n  I will propound a unanimous consent request, and I am curious to hear \nthe comments from the majority whip as to where we are in the state of \nplay on the Democratic side of the aisle at this point. The reason I do \nso, I want to announce beforehand, is that last week when I came to the \nfloor, having worked this now for several weeks, I said it is important \nwe try to bring this issue to a head, and if we could not get a \nunanimous consent agreement offered by the leader that I would do so to \nattempt to provide to the Senate a better understanding of where this \nprocess stands and the likelihood for success in getting this done \nbetween now and the end of the session.\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Request\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time determined by \nthe majority leader, after consultation with the Republican leader, the \nSenate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 496, H.R. 7, which \nis the House-passed President's faith-based initiative, and that it be \nconsidered under the following limitation: That there be 1 hour for \ngeneral debate on the bill equally divided between the two managers; \nthat the only amendment in order, other than a managers' substitute, be \nthe following: One first-degree amendment offered by Senator Reed of \nRhode Island regarding charitable choice; and one first-degree \namendment to be offered by Senator Gramm of Texas regarding land/water \nsales or exchanges; that the amendments be limited to 60 minutes each \nto be divided between the proponents and opponents.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of \nthe above amendments and expiration of debate, the bill be read for a \nthird time and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage of the bill, \nwith no further intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I think \nthere is agreement by the vast majority of Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle that this faith-based bill is important; that it is an \nimportant initiative we need to address. Fortunately, Senator \nLieberman, who has worked hand in hand with the Senator from \nPennsylvania, is in the Chamber. I do not know\n\n[[Page S9095]]\n\nof anyone better qualified to work on this issue than the Senator from \nConnecticut, who has devoted much of his life to issues such as this \nand sets an example on faith-based issues generally. We should listen \nto him, and certainly we will.\n\n  Senators Lieberman and Santorum have crafted a bill that avoids many \nof the pitfalls some believe are contained in the House bill. As the \nSenator from Pennsylvania knows, we have also diligently worked to \nsecure a unanimous consent agreement that would allow for consideration \nof this important legislation.\n  It is frustrating. We have not yet been able to work it out, but \nthere is a lot of frustration on a lot of different issues in the \nSenate at this time.\n  We have been advised by a number of Senators, as late as this \nmorning, that we need more time to work through some of the details of \nthis unanimous consent request.\n  Again, I appreciate Senator Santorum's and Senator Lieberman's \ncommitment to this issue, but I object at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, if I may, objection has been heard, \nbut I thank both my colleague from Pennsylvania and my colleague from \nNevada for their statements. I share the frustration of the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania and the disappointment with our inability to reach an \nagreement to allow for consideration of the CARE Act, which started out \nmuch broader. We have worked on it and really got it down to its \nessence and it is a good bill. It employs an expanding number of tax \nincentives to encourage charitable contributions.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania said not just faith-based organizations \nbut all charitable organizations. It is kind of a community-based or \ncivic-based, nonprofit-based bill. It has the support of 22 cosponsors \nin the Senate. The occupant of the chair, the junior Senator from New \nYork, is one of our original cosponsors. It is supported by the \nPresident, by the majority leader, Senator Daschle, as we said, and by \n1,600--I repeat, 1,600--religious and community groups and social \nservice providers, large and small, across the country.\n\n  We ought to pass this bill. It is one of the best bills we take up \nthis year for not just faith-based groups but for our communities.\n  For reasons that are sometimes clear and sometimes not, some of our \ncolleagues are holding up action on the CARE Act. Some who are \nobjecting have not yet disclosed their identity. Given the fact that \ntime is slipping away in this session, I appeal to my colleagues to not \nlet this opportunity to help make our country as good as our values \nslip away, and let's particularly not squander the bipartisan consensus \nwe have achieved on this method of transforming the good will in our \ncountry into more good work.\n  A lot of effort has gone into crafting this bill by people on both \nsides. I particularly thank Senator Daschle and his staff for the work \nthey have done. Ideally, we can agree, as the Senator's unanimous \nconsent proposal stated, to have one amendment on each side. Maybe we \ncould agree on a couple more, if that is necessary. Let's have an open \ndebate. Let's move the bill forward. Let's deliver this unique CARE \npackage to its rightful destination, which is on the President's desk.\n  I hate to have Senator Santorum and me in a position where we start \nto look for a vehicle to which we can attach this as an amendment. We \nshould not have to do that. I hope, working together, we can avoid that \nand get this legislation passed.\n  I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/24/senate-section/article/S9095-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9095-S9096]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE PROGRESS\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I will make a couple of comments \nconcerning the budget and the appropriations process. A couple of days \nago we heard the majority leader being very critical of the President, \ntalking about his lack of working with Congress and it is his fault we \nhave a budget deficit. Earlier today, we heard the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee being critical of the President. It looks like \na lot of people are throwing rocks at the White House. Maybe that is \nthe easy thing to do, but we should be looking internally and saying: \nWhat have we done?\n  We have not passed a budget, and because we have not passed a budget \nfor the first time since the Budget Act was passed in 1974, we do not \nhave a budget that has the same figures with the House. Every other \nyear--and I have been in the Senate for 22 years--we have always had a \nbudget.\n  Basically, the House and the Senate agree on numbers and then we pass \nappropriations bills. Every year we have been able to do that, except \nfor this year. We have less than a week to go. Next Monday the fiscal \nyear expires, and we have passed 3 out of 13 appropriations bills. That \nis probably the worst record in Senate history--certainly since the \nBudget Act passed. Shame on us.\n  And then to say it is the administration's fault or it is the House's \nfault--I heard somebody say it is the House's fault because the House \nhas not passed very many. That is not our constitutional \nresponsibility. Our responsibility is to pass our bills. We do not have \nto wait for the House. The tradition is, the Senate waits on the House, \nbut we do not have to wait on the House. We certainly do not have to \nspend 4 weeks on the Interior appropriations bill.\n  This is our fourth week on the Interior appropriations bill. The \nInterior bill can, could, and should be done in 1, 2 or, at most, 3 \ndays. It is ridiculous to think we have been on the bill for 4 weeks, \nand we still do not have an end in sight.\n  Some have said the Republicans are filibustering the bill. No \nRepublican is filibustering the Interior bill and no Republican is \nfilibustering the homeland security bill; none, not one. We have \noffered an amendment. I noticed the Democrats offered an amendment. \nThey are entitled to offer amendments. We are entitled to have votes on \nthose amendments. For some reason, the majority has come to this \nconclusion to file cloture.\n  Filing cloture on the Interior bill does nothing. Even if cloture was \ngranted, it does not prohibit somebody from offering an amendment. They \nfiled cloture on an amendment, not on the bill. So that process is \ngoing nowhere fast.\n  Now we have another cloture vote scheduled on homeland security, as \nif that is going to deny us having a chance to vote on the President's \nhomeland security bill. That is not going to happen. It should not \nhappen.\n  My compliments to Senator Gramm and Senator Miller. They have put \ntogether the President's package. They have made some modifications to \ntry and accommodate Members. They are entitled to a vote. This idea of \nwe are going to have cloture on the bill so they will not be able to \noffer their amendment is absurd, and it is not going to happen. So \npeople can file all the cloture motions they want, but it does not move \nthe process of the Senate.\n  We can move it. We can pass these bills. On the Interior bill, all \nsomeone has to do is move to table the amendment. Let's find out where \nthe votes are. That is what we used to do. If the managers of the \namendment do not like it, they can move to table it. They do not need \nto file cloture. They do not need a supermajority; just move to table \nit. It may well have the votes.\n\n  Certainly the President is entitled to have a vote on homeland \nsecurity. It would be absurd to invoke cloture so that amendment would \nnot be allowed. It brings home the fact the Senate is dysfunctioning; \nthe Senate is not working. We had a very important energy bill. Did it \ngo through committee? No. Did Senators who have experience and \nexpertise in the energy issues get to mark up the bill? No. It came on \nthe floor of the Senate. We spent 6 or 7 weeks working on marking up \nthe bill on the Senate floor, and now it is in\n\n[[Page S9096]]\n\nthe conference. Hopefully, something will come out of that.\n  Did the Senate pass a prescription drug bill? No. Was it marked up in \nthe Finance Committee? No. Did we have a markup? Did Members on the \nFinance Committee, some of whom have experience and expertise on \nprescription drugs and Medicare--every major Medicare expansion has \npassed through the Finance Committee in a bipartisan vote. We did not \nhave a markup this year. We did not even have a chance to offer \namendments. Yet we spent 2, 3, 4 weeks on the floor trying to mark up \nsomething on the floor with no result, with no prescription drug \nbenefit being offered. The House was able to pass it. We were not.\n  The same thing is true for the Medicare give-back bill. The House was \nable to do that, in conjunction with the prescription drugs. Some are \nsaying let's put together a give-back bill and run that through.\n  We are going to give providers, hospitals, and doctors more money, \nbut we are not going to give prescription drugs to seniors who really \nneed them, who do not have them, or who are maybe low-income? I am not \nsure that is very fair.\n  The Senate is flat not working.\n  In the Finance Committee last week, we are going to have a small \nbusiness bill. Two or three Senators put together a bill, $16 billion. \nThere are some tax increases. There was no consensus whatsoever in \ndoing it, except maybe to help somebody politically, but it was not a \nquestion of, is this really going to stimulate small business?\n  Most people realize it is a stalking horse for a person to offer a \nminimum wage increase which really would hurt small business.\n  I look at the number of judges, and we have confirmed 78 judges. Some \nsay that is great. In President Bush's first 2 years, 78 judges have \nbeen confirmed, which is 61 percent of the judges that he has \nnominated. Maybe that sounds pretty good, but in looking at President \nClinton, he got 129 judges in his first 2 years. He got 90 percent of \nhis judges; President Bush has 61 percent. President Bush 1 got 71 \njudges. That was 93 percent of the judges he nominated. President \nReagan got 89 judges, which was 98 percent of the judges he nominated \nin his first 2 years, but President Bush only has 61 percent.\n  When it comes to circuit court judges, the President only has 14 of \n32. He has 43 percent of his circuit court judges confirmed. For \nwhatever reason, it seems as if the majority, the Democrats on the \nJudiciary Committee, do not want circuit court judges to be appointed \nby President Bush, so they are holding up several outstanding, well-\nqualified nominees, for ages.\n  Miguel Estrada is finally going to get a hearing on Thursday. He was \nnominated a year ago May. He has argued 15 cases before the Supreme \nCourt. He has outstanding qualifications, graduated the top of his \nclass from Columbia and Harvard, was an assistant U.S. attorney, and an \nassistant solicitor. He finally gets to have a hearing.\n  Then there is John Roberts who was nominated a year ago May. He has \nargued 35 cases before the Supreme Court, and he is yet to get a \nhearing, probably will not get a hearing this year. What is fair about \nthat?\n  When people are patting themselves on the back because we have \nconfirmed 78 judges and they are saying that is a lot, well, not when \nBill Clinton got 90 percent and President Bush gets 61 percent; not \nwhen the current President Bush gets 43 percent of his circuit court \njudges and President Clinton got 86 percent. President Bush 1 and \nPresident Reagan both got 95 percent of their circuit court judges.\n  All of a sudden, when it comes to circuit court judges, we are just \ngoing to go slow on those; they are going to have to wait a year and a \nhalf to get a hearing, if they get a hearing. I do not think that is \nfair.\n  If we add together the fact that we have not done a budget, we have \nnot done appropriations bills, we have not been confirming the number \nof judges that we traditionally have for the previous three Presidents, \nwhen we have not done a prescription drug bill, when we have not marked \nup an energy bill through the committee so it is stuck in conference, \nthis Congress, this Senate, has not been working.\n  For people to say it is the President's fault or it is the House's \nfault, I disagree. The House has been pretty productive in their \nlegislative efforts. They passed a prescription drug bill. They passed \na budget. They have passed more appropriations bills than we have, and \nthey would have passed more had we passed a budget. If this Senate \nwould have passed a budget--which, incidentally, 60 votes are not \nneeded to pass a budget. Fifty-one votes are needed to pass a budget. \nIf this Senate would have passed a budget, these appropriations bills \ncould have gone forward.\n  To cast aspersions blaming the House or the President for not getting \nthe work done, the blame belongs right here. The Senate has not done \nits work. We have not passed a budget. We have not passed \nappropriations bills. Next Monday is the end of the fiscal year. Shame \non us. This is the first year I have been in the Senate that we have \nnot gotten our work even close to being done. It is not as though the \nbills are stuck in conference and we have not resolved the differences. \nWe have not gotten the bills out of the Senate, and that is really not \nvery acceptable.\n  The Senate needs to work. We need to do our work. We have not done \nour work, certainly this past year.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Could we have the \nability to enter into an agreement at this stage?\n  Mr. GREGG.

The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I thank the leader for his courtesy in \norchestrating this so I can speak briefly. I hope to offer an \namendment, and I\n\n[[Page S9097]]\n\nwant to outline what the amendment is. I understand that the \nparliamentary situation, or the order of events, is that Senator Gramm \nhas the first amendment and, until that is worked out, this amendment \nwill not necessarily be in order.\n  This amendment will address a very significant issue. It is a sense-\nof-the-Senate amendment dealing with the question of how we are dealing \nwith the national policy on the smallpox vaccination.\n  As many people in America are probably aware, smallpox is probably \none of the most virulent potential biological weapons that can be used \nanywhere in the world. It had, however, been significantly contracted \nin its availability. There were only two sites that actually possessed \nthe actual smallpox germ; one was in Russia and the other was in the \nUnited States. Both of those were considered to be very secure. There \nis, however, concern that other individuals in the world may be trying \nto develop a smallpox strain, and if they are able to do that, the \npotential for devastating biological attack would be overwhelming.\n  I think it is important that people understand, as a preface to this \nissue, that, if a smallpox epidemic--or even a single incident of \nsmallpox--breaks out anywhere in the world, it is reasonable to assume \ntoday that it is breaking out because there is somebody who has \npossession over the smallpox strain and is willing to use it in an \naggressive, violent way and is willing to use it in a terrorist act. In \nother words, there is no way today you could have a natural breakout of \nsmallpox anywhere in the world.\n  If, for instance, a single case of smallpox were found somewhere on \nthe North American continent, one could immediately presume that \nterrorists had possession of the smallpox disease and were willing to \nspread it. That has a huge potential for loss of life.\n  Smallpox is a disease that spreads extremely quickly and is hard to \ncontrol. How do we address this? Essentially, because we thought we had \nbeaten smallpox as a disease, we didn't have in place a large stockpile \nof vaccination as a nation, or even across the world. There is very \nlittle stockpile of vaccine. We did have some stockpile and it was \nquite old--approximately 15 to 30 years old. It was a small amount. But \nafter determination, it is now thought that even that small amount can \nbe subdivided and we can produce maybe as much as 70 million doses.\n  We are in the process of developing, on the production side of the \nagenda in the U.S., with the pharmaceutical companies--and not only \nhere but overseas--the capacity to bring online large amounts of dosage \nof smallpox vaccine. We expect that we will have enough dosage of \nsmallpox vaccine within a relatively short time that, if we desire to \ndo so, we could vaccinate every individual in our Nation.\n  Why don't we immediately do that and make that our national policy? \nThe reason the decision has not been made to go forward to vaccinate \nthe entire country is that there is a downside to the smallpox vaccine \nas it is presently developed; that is, approximately 1 percent of the \npeople vaccinated, we know, will be significantly harmed and possibly \neven die. If you vaccinate 260 million people, you are looking at a \nsignificant death toll--in the hundreds, at a minimum--as a result of \nthat vaccination regime. We know who those people usually are. They are \nusually people suffering from certain types of allergies, and we know \nthey are people who are aged, infirm, or who have other weaknesses in \ntheir immune systems.\n\n  What has been the policy decision so far? The first policy decision, \non which I greatly congratulate this Congress and the administration, \nwas to put in place the regime so we could produce an adequate amount \nof vaccine. The second policy put forward as the concept of how we will \naddress the smallpox breakout is that we will do a concentric circular \nevent. In other words, we will surround the incident of smallpox with a \nvaccination of everybody in the area in an expanding circle. It is a \npebble in a pool approach. If somebody threw a pebble in the small \npond, it spreads outward. In the event of a smallpox outbreak, we are \ngoing to vaccinate everybody around the people infected, hopefully, \ncontaining the output. That is the plan as it is presently proposed. In \naddition, the plan is to vaccinate all first responders in the country.\n  What is the problem with that plan? It is very unlikely that our \npublic health capability would allow us to vaccinate enough people fast \nenough to make the concentric circle approach be absolutely secure. We \nwould probably experience an expansive medical emergency that would \nlead to a fairly significant loss of life should a single case of \nsmallpox break out in the United States.\n  I am not saying it is not a reasonable approach, but it is an \napproach that probably has a significant likelihood that it will not be \ntotally successful. We will have a significant success rate, but the \nsuccess rate will be limited. Therefore, the loss of life will still be \nsignificant.\n  What is America to do? Basically, I think we can place confidence in \nour public health community that the vaccines are being developed and \nbrought online. In addition, I believe we should, as a national policy, \nbe willing to say to any American, once we have the smallpox vaccine in \nplace, that in order to vaccinate the population generally--and it will \nbe in place certainly by next June, and maybe earlier--we should be \nable to say to any citizen who feels strongly that they want to be \nvaccinated that you may be vaccinated.\n  In addition to the concentric circle approach, which I endorse, we \nshould be able to say, if you are an American citizen, you have the \nright to go to your medical practitioner and ask them for a smallpox \nvaccination. If the physician determines you are not in an adverse \ncategory and that it is appropriate for you, thus, limiting the loss of \nlife as a result of the 1 percent problem, then you ought to be able to \nget that vaccination.\n  That is what this sense of the Senate says. It says that, once we \nhave obtained the necessary dosage level, which has been federalized, \nin order to vaccinate our population generally, then any American \ncitizen will have the right to go to their physician and obtain that \nvaccine and be vaccinated.\n  It makes great sense to do this because, as a practical matter, it \nwill first bring a calmness to the circumstance, which is important. \nSecondly, should there be an outbreak, it will obviously mean that a \nlarge percentage of America has been vaccinated already. Many people, I \nsuspect, will take advantage of that option if it is out there.\n  Thirdly, I think it is good public health policy. I also think it \nshould be done at no charge. I believe we, as a government, have an \nobligation to protect our citizens as a primary responsibility and, \ntherefore, the Federal Government should pick up the cost of the \nvaccine as it is distributed.\n  So that is what this sense of the Senate says. It doesn't say that \nthe concentric circle approach isn't good. It says, in addition to \nthat, we should give all Americans, once we have obtained the vaccine \ncapability that we know we are going to obtain, we should give them, in \nconsultation with their physician, the opportunity to be vaccinated. I \nbelieve that is good health policy.\n  Certainly, as we proceed down the road and debate this homeland \nsecurity bill, I intend to take the opportunity to offer this sense-of-\nthe-Senate amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from Ohio \nis recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, approximately 3 hours ago, the Senate \npassed the Lieberman-McCain amendment to create an independent national \ncommission to investigate the events leading to and following the \nSeptember 11 terrorist attacks. I voted in favor of that amendment. I \ncome to the floor this afternoon to briefly explain why and explain \nwhat I hope that commission will do and what I hope it won't spend a \nlot of time doing.\n  I believe that commission should focus on what the joint Senate-House \nIntelligence Committee's investigation focused on in looking at the \nSeptember 11 tragedy.\n  As a member of that committee, I have argued that we should be \nlooking at not just what led up to September 11, not just finding out \nwhat the failures were, but also, and much more importantly, looking \ntoward the future\n\n[[Page S9098]]\n\nand trying to determine what we can do to change, what we can do to \nimprove our intelligence operation, our intelligence network.\n  I believe that should be the same focus of the national commission. \nThe national commission will inherit the work our joint committee has \ndone. Shortly, we will be done with our work. The national commission \nwill not only have our work, but it will have other information \navailable to it. It will have the information that has been dug up by \nsome very good reporters. It will have additional information, and so \nthe foundation clearly will be laid.\n  The commission will not have to spend a lot of time rehashing the \nerrors that were made. What I hope the commission will spend most of \nits time on, though, is the future. I would like to talk a little bit \nabout that future this afternoon and what I think we need to do.\n  Knowing what failures have occurred in the past certainly is vital, \nbut it is not enough. Knowing what we should do in the future is really \nwhat is important. The creation of this independent commission presents \nus with the opportunity to build on our current congressional \nintelligence investigation.\n  One of the reasons I did vote in favor of this commission is that I \nbelieve our Senate and House intelligence investigation stopped too \nearly. We had a deadline. I thought the deadline was a mistake. I still \nthink it is a mistake. Because we have that deadline, we have not been \nable to focus on the big picture issues of where we need to go in this \ncountry.\n  The language of the McCain-Lieberman amendment that was adopted this \nafternoon clearly provides the commission with the opportunity to get \ninto these big picture issues.\n  I quote from that amendment. The amendment specifies the commission \nmay\n\n       . . . identify, review, and evaluate the lessons learned \n     from the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, regarding \n     the structure, coordination, management policies, and \n     procedures of the Federal Government.\n\n  There is more to that. Those are words that I think are very \nimportant because those words, if this becomes law, will give this \ncommission a great opportunity to look at these big picture issues \nabout which I am talking.\n  What am I talking about? Let me give some examples. I believe the \ncommission should take a serious look at the role of the Director of \nCentral Intelligence. I believe it is time to give the DCI the \nnecessary authority and the ability to truly direct our overall \nintelligence operations. Quite simply, we need to empower the DCI to do \nthe job.\n  We all know the facts. Currently, the DCI, while he is in charge of \nour intelligence, only controls about 15 to 20 percent of the budget. \nThis is an issue that has to be examined, and it has to be looked at, \nno matter how people come down on this issue. I know it is a \ncontentious issue, and it may divide this Senate, it may divide the \ncommission, but we need to look at it.\n  We had the opportunity in our joint committee the other day to hear \nfrom Sandy Berger, Anthony Lake, and Brent Scowcroft on a panel. All \nthree of them said with various degrees of language that we need to \nmake a change in the DCI, we need to make the DCI more powerful, we \nneed to enable him to get the job done. That is an issue at which we \nshould look.\n\n  Second, I believe we must seriously examine the long-term resource \nissues that confront us, not just now but over the long haul--over the \nnext decade, maybe over the next two decades, or three decades. Are we \nproviding the resources we need for our intelligence community? And are \nwe providing them in the right way? Do they know they are going to have \nthe necessary resources, as much as anybody can ever know year to year \nwith Congress? But do they have some indication those resources are \ngoing to be there so they can get the job done? How much resources do \nthey, in fact, need to protect us?\n  Maybe a good way of looking at it is to say, if tomorrow we were \nstruck again and we are all in shock again, what would be our reaction? \nWhat would we do to the budget then? Maybe we need to ask ourselves \nthat question and go ahead and do it now.\n  The next question I hope the commission looks at is: Do we have the \nhuman resources available within the agencies themselves? Are we going \nto get the necessary people because ultimately it comes down to people. \nWe have good people. They are doing a good job. They are working 14, \n15, 16 hours a day, but there is only so much they can do. How many \nmore people do we need? My guess is we need a lot more people based on \nwhat I have seen. In the counterterrorism center, for example, in the \nCIA, FBI, we need a lot more people.\n  Do we have the right technology is another question the commission \nshould look at, and do we have enough of it to get the job done in the \nnew world in which we live? The technology the FBI has is not good. If \nany major business in this country had that technology, somebody would \nbe fired; a lot of people would be fired. It is shameful. It is wrong. \nIt is not fair to the employees, and it is not fair to the American \npeople. We are, frankly, responsible for that. We are responsible for \nthat failure. We have an obligation to change that. That is another \nissue at which this commission should look.\n  The commission should ask us and the American people: What is our \nlong-term commitment to intelligence?\n  Finally, I think the commission needs to examine the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act, the FISA statute, and determine what \nchanges are necessary to make sure we are getting intelligence from \nthis source to help prevent future attacks. We made improvements in \nFISA. The Patriot Act was an improvement. Quite frankly, Congress has \nbeen derelict in its duty over two decades to have good oversight over \nFISA. It has been a hidden court, as it was designed to be; a secret \ncourt, as it was designed to be. Yet we have not figured out some way \nthrough the Intelligence Committees to have good oversight to find out \nhow the law we wrote as representatives of the American people is truly \nbeing interpreted.\n  For the first time we have a court decision that has come out of the \nFISA court. It is not public, but we can at least look at it. It is the \nfirst one, to my knowledge, that has been published in 2 decades. I do \nnot happen to agree with the decision, but we can look at it. It is \nbeing appealed. We will have an opportunity to see what the court of \nappeals says about that, but at least that part of the debate is out \nthere.\n  We must continue to look for ways to fulfill our oversight \nresponsibility in the Congress. That is an issue that the commission \nshould look at as well.\n  These are a few of the issues I think the commission needs to look \nat. Let me say, however, it is not just the commission's \nresponsibility. I voted for this amendment, not because I felt it would \nbe solely the commission's responsibility to look at these issues; I \nbelieve the Senate Intelligence Committee has an obligation to look at \nthese big-picture issues in the months and years ahead. I believe the \nHouse has the same obligation. I simply believed that with an \nadditional commission issuing reports in 6 months, 12 months, 18 \nmonths, that would be an added voice, an added set of eyes, more \nexpertise, to look at some of these issues this country should be \ndebating.\n  Ultimately, we need a serious national debate about all of these \nissues and so many more, even those that are outside the realm of the \nintelligence community. In examining the intelligence component, if we \nhave learned anything from September 11, it is that our security, our \nsafety, and the safety of our loved ones, is intrinsically linked to \nthe quality of that intelligence. So we must do all we can to improve \nthe quality of that intelligence. The ability to share that information \nwith the appropriate agencies is involved with our national security. \nAs Members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, as Members \nof this Senate, we have an obligation to examine these issues. We must \ndebate them. The proposed commission can certainly play a productive \nrole in these debates and in these investigations. Therefore, I was \npleased this afternoon to support its creation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that following the cloture vote on \nthe Lieberman amendment tomorrow, if cloture is not invoked, the Senate \nremain on the homeland defense bill and\n\n[[Page S9099]]\n\nSenator Gramm of Texas be recognized to offer an amendment; that there \nbe two hours of debate equally divided between Senators Gramm and \nLieberman or their designees; that at the conclusion of that time the \namendment continue to be debatable and Senator Daschle or his designee \nbe recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the amendment we have been waiting for for \nsome time will be offered in the morning, or as soon as the vote is \ncompleted, as the unanimous consent request indicated.\n  It appears the two managers have some amendments they can clear on \nthis homeland security bill. That being the case, we will stay on the \nbill. When the amendments are cleared, we will go to a period for \nmorning business until Senators have said all they wish to say, and \nthen we will recess until tomorrow. We hope this is the beginning of \nthe end of this bill. I think we have made progress to get to this \npoint. As I have indicated, we have been trying to get this amendment \nnow for about the second week, so finally we are there. This is a big \namendment. We will determine how it is going to be disposed of sometime \ntomorrow.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to speak about several \nimportant issues facing the Senate at the moment: namely, the situation \nwith Iraq, and the state of our economy.\n  First, let me speak about Iraq. And let me begin by saying that I \ndon't think there is any question that Saddam Hussein is not following \nthe terms of surrender at the end of the gulf war. He has failed to \nlive up to any one of those terms or conditions.\n  I was at the Incirlik Base in Turkey and visited with the pilots who \nare flying over the northern area of Iraq enforcing the no-fly zone. \nThese pilots fly in harm's way. They are often shot at by the ground \nforces of the Iraqi Army. The fact is, Saddam Hussein has violated \nvirtually everything to which he previously agreed.\n  I don't think there is any question that this is a bad person, who \nposes a real threat. He wants access to nuclear weapons. He has access, \napparently, to chemical and biological weapons. And the President says \nwe ought to do something about this threat posed by Saddam Hussein. I \nagree that we should. The question is, How?\n  The President went to the United Nations. And I think that was the \nright thing to do. The Secretary of State is now asking the Security \nCouncil to join us and pass another enforcement resolution so we can, \nwith other countries, begin to enforce coercive inspections in Iraq to \nmake sure that, if they have weapons of mass destruction, they are \ndestroyed, and to make sure they are never able to acquire weapons of \nmass destruction, especially nuclear weapons.\n\n  But there are other avenues that we should also pursue. I have \nthought for 10 years, since the end of the gulf war, that this country \nshould press for the formation of an international criminal tribunal at \nthe United Nations to indict and try Saddam Hussein as a war criminal.\n  I don't know whether at the end of the day there is going to be a \nregime change in Iraq or not. I hope there is. I believe there ought to \nbe a regime change, but I am not sure whether that is going to happen. \nIf it doesn't happen, I still think we ought to push for the creation \nof an international war crimes tribunal, so that Saddam Hussein is \nindicted and convicted.\n  There is ample evidence--both in this country and also in the United \nNations--to indict and convict this man of war crimes.\n  I spoke on the floor some years ago about a young boy and his family \nwho lay dead on the ground in Iraq--victims of weapons of mass \ndestruction unleashed by Saddam Hussein that killed thousands of those \npeople. He is the only leader I know of in this world who has used \nweapons of mass destruction against his own citizens. So there is ample \nevidence for that and other reasons to indict, try, and convict Saddam \nHussein for crimes against humanity.\n  I have never understood the reluctance of this Government to push \nahead to do that. I have never understood that. Senator Specter from \nPennsylvania and I offered a resolution--I think it was about 5 years \nago in the Senate--calling on the State Department to go to the United \nNations and attempt to get a war crimes tribunal so we could indict, \ntry, and convict this man as a convicted war criminal. I think whenever \nwe talk about Saddam Hussein, we should be talking about a convicted \nwar criminal.\n  Had we done what we should have done 10 years ago and 5 years ago, \nthat is what we would now call him, because the evidence is so \nsubstantial about what he has done to his own people, to people in the \nregion, to his neighbors, the weapons he has used--there is just no \nquestion that this man, even in absentia, would be tried and found \nguilty as a war criminal.\n  I think even today our State Department should press that case, even \nas we are pressing for coercive inspections and contemplating taking \naction again against the country of Iraq.\n  I have asked my staff to talk to the staff of the Senator from \nPennsylvania about offering that resolution once again in the Senate. \nIt passed the Senate 4 or 5 years ago without a dissenting vote. Yet \nnothing has happened with respect to Saddam Hussein and Iraq and the \ncreation of a war crimes tribunal at the United Nations to indict and \nto try him.\n  Let me turn to the economy for a moment. Because while the Iraq issue \nis vitally important, we have other very big challenges that are \nlargely being ignored. The President and some in this Chamber don't \nwant to talk about this, but the fact is our economy is in some \nsignificant trouble. We have some people whose responsibility it is to \nbe involved in fiscal policy who say: What trouble? Things are going \njust fine. This is just a little bit of a correction. Things will be \nfine. Just wait and do nothing. Things will work their way out.\n  The fact is, we have come to an intersection in this country unlike \nany we have ever arrived at before. Just a year and a half ago, \nPresident Bush proposed a fiscal policy. He came to office, and said: \nWhat I see in this country is 10 years of surpluses, and big ones at \nthat. That money belongs to the taxpayer. Let us give it back. Let us \nhave a $1.7 billion tax cut.\n  I did not vote for that because I said I thought we ought to be a \nlittle more conservative. I don't think we can see 3 months ahead, let \nalone 10 years ahead. I think the conservative thing to do would be to \nattempt to be a little more moderate in how we deal with fiscal policy \nand not lock in a $1.7 billion reduction in revenue.\n  I lost that argument. The majority in this Chamber and the other \nChamber voted for a $1.7 billion tax cut over 10 years. The President \ncelebrated and his supporters celebrated. Everyone talked about how \nwonderful that was. Mr. Greenspan, down at the Federal Reserve Board, \nthought that was fine, too.\n  It wasn't very much past that--some months past that--when we \ndiscovered the country was in a recession. If we had been in a \nrecession at the time we were talking about these expected 10 years of \nsurpluses, would we have made a different decision? Maybe.\n  Not much more than a couple of months beyond that we had the \nterrorist attacks against our country on September 11. Had we known we \nwere going to face a recession and the terrorist attacks on our country \non September 11 that caused such a devastating loss of life, would we \nhave said let us put in place a $1.7 billion tax cut? I think we might \nhave made different decisions.\n\n[[Page S9100]]\n\n  Then, on top of that, we had the technology bubble burst and the \nstock market began to act like a yo-yo with more down than up.\n  On top of all that, we had the corporate scandals in which we saw \nsome of the largest corporations in this country--Enron, to name one. I \nchaired the hearings in the Commerce Committee investigating Enron. We \nsaw the executives of that company and others run these companies into \nthe ground. They cheated and lied to the investors and to the \nemployees. The board of directors finally had their own investigation \ninto their own company. Do you know what they said? They said: What we \nfound inside our company was ``appalling.'' They said: We found this \ncorporation was reporting $1 billion in earnings that it didn't earn.\n  To give a small example of what was going on, the chief financial \nofficer of that corporation invested $25,000 of his own money into a \ncorporation, a partnership--a corporation in which he had a proprietary \ninterest--and he took out $4.5 million 60 days later.\n  Let me say that again.\n  He invested $25,000 of his own money and then took out $4.5 million \n60 days later.\n  I come from a town of 300 people. We call that stealing in my \nhometown.\n  In corporation after corporation, we see all of these corporations \nand the books being recalculated and company executives being led away \nin handcuffs.\n  There are a lot of great companies in this country, and a lot of \ngreat CEOs. Make no mistake about that. Some people say it is just a \nfew bad apples. That is true. How big is the orchard with bad apples?\n  It is just too many corporations, too many accounting firms, and too \nmany law firms that are the enablers that allowed all of this to happen \nand too many executives with larceny in their hearts who don't \nunderstand this wasn't their money. This was the investors' money.\n  What you have is an intersection of a recession, a terrorist attack, \ncorporate scandal, the tech bubble bursting, and the stock market \ncollapsing.\n  Yet, the Administration is telling us that they don't even want to \ntalk about the economy, as if the circumstances had not changed at all.\n  When people sit around a supper table and talk about their lives, \nmost families talk about some key things. Do we have good jobs? Do our \njobs pay well? Do we have job security? Do our kids go to good schools? \nDo grandpa and grandma have access to good health care? Do we live in a \nsafe neighborhood? Those are all the questions that affect the lives of \nAmerica's families.\n  Do we have job security? Let me give you an example. A fellow wrote \nto me. He said: My life savings as an employee of the Enron \nCorporation--he worked for a pipeline corporation that was a \nsubsidiary--were in Enron stock. It was worth $330,000. I saved for \nyears to put together $330,000 in my 401(k) account in Enron stock. It \nis all that I have. That $330,000 is now worth $1,700.\n  Is that a problem? You bet your life it is a problem for that family, \nand so many other families across this country who have seen their life \nsavings dissipate.\n  Now, people say: Well, that is just anecdotal information about this \nfamily or that family. But it is not that. The average 401(k) account \nin this country has lost one-third of its value. These are the life \nsavings of people, the retirement savings of people. It has lost one-\nthird of its value.\n  Do you think that is going to have an impact on our economy? Of \ncourse it is. Our economy is all about people's expectations about the \nfuture.\n  I used to teach economics. I overcame that, nonetheless, and have \nbeen able to go on and do some other things productively. The field of \neconomics is not much more than psychology pumped up by helium. It is \njust people estimating what might or might not happen.\n  Our economy is very simple. If our future is a bright, rosy future, \nif people are confident about the future, then they do things that \nmanifest that confidence. They buy a house, buy a car, take a trip; \nthey do the things that represent people who are confident in their \nfuture. And that expands the economy.\n  When people lack confidence in the future, they do the exact \nopposite. They decide not to take the trip. They don't buy the car. \nThey don't buy the house. They defer purchases they might have \notherwise made. As a result, economy contracts.\n  So we are in a situation where we have an economy that is in some \ntrouble. It is not growing. People are not confident about the future. \nThey see corporate scandals. They are worried about investing in a \ncorporation. They are worried about the method by which we ask people \nto invest in a share of stock in a company they never visited with \nexecutives they don't know, with accounting firms they are supposed to \ntrust but now do not.\n  And still we have the Administration and some in the Senate saying: \nWell, what is the problem? We don't need to revisit any of these \ncircumstances. We don't need to talk about fiscal policy. We don't need \nto talk about the economy.\n  They are wrong. We need to talk about jobs. What is happening in \njobs? We need to talk about the economy, economic growth, and \nopportunity. We need to talk about this country's fiscal \nresponsibility, its budget mess.\n  There isn't anyone in this Chamber who can get up and talk about how \nthis budget adds up, because it does not. We have a fiscal policy that \nis sorely out of balance, and everybody knows it. Everyone wants to \npretend that is not the case. And it starts with the President.\n  Now, what is the record?\n  Job losses. We are not expanding. We are losing jobs at this point. \nPrivate-sector jobs are down, down sharply.\n  Weak economic growth. In fact, some indicators suggest we may have \nalmost no growth at the present time.\n  We have an anemic economy, there is no question about that.\n  Declining business investment.\n  A falling stock market. Just take a check over the last week or two; \nin fact, go back 6 years to find when the NASDAQ was as low as it was \nyesterday.\n  Shrinking retirement accounts. I have just described that. An average \nfamily having a 401(k) is losing a third of its value.\n  Eroding consumer confidence.\n  Rising health care costs. One of the issues we ought to talk about on \nthe floor of the Senate is this: rising health care costs. It also \nexplodes the Federal deficit, causes havoc with every State budget, \nespecially causes chaos with the budgets of families.\n  We are trying to say to the American people and the pharmaceutical \nindustry: The prices you are charging for prescription drugs are \noutrageous. You charge the American people the highest prices in the \nworld for prescription drugs, and it is unfair.\n  Yet, when you take on that industry in this Chamber, asking, ``how do \nyou justify this; how do you justify to a woman who has breast cancer \nthat the drug Tamoxifin is going to cost her 10 times as much in the \nUnited States as you charge for the identical drug in Canada; how do \nyou justify that,'' there is no answer. It is a deafening silence.\n  But yet you can't get effective legislation through the Congress \nbecause we have too many here who support the pharmaceutical industry. \nThe big, powerful, and strong make a great deal of money, and they like \nthe status quo.\n  We are going to focus on an economic forum of sorts in the coming \ncouple of weeks, to see if we can get together people who want to talk \nabout the economy who have contrasting views about the economy, and to \nsee if we can begin a debate about what ought to be done.\n  We have too many people out of work. We have too many people who have \nlost too much money in the market. We have an erosion of confidence. We \nhave a budget deficit that is escalating.\n  We could not get appropriations bills through the floor of the Senate \nby the October first date. Why? We could not get a budget? Why? Because \nnone of it adds up. And everyone in this Chamber knows it does not add \nup.\n  How do you add up a circumstance where you have less revenue coming \nin, and you decide you have to do $45 billion more for defense in 1 \nyear, probably something close to $30 billion more for homeland \nsecurity in 1 year? Add that additional spending on top of a fiscal \npolicy in which you have either slow growth or a recession, and less\n\n[[Page S9101]]\n\nmoney coming in, and therefore higher deficits, and then what is left \nfor the things that represent domestic discretionary spending, \nincluding health care and education?\n  What is left to try to do something that says to kids: Your education \nmatters because our future is in our schoolrooms? We believe that every \nyoung child ought to walk through the door of a schoolroom where their \nparents are able to say: We have sent our child to the best schoolroom \nin the world.\n  How do you do that when there is no money left for education or \nhealth care because we have a fiscal policy that does not add up \nbecause 18 months ago we said we were going to have surpluses for 10 \nstraight years, and 18 months later--following a war, a recession, \nstock market collapse, corporate scandals, and more--we now have turned \nsurpluses into big deficits.\n  I think it is time--long past the time--for this Congress to have an \nhonest, real, aggressive, significant debate about this country's \neconomy: what is wrong; how do we fix it; what has worked; what works; \nwhat is right; what does not work, and how do we repair it.\n  I began by talking about Iraq. The situation in Iraq is very \nimportant. But our economy is also vitally important. We have been the \neconomic engine for this world. When the economy in Asia was soft, we \nstill were the economic engine that provided strength. When the \neconomies of Europe were soft, the American economy was still the \neconomic engine. Take a look what is happening to the American economy \ntoday, and it is not working well.\n  This Congress has a responsibility to begin a thoughtful, sober, \nserious discussion about what works and what does not with our economy, \nand how we construct a new fiscal policy to fix that which is wrong. \nThe President has a responsibility to join us as well. At the present \ntime he talks only about foreign policy. Foreign policy is important, \nbut it is not exclusive. This President has a responsibility to join \nus. It is his fiscal policy. He won 18 months ago. It is his fiscal \npolicy that now helps create large deficits rather than large \nsurpluses. He must join us in trying to determine what we can do to \npull ourselves out of this morass.\n  This country can do better, but it needs good public policy coming \nfrom this Congress.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/24/senate-section/article/S9101-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9101-S9106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HOMELAND SECURITY ACT OF 2002--Continued\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I come to the floor at the end of the day \nto remind our colleagues that there will be two votes tomorrow morning. \nThey will both be cloture votes. Those votes are ones we have cast \nbefore. This will be the third cloture vote on the drought and \nfirefighting amendment that has been pending for weeks. It will be the \nsecond vote on homeland security.\n  I am troubled by the rhetoric I hear off the floor with regard to \nDemocratic efforts to slow this legislation down. I find it quite \nironic that while there are some who suggest it is Democrats holding up \nthis legislation and criticize us for doing so, it is the Democrats \nvoting virtually with unanimity in support of cloture to end debate on \nboth bills.\n  This is the fourth week we will be on this legislation.\n  I don't know what agendas are being played out. Some may think maybe \nthe longer we wait to vote on these things, the more advantageous it is \nfor one side or the other. There is a lot of work left to be done. I \nknow the American people expect us to complete our work on homeland \ndefense, and our farmers and ranchers and firefighters certainly expect \nus to have acted by now on the assistance they need so desperately.\n  How cynical can it be for some to suggest, in the name of whatever, \nthat we can hold up drought assistance, hold up firefighting \nassistance, hold up the extraordinary help this represents, in the name \nof whatever issue? I have said this before on the Senate floor, and I \nwill say it again now. Just getting cloture on the Byrd amendment, \nwhich includes $5 billion or more in drought assistance, and almost a \nbillion dollars in firefighter assistance--to get cloture on that \namendment in no way precludes other amendments. It certainly doesn't \npreclude any Senator from offering the forest health amendment or \nanything else on the bill itself. It doesn't preclude that.\n  So there is absolutely no reason Senators should oppose cloture on \nthe drought and firefighters amendment--unless they are not serious \nabout providing help in the first place. You have to wonder, after the \nthird cloture vote, if people are truly serious about providing help; \nif they are serious when they say they want to provide some response to \nfirefighters and drought victims in the agricultural areas of our \ncountry.\n  You would have to believe if they were serious they would vote for \ncloture, they would send this amendment and this bill into conference, \nand we would get this job done. You would think that.\n  All of the machinations and explanations and all of the excuses ring \nvery hollow to ranchers and farmers and firefighters when they note \nthat we are now in the third week of this filibuster from the other \nside, depriving these very people the sustenance they need to survive.\n  Mr. President, there can be no explanation. So I hope the vote \ntomorrow will have a different result. I hope all these political \nstrategies, as they play themselves out, have played their course. I \nhope we can say, on a bipartisan basis, that the time has come for us \nto send a clear message to ranchers and farmers and firefighters that \nwe are going to get them that help. I hope we can do that.\n  Tomorrow is our chance because I will tell you if we don't get \ncloture tomorrow, we send just the opposite message--that in politics \nwe can say anything we want and not be held accountable. We can say we \nare for you, but we can always think of a reason we are not at the end \nof the day.\n  There is a great deal of cynicism in ranch and farm country and the \nforests as we fight these fires right now. People are shaking their \nheads wondering what in Heaven's name could be holding up this help. I \ncannot explain it, and I don't think anybody else can satisfactorily. \nThey can come to the floor and say they are not filibustering. They can \ncome to the floor and say there are other issues that are more \nimportant. They can come to the floor and try to explain in a hundred \ndifferent ways, but there is no explanation. There is no excuse. There \nis no way to look in the eyes of those farmers and ranchers or \nfirefighters and say: Just wait another week, wait another month. You \nhave waited long enough, but we are going to make you wait a little \nlonger.\n  You cannot do that.\n  So tomorrow is a big test. Are we serious about drought assistance? \nAre we serious about firefighter assistance? Are we serious about \ngetting this job done and sending the right message? We will know the \nanswer by late morning.\n\n  The same could be said about homeland security. As I noted, we have \nalready had one cloture vote. I am told the amendment offered by our \nRepublican friends is germane. So there really is no reason to vote for \ncloture and bring this bill to a close. We have so much more work to be \ndone. A day doesn't go by when three or four colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle come to me and say: When are we getting out? When are we \ngoing to be able to go home?\n  The answer to that rests, in part, on tomorrow. If we can support \ncloture and get this legislation passed, if we can move this agenda \nforward, with all the other things that have to be done, there is no \nreason we cannot meet our adjournment day.\n  Mr. President, I just come to the floor to urge my colleagues not to \nfall into the trap--the rhetoric trap--of attempting to explain why you \nare for homeland security, why you are for drought assistance, why you \nare for firefighting assistance, why you are for completing our work on \ntime--and then turning around and voting against cloture, voting \nagainst bringing this\n\n[[Page S9102]]\n\ndebate to a close, after a month of legislative activity on the Senate \nfloor.\n  I will be watching. I know the American people will be watching. \nTomorrow is a very big day. Tomorrow is a day when we will see who is \nsincere and who is not; who is prepared to bring help to those needy \nfarmers and ranchers and firefighters, and who is not; who is prepared \nto answer the President who said just yesterday that the Senate needs \nto get its act together to pass homeland security. Tomorrow is our \nchance.\n  So let's see whether we seize the moment and take that chance and do \nwhat we need to do to get the job done. I am sure on both sides of the \naisle colleagues recognize the importance of doing just that. So we \nwill have a chance to prove it tomorrow morning on the cloture vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, to respond to the majority leader, I \ntotally disagree with many of the statements that were made. There is \nno one on this side of the aisle filibustering the Interior or homeland \nsecurity bills. No one. None. I know. We are willing to vote. I am \nembarrassed that we have spent 3 weeks on the Interior bill. Cloture is \nnot filed on the Interior bill; cloture is filed on one amendment. Even \nif cloture was invoked, the amendments can still be offered. Senators \nhave a right to offer amendments. I just mention that.\n  If the majority leader wants to move forward on the bill, table the \namendment. That is the way to do it. I know the majority leader knows \nthat. I will table the amendment if that will help him. If I was \nmanaging the bill, I would try to move the bill. I used to be chairman \nof that subcommittee. It is embarrassing to me that the Senate has been \non this and homeland security for now the fourth week. That is not the \nway to manage appropriations bills. I am embarrassed we haven't passed \nbut three appropriations bills. I just mention that to my colleague.\n  Having a cloture vote on the Interior bill is a total waste of time. \nEven if it is invoked, you can waste 3 days, and then the sponsors of \nthe amendment can still offer the amendment to the bill. That is \ncorrect. Cloture on homeland security is a waste of time. I tell the \nmajority leader that because it would deny the Senator from Texas and \nthe Senator from Georgia the chance to offer the President's \nsubstitute. I know the leader knows we have enough votes to make sure \nthey know they are going to get enough votes on the substitute.\n  There is a tendency around here to file cloture thinking that will \nalways expedite matters, but certainly it is not the case with the \nappropriations bills. It will not work, I am informing the majority \nleader.\n  I am also saying, with regard to filing a cloture motion on homeland \nsecurity, we are not going to let that deny the President the \nopportunity to offer his proposal. We can have all the cloture votes \nyou want, but it does not move us any quicker to passing drought relief \nor additional money for firemen. It will not happen.\n  If you want to dispose of that amendment, we can table it and find \nout where the votes are. The Senator from Idaho is entitled to have a \nvote on his amendment. There is money in it for fire. He is saying we \nshould reform our processes in managing the forests. He has a right to \ndo that.\n  I know Senator Reid and I have managed bills in the past. Senators \nhave offered amendments, and the ones we did not like, we would usually \ntable, and if we were not successful, we would usually drop it in \nconference, but we would manage the bill. This bill is not being \nmanaged. Neither bill is being managed. So we are now on our fourth \nweek on two bills when both should have been done in a relatively short \nperiod of time.\n  I mention that to the majority leader. File all the cloture motions \nyou want, but if you want to move forward on the bill, I think we \nshould just vote on these amendments and we can be done.\n  I mention that as friendly advice. I would like to see the Senate \nwork and see the Senate work much better, but I did want to clarify--I \nhave said this about four times--no one on the Republican side of the \naisle is filibustering either of these two bills.\n  I think it is in our best interest for the Senate and for the \nCongress to pass both bills. I am willing to work with the majority \nleader to do that. I offer a suggestion: If people do not like the \nCraig amendment, move to table it or come up with an alternative where \nwe vote side by side on different alternatives.\n  I had understood there was going to be a motion to table the Craig \namendment, and then there was going to be a Bingaman amendment which is \ncomparable. Ways can be worked out. Senator Craig is entitled to a vote \non his amendment, and Senator Bingaman may be entitled to a vote on his \namendment. We can dispose of that, finish the Interior bill, get it to \nconference, and hopefully work it out with the House.\n  I also hope we can do that with the remainder of the other \nappropriations bills. It is embarrassing for me not to have passed more \nappropriations bills through the Senate, through the House, and to the \nPresident. He is entitled to have an opportunity to sign or veto \nappropriations bills, and we are not giving that to him.\n  I make those comments and friendly suggestions to my friend. I do \nwant to reemphasize that no one on the Republican side is filibustering \neither of these bills. I wanted to make sure that is clear. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as always, I appreciate the friendly \nadvice from my friend and colleague, the Senator from Oklahoma. He is a \nstudent of the legislative process. He has every right to be \nembarrassed. If he wants to come to the floor to express how \nembarrassed he is, I certainly would not want to keep him from doing \nthat, and I appreciate his candor.\n  As to the appropriations bills, the House has sent us five. This is \nthe fourth one that we have taken up. There are eight bills that are \nmired, that are languishing in the House of Representatives because the \nHouse Republican leadership cannot appear to find whatever wherewithal \nmay be required to move the legislation forward. They have not sent \nthem to the Senate so, obviously, we cannot bring them up. We are \nwaiting patiently for additional legislative action on the part of the \nHouse. I am hopeful they will send it soon because they are the ones \nwho should be embarrassed.\n  I must say the Senator from Oklahoma is certainly within his rights \nto express himself and in characterizing these votes against cloture in \nany way he sees fit. That is the right of every Senator. I do not blame \nhim for not wanting to be accused of filibustering this legislation, \nbut I think anyone, just an objective observer would be hard pressed to \nsay: We are not filibustering, but we are going to vote against \ncloture.\n  What is cloture? Cloture is the means by which you bring an end to \nthe debate on a particular bill or an amendment. That is what cloture \nis. I can read the rule. I can clearly, I am sure, share with my \ncolleagues exactly what the rule says with regard to how one ends a \nfilibuster, how one ends extended debate. How do you do that? You file \ncloture.\n  When our Republican colleagues were in the majority, they used to \nfill the tree. They used to load up the amendment tree and then file \ncloture so that not only would they end debate, they would keep it from \nbeginning. We would not even start the debate when our colleagues would \ncome to the floor and not end it but prevent it.\n  I have said I will not do that. We will have debates, but there comes \na time, and I would say any objective observer would say at the end of \n4 weeks, that is a pretty good time. I mean, just to pick a number--4 \nweeks of debate. We file cloture now for the third time on the Interior \nappropriations bill to end debate. That is what it will say tomorrow \nmorning.\n  We will support it. Our colleagues are going to oppose it, and then \nthey are going to say: But we are not against ending debate; we are not \nfilibustering.\n  If you can convince anybody of that, you are a better speaker and a \nmore persuasive person than I am. Bless your heart if you can do that. \nI am telling you, this is a filibuster, purely, simply, and without \nquestion. You vote against cloture for the third time, you\n\n[[Page S9103]]\n\nvote to filibuster; you vote not to end debate; you vote to extend, and \nthe bottom line is--forget all the parliamentary procedural \ngobbledygook--you are telling ranchers, and farmers, and firefighters \nthey are going to wait a lot longer. That is what you are telling them.\n  Forget the filibuster. Just remember what it means to extend debate \nin this case. It means they wait longer. It means that regardless of \nwhatever excuses you can come up with, you continue to deny these \npeople the chance to get help. That is what it means, pure and simple. \nThey understand that in South Dakota. I think they even understand that \nin Oklahoma. But regardless of whether they understand it in \nWashington, we will have the chance once more to demonstrate who is for \ngetting that help and who is not. That is what that vote is tomorrow. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Republican leader.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from South \nDakota because he got his people some help. He was able to pass an \namendment that would allow them to clean up their forests and maybe \nprevent forest fires, but the rest of the people in the country did not \nget the so-called Daschle amendment. He was able to get it. I do not \nknow how. It went through. We did not have a vote on it. We did not \nhave a lot of discussion because a lot of us would have said it should \nhave been national. So Senator Craig offered an amendment that said we \nwant part of the reforms--not all the reforms--Senator Daschle was \nsuccessful in getting to help South Dakota.\n  We are saying, in forest management, because we have forest fires \nbreaking out all across the country, we should be able to clean up some \nof the diseased and dead trees so we do not have kindling for further \nfires. That is the essence of the Craig amendment.\n  We are entitled to a vote on that amendment. We did not get to vote \non Senator Daschle's amendment. We did not get a vote on that. We are \nnot even saying we should have that policy nationally, but we should \nhave part of it to reduce the cause and incidents of forest fires.\n  In the underlying bill, we have money for forest fires, and we have \nmoney for drought. Senator Craig says: Let's have improvement in forest \nmanagement simultaneously. He has a right to offer that amendment. \nCloture, as Senator Daschle is trying to invoke, would make it \nimpossible for Senator Craig to offer that amendment on the \nfirefighting money.\n  Interestingly enough, it would not prevent him from offering it to \nthe rest of the bill. Senator Daschle is not offering cloture on the \nbill. He is offering it on one amendment. I am tempted to say we agree \nto cloture; that would be fine with me. And then Senator Craig can \noffer the amendment to the bill. So cloture is getting us nowhere fast. \nWe do not need this.\n  I implore the majority leader: Let the Senate work. If you do not \nwant the Craig amendment to pass, move to table it, and we move on. You \nroll with the punches. You win some, you lose some.\n  Evidently, some people on the Democratic side of the aisle do not \nwant to vote on the Craig amendment. I hope people understand that is \nwhat it is about. I am protecting the right of the minority to offer an \namendment.\n  I tell the majority, we are going to offer this amendment. Whether it \nis an amendment to Senator Byrd's amendment or someplace else on the \nbill, we are going to offer the amendment. We are not going to be \ndenied the opportunity to offer an amendment. I have to protect my \nMembers' rights, and I will do so aggressively.\n  So I urge the majority leader to withdraw the cloture vote. If he \nwants to have cloture, he is not going to get it. We are going to \ninsist on the right to offer amendments.\n  The same thing would apply to homeland security. If cloture is \ninvoked, then we do not even get to have a vote on the President's \nhomeland security bill.\n  Senator Gramm and Senator Miller have a bipartisan bill, which the \nPresident has worked on. They have agreed upon it, they have adjusted \nit, they have worked on it, and they are entitled to offer their \namendment. If cloture is invoked on homeland security, they do not even \nget to offer that amendment. So cloture is a tool not just to shut off \nthe debate, it is a tool used to deny Members the right to offer their \namendments.\n  This is the fourth week we have been on these two bills, and we have \nmade very little progress. We have had very few votes because people do \nnot want to vote? This side is willing to vote. We have been willing to \nvote on the Craig amendment for weeks. Let's vote. The way to bring a \nvote to a head if you cannot get somebody on this side ready to vote \nand that side is not ready to vote, you move to table it. That is a \nnondebatable motion. You get a vote. Let's find out where the votes \nare.\n  If somebody does not want to vote, why are they in the Senate? We are \ndelaying one bill for weeks because some people do not want to vote on \none amendment. It is ridiculous. We used to manage these bills in ways \nthat if a Senator did not like the amendment and got beat on the floor, \nhe might drop it in conference, or try and change it. But to just say \nwe are going to keep filing cloture, as if that is trying to bring a \nfilibuster, there is no filibuster. If there is a filibuster, it is on \nthe Democrat side; it is not on the Republican side. We are ready to \nvote. I have heard the sponsors of this amendment say we are ready to \nvote, we are ready to vote. So to say this is going to risk drought \nassistance and fire assistance does not fly. We are ready to vote. \nLet's vote up or down on the amendment. Let's vote today. Let's vote \ntomorrow. Let's vote the next day. How many weeks do we need to be on \nit?\n  I am ready to win. I am ready to lose. We are exhausted on the \ndebate, but we keep having it. This is about the fifth debate I have \ngiven, not on the substance but on cloture, because the majority keeps \nfiling cloture. They are going to keep filing cloture. Why? It is to no \navail.\n  We are not going to get cloture and deny Senator Gramm and Senator \nMiller the opportunity to offer the President's substitute or the \nPresident's proposal for national homeland security. That is not going \nto work. Everybody knows that. It is not going to work.\n  Why in the world would we adopt cloture and deny Senator Craig the \namendment dealing with forest fire management? Senator Daschle was able \nto get in a management proposal that dealt with his forests. My \ncompliments to him. I like people taking care of their States. I like \npeople doing forest management in their States, working out agreements \nwith environmentalists. Evidently, that happened in Senator Daschle's \ncase so they can harvest some timber and get rid of some of the dead \ntimber. That is great. Why can we not do that for the rest of the \ncountry? Are we not entitled to offer that amendment?\n\n  I believe Senator Craig's amendment is scaled down in comparison to \nwhat Senator Daschle was able to do in South Dakota. My compliments to \nSenator Daschle for helping his State, but I think other people are \nentitled to offer amendments that would protect their States. Their \nStates are burning. Their States are not just asking us to give them \nmore money for fire assistance, but they want to change the policy so \nwe do not have so many fires next year and the next year.\n  They are entitled to offer that amendment, and if people disagree \nwith that amendment, they are entitled to vote against it or they are \nentitled to table it. But to file what I think are frivolous cloture \nmotions undermines the whole purpose of the Senate.\n  I am a student of the Senate. I love the Senate. Cloture should be \nused rarely, when there is a real extended debate. We have not had an \nextended debate. We are ready to vote. So it is a method where some \npeople are trying to use it to stop amendments that are not liked and \non which they do not want to vote.\n  Again, the Senator from Idaho, the Senators from the West, are \nentitled to say we want at least part of what the majority leader was \nable to do in his State. We are going to protect the rights of the \nminority to be able to offer amendments. We are going to protect the \nrights of Senator Gramm and Senator Miller to offer the President's \nproposal. Cloture on these two bills is not going to work. It would not \nwork anyway.\n  I am tempted to say let's give cloture and then offer the amendment \ntomorrow after we wait 30 hours; waste a\n\n[[Page S9104]]\n\ncouple of days and then offer the amendment again. We can do that. \nMaybe we should do that. It might prove our point that cloture is not \nthe way to go when filing amendments dealing with appropriations bills. \nIt really does not let the Senate work. The Senate should work, but \nfrankly the Senate is not working.\n  Fingers can be pointed at the House of Representatives, but the \nreason why the House has not done more bills is because there has not \nbeen a budget. The House has passed a budget and the Senate has not \npassed a budget.\n  When I say I am embarrassed for the Senate, I am embarrassed for the \nmajority because they have not passed a budget. They did not even bring \na budget resolution to the floor of the Senate. A budget does not take \n60 votes to pass. It takes 51 votes to pass in the Senate. For the \nfirst time since 1974, the majority did not bring a budget to the floor \nof the Senate. Because we do not have a budget, we do not have like \nfigures between the House and the Senate. We do not have figures in the \nSenate because we have not passed it.\n  So fingers can be pointed at the House and one can say the House has \nonly passed so many appropriations bills, but they have passed more \nthan the Senate has. There is nothing in the Constitution that says the \nSenate has to wait on the House to pass appropriations bills. That has \nbeen the tradition, but it is not mandatory. If the House is not doing \nits work, we should go ahead and pass our appropriations bills, period.\n  I mentioned this to Chairman Byrd, and I hope we will do that. The \nSenate should pass appropriations bills. If the House has not passed \nthem, let us pass them.\n  The end of the fiscal year is next Monday. I cannot remember any time \nin my 22 years in the Senate that the Senate has done so little in the \nappropriations process with 1 week to go in the fiscal year. Shame on \nthe Senate. People can point fingers at the President that he would not \ngive us an extra $9 billion--really, I think the difference is closer \nto $13 billion. Between the Senate Democrats and the President of the \nUnited States, I believe it is about $13 billion. Why don't we pass \neverything we agree on or take the House figure and then if Senators \nwant to pass another $9 billion, do that in a supplemental? We could do \nthat.\n\n  So we could pass the bulk of the $759 billion and then for the \nadditional $9 billion or $12 billion, that could be put in a \nsupplemental and the President could sign or veto it. At least then we \nwould have done our job and we would be able to have appropriations for \nthe bulk of the Federal Government.\n  Right now we are not doing anything. We are not functioning. The \nSenate is becoming dysfunctional. To only pass three appropriations \nbills at this late stage is very irresponsible, and I do not get any \ncomfort by having fingers pointed at the House or the White House. The \nSenate is the one that did not pass the budget, and the Senate has not \npassed its appropriations bills.\n  We are an equal branch to the White House. So why don't we do our \nwork? We are an equal division to the House of Representatives. If the \nHouse is not doing its work, let's do our work. It goes back to the \nbudget because if we have a budget, we have similar levels to work \nfrom, and then, since the House and the Senate are working from the \nsame levels, they have something to go to conference with and come up \nwith suitable compromises.\n  This should not be this difficult. I am flabbergasted this is our \nfourth week now on the Interior appropriations bill, a bill that has \ntotal spending of about $18 billion or $19 billion. The $18 billion is \na very small amount in the total scheme of Federal appropriations, \nwhich is more like $760 billion. It should not take us 4 weeks to do \nthat. If it is going to take us 4 weeks to do the Interior bill, we are \nnever going to finish the larger bills.\n  If the majority leader wants to have more cloture votes, that is \nfine, but I think the managers of the bill should come down to the \nfloor and say it is time for us to move on. Let's either vote up or \ndown on the amendments or let's move to table the amendments, finish \nthese appropriations bills, and get our work done as we have the \nconstitutional responsibility to get our work done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am not going to spend a lot of time \nresponding to my friend, the assistant Republican leader. But I say, no \nmatter what you call a filibuster, it is still a filibuster. We are 4 \nweeks on two bills. Check the history of this body. How often do we \nspend 4 weeks on a bill? We do not unless there is a filibuster, and \nthat is what we have here. The majority leader, Senator Daschle, is \ntrying to stop debate so we can go ahead and finish these bills.\n  The President has told everybody he wants homeland security, but he \nsure is acting strangely if he really wants this legislation passed. \nThere is simply nothing to show the President really wants this bill. \nIn fact, what this is showing is that on this issue, Iraq, and anything \nelse he can do to keep away from domestic policy, he is doing it. We \nhave a stumbling, staggering, faltering economy, and we should do \nsomething about it.\n  We have in the dark holes of the other body, these conference \ncommittees, legislation that has been held up for months and months. \nThere is terrorism insurance. Important? Of course it is. We have major \nconstruction projects--I will bet in Minneapolis and other places in \nMinnesota and in Las Vegas and other places--that are being held up \nbecause we don't have terrorism insurance. Why? They won't let us \ncomplete a bill. Election reform--we had another debacle in Florida--\nstill no election reform, held up in conference; bankruptcy reform, \nheld up in conference with the House; Patients' Bill of Rights, held up \nin conference with the House; generic drugs, held up in the House.\n  We haven't done our appropriations bills because they will not move \nthem in the House. This is a filibuster. They are doing everything they \ncan to keep away from the fact that the stock market is at its lowest \nin 6 years. The stock market drop is more than in the time of the Great \nDepression. There were 2 million unemployed persons in the last 2 \nyears--additional unemployed people. We had a huge surplus, in the \ntrillions of dollars, a year ago at this time. We are now broke.\n  So this is a filibuster. It is a filibuster. It is a filibuster.\n  Mr. President, are we on the homeland security bill at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                  Amendments Nos. 4515, 4568, And 4565\n\n  Mr. REID. At this time I ask unanimous consent it be in order to \nconsider the following amendments: No. 4515, No. 4568, and No. 4565.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent these amendments be \nconsidered and agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as chair of the Military Construction \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I have the opportunity and responsibility \nto take a close look at our military's construction needs throughout \nthe world.\n  During our August recess, I chose to take a closer look at an \ninitiative recently implemented by the Army in Europe called \n``Efficient Basing''. This initiative is a two part process that will \nstreamline the Army's infrastructure needs in Germany and in Italy.\n  The plan will direct much needed funds to consolidate U.S. bases \nthroughout Germany, and better position an airborne battalion south of \nthe Alps in Vicenza, Italy to more quickly respond to the possibility \nof crisis in the Transcaucasus, the Balkans, the Middle East and \nAfrica.\n  Although the costs for this initiative could total nearly $1 billion \nwhen complete, there is little doubt that it will both dramatically \nreduce the long term costs of basing our forces in Western Europe and \nprovide better strategic positioning for regional conflicts and the \nglobal war on terrorism.\n  This aptly named ``Efficient Basing'' initiative is being guided by \nthe U.S. Army's European Commander in Chief, Gen. Montgomery Meigs. \nGeneral Meigs invited me to Europe to take a closer look at the work in \nprogress and allow him the opportunity to justify the costs associated \nwith the program. As a result, I went to Camp Ederle, in Vicenza, \nItaly, and was able to see first hand the real efficiency of this \ntremendously large task and recognize the actual savings to be gained.\n  I would like to take a few minutes to recognize the degree of \ndedication and service to our country that is often overlooked.\n  Whether fighting a war, or carrying out the daily administrative \ntasks necessary to provide protection for America at home and abroad, \nour military commanders and the soldiers within their command display a \nlevel of dedication, efficiency, and selflessness that is awe \ninspiring.\n  We ask a lot of our soldiers, sailors, Marines and airmen. And, \nwithout question, they are up to the task, whatever it might be.\n  Let me give just a couple of examples: In his nearly 35 years of \nmilitary service, General Meigs and his wife, Mary-Ann have moved their \nfamily 24 times. That's not just soldier dedication, that's family \ndedication--all for the sake of our freedom. This sacrifice is \nrecognized throughout the world, not only by Americans, but by our \nallies and partners as well.\n  In the wake of September 11, a strangely surprising and caring act \ntook place on the part of our Italian allies. In less than 24 hours, \nthe Carabinieri--Italian police--in a show of force protection, came \nout in large numbers to surround our Vicenza base, Camp Ederle.\n  The base didn't solicit their presence. It was given voluntarily.\n  Acts like this do not just happen--they take time and the creation of \na rapport built on admiration and years of interaction with our \ncommanders and soldiers. The actions of the Carabinieri was, in part, a \nresponse to a lasting friendship--a friendship forged by men like MG \nRobert Wagner, the Southern European Task Force, SETAF, Commander.\n  General Wagner, a shining example for all to follow, is one hundred \npercent engaged with the leaders of the community--the mayor, the \ndirector of the Carabinieri, and businesses leaders throughout northern \nItaly.\n  The relationships and mutual admiration did not just happen by virtue \nof his position. It was developed over time, by him and by his \npredecessors, who hosted dinners and got to know these leaders and \ntheir needs, as well as expressing his concerns for our soldiers and \nthe community in which they live and work.\n  The relationship between General Wagner and the community is \npriceless, but the care and concern he expresses for his soldiers is \neven more evident.\n  I was pleasantly amazed by the spontaneously unsolicited comments by \npersons like the local base librarian, who takes pride in his \nfacilities and the services that he is able to provide to\n\n[[Page S9107]]\n\nsome 750 daily visitors. The same type of pride was exhibited by the \ndirector of the commissary, who manages a clean, well stocked facility \nand therefore plays a critical role in the morale and welfare of those \nwho defend us.\n  A long time concern of mine has been the high operational tempo, or \nmore simply put, the rate at which our service members are deployed \naway from their home base, whether for training, or deployed in \nreaction to a crisis.\n  In Vicenza, Italy, I met an impressive young man--a Californian--1SG \nNoel Fernando. First Sergeant Fernando, a native of Salinas, \nCalifornia, talked to me about his highly trained Airborne unit's \noperational tempo.\n  Sergeant Fernando, a hard worker who achieved his very high enlisted \nrank at an early age, assured me that more organized planning and early \nnotification to family members regarding deployment schedules has \nreduced the trauma experienced by younger soldiers and their loved \nones. They are now better able to anticipate deployments and plan \naccordingly.\n  Another distinguished member of our military forces is Gen. Joe \nRalston. General Ralston is the Commander in Chief, U.S. European \nCommand and the NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe.\n  As Commander in Chief of U.S. European Command, he is the senior U.S. \nmilitary officer and commander of a unified combatant command with an \narea of responsibility that includes 89 nations in Europe, Africa and \nthe Middle East. General Ralston will be retiring soon, and just like \nmany service members before, he and his family have sacrificed much of \ntheir lives for our freedom.\n  I was pleased to have been escorted by General Ralston to the sites \nof several upcoming military construction projects in the Mons, Belgium \narea.\n  The first is a barracks complex that will accommodate soldiers at the \n``one-plus-one'' housing standard. Another project will add a classroom \nto the SHAPE, Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, elementary \nschool.\n  While there, I had an opportunity to visit this site and visit with \nthe students and teachers. I am pleased to report that the \nadministrators of this and other military schools in Europe have been \nable to reduce the student to teacher ratio significantly, thus \noffering a quality education for our military dependents.\n  In summary, I would like to emphasize the important role that our \nofficers, enlisted members, and their families play in creating good \nwill around the world for the people of America.\n  As I have mentioned previously, all of these people dedicate their \nlives, and to a certain degree their personal freedom, to ensure our \nnation's remains free. These military service members and their \nfamilies deserve quality facilities wherever they might be stationed.\n  This is why, I feel honored to sit as chair of the Appropriations \nMilitary Construction Subcommittee, because it allows me to make a \ndifference in the living and working conditions for our troops who are \nwilling to make the ultimate sacrifice on our nation's behalf. I am \ndedicated to providing first class facilities for them both at home and \nabroad.\n  Lastly, it is with great pride that I commend those service members \nlike General Ralston, General Meigs, General Wagner and First Sergeant \nFernando, who have for decades sought to ensure a better quality of \nlife for our fighting force.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/24/senate-section/article/S9107-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9107-S9108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    U.S. INTERNATIONAL TRADE POLICY\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr President, this year marks an historic turning point \nfor U.S. international trade policy. For the first time in over eight \nyears the Congress renewed the President's authority to negotiate new \ntrade agreements. This authority, called Trade Promotion Authority, \nreestablishes the traditional partnership on trade between the Congress \nand the Executive branch. It allows us to work together to open new \nmarkets for American exports, set fair rules of conduct for U.S. \ninvestors overseas, and help raise the standard of living for millions \nof people around the world.\n  The negotiating objectives and procedures laid out in the Bipartisan \nTrade Promotion Authority Act represent a very careful substantive and \npolitical balance on some very complex and difficult issues such as \ninvestment, labor and the environment, and the relationship between \nCongress and the Executive branch during international trade \nnegotiations.\n  Because this balance is so delicate, I was somewhat dismayed to learn \nrecently that some groups and Members of Congress are trying to push \nfor interpretations of certain provisions of the TPA bill that do not \ncomport with the negotiating objectives laid out in the Bipartisan \nTrade Promotion Authority Act. For example, an article in the September \n18, 2002 edition of National Journal's CongressDaily noted that ``a \ngroup of labor officials who were active in the fight against, TPA, are \nmeeting in the offices of the AFL-CIO. At the top of their agenda: \nmapping a plan to ensure future trade agreements include strong \nprovisions on labor rights and the environment. Labor officials plan to \nhold future agreements to standards set in an earlier free-trade \nagreement reached with Jordan, which they consider a model of backing \nup labor and environmental provisions with enforceable sanctions.'' \nSome Members of Congress are even arguing that future agreements must \nfollow the ``Jordan Standard'' on labor and environment in order to \nmeet the objectives laid out in the TPA bill. Perhaps even more ominous \nwere the public remarks of the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee \nwho urged the administration to follow the model of the Jordan Free \nTrade Agreement ``exactly'' in implementing the labor and environment \nprovisions of the Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act.\n  On this issue, I respectfully disagree with my colleague from \nMontana. In fact, I think this would be a serious mistake. The \nnegotiating objectives in the TPA bill set the parameters for future \ntrade negotiations, not some past agreement like the Jordan FTA that \nwas negotiated during the Clinton Administration. To follow the \nprovisions of this past agreement ``exactly'' would ignore the clear \nwill of Congress as set forth in the TPA bill. Even more disconcerting \nis that such a stark litmus test ignores that basic premise that the \nmost appropriate mechanisms to improve labor and environment standards \nabroad differ from country to country and agreement to agreement. In \nshort, one size does not fit all.\n  Trying to solve complex environmental and labor issues with rigid \nconstructs will do nothing to actually improve environmental or labor \nstandards abroad. At the same time, demanding that our trading partners \naccept specific language laid out in past agreements during trade \nnegotiations will come at a heavy price for our farmers and workers, as \nour trading partners can demand significant concessions on other \nissues, such as agriculture, in exchange for our rigid insistence that \nthey accept specific language from our trade negotiators. The \nAdministration and Members of Congress need to remember that the \nunderlying premise of the TPA Act is to provide the President and our \ntrade negotiators with flexibility so they can negotiate the best trade \nagreements for the American people. It is not intended, nor should it \nbe used, to try to tie the President's hands on any particular issue.\n  It is also troubling that some advocacy groups are pushing to ensure \nthat future free trade agreements adhere to their version of so-called \n``Jordan Standard.'' I think it bears repeating that it is the \nnegotiating objectives laid out in the Trade Promotion Authority bill \nthat should guide the Administration in future trade negotiations, not \na single free trade agreement that was concluded long before TPA became \nlaw.\n  I also believe it would be a political miscalculation to insist that \nnew trade agreements must follow the ``Jordan Standard'' to gain \nsupport in Congress. First, no one really knows what the ``Jordan \nStandard'' is. In fact, when we held a hearing on the Jordan Free Trade \nAgreement on March 20, 2001 in the Senate Finance Committee, one of the \nmost controversial issues raised was what the labor and environmental \nprovisions of the Jordan Free Trade Agreement actually mean. For \nexample, former United States Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky \ntestified that the labor and environment provisions in the Jordan FTA \n``while\n\n[[Page S9108]]\n\nrestating the existing commitment of both countries to environmental \nprotection and the ILO's core labor standards, neither imposes new \nstandards nor bars change or reform of national laws as each country \nsees fit.''\n  Ambassador Michael Smith, former Deputy United States Trade \nRepresentative and the first American Ambassador to the General \nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, testified that ``Articles 5 and 6 [of \nthe Jordan FTA] as written are largely fluff, open to widely differing, \neven if plausible, interpretations and, as such, causes for possible \nunfortunate differences between Jordan and the United States in the \nyears ahead as the agreement is implemented. Articles 5 and 6 do not \nadvance the ``cause'' of either international environmental or labor \naffairs and add only confusion to what should be a straightforward free \ntrade agreement. Indeed, the only result I can foresee is countries \nadopting lower environmental and labor standards for fear of themselves \nbeing unable to effectively enforce higher standards hardly a desired \nresult.''\n  During the hearing it became clear that labor and environment \nprovisions, and their relationship to the dispute settlement procedures \nestablished in the Jordan FTA, are highly controversial. A number of \ngroups, including the American Farm Bureau Federation and the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce, strongly opposed including the labor and \nenvironment provisions in the Jordan FTA without some clarification \nfrom the Administration that these provisions would not be implemented \nin a trade restrictive manner. Many members of the Republican party, \nincluding myself, shared these concerns. Had the U.S. Government not \nagreed to side letters with the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, clarifying \nthat these and other provisions would not be implemented in a manner \nthat results in blocking trade, it is highly likely that the agreement \nwould not have gained the support of the Republican caucus in the \nSenate, and may not have passed the Senate at all. And, if the proposed \nagreement had not been with our good friend and ally Jordan, side \nletters may not have been enough.\n  I think this represents an important political reality which the \nAdministration must gauge in entering into new free trade agreements. \nAlmost 90 percent of the Republican Caucus in the House and Senate \nsupported passage of Trade Promotion Authority. In contrast, only 12 \npercent of the House Democratic Caucus and 40 percent of the Senate \nDemocratic Caucus supported the bill. And the price for that support \nwas high. Clearly, if future free trade agreements are going to pass \nCongress, the strong support of the Republican caucus will be key.\n  In short, I am deeply concerned that some advocacy groups and Members \nof Congress are pushing the Administration to adhere to a highly \ncontroversial and vague ``Jordan Standard'' which does not have the \nstrong support of the Congress and that is not clearly reflected in the \nTrade Promotion Authority negotiating objectives. While the labor, \nenvironment, and dispute settlement negotiating objectives in the \nBipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act are loosely based on \nprovisions found in the Jordan Free Trade Agreement, there is clearly a \ndistinction between the two. In implementing the will of Congress as \nembodied in the Trade Promotion Authority Act, it is critically \nimportant for the administration to keep this distinction in mind if \nfuture agreements are to gain the support of myself and other strong \nsupporters of free trade in the Congress.\n  Before I conclude I would like to talk about another important \ndevelopment in U.S. trade policy. Last week, for the very first time, \nthe bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Oversight Group, COG, met with \nAmbassador Zoellick to discuss pending and future trade agreements. The \nCOG was created by the Trade Promotion Authority Act to provide an \nadditional consultative mechanism for Members of Congress and to \nprovide advice to the U.S. Trade Representative on trade negotiations.\n  The COG is comprised of: the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the \nFinance and Ways and Means Committees; three additional members from \nthe Senate Finance Committee, no more than two of whom may be of the \nsame political party; three additional Members of the House Ways and \nMeans Committee, no more than two of whom may be of the same political \nparty; and the chairman and ranking member or their designees of the \ncommittees of the House or Senate which would have, under the Rules of \nthe House or Senate, ``jurisdiction over provisions of law affected by \na trade agreement negotiations for which are conducted at any time \nduring that Congress.''\n  The purpose of the COG is to ``consult and provide advice to the \nTrade Representative regarding the formulation of specific objectives, \nnegotiating strategies and positions, the development of the applicable \ntrade agreement, and compliance and enforcement of the negotiated \ncommitments under the trade agreement.'' In addition, each member of \nthe COG is to be accredited as an official adviser to the United States \ndelegation in the negotiations. However, those Senators or Members who \nare Members of the COG because they are the chairman or ranking member \nof a Committee which has ``jurisdiction over provisions of law affected \nby trade negotiations'' are to be accredited as advisors only on those \nprovisions which would fall under their Committee's jurisdiction.\n  The TPA bill makes it clear that the COG is a mechanism for enhanced \nconsultations and that it is not designed to serve as a referendum on \nnew agreements or on particular negotiating positions.\n  I am pleased to report that our first meeting was a great success. A \nnumber of Senators and Members of the House from both political parties \nattended the meeting, including the chairmen and ranking members of \nboth the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means Committees. During the \nmeeting Ambassador Zoellick expressed his strong support for enhanced \nconsultations and his keen interest in meeting with the COG on a \nregular basis. I certainly would support his enthusiastic efforts.\n  The TPA bill also requires the chairmen and ranking members of both \nthe Finance and Ways and Means Committees to establish guidelines for \nthe exchange of information between the Congress and the Executive \nbranch. I plan to work diligently to ensure that these guidelines are \nfeasible and that the resulting exchange of information is meaningful.\n  With the passage of the Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of \n2002, we begin a new phase in the history of U.S. trade policy. \nAlthough the bill contains some new buttons and bows, the underlying \npremise of the bill remains the same as it was decades ago to give the \nadministration the tools it needs to liberalize trade and create new \nopportunities for America's farmers, ranchers and workers. As the \nRanking Member of the Senate Finance Committee, I intend to ensure that \nthe Trade Promotion Authority Act is implemented in a manner that does \njust that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/24/senate-section/article/S9108-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9108-S9109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              VISIT OF TAIWAN'S FIRST LADY CHEN WU SUE-JEN\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, Washington is graced this week by the \nvisit of Madame Chen Wu Sue-Jen, the First Lady of Taiwan and a \ndistinguished humanitarian and advocate for human rights. Mrs. Chen has \nworked tirelessly to promote human rights and democratization on \nTaiwan. In tandem with her husband, President Chen Shui-Bien, Mrs. Chen \nhas worked to open up the Taiwanese political system and ensure that \nthe Taiwan Government reflects all its citizens' views and interests. \nTaiwan's democracy serves as an model to Chinese-speaking people around \nthe world, and as compelling evidence that human rights and democracy \nare truly universal aspirations.\n  The struggle for democratization is never quick or easy, and in Mrs. \nChen's case, it led to very personal sacrifice. When leaving a campaign \nrally in 1985, she was hit by a vehicle that left her paralyzed from \nthe waist down. While some might view that as a justification to \nwithdraw from public life, in the case of Mrs. Chen, it only reinforced \nher commitment to public service, and she went on to serve with \ndistinction in Taiwan's legislature. Her experience has also given her \na profound sense of identification with the disabled, whom she has \nworked as First Lady to support. While here in Washington, Mrs. Chen \nwill meet with the Red Cross and the National Rehabilitation Hospital\n\n[[Page S9109]]\n\nto discuss the work she has done in Taiwan to promote the rights of the \ndisabled.\n  It has been pointed out that Mrs. Chen's visit is the first visit by \na First Lady of the Republic of China since Soong May-ling, better \nknown here as Madame Chiang, traveled to Washington to ask for U.S. \nsupport in 1943. Since that turbulent period, America has maintained \nclose ties with the Republic of China. The United States has had, and \nwill continue to have, a unique partnership with Taiwan, and the people \non Taiwan should remain assured that they have no better friend than \nthe United States.\n  But this week's historic milestone also marks a good opportunity to \nreflect the vast distance the Republic of China has traveled between \n1943 and now. Today when Taiwan talks with the United States, it does \nso as a vibrant democracy, a flourishing economy, a major trading \npartner and investor in the United States, and an important partner of \nthe U.S. in our efforts to preserve peace and stability in East Asia.\n  There is no better reflection of today's Taiwan than this dedicated \nwoman who embodies so many of the positive changes that have occurred \non the island. This week's visit will give Americans an opportunity to \ndeepen their understanding of Taiwan by meeting with one of its most \naccomplished and articulate representatives. It gives me great pleasure \nto welcome my friend, Madame Chen Wu, to Washington. I urge my \ncolleagues to take this opportunity to get to know her, you will be \nglad you did.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I welcome Taiwan's First Lady, Madame \nChen Wu Sue-jen, to Washington, D.C. and remark on her considerable \naccomplishments. As many of my colleagues are aware, Madame Chen Wu was \nparalyzed from the waist down after being hit by an automobile in 1985, \nand is permanently confined to a wheelchair. Despite this tragic event, \nMadame Chen Wu has persevered.\n  In 1986, when her husband, now President Chen Shui-bian, was \nimprisoned on political charges, Madame Chen Wu ran on her husband's \nbehalf for a seat in the national legislature--and won. Since then, she \nhas played a crucial role as confidant and supporter to President Chen \nas he progressed from legislator to Mayor of Taipei and now in this \ncurrent office.\n  The courage and optimism Madame Chen Wu demonstrates, in spite of her \nphysical limitation, serves as a source of inspiration for all. \nContinuously upbeat in life, Madame Chen provides tremendous support to \nall who know her. Her strength of character has done much to transform \nthe role of Taiwan's First Lady.\n  So, it is with great pleasure that I welcome Madame Chen Wu to the \nUnited States, to Washington, D.C., and am confident that her visit \nwill only serve to strengthen U.S.-Taiwan relations.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to speak about \nTaiwan's First Lady, Madam Chen Wu Sue-jen, who is visiting Washington \nthis week for the first time in her capacity as First Lady. As a dear \nfriend of Taiwan, and on behalf of my colleagues in the United States \nSenate, I would like to welcome Madam Chen Wu to Washington. I hope her \nvisit is pleasant and productive.\n  Mr. President, Madam Chen Wu is truly a delightful and remarkable \nlady. I am in awe of her courage in the face of adversary. I am \nespecially moved by her refusal to allow being a victim of an \nautomobile accident, which rendered her disabled, from ending her \noutspoken advocacy for democracy in Taiwan.\n  Madam Chen Wu successfully ran for office herself, becoming a \nlawmaker. She later focused her efforts to make her husband one of \nTaiwan's eminent political figures. Her dreams and hopes for him became \nfulfilled when Chen Shui-bian was elected president of the Republic of \nChina in 2000.\n  Since taking office, President Chen has exhibited great leadership \nand courage in the face of the People's Republic of China's constant \nmenace. President Chen has also shown his compassion and friendship to \nthe American people in the wake of the tragic attacks on the citizens \nof the United States of America. I am certain these fine traits have \nbeen honed in part through the example Madam Chen Wu has played in his \nlife.\n  To this day, First Lady, Madam Chen Wu has not changed. She is still \nthe same Chen Wu Sue-jen of years ago: an innocent schoolgirl from \nMatou, Tainan County, Taiwan. She has retained all the charm and grace \nof a young Taiwanese girl who later became a wife, mother, politician \nand First Lady.\n  The United States of America welcomes you, Madam Chen Wu.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/24/senate-section/article/S9109-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9109-S9110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           U.S.A. PATRIOT ACT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on behalf of \nthe listed Senators, a joint statement of myself, Senator Thurmond, \nSenator Kyl, Senator DeWine, Senator Sessions, and Senator McConnell \nregarding the Committee on the Judiciary, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n The U.S.A. Patriot Act in Practice: Shedding Light on the FISA Process\n\n       Prior to the U.S.A. PATRIOT Act of 2001, the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 authorized the \n     government to gather intelligence on agents of foreign powers \n     with less stringent requirements than those required for \n     surveillance of domestic criminals. The courts interpreted \n     FISA as requiring that gathering foreign intelligence be the \n     ``primary purpose'' of the surveillance of the foreign agent. \n     See United States v. Duggan, 743 F.2d 59, 77 (2nd Cir. 1984); \n     United States v. Truong Dinh Hung, 629 F.2d 908 (4th Cir. \n     1980), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1154 (1982).\n       This statutory regime worked well during the cold war for \n     conducting surveillance on spies who were either foreign \n     nationals employed by foreign government working under \n     diplomatic cover at foreign embassies in the United States, \n     or United States persons in this country who had been \n     recruited to spy by foreign intelligence agencies. Both were \n     clearly ``agents of a foreign power,'' and gathering foreign \n     intelligence on the activities of these targets was generally \n     the ``primary purpose,'' if not the only purpose, of the \n     surveillance.\n       The statutory regime did not work as well with respect to \n     terrorists, who did not work for a foreign government, who \n     often financed their operations with criminal activities, \n     such as drug dealing, and who began to target American \n     interests. It was more difficult to determine if such \n     terrorists were ``agents of a foreign power'' and it was \n     difficult for the government to keep the appropriate types of \n     investigators, intelligence or criminal, involved in the \n     operation.\n       To determine what the ``primary purpose'' of a surveillance \n     was, courts looked to what type of federal investigators were \n     managing and directing the surveillance operation. If \n     intelligence investigators managed and directed the \n     surveillance, courts interpreted the primary purpose of the \n     surveillance to be gathering foreign intelligence, thus \n     requiring the government to comply with the less stringent \n     FISA surveillance procedures. On the other hand, if criminal \n     investigators managed and directed the surveillance, courts \n     interpreted the primary purpose of the surveillance to be \n     gathering criminal evidence, thus requiring the government to \n     comply with the more stringent Title III wiretap procedures \n     or to exclude the evidence from court. In short, the courts \n     held that there could be only one primary purpose, and it was \n     either gathering foreign intelligence or gathering criminal \n     evidence. See, e.g., Truong, 629 F.2d at 912-13.\n       The attacks on September 11, 2001, appeared to be \n     orchestrated by the Al Qaeda, an international terrorist \n     organization, with no embassies or diplomats, and whose \n     operatives were loosely associated small groups who often \n     engaged in criminal activities. The intelligence agencies and \n     criminal investigators were unable to analyze and disseminate \n     information needed to detect and prevent the September 11th \n     attacks partly because of restrictions on their ability to \n     share information and coordinate tactical strategies in order \n     to disrupt foreign terrorist activities. It was apparent that \n     the existing court interpretation of the FISA requirement of \n     ``primary purpose'' impeded the sharing and coordination of \n     information between criminal and intelligence investigators \n     on foreign terrorists.\n       Accordingly, Congress enacted the USA Patriot Act, in part, \n     to replace the ``primary purpose'' requirement with a less \n     stringent requirement, and to increase consultation and \n     coordination efforts between intelligence and federal law \n     enforcement officers to investigate and protect against \n     foreign terrorist threats. See Sections 218 and 504. Three \n     replacement standards were discussed for determining how \n     large a purpose gathering foreign intelligence must be in \n     order for a FISA warrant to issue: (1) a substantial purpose; \n     (2) a significant purpose; and (3) a purpose. With multiple \n     purposes in an investigation of an international terrorist, \n     there could be only one ``primary'' purpose, but more than \n     one ``substantial'', ``significant,'' or ``a'' purposes. A \n     ``substantial'' purpose of gathering foreign intelligence \n     was viewed to be less than primary, but more than a de\n\n[[Page S9110]]\n\n     minimis purpose. A ``significant'' purpose of gathering \n     foreign intelligence was deemed to be less than \n     ``significant,'' but more than a de minimis purpose. And \n     ``a purpose'' of gathering foreign intelligence was deemed \n     to include a de minimis purpose.\n       Congress chose the word ``significant'' purpose to replace \n     the existing FISA requirement of a ``primary'' purpose. By \n     this we intended that the purpose to gather intelligence \n     could be less than the main or dominant purpose, but \n     nonetheless important and not de minimis. Because a \n     significant purpose of gathering foreign intelligence was not \n     the primary or dominant purpose, it was clear to us that in a \n     FISA search or surveillance involving multiple purposes, \n     gathering criminal evidence could be the primary purpose as \n     long as gathering foreign intelligence was a significant \n     purpose in the investigation. See generally, e.g., United \n     States v. Soto-Silva, 129 F.3d 340, 347 (5th Cir. 1997) \n     (holding that a defendant who maintained a house for the \n     ``primary purpose'' of taking care of a family member also \n     maintained the house for a ``significant purpose'' of \n     distributing marijuana).\n       The Department of Justice confirmed the meaning of the \n     change from primary purpose to significant purpose in a \n     letter supporting the amendment sent on October 1, 2001, to \n     the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the House and Senate \n     Judiciary and Intelligence Committees. The Department stated \n     that the amendment would recognize that ``the courts should \n     not deny [the President] the authority to conduct \n     intelligence searches even when the national security purpose \n     is secondary to criminal prosecution.''\n       The understanding of increased cooperation between \n     intelligence and law enforcement was confirmed by voices in \n     the House and the Senate in the days and weeks immediately \n     following the new FISA standard. ``This legislation \n     authorizes the sharing of information between criminal \n     investigators and those engaged in foreign intelligence-\n     gathering. It provides for enhanced wiretap and surveillance \n     authority. It brings the basis building blocks of a criminal \n     investigation, pen registers and trap and trace provisions, \n     into the 21st century to deal with e-mails and Internet \n     communications.'' 147 Cong. Rec. H7196 (daily ed. Oct. 23, \n     2001) (statement of Rep. Sensenbrenner). ``The core \n     provisions of the legislation we passed in the Senate 2 weeks \n     ago remain firmly in place. For instance, in the future, our \n     law enforcement and intelligence communities will be able to \n     share information and cooperate fully in protecting our \n     Nation against terrorist attacks.'' 147 Cong. Rec. S11016 \n     (daily ed. Oct. 25, 2001) (statement of Sen. Hatch).\n       In addition, a news publication confirmed the general \n     understanding on Capitol Hill during the consideration of the \n     U.S.A. PATRIOT Act. The Congressional Quarterly reported \n     separately on October 8, 9, and 23, 2001: ``Under the \n     measure, for example, law enforcement could carry out a FISA \n     operation even of the primary purpose was a criminal \n     investigation.'' Congr. Q., House Action Reports, Fact Sheet \n     No. 107-33, at p. 3 (Oct. 9, 2001); see Cong. Q., House \n     Action Reports, Legislative Week, at p. 3 (Oct. 23, 2001); \n     Cong. Q., House Action Reports, Legislative Week, a p. 13 \n     (Oct. 8, 2001). FISA may not be used ``even if the primary \n     purpose is a criminal investigation.'' Cong. Q. Billwatch \n     Brief, H.R. 3162 (Oct. 23, 2001).\n       It was our intent when we included the plain language of \n     Section 218 of the U.S.A. PATRIOT Act and when we voted for \n     the Act as a whole to change FISA to allow a foreign \n     intelligence surveillance warrant to be obtained when ``a \n     significant'' purpose of the surveillance was to gather \n     foreign intelligence, even when the primary purpose of the \n     surveillance was the gathering of criminal evidence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/24/senate-section/article/S9110-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred September 22, \n2002, in West Hollywood, CA. Two men brutally attacked a 55 year old \ngay man walking in West Hollywood, the second such attack in West \nHollywood this month. The assailants beat the victim with a baseball \nbat and metal pipe while yelling anti-gay slurs. The attackers, who \nmatch the description of the men who attacked a 34 year old actor on \nSeptember 1, fled when a cab driver stopped to help the victim. The \nvictim received treatment at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center following the \nassault.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/24/senate-section/article/S9110-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n          TRIBUTE TO DR.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer my thoughts \nand prayers to the family of Jamie Christenson of Marshalltown, Iowa \nand Eric Hurst of Ventura, California. Bob and Debra Christenson \nsuffered a terrible loss this summer when their young daughter, Jamie, \ndied in a tragic swimming accident in Minnesota at the young age of 17. \nThe Hurst family lost Eric, only 24, as he valiantly attempted to save \nJamie's life.\n  Jamie Christenson was one of 53 campers from Trinity Lutheran Church \nin Marshalltown who were at Camp Vermillion, near Cook, Minnesota. \nWhile on a canoeing trip on the afternoon of July 30, Jamie and her \nfriends took a break from carrying their canoes around the more \ntreacherous falls and began cooling off in the waters near Upper \nBasswood Falls, in Minnesota's Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.\n  Beyond the falls, Jamie and a group of campers donned life preservers \nand entered the water. There, in what had appeared to be calm and \nshallow waters, Jamie was caught in a swift undercurrent and pulled \nbelow the river.\n  Several campers and boaters in the area rushed to her rescue, \nincluding Eric Hurst, who was working on the river as a canoe guide. \nSadly, the river claimed both of their lives.\n  The State of Minnesota and Governor Jesse Ventura have each issued a \nposthumous certificate of commendation for heroism to the family of \nEric Hurst. It is my hope that the Senate can act in some similar \nfashion, or, that there can be some other Federal recognition of Eric's \nefforts to save Jamie's life.\n  As the father of two daughters, I can think of no pain deeper than to \nlose a child. I offer my deepest condolences to Bob and Debra, their \nfamily, and to Jamie's many friends, as well as to the family and \nfriends of Eric Hurst. In times of such pain, words fall far short of \ncomfort we wish we could provide to those in mourning, but even words \nare we can offer.\n  So I offer the words of the Greek poet Aeschylus: ``In our sleep, \npain which\n\n[[Page S9111]]\n\ncannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart until, in our own \ndespair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of \nGod.''\n  To the Christenson family and the Hurst family, I offer these words \nas a prayer for an end to their sorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/24/senate-section/article/S9111-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   LEO JOHN SWEENEY JR.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate John \nand Eileen Sweeney, who will celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary \non November 25, 2002.\n  As they celebrate this milestone in their lives, they will surely \nreflect on the many changes, successes, and accomplishments they have \nexperienced together over the last 25 years. Theirs is a journey of \nwhich they can be proud.\n  Leo John Sweeney Jr. is the son of the late Leo John Sweeney Sr. and \nIsabelle Moore Sweeney, and is a lifelong Wilmingtonian. He is a \ngraduate of St. Elizabeth's Elementary School and Salesianum High \nSchool. His wife, Catherine Eileen Claffey Sweeney, is the daughter of \nthe late John J. Claffey and Alice G.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor Anna Marie \nO'Loughlin, a woman who has dedicated more than a decade of her life to \nadvocating and caring for children in the foster care and adoption \nsystem. Her boundless energy, courage, and commitment to children make \nher an outstanding parent and an asset to the State of New Jersey. I \ncongratulate her on recieving of the 2002 Congressional Angel in \nAdoption Award.\n  In 1991, Anna Marie O'Loughlin and her husband, Frank, adopted their \nfirst child from the New Jersey Division of Youth and Family Services, \nDYFS. Jason, a toddler born drug and alcohol addicted, suffered \nmultiple learning disabilities as a result of his unfortunate start in \nlife.\n  Five years later, Anna Marie and Frank adopted another child, a 10-\nyear-old boy with an attachment disorder. Later that same year, the \nO'Loughlins volunteered to serve as foster parents, receiving their \nfirst foster child, an infant girl, in January of 1997. Seven months \nlater the infant girl's biological sister joined the family. Anna Marie \nand Frank adopted both girls in December 2000.\n  In January 2001, Anna Marie left a thenty-year career in order to be \nmore consistently available to her children, and opened her home and \nheart, this time as an emergency placement foster home for older \nchildren and teenagers. Children aged 2 to 17 passed through her home, \nsome in the middle of the night, and moved on when DYFS found a foster \nhome. Anna Marie established a particularly special relationship with \none of these children, a 16-year-old boy who had been in multiple homes \nand treatment facilities. He would soon be forced to leave the foster \ncare system due to his age, and would have been left to face an \nuncertain future on his own. However, Anna Marie stepped in with her \ncharacteristic determination to change that outcome, and in January \n2002, the O'Loughlin home became a permanent foster home for this young \nman.\n  Over the course of these years, Anna Marie also became an outspoken \nadvocate for children in the foster care and adoption system. She has \nserved on the board of Concerned Parents for Adoption in a variety of \npositions, including president from 1996 to 2000. Currently, Anna Marie \nworks as a co-trainer for adoptive and foster parent applicants. She \npresents workshops at the Concerned Parents for Adoption conference on \nolder child adoption and teenage issues, offering a wealth of \nexperience and practical knowledge.\n  Anna Marie has said that she cannot help feeling that her work is \nmaking a difference. Indeed, she has reached out to children in \ndesperate need to offer them a better life. As our nation reaffirms its \ncommitment to service, Anna Maria is a shining example. Again, I \ncongratulate Anna Marie on her well-deserved recognition, and I thank \nher for her tireless efforts on behalf of children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/24/senate-section/article/S9111-3", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RICHARD I.

RICHARD RYAN'S RETIREMENT FROM DES MOINES \n                               UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, one of Iowa's foremost leaders in \nmedical and health sciences education, Dr. Richard M. Ryan Jr., has \nannounced his retirement from Des Moines University at the end of this \nDecember. Today, I rise to acknowledge his many contributions to health \ncare in the State of Iowa, the Nation and the world.\n  Dr. Ryan's career reflects his lifelong commitment to community and \npopulation-based medicine. He began his career with a doctoral degree \nin public health from Harvard University, and has continued to serve on \nnumerous academic and health boards, professional organizations, \ncommittees, and task forces.\n  Harvard University, Boston University, and Tufts University have all \nbeen a part of Dr. Ryan's distinguished career in medical education and \nhealth services administration. Iowa was fortunate to attract Dr. Ryan \nin 1996, when he became president of Des Moines University.\n  Among his many accomplishments, Dr. Ryan created a new Public Health \nProgram, significantly expanded the Des Moines University research \nenterprise, and laid the foundation for a campus revitalization plan. \nUnder Dr. Ryan's leadership the University recently established a \nGeriatric Education Center on campus. Through all of these efforts, Dr. \nRyan has helped to expand the reach and recognition of the University's \nmedical and health sciences programs in Iowa and across the Nation.\n\n[[Page S9112]]\n\n  Additionally Dr. Ryan has helped forge new partnerships within the \ncommunity and state. The university's modern research laboratories \nwelcome students from Iowa's public and private undergraduate \ninstitutions. Faculty and students from the University provide ongoing \nhealth care services and educational opportunities to students and \nteachers in the younger grade levels within the community.\n  A Navy veteran, Dr. Ryan has also distinguished himself through \ncommitment to the welfare of veterans. He served as senior health \nconsultant to the Chief of Health Services for the U.S. Coast Guard and \nas executive consultant to six medical directors of the Veterans \nAdministration.\n  In addition to serving both public and private health care interests \nin the U.S., Dr. Ryan is highly regarded for his experience and \nexpertise in international medicine. He has served as a consultant to \nministries of health and education in Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Bahrain, \nKuwait, Qatar, and Russia.\n  Although I am saddened to see this great man retire, he has assured \nme that he intends to remain active and available to serve where \nneeded, helping to ensure access to health care for all.\n  I commend Dr. Ryan for his commitment to the health care needs of the \npeople of Iowa and the Nation through his many years of visionary \nleadership and dedicated service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/24/senate-section/article/S9112-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL OVARIAN CANCER AWARENESS MONTH\n\n Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, September is National Ovarian \nCancer Awareness Month, and I want to draw your attention to some \nsobering facts.\n  Ovarian cancer is very difficult to diagnose and even more \nchallenging to treat. While it is encouraging that scientific reports \nhave shown an improvement in survival rates for women with ovarian \ncancer in recent years, sadly, the 5-year survival rate remains barely \n50 percent. The American Cancer Society estimates that over 25,500 \nwomen are diagnosed with ovarian cancer and 14,500 women die from the \ndisease annually. Poor long-term survival rates are mostly due to the \nlack of a reliable method of detection, with less than one-third of all \novarian cancer cases detected at the critical early stages when the \ndisease is most treatable.\n  Since Congress established the Department of Defense Ovarian Cancer \nResearch Program, OCRP, in 1997, the program has addressed the urgent \nproblem of early detection by funding comprehensive research \ninitiatives. The OCRP promotes research in ovarian cancer prevention \nand engages experts from multiple disciplines in genuinely \ncollaborative efforts. The innovative proposals funded through the \nprogram foster new directions in research and strengthen long-term \novarian cancer research capabilities and networking among institutions.\n  Last year, I was proud to join Senator Landrieu and several of my \ncolleagues in sponsoring Senate Resolution 163 designating a week in \nSeptember as ``National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Week.'' This \nresolution passed the Senate unanimously.\n  On April 30, I along with many of my colleagues sent a letter to the \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee leadership requesting that funding \nfor the Department of Defense, DOD, Ovarian Cancer Research Program be \nincreased to $15 million in fiscal year 2003. While the Senate-passed \nbill did not include this level of funding, it did include $10 million \nfor this important project. The House version completely cut funding. \nThis funding level is currently being worked out in conference.\n  We must remain steadfast in our quest to ultimately conquer this \nterrible disease. I urge my colleagues to heed the slogan of the \nNational Ovarian Cancer Coalition: ``Ovarian Cancer . . . It Whispers . \n. . So Listen.'' To the one woman in 55 who will develop this disease \nduring her lifetime, let me assure you, I'm listening.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/24/senate-section/article/S9112-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9112-S9113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ISRAEL'S HEBREW UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the civilized world was shocked and \noutraged when Palestinian militants planted a bomb on July 31, 2002 in \na cafeteria at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. The bomb ultimately \nkilled nine young people, including five young Americans, and injured \nan additional 80 people.\n  I agree with President George W. Bush, who condemned ``in as strong \nas possible terms the attack that took place in Israel'' and \ncharacterized those behind the bombings as ``killers who hate the \nthought of peace.''\n  What made the attack particularly heinous and unforgivable was the \nHebrew University is an institution that constitutes an island of \nsanity and hope in a region that often seems to exemplify the opposite \nof those virtues.\n  Professor Menachem Magidor, President of Hebrew University, \narticulated these points in a letter published by The New York Times on \nAugust 9, 2002. He stated that this ``was more than a murderous act. \nSpecifically targeted against the heart of an academic campus, it was \nalso an attack on what the university symbolizes and aspires to: \nunderstanding, tolerance and the quest for peace.''\n  He went on to state that ``The ethnic composition of the victims \nattests to the diversity and pluralism of our university family. The \nvictims includes Jews and Palestinians, as well as citizens of the \nUnited States, France, Italy, South Korea, Turkey and Japan. Our \nuniversity, where more than 10 percent of the 23,000 students are of \nArab descent, is one of the very few places in which a meaningful \ndialogue between Jews and Arabs still takes place.''\n  Hebrew University is, indeed, a unique and special institution. It is \nthe oldest comprehensive institution of higher learning in Israel, and \nconsidered to be among the world's great universities.\n  The laying of the cornerstone for the university on Mt. Scopus in \nJuly 1918 was attended by Muslims, Jews and Christians. This set the \ntone for a university dedicated from its very beginnings to the pursuit \nof knowledge for the benefit not only of the then fledgling Jewish \ncommunity of the land of Israel and for world Jewry, but also for all \nof the peoples of the region--including Muslims and Christians--and for \nhumanity generally.\n  Seven years later, on April 1, 1925, the Hebrew University of \nJerusalem was opened at a gala ceremony attended by leaders of world \nJewry including the University's founding father, Chaim Weizmann, who \nwould become in 1948 the first President of the new nation of Israel. \nAlbert Einstein, one of the intellectual giants of the modern work, was \nalso among the founding fathers of the institution.\n  As Palestine was then part of the British mandate, the British were \nrepresented by Lord Balfour, Viscount Allenby and Sir Herbert Samuel, \nall pivotal figures in the history of the region.\n  The University's first three research institutes were in \nmicrobiology, chemistry and Jewish studies, and the school began with a \ntotal of 33 faculty members and 141 students. The University awarded \nits first Master's degrees to 13 graduates in 1931.\n  By the time the British announced that they would leave Palestine in \n1947, the University had grown into a well established research and \nteaching institution. As a result of the fighting in Jerusalem during \nthe War of Independence in 1948, the University was cut off from the \nmain Israei-held sectors in the city. The University was forced to seek \nother quarters and its facilities were scattered throughout Jerusalem.\n  Construction began in 1953 on a new campus in the Givat Ram section \nof Jerusalem. Together with Hadassah Medical Organization, a few years \nlater, Hebrew University began construction of a medical science campus \nin Ein Kerem in southwest Jerusalem.\n  By 1967, enrollment exceeded 12,500 at the two campuses in Jerusalem \nand Rehovot. The reunification of Jerusalem, as a result of the Six Day \nWar in June 1967, enabled the university's leaders to restore and \nexpand the original campus on Mt. Scopus. The Rothberg International \nSchool was opened there in 1971 and by 1981, Mt. Scopus was again the \nmain campus for the university.\n  Thus, since its modest beginning, with its handful of students and \nstaff, the university has grown remarkably to include an enrollment of \nsome 23,000 students on four campuses, three of them in Jerusalem and \nanother in Rehovot.\n  But this is a story of more than buildings. The university offers \nbasic\n\n[[Page S9113]]\n\nand advanced educational opportunities in virtually all fields of \nhigher education, from humanities to the social sciences, chemistry, \nphysics, life sciences, law, medicine, agriculture, engineering, social \nwork, education and numerous other fields of study too numerous to \nmention. It offers degrees at all levels including B.A., B.S., Master's \nand Ph.D.\n  Although it attracts students of the front rank from all over Israel \nand abroad due to its reputation as a leading teaching institution, the \nuniversity is also renowned internationally for the research carried \nout there in all of the sciences.\n  These research projects, numbering in the thousands, involve in many \ncases cooperative efforts with leading scientists and scholars, among \nthem a substantial number of Americans. To get an idea of the quality \nof the research being pursued, one need only examine the leading \nscientific journals, such as Science or Nature, to see how often the \nnames of Hebrew University researchers appear on their pages.\n\n  It is significant that scholars and researchers based at Hebrew \nUniversity have competed for and received many grants from numerous \nAmerican agencies and departments including NIH, NIST, DARPA, and \nUSAID. Those in charge of reviewing such grant proposals have come to \nrespect the substantive quality of the work done at Hebrew University. \nIt is worth noting that many of these proposals are made in cooperation \nwith American institutions, which has served to enhance the close \nrelations between our people and especially our scientists. The results \nof these projects have benefitted Americans, Israelis and all mankind.\n  But it is more than the quality of its teaching and research that I \nwish to emphasize today in speaking about the special nature of the \nHebrew University of Jerusalem.\n  Indeed, there are many outstanding universities in our own country \nand elsewhere that are making significant contributions to our \nknowledge and to the progress of our world.\n  What I really want to stress is the singularity of this university in \nits vigorous efforts towards meeting the desperate need for the \nfurtherance of those human values which we so treasure in our own \ncountry and which we consider to be the foundation stones of decent \nsocieties everywhere.\n  Specifically, I am speaking of elements that to us seem basic and \nwhich we probably take for granted: the free and unfettered pursuit of \ninformation, freedom of expression, tolerance for people of different \nreligious, races and ethnic origins and for those whose world views may \nbe different from our own. In brief, I am speaking of an openness \nthat--all too sadly--does not exist in many societies and in many parts \nof the world.\n  It is precisely this pluralistic and tolerant spirit which has \ncharacterized the Hebrew University since its earliest days and which \nhas through the years attracted students and scholars from the four \ncorners of the world.\n  The student body today is a diverse and pluralistic one, made up of \nIsraelis--Jews and Arabs--as well as foreign students of all religions, \nraces and ethnic origins.\n  These students study and live together within the university \ncommunity, contributing in no small measure--perhaps unconsciously--to \nthe development of a world based on informed coexistence and peace, \nrather than one grounded in ignorance and hatred, doomed to eternal \nconflict and purposeless death and suffering.\n  Long before anyone dreamed of dialogue between Israelis and \nPalestinians, the Hebrew University, through one of its institutes \nnamed for one of our great Presidents of the last century--the Harry S. \nTruman Research Institute for the Advancement of Peace--initiated and \ndeveloped substantial cooperative academic and research projects \ninvolving scholars from Israel and from its Arab neighbors Egypt, \nJordan, the West Bank and Gaza.\n  Nowhere were there so many Arab and Israeli researchers involved in \ncooperative ventures aimed at achieving a better and mutually \nbeneficial future than at the Hebrew University. These projects \ninvolved numerous academic disciplines: the social and exact sciences, \nagriculture, medicine, dental medicine and others.\n  Scores of practically oriented plans and reports were drawn up by \nthese teams as to how to proceed regarding the resolution of such \ndifficult issues as the sharing of water resources, the delineation of \nborders, and the protection of the environment. In addition, the \nuniversity has conducted numerous in-service training courses for Arab \nprofessionals.\n  It is precisely the yearning and searching for the solving of age-old \nconflicts, for peaceful resolution that the savage advocates of hate \nand murder sought to strike down in their despicable bombing attack at \nthe Hebrew University. But the human spirit is not so easily \ndiscouraged or defeated.\n  In condemning the bombing attack on the Hebrew University, the \npresident of the American Council on Education, David Ward, took note \nof this significant aspect of the university. He wrote that: ``The \nHebrew University of Jerusalem has played a critical role in promoting \nco-existence between Israelis and Palestinians--as well as among people \nof all nationalities, religions and cultures. The terrible act at the \nMount Scopus campus was intended to prevent the type of human \ninteraction and discourse that can facilitate peaceful change in a more \ncomplex and challenging world.''\n  It is this kind of hopeful spirit that was so brutally and viciously \nassaulted in the murderous bombing attack that took place at the Hebrew \nUniversity's Frank Sinatra Student Center cafeteria on July 31, 2002.\n  This was more than another senseless terror attack, aimed at killing \nand maiming innocent people. It was an attack--knowingly or \nunknowingly--against everything that not just the Hebrew University but \nall of the free world holds dear.\n  Just as the American people are firm in their resolve not to allow \nthe perpetrators of September 11th to destroy our society or our \ncommitment to decency and peace, so too the people of Israel, including \nthe Hebrew University community, are determined not to lose heart \nbecause of those who would seek to destroy that spirit of humanity \nwhich has been so devotedly cultivated there over the years.\n  Hebrew University's President Magidor stated that this was ``an \nattack on understanding, tolerance and the quest for peace. [It] is a \ncrime not only against Israel or the Jewish people, it is a crime \nagainst the free and enlightened world.''\n  In the wake of this tragedy, President Magidor then asked himself \n``whether it still makes sense to strive for a peaceful society based \non reason and understanding.'' Given the circumstances, his conclusion \nis both remarkable and also a perfect summation for the ethos of this \ninstitution. He concluded his letter to The New York Times by stating \nthat ``the answer came to me clearly, and it is summarized by the \nHebrew word `davka'--`despite everything'.

In accordance with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice, stating that the emergency declared with respect to \nthe National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) is to \ncontinue in effect beyond September 26, 2002, to the Federal Register \nfor publication. The most recent notice continuing this emergency was \npublished in the Federal Register on September 25, 2001 (66 Fed. Reg. \n49084).\n  The circumstances that led to the declaration on September 26, 1993, \nof a national emergency have not been resolved. The actions and \npolicies of UNITA pose a continuing unusual and extraordinary threat to \nthe foreign policy of the United States. United Nations Security \nCouncil Resolutions 864 (1993), 1127 (1997), and 1173 (1998) continue \nto oblige all member states to maintain sanctions. Discontinuation of \nthe sanctions would have a prejudicial effect on the prospects for \npeace in Angola.

A bill to provide for adjustments to the Central Arizona \nProject in Arizona, to authorize the Gila River Indian Community water \nrights settlement to reauthorize and amend the Southern Arizona Water \nRights Settlement Act of 1982, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator McCain and myself I am \nintroducing legislation today that would codify the largest water \nclaims settlement in the history of Arizona. This bill represents the \ntremendous efforts of literally hundreds of people in Arizona and here \nin Washington over a period of five years. Looking ahead, this bill \ncould ultimately be nearly as important to Arizona's future as was the \nauthorization of the Central Arizona Project, CAP, itself.\n  Since Arizona began receiving CAP water from the Colorado River, \nlitigation has divided water users over how the CAP water should be \nallocated and exactly how much Arizona was required to repay the \nFederal Government. This bill will, among other things, codify the \nsettlement reached between the United States and the Central Arizona \nWater Conservation District over the State's repayment obligation for \ncosts incurred by the United States in constructing the Central Arizona \nProject. It will also resolve, once and for all, the allocation of all \nremaining CAP water. This final allocation will provide the stability \nnecessary for State water authorities to plan for Arizona's future \nwater needs. In addition, approximately 200,000 acre-feet of CAP water \nwill be made available to settle various Indian water claims in the \nState. The bill would also authorize the use of the Lower Colorado \nRiver Basin Development Fund, which is funded solely from revenues paid \nby Arizona entities, to construct irrigation works necessary for tribes \nwith congressionally approved water settlements to use CAP water.\n  Title II of this bill settles the water rights claims of the Gila \nRiver Indian Community. It allocates nearly 100,000 acre-feet of CAP \nwater to the Community, and provides funds to subsidize\n\n[[Page S9118]]\n\nthe costs of delivering CAP water and to construct the facilities \nnecessary to allow the Community to fully utilize the water allocated \nto it in this settlement. Title III provides for long-needed amendments \nto the 1982 Southern Arizona Water Settlement Act for the Tohono \nO'odham Nation, which has never been fully implemented.\n  This bill will allow Arizona cities to plan for the future, knowing \nhow much water they can count on. The Indian tribes will finally get \n``wet'' water, as opposed to the paper rights to water they have now, \nand projects to use the water. In addition, mining companies, farmers, \nand irrigation delivery districts can continue to receive water without \nthe fear that they will be stopped by Indian litigation.\n  While some minor issues remain, we have every confidence that these \nissues will be resolved before a hearing is scheduled. In addition, \nbefore the next Congress begins its work we hope that negotiations with \nthe San Carlos Apache Tribe, the only party not yet included in the \nsettlement, will move forward so that all claims can be resolved by \nthis bill.\n  In summary, this bill is vital to the citizens of Arizona and will \nprovide the certainty needed to move forward with water use decisions. \nFurthermore, the United States can avoid litigating water rights and \ndamage claims and satisfy its trust responsibilities to the Tribes. The \nparties have worked many years to reach consensus rather than litigate, \nand I believe this bill represents the best opportunity to achieve a \nfair result for all the people of Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator \nKyl, as a co-sponsor of this important legislation, the Arizona Water \nSettlements Act of 2002, which would ratify negotiated settlements for \nCentral Arizona Project, CAP, water allocations to municipalities, \nagricultural districts and Indian tribes, state CAP repayment \nobligations, and final adjudication of long-standing Indian water \nrights claims.\n  These settlements reflect five years of intensive negotiations by \nState, Federal, tribal, municipal, and private parties. I commend all \nthose involved in these negotiations for their extraordinary commitment \nand diligence to reach this final stage in the settlement process. I \nalso praise my colleague, Senator Jon Kyl, and Interior Secretary Gale \nNorton, for their leadership in facilitating these settlements. From my \nexperience in legislating past agreements, I recognize the enormous \nchallenge of these negotiations, and I appreciate their personal \ndedication to this settlement process.\n  This legislation is vitally important to Arizona's future because \nthese settlements will bring greater certainty and stability to \nArizona's water supply by completing the allocation of CAP water \nsupplies. Pending water rights claims by various Indian tribes and non-\nIndian users will be permanently settled as well as the repayment \nobligations of the state of Arizona for construction of the CAP.\n  I join with Senator Kyl today to express support for the agreements \nembodied in this bill and to encourage conclusion of this settlement \nprocess in the near future. Significant progress has been made in \nresolving key issues since we last sponsored a bill to facilitate this \nagreement in the 106th Congress. Some of these key issues pertain to \nthe final apportionment of CAP water supplies, cost-sharing of CAP \nconstruction and water delivery systems, amendment of the 1982 \nsettlement agreement with the Tohono O'odham Nation, mitigation \nmeasures necessitated by sustained drought conditions, and equitable \napportionment of drought shortages.\n  While this bill reflects agreements reached on a host of issues after \nan intensive and extended effort by the numerous parties involved, it \nis important to emphasize that this bill does not represent the final \nsettlement. All parties recognize that a very limited number of the \nprovisions of this bill may be modified as the negotiations continue. \nWe fully expect that the legislative process will culminate with a \nfinal agreement early in the next congressional session.\n  We introduce this bill today as an expression of our strong support \nof the various parties to successfully achieve conclusion to this \nprocess. The Arizona Water Settlements Act will be a historic \naccomplishment that will benefit all citizens of Arizona, the tribal \ncommunities, and the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 2993. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require \ninstitutions of higher education to preserve the educational status and \nfinancial resources of military personnel called to active duty; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, when the President gives the order to \nactivate Reservists and National Guardsmen, the lives of those men and \nwomen are put on hold. Businesses, careers, and families are left \nbehind so that America's interests may be served. Students make up a \nsubstantial part of our National Guard and Reserve forces. When these \nstudents are activated, it jeopardizes their academic standing, as well \nas their scholarships and grants. This bill would preserve their \nacademic standing for the duration of their service as well as a 1-year \nperiod that follows that service. It would also preserve their \nscholarships and grants, as well as entitle them to a refund of unused \ntuition and fees. Federal laws already safeguards the employment status \nof activated Reservists and Guardsmen. It is time that we extend the \nsame guarantee to students.\n  This legislation would require colleges, universities, and community \ncolleges to grant National Guardsmen and Reservists a leave of military \nabsence when they are called to active duty. This leave of absence \nwould last while the student is serving on active duty and a 1-year \nperiod at the conclusion of active service. This bill would preserve \nthe academic credits that the student had earned before being \nactivated. It would also preserve the scholarships and grants awarded \nto the student before being activated. Under this legislation, students \nwould be entitled to receive a refund of tuition and fees or credit the \ntuition and fees to the next period of enrollment after the student \nreturns from military leave. If a student elects to receive a refund, \nit would allow them to receive a full refund, minus the percentage of \ntime the student spent enrolled in classes.\n  The protections that are already afforded our Reservists and \nGuardsmen are appropriate considering the hardships they endure on the \nNation's behalf. We need to acknowledge the many college students who \nare in the ranks of the Guard and Reserve and extend to them the \nprotections they deserve. In this day of uncertainty on the world \nstage, our Reservists must be prepared to be called up at a moments \nnotice. Once they get to their duty station, they need to focus all of \ntheir attention on the mission. This legislation provides our student \nReservists with the proper safeguards on their academic career which \nwill allow them to accomplish their mission.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. LINCOLN:\n  S. 2994. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the immediate and permanent repeal of the estate tax on family-\nowned businesses and farms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, just over one year ago, when budget \nsurpluses reached over $5 trillion, Congress passed a tax cut bill \nthat, in part, began the process providing estate and gift tax relief. \nNow, in 2002, the surpluses have disappeared, and Congress is making no \nprogress on further estate tax relief. The reason for the stalemate is \nthat some will vote only for complete repeal, while others offer \ntargeted proposals based on prior tax laws that proved to be too \ncomplex and intrusive. In this environment, we are losing ground on \ncoming to a fair resolution of this issue, and in the meantime, the \ncurrent state of the law places many family-owned businesses in an \nuncertain and precarious position.\n  These are the same American-owned businesses that Congress initially \nsought to help when this effort began in the mid-1990's. Given these \ncircumstances, I believe we must explore new ways to immediately and \npermanently target relief for these businesses, which are so important \nto our American economy. My bill does not seek to change current law to \nrepeal the estate tax. It would leave in place\n\n[[Page S9119]]\n\nthe increases in the unified credit, the decreases in rates, and the \nrepeal of the estate tax in 2010. My bill would only seek to rectify \nthe special circumstances of family-owned businesses and farms, in an \nattempt, not to inflame the issue further, but to resolve this issue \nnow and forever for those this effort was originally intended to help.\n  A serious problem for family-owned businesses is the rollercoaster-\nride that current law places them on. Under the 2001 estate tax cut, \nfamily-owned businesses pay the estate tax until 2010 with modest \nreductions, and then the tax is completely repealed for one year. Then, \nin 2011, these businesses resume paying the tax at the high pre-2001 \nrates. Such a disparity in tax, depending on when one dies, causes \ngreat uncertainty for a business that must meet payroll, hire new \npeople, make new capital investments, and service debt. Under this tax \nregime, we have made business planning virtually impossible. These \nfamily-owned businesses deserve better.\n  In fashioning a targeted approach for family-owned businesses, it is \nimportant to learn from the important lessons of the past. The Lincoln \nbill recognizes these lessons and seeks to reflect a thoughtful \napproach, which includes the good lessons learned and avoids the bad \nones.\n  In 1995, Senator Dole and Senator Pryor introduced the Family \nBusiness Estate Relief Act, S. 1086. The government budget faced \ndeficits, so the sponsors took a targeted approach to estate tax relief \nfor family-owned businesses. Many in this body, on both sides of the \naisle, supported Senators Dole and Pryor in this effort. The bill was \nan instant hit with overwhelming bipartisan support, and the support of \nmost every small business trade association.\n  In 1997, the Qualified Family-Owned Business rules, in IRC Section \n2057, were enacted into law. During the debate on these new rules, \nsponsors of the bill stated their concern that family farms and \nbusinesses are too often forced out of business at the death of a key \nfamily member. While this liquidity concern was all too real, it \nspawned an inadequate solution.\n  Over the years since enactment, the Family-Owned Business rules were \nroundly and rightly criticized for their unnecessary complexity, \nintrusiveness into family decisions, and paltry tax benefit. Finally, \nin 2001, Congress threw in the towel on the targeted approach of \nSection 2057, and repealed it after 2004. This experience, in many \nways, poisoned the waters for estate tax relief for family-owned \nbusinesses, but I am confident we can do better.\n\n  So, I would like to propose an immediate and permanent plan for \nfamily-owned businesses. It is a targeted approach in times of budget \ndeficits, and it is a conceptual approach, which, in the past, has \ngarnered bipartisan support in times of political division. But given \nthe hard lessons learned by Section 2057, my bill is not complex or \nintrusive. For those who don't believe a targeted approach can work, I \nurge you to take a look and study the Lincoln bill to immediately and \npermanently repeal the estate tax for family owned farms and \nbusinesses.\n  Maybe one of the most important lessons learned is that the original \ngoal was too limiting. So we have broadened our focus and we make clear \nour new goal. Simply put, the goal of the Lincoln bill that no family-\nowned farm or business will ever pay the estate tax, the same as \npublicly held businesses, which face no estate tax liability. If we \nfocus merely on the liquidity of a family's estate, then we stop well \nshort of treating American family farms and businesses the same as the \nGE's, Citigroups, and Ciscos of the world. We can do better. We must do \nbetter. And we must do better sooner than 2010. And we cannot afford to \nrevert to pre-2001 law down the road. It is simply unacceptable.\n  With a new goal in mind, the Lincoln bill greatly simplifies the \nrules and delivers immediate and permanent repeal of the estate tax on \nfamily-owned businesses and farms. In doing so, the Lincoln bill throws \naway several troubling and burdensome provisions of Section 2057, \nincluding the 50-percent liquidity test, material participation rules \nfor heirs, the passive income test, and recapture tax provisions. \nFurther, the bill provides sensible working capital rules, to encourage \nfamily-owned businesses to grow, add new jobs, and make new capital \ninvestments.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill in the Record along \nwith a detailed description of ``What's Not in the Lincoln Bill'' which \ncontrasts this new proposal to Section 2057.\n  It is my hope that Americans who own family businesses will seriously \nconsider my bill and not dismiss it out of hand because of past \nfailures to target estate tax relief. I urge them to read my bill and \nconsider the possibility for estate tax relief for them that can be \ndone immediately and permanently.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2994\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

QFOBI--What's Not in the Lincoln Bill to Repeal the Estate Tax \n                      for Family-Owned Businesses\n\n       The Qualified Family-Owned Business rules, enacted in 1997, \n     have been roundly, and rightly, criticized for their \n     complexity and paltry tax benefit. Even more troubling, the \n     rules have been criticized for their intrusiveness into a \n     business owner's activities, and for their subjectivity, \n     which allow for large areas of disagreement with the IRS. \n     What went wrong with this effort to free family-owned \n     businesses from the estate tax?\n       In 1997, the primary concern expressed by proponents of \n     these rules was that family-owned farms and businesses are \n     ``too often forced out of businesses upon the death of a key \n     owner.'' While this concern was, and is, all to real, it does \n     not translate into a worthy goal on how we should treat \n     American family-owned farms and businesses.\n       Sure, the government should not force these businesses to \n     shut down, but the real point is that we must not stop there, \n     we must encourage them to grow, add new jobs, and make new \n     capital investments. In short, the 1997 qualified family-\n     owned business rules were well intentioned, but they yielded \n     a solution that is too limited and unworkable. So, we went \n     back to the drawing board, taking with us the lessons learned \n     from the qualified family-owned business rules.\n       The first task was to restate our concern and our goal. \n     Simply put, the reformulated goal of the Lincoln bill is that \n     no family-owned farm and business will ever pay the estate \n     tax. It is often stated that family-owned businesses are \n     subject to an estate tax that can reach over one-half the \n     value of the business. This is true, but on top of this \n     liability, a family-owned business is subject to estate tax \n     liability each time that one generation passes the business \n     to another generation. So, a family-owned business can pay \n     the estate tax more than once over its lifetime.\n       In contrast, publicly held companies are never impacted by \n     the estate tax. At the very least, we should treat family-\n     owned businesses the same as publicly owned businesses life \n     GE, IBM, and Cisco, which face no estate tax liability. Thus, \n     our goal should be that no family-owned farm or business will \n     ever pay the estate tax.\n       In pursuit of this goal, the Lincoln bill sheds many of the \n     unnecessary and complex provisions under current law, and in \n     doing so, it provides our best chance to enact immediate and \n     permanent repeal of the estate tax for America's family owned \n     farms and businesses.\n       The Lincoln bill includes the following improvements to \n     current law:\n       1. Elimination of the Dollar Limitation on the Tax Benefit. \n     Since the goal of the Lincoln bill is that no family-owned \n     business will ever pay the estate tax, it places no arbitrary \n     dollar or size limit on family-owned businesses. A deceased \n     taxpayer's estate may elect to treat an unlimited portion of \n     the decendent's estate as Carryover Business Interest, COBI. \n     A COBI remains subject to all income and capital gain taxes \n     with no basis adjustment.\n       Family-owned businesses, regardless of size, will be \n     treated the same as their publicly held competitors, and \n     thus, the economic disadvantage and distortion created by the \n     estate tax on family-owned businesses would be eliminated.\n       2. Elimination of the 50-Percent Qualification Requirement. \n     The principal argument in the past for repeal of the estate \n     tax is its potential for forcing liquidation of a family-\n     owned farm or business. Pursuant to this concern, the law, \n     passed in 1997, created an extremely complex requirement that \n     the value of the business must be at least 50 percent of the \n     decedent's gross estate. Under this theory, it was presumed \n     that a decedent's estate could afford to pay the tax if the \n     business makes up 49 percent of the estate, but not if it is \n     50 percent of the estate. This example highlights the folly \n     of this requirement, but it also demonstrates the importance \n     of estate tax planning techniques in order to comply and \n     receive the tax benefit. In the end, such a rule creates \n     inequities among similarly situated taxpayers and benefits \n     those with the best tax planning advise. Such incentives \n     should be reduced whenever possible.\n       Under the Lincoln bill, this arbitrary requirement is \n     eliminated, so that no family-owned farm or business would \n     ever pay the estate tax, regardless of the portion of the \n     estate that is comprised of the family-owned business. All \n     family-owned businesses will no longer be required to shut \n     down or plan to pay the estate tax. Instead, these businesses \n     can increase working capital for expansion. The elimination \n     of this requirement will also dramatically reduce complexity \n     in the tax code and the subjectivity associated with the \n     administration of the provision by the IRS.\n       3. Elimination of the Material Participation Requirements \n     for Heirs. The material participation standard requires the \n     IRS to measure a family member's activities on an hour-to-\n     hour basis. This qualified family-owned business rules use \n     this standard such that the IRS is required to monitor the \n     activities of the heir for 10 years. This standard has been \n     widely criticized as too intrusive. This may be the \n     understatement of the year, and on top of that, it is an \n     outrageous requirement the IRS could never effectively carry \n     out if we wanted them to do so. Under the Lincoln bill, an \n     heir is not required to participate in the business. Still, \n     if he or she decides to sell or dispose of the COBI, capital \n     gains and income taxes will continue to be payable and \n     calculated using the decedent's carryover basis. But the \n     estate tax will never put them out of business.\n       4. Elimination of the Recapture Provisions. Since the \n     Lincoln bill does not require heirs to participate, recapture \n     provisions are not necessary and therefore eliminated. The \n     absence of these complex, arbitrary, and intrusive provisions \n     eliminates the need for the IRS to monitor the daily \n     activities of an heir for 10 years, a clearly intrusive \n     requirement under current law.\n\n[[Page S9122]]\n\n       5. Elimination of Passive Income Test. Under current law, a \n     family owned business does not qualify for the tax benefit if \n     more than 35 percent of its adjusted gross income is passive \n     income in the tax year, which includes the decedent's date of \n     death. This chance one-year arbitrary measurement of passive \n     income is an insufficient and unreliable test of whether a \n     family owned business has active business income. Further, \n     the test is unnecessary in the face of a reasonable and \n     workable passive asset test, as included in the Lincoln bill. \n     See 6 below.\n       6. Modification of the Working Capital Rules. Under current \n     law, a qualified family owned business may not hold cash or \n     marketable securities in excess of the day-to-day working \n     capital needs of the business. This rule does not recognize \n     that family-owned businesses must retain liquid funds to \n     expand by incurring debt or acquiring another business.\n       The Lincoln bill provides a standard that allows family \n     owned businesses to retire debt and expand without facing the \n     burden of the imposition of the estate tax. The standard \n     under the Lincoln bill would allow the family owned business \n     to own cash and securities ``reasonably anticipated business \n     needs.'' This standard is well established under current law, \n     regulations, and IRS audit guidelines.\n       In any event, in order to prevent any pre-death \n     ``stuffing,'' cash or marketplace securities shall be treated \n     as passive assets if such cash or marketplace securities are \n     transferred to the entity with 3 years of the decedent's date \n     of death in any event. On the flip side, the IRS shall have \n     the authority to increase the value of the COBI by that \n     portion of those assets transferred from the COBI to the \n     taxable estate within 3 years before the decedent's death.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOLLINGS (for himself and Mr. Cleland):\n  S. 2995. A bill to improve economic opportunity and development in \ncommunities that are dependent on tobacco production, and for other \npurposes, to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that the \ndistinguished Senator from Georgia, Mr. Cleland, and I are sponsoring \nto assist rural farming communities that have become dependent on \ntobacco in finding ways to diversify.\n  Right to the point: The tobacco program as we know it today is not \nsustainable for tobacco producers or the communities that have become \ndependent on tobacco for their standard of living. For too many years, \ntoo many people in this Chamber ignored the problem of the tobacco \nprogram, while addressing every other farm issue under the sun, and we \nnow run the risk of putting tobacco farmers out of business with no \nconcern for the impacts on rural communities. It is in the best \ninterest of not only tobacco farmers and their communities, but of the \nfuture health of Americans, to pass this legislation\n  South Carolina has about 2,000 honest, hard-working tobacco farmers \nwho, of late, can't make ends meet because the demand for tobacco is \ndown so far. It's not that everyone in the world has all of a sudden \nstopped using tobacco. It's that American companies are using foreign-\ngrown tobacco. It's cheaper for corporations to go to Brazil, or China, \nor Vietnam, than to buy tobacco from South Carolina or Georgia. The \nsame thing that happened to textile workers in this country is now \nhappening to our farmers, who have bills to pay, and children to send \nto college, and everything else like that.\n  In addition to low demand, farmers are in trouble because of past \nFederal policies intended to encourage farmers to get out of this \nbusiness, which have instead led them to totally rely on tobacco. At \nthe recommendation of the President's Tobacco Commission, we need to \nkick the habit of quota subsidies for tobacco farmers or this charade \nwill never end.\n  Any legislation that fails to focus on the tobacco problem as a \ncommunity, is not dealing with the problem as a whole. We have to help \ntobacco communities diversify their economic base, or they will plummet \ninto further economic distress. This legislation provides these \ncommunities with the tools to attract new industries and, thus, new and \ndifferent kinds of jobs for the area. We can't expect to buy farmers \nout, try to take care of them with a short-term fix, and not take care \nof the communities' long-term future.\n  This legislation does just that by making quota buy outs for farmers \nmandatory, offering special incentives for growers who transition their \nland from tobacco production and providing meaningful community \nassistance to bring economic development and diversify the rural \neconomy.\n  Obviously, every one in this Chamber will want to know: how will we \npay for it? What will these buyouts cost a government that this year is \nrunning a $412 billion budget deficit? It will not cost the American \ntaxpayer a single dime. I will be paid for by fees assessed on \nmanufacturers based on market share. We used a similar funding \nmechanism in the LEAF Act that had the full support of tobacco growing \nstates.\n  When you come right down to it, this is a balancing act to fix a \nbroken farm program without decimating rural communities and without \ncost to the American taxpayer. This is as balanced a way as Senator \nCleland and I know how to deal with this. The legislation has the \nsupport of the health care community and the tobacco growers alike. We \nhave received letters of support from the Alliance for Health Economic \nand Agriculture Development, the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, the \nSouth Carolina Tobacco Growers Association, the South Carolina Farm \nBureau, Flue-Cured Tobacco Cooperative Stabilization Corporation, and \nthe Burley Tobacco Growers Cooperative Association. We urge your \nsupport.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself, Mr. Sessions, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 2996. A bill to amend title 11, United States Code, to limit the \nvalue of certain real and personal property that a debtor may elect to \nexempt under State or local law, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Bankruptcy \nAbuse Reform Act of 2002. The Senate is very familiar with the issue of \nthe homestead exemption. We have voted to close the homestead loophole \nin each of the past three Congresses. Each and every time, the Senate \nstrongly supported our proposal to close the homestead loophole and \nprohibit wealthy debtors from moving to Florida or Texas to shield \ntheir multi-million dollar mansions from their creditors.\n  In practical terms, the unlimited homestead exemption means that a \nperson can declare bankruptcy in Houston, for example, wipe out most of \ntheir debts, but shield from creditors a house worth an infinite \namount. Our amendment will generously cap the homestead exemption at \n$125,000, that is, it permits a debtor to keep $125,000 of equity in \nhis or her home after declaring bankruptcy.\n  This provision should be law by now. Unfortunately, the politics of \nthe bankruptcy bill generally and this provision specifically have \nprevented the homestead loophole from being closed once and for all. \nDuring the course of this debate, we accepted a compromise that was \nweaker than we would have wanted, but would get at the worst abusers. \nIt was not all that we wanted, nor was it that is needed, but is was a \ngood first step.\n  To those that argue that the compromise that we agreed to is enough, \nwe say it only got at some of the abusers who will use this provision \nin the law. Certainly, no matter how well we draft it, we will not be \nable to anticipate everything that some clever lawyer or devious debtor \nwill think of to find a way around it. The only way to ensure that no \ndebtor will be able to take advantage of this loophole is for the \nCongress to pass a hard cap. Only then can we be certain that the \nloophole would be closed once and for all.\n  It appears now, however, that the bankruptcy reform bill has stalled \nand may not be considered before the Congress adjourns for the year. It \nwould be a miscarriage of justice to permit the year to end without \naddressing the most scandalous abuse of the bankruptcy laws in an era \nwhen numerous corporate executives will surely use the homestead \nexemption to protect millions of dollars from their creditors.\n  The country has been stunned recently by stories of corporate \nmalfeasance, insider dealing, and fraud. And, not by fly-by-night \ncompanies, but rather the worst wrongdoing went on in companies that \nwere entrusted with the nest eggs of millions of Americans in pension \nplans and mutant funds. Those investments have been lost. And, yet \nthere is every chance that the people who caused these nightmares may \nwalk away from their misdeeds and seek shelter in their luxury homes.\n\n[[Page S9123]]\n\n  Whether we are discussing Ken Lay's $7.1 million, 13,000 square foot \ncondominium or Andrew Fastow's newly built multi-million dollar home in \none of Houston's swankiest neighborhoods, or Scott Sullivan's $15 \nmillion estate in Boca Raton, one thing is clear; these former \nexecutives must not be permitted to continue to live like kings in \nbankruptcy while their former employees are looking for their next \npaycheck.\n  Debtors should not be able to avoid their creditors through luck of \ngeography or through strategic bankruptcy planning. The bottom line is \nthat bankruptcy must be a refuge of last resort, not a financial \nplanning tool for Ken Lay, Scott Sullivan or a host of others. It would \nbe a shame if this Congress were not able to close the most egregious \nabuse of all in the bankruptcy laws. It is time to close the homestead \nexemption loophole once and for all.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Bankruptcy Abuse Reform \nAct of 2002 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2996\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reauthorize the Child Abuse Prevention and \nTreatment Act, the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act, the \nChild Abuse Prevention and Treatment and Adoption Reform Act of 1978, \nand the Abandoned Infants Assistance Act of 1988, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from New \nHampshire, Senator Gregg, to introduce the Keeping Children and \nFamilies Safe Act. We are pleased to be joined by Senators Kennedy, \nCollins, Wellstone, and DeWine.\n  Child abuse and neglect continue to be significant problems in the \nUnited States. Recent reports present startling indications of child \nmaltreatment in the United States.\n  About 3 million referrals concerning the welfare of about 5 million \nchildren were made to Child Protection Services, CPS, agencies \nthroughout the Nation in 2000. Of these referrals, about two-thirds, 62 \npercent, were ``screened-in'' for further assessment and investigation. \nProfessionals, including teachers, law enforcement officers, social \nservice workers, and physicians made more than half, 56 percent, of the \nscreened-in reports. About 879,000 children were found to be victims of \nchild maltreatment. About two-thirds, 63 percent, suffered neglect, \nincluding medical neglect; 19 percent were physically abused; 10 \npercent were sexually abused; and 8 percent were emotionally \nmaltreated.\n  Many of these children fail to receive adequate protection and \nservices. Nearly half, 45 percent, of these children failed to receive \nservices.\n  The most tragic consequence of child maltreatment is death. The April \nmaltreatment summary data released by the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, HHS, shows that about 1,200 children died of abuse and \nneglect in 2000. Children younger than six years of age accounted for \n85 percent of child fatalities and children younger than one year of \nage accounted for 44 percent of child fatalities.\n  Child abuse is not a new phenomenon. For more than a decade, numerous \nreports have called attention to the tragic abuse and neglect of \nchildren and the inadequacy of our Child Protection Services, CPS, \nsystems to protect our children.\n  In 1990, the U.S. Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect concluded \nthat ``child abuse and neglect is a national emergency.'' In 1995, the \nU.S. Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect reported that ``State \nand local CPS caseworkers are often overextended and cannot adequately \nfunction under their current caseloads.'' The report also stated that, \n``in many jurisdictions, caseloads are so high that CPS response is \nlimited to taking the complaint call, making a single visit to the \nhome, and deciding whether or not the complaint is valid, often without \nany subsequent monitoring of the family.''\n  A 1997 General Accounting Office, GAO, report found, ``the CPS system \nis in crisis, plagued by difficult problems, such as growing caseloads, \nincreasingly complex social problems and underlying child maltreatment, \nand ongoing systemic weaknesses in day-to-day operations.'' According \nto GAO, CPS weaknesses include ``difficulty in maintaining a skilled \nworkforce; the inability to consistently follow key policies and \nprocedures designed to protect children; developing useful case data \nand record-keeping systems, such as automated case management; and \nestablishing good working relationships with the courts.''\n  According to the May 2001 ``Report from the Child Welfare Workforce \nSurvey: State and County Data and Findings'' conducted by the American \nPublic Human Services Association, APHSA, the Child Welfare League of \nAmerica, CWLA, and the Alliance for Children and Families, annual staff \nturnover is high and morale is low among CPS workers. The report found \nthat CPS workers had an annual turnover rate of 22 percent, 76 percent \nhigher than the turnover rate for total agency staff. The \n``preventable'' turnover rate was 67 percent, or two-thirds higher than \nthe rate for all other direct service workers and total agency staff. \nIn some States, 75 percent or more of staff turnovers were preventable.\n  States rated a number of retention issues as highly problematic. In \ndescending order they are: workloads that are too high and/or \ndemanding; caseloads that are too high; too much worker time spent on \ntravel, paperwork, courts, and meetings; workers not feeling valued by \nthe agency; low salaries; supervision problems; and insufficient \nresources for families and children.\n  To prevent turnover and retain quality CPS staff, some States have \nbegun to increase in-service training, increase education \nopportunities, increase supervisory training, increase or improve \norientation, increase worker safety, and offer flex-time or changes in \noffice hours. Most States, however, continue to grapple with staff \nturnover and training issues.\n  Continued public criticism of CPS efforts, continued frustration by \nCPS staff and child welfare workers, and continued abuse and neglect, \nand death, of our Nation's children, served as the backdrop as we \nsought to draft a CAPTA reauthorization bill this year.\n  The Child Protection System mission must focus on the safety of \nchildren. To ensure that the system works as intended, CPS needs to be \nappropriately staffed. The staff need to receive appropriate training \nand cross-training to better recognize substance abuse and domestic \nviolence problems. Triage can help in communities with numerous abuse \nreports so that those reports where children are most at-risk of \nimminent harm can be prioritized. More collaborations in communities \nbetween CPS, health agencies, including mental health agencies, \nschools, and community-based groups can help to strengthen families. \nPrevention programs and activities to prevent child abuse and neglect \nfor families at-risk can improve the likelihood that a child will grow \nup in a home without violence, abuse, or neglect.\n  Beyond the CAPTA title of this legislation, our bill reauthorizes the \nFamily Violence Prevention and Services Act, including the creation of \na new program to address the needs of children\n\n[[Page S9124]]\n\nwho witness domestic violence, the Adoption Opportunities Act, and the \nAbandoned Infants Assistance Act.\n  There is not much time before Congress adjourns for the session. And \nthere are many outstanding issues for Congress to address. Child \nprotection ought not be a partisan issue. I urge my colleagues to join \nus in supporting this bill and to strengthen child protection laws \nbefore we adjourn for the year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be printed in the \nRecord, followed by the text of the bill.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n          Keeping Children and Families Safe Act Brief Summary\n\n       The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, CAPTA, \n     authorizes research and demonstration projects related to \n     preventing and treating child abuse and neglect, grants to \n     States to improve child protection systems and, grants to \n     support community-based family resource and support services. \n     Authorization for CAPTA expired with FY2001 but Congress has \n     continued to fund its programs.\n       Reauthorizes CAPTA with increased funding. The bill would \n     reauthorize CAPTA through FY2007 and authorized $200 million \n     for CAPTA programs. The FY2002 appropriation for CAPTA \n     programs was $81.6 million.\n       Encourages new training and better qualifications for child \n     and family service workers. The bill would recommend grants \n     for a variety of training programs and research activities \n     designed to improve training to child protective services and \n     other child and family service workers, including \n     supervisors. Suggested projects include: training workers on \n     how to best work with families from initial investigation \n     through treatment; cross-training to better recognize \n     neglect, domestic violence or substance abuse in a family; \n     training to strengthen linkages between Child Protection \n     Services (CPS) and health agencies including physical and \n     mental health services; and to promote partnerships that \n     offer creative approaches to meet the needs of abused \n     children; as well as training for CPS workers on their legal \n     duties. The bill would also encourage attention to staff \n     recruitment and retention issues.\n       Encourages links between agencies to improve services to \n     children. The bill would seek to create or improve links \n     between child protection services and education, health, \n     mental health, and judicial systems to ensure that children \n     who are abused and neglected are properly identified and \n     receive referrals to appropriate services. It would further \n     encourage greater collaboration between child protective \n     services and the juvenile justice system to ensure that \n     children who move between these two systems do so smoothly \n     and receive appropriate services. In addition, the bill would \n     promote partnerships between public agencies and community-\n     based organizations to provide child abuse and neglect \n     prevention and treatment programs. The bill would also \n     require States, as a condition of receiving State grant \n     money, to have policies and procedures to have triage for the \n     referral of a child not at imminent risk of harm to a \n     community or voluntary child maltreatment prevention service; \n     to improve the training, retention, and supervision of \n     caseworkers; to address the needs of infants who have been \n     prenatally exposed to illegal substances, including referral \n     to CPS and other services; to have provisions requiring CPS \n     workers to inform individuals of child maltreatment \n     allegations made against them; and to perform background \n     checks on all adults in prospective foster care households.\n       Strengths and expands the National Child Abuse \n     Clearinghouse. The role of the National Child Abuse \n     Clearinghouse would be strengthened and expanded to not only \n     maintain information about effective child abuse prevention \n     programs, but also to maintain information about best \n     practices used for improving CPS and best practices for \n     making referrals related to addressing the physical, \n     developmental, and health needs of abused and neglected \n     children.\n       Broadens access to technical assistance and grant funds. \n     CAPTA currently authorize the Department of Health and Human \n     Services, HHS, to fund certain kinds of child maltreatment \n     related demonstration programs and to provide certain \n     technical assistance. In general, grants or contracts may be \n     made with public and nonprofit private entities. The bill \n     would allow for-profit private entities to access technical \n     assistance and to operate HHS-funded demonstration programs.\n       Strengthens local oversight. States are now required to \n     appoint citizen review panels to oversee the policies and \n     procedures of State and local child protection service \n     agencies. The bill would require these panels to also study \n     agency ``practices,'' do public outreach and allow for public \n     comment, and include recommendations for changes in an annual \n     report to the State. States would be required to make a \n     written response regarding whether or how they will \n     incorporate the recommendations to improve the State and \n     local child protection systems.\n       Requires new study. The bill would require HHS to conduct \n     the 4th National Incidence Study of Child Abuse and Neglect \n     and to report its findings within 4 years of enactment of the \n     legislation. The last National Incidence Study was conducted \n     in 1993.\n       Revises Title II Community-Based Family Resource and \n     Support Grants. The bill revises Title II to support \n     community-based efforts to develop, operate, enhance, and \n     where appropriate, to network, initiatives aimed at the \n     prevention of child abuse and neglect and supports \n     coordinated resources and activities to better strengthen and \n     support families to reduce the likelihood of child abuse and \n     neglect.\n       Title II reauthorizes the Family Violence Prevention and \n     Services Act (FVPSA), which provides assistance to states, \n     Tribes, and Tribal organizations to assist in efforts to \n     increase public awareness about family violence and provide \n     immediate shelter and related assistance to victims of family \n     violence and their children. The reauthorization: extends the \n     authorization of existing programs to 2007; repeals three \n     programs: The Family Member Abuse and Documentation Project, \n     Model State Leadership Grants, and the Youth Education and \n     Domestic Violence Program; increases the authorization for \n     the National Domestic Violence Hotline to $5 million; carves \n     out 10 percent of State Grant funds for State Domestic \n     Violence Coalitions; allows for the Secretary to retain \n     administrative funds to implement and evaluate FVPSA \n     programs; establishes a highly secure electronic network to \n     link domestic violence shelters and service providers and the \n     National Domestic Violence Hotline on a confidential website. \n     The website would provide a continuously updated list of \n     shelter availability anywhere in the United States at any \n     time and would provide comprehensive information describing \n     the services each shelter provides such as medical, social \n     and bilingual services. It would also provide internet access \n     to shelters that do not have appropriate technology; creates \n     the Children Exposed to Domestic Violence Program to provide \n     funds for: shelters and other domestic violence service \n     providers to run programs to address the physical, emotional \n     and logistical needs of children who enter programs with \n     their mothers who are abused; training of child welfare, and \n     where appropriate, court and law enforcement personnel to \n     assist them in addressing cases where child abuse and \n     domestic violence intersect; and, nonprofit agencies to bring \n     various service providers together to design and implement \n     intervention programs for children who witness domestic \n     violence.\n       Makes several technical corrections to the bill.\n       Title III of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment and \n     Adoption Reform Act of 1978, as amended (Public Law 95-266) \n     authorizes the Adoption Opportunities Program. The program is \n     intended to eliminate barriers to adoption and to provide \n     permanent homes for children who would benefit from adoption, \n     particularly special needs children and disabled infants with \n     life-threatening conditions.\n       Seeks to eliminate interjurisdictional barriers to \n     adoption. As part of a revised and updated findings section, \n     the bill would explicitly include the elimination of \n     jurisdictional barriers to adoption. It notes that the \n     Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 prohibited delay or \n     denial of placement of a child across jurisdictional lines, \n     where an appropriate adoptive family was available. The bill \n     would require the Secretary of HHS to fund public or private \n     entities, including States, to eliminate barriers to placing \n     children for adoption across jurisdictional lines. Purposes \n     of this funding would include: developing a uniform homestudy \n     standard and protocols for acceptance of homestudies between \n     States and jurisdictions; developing models of financing \n     cross-jurisdictional placements; expanding capacity of all \n     adoption exchanges to serve increasing numbers of children, \n     including older children least likely to currently be \n     adopted; developing training materials and training social \n     workers on preparing and moving children across State lines; \n     and developing and supporting models for networking among \n     agencies, adoption exchanges, and parent support groups \n     across jurisdictional boundaries.\n       Within one year of enactment, the bill would require HHS, \n     in consultation with the General Accounting Office, to \n     facilitate interjurisdictional adoption of foster children. \n     Separately, the bill would also make interjurisdictional \n     adoption issues, including financing and best practices, a \n     part of a larger study HHS would be required to conduct on \n     adoption placements. Current law generally allows HHS to fund \n     services provided by public and nonprofit private agencies \n     only. The bill generally allows HHS to include for-profit \n     agencies among eligible grantees.\n       Increases funding for Adoption Opportunities grants. The \n     current authorization for Adoption Opportunities is $20 \n     million. The bill would increase the authorization to $40 \n     million for FY2003 and such sums as necessary for FY2004-\n     FY2007. (The Adoption Opportunities program received an \n     appropriation of $27.4 million for FY2002.)\n       The Abandoned Infants Assistance Act of 1988, as amended, \n     Public Law 100-505, authorizes demonstration grants to public \n     and private nonprofit agencies for activities such as \n     preventing the abandonment of infants, identifying and \n     addressing the needs of abandoned infants, recruiting and \n     training foster families for abandoned children, providing \n     residential care for infants and young children who cannot \n     live with their families or be placed in foster care, \n     providing respite\n\n[[Page S9125]]\n\n     care for families and foster families, and recruiting and \n     training health and social services personnel to work with \n     abandoned children.\n       Broadens priority for services. Under current law grantees \n     must ensure priority for their services is given to abandoned \n     infants and young children who are HIV-infected, perinatally \n     exposed to HIV, or perinatally drug-exposed. The bill would \n     maintain priority service for these children but would also \n     broaden the priority category to include abandoned infants \n     and young children who have ``life threatening illness[es]'' \n     or ``other special medical need[s].''\n       Requires studies. The bill would require that HHS conduct a \n     study that: estimates the number of infants and young \n     children who are relinquished, abandoned or found deceased in \n     the United States and the number of young children who are \n     HIV positive, have a life-threatening illness or other \n     special medical need, or have been perinatally exposed to HIV \n     or a dangerous drug; estimates the annual number of infants \n     and young children who are victims of homicide; determines \n     the characteristics of parents who have abandoned a child \n     within a year of the child's birth; and estimates the annual \n     costs incurred by all levels of government to provide housing \n     and care for abandoned infants and young children.\n       The bill would further require HHS to report findings of \n     this study to Congress not later than 36 months after \n     enactment of the legislation. Separately, HHS would be \n     required to evaluate and report on effective intervention \n     methods to prevent abandonment of children and effective ways \n     of responding to the needs of abandoned children.\n       Increases funds for Abandonment Infants Assistance grants. \n     The current authorization for Abandoned Infants Assistance is \n     $35 million. The bill would increase authorization to $45 \n     million for FY2003 and such sums as necessary for FY2004-\n     FY2007. The Abandoned Infants Assistance program received an \n     appropriation of $12.2 million for FY2002.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                S. 2998\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to join my \ncolleagues in introducing the Keeping Children and Families Safe Act of \n2002.\n  This bipartisan bill authorizes funding and programs that support \nmore than 870,000 children in this country who are victims of child \nabuse and neglect each year. It is essential to do all we can to see \nthat these very vulnerable children are protected and feel safe, in \nspite of the abuse and neglect they have suffered.\n\n[[Page S9135]]\n\n  Every year in America, local child protective service agencies \nrespond to approximately 3 million reports of child abuse or neglect. \nAccording to Prevent Child Abuse America, this problem costs the U.S. \nover $9 billion a year in direct and indirect costs. We owe it to the \nNation's children to provide more effective prevention and treatment \nservices.\n  Often these children are caught up in a system that fails to protect \nthem today. Nearly half of the children in substantiated cases of abuse \nreceive no followup services. We can and must do better. Our bill will \nprovide funding for grants to community-based and prevention-focused \nprograms and activities to prevent child abuse and neglect.\n  In 2000, approximately 1,100 children died of abuse and neglect. \nEight-five percent of these children were younger than 6. We know that \nearly identification of risk and timely intervention can reduce abuse. \nOne major prevention strategy shown to work is good parent education.\n  Effective action also means preparing those who investigate \nallegations of child abuse to assess the risk and ensure appropriate \nfollowup, so that children receive the medical and emotional treatment \nthey need.\n  Included in this bill is Senator Wellstone's Children Who Witness \nViolence Act. This legislation is long overdue and very important in \nconfronting the impact of domestic violence on children. It addresses \nthe issue form multiple perspectives by supporting the development of \nintervention program for children who witness domestic violence. It \ntakes advantage of local resources such as counselors, courts, schools, \nhealth care providers and battered women's programs to address the \nneeds of children in violent homes.\n  Witnessing domestic violence directly affects school achievement. \nThese children have higher levels of impaired concentration and poor \nschool attendance. They are often labeled as underachievers and have \ndifficulties in cognitive and academic functioning.\n  Research demonstrates that the effects of abuse can continue long \nafter the bruises fade. We need to do much more to prevent abuse and \nhelp abused children find a way out of violence. I urge my colleagues \nto support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. \n        Specter):\n  S. 3000. A bill to enhance and further research into paralysis and to \nimprove rehabilitation and the quality of life for persons living with \nparalysis and other physical disabilities, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nBrownback, Kennedy, and Specter today in introducing legislation that \nwill provide hope to Americans living with paralysis.\n  Recent news reports about the medical miracle Christopher Reeve has \nexperienced this past year are an inspiration for every American living \nwith paralysis as a result of a spinal cord injury. When it was \nannounced that, for the firs time since his accident in 1995, Chris was \nable to wiggle his fingers and toes, there was hope for some of the two \nmillion Americans living with paralysis.\n  Today, through the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Act of 2002, we seek \nto achieve two primary goals. First to further advance the science \nneeded to help those living with paralysis take their next step. And \nsecond, to time build quality of life programs throughout the country \nthat will further advance full participation, independent living, self-\nsufficiency and equality of opportunity for individuals with paralysis \nand other physical disabilities.\n  Chris' recovery and recent scientific evidence show that there is \nhope for those living with paralysis . At research centers in the \nUnited States, Europe and Japan, new techniques of rigorous exercise \nhave helped an estimated 500 persons with paraplegic with limited \nsensations in their lower bodies walk for short distances, unassisted \nor using walkers.\n  While the results of these new methods are quite miraculous, the \nlimits of what physical exercise can do for patients remains grossly \nunderstudied. While each person and each injury in unique, and some \npeople recover spontaneously, an estimated 200,000 Americans are living \nwith spinal cord injuries that have not improved. Which therapy or \ncombination of therapies will work for each person is unknown. Today 2 \nmillion Americans are living with paralysis, including spinal cord \ninjury, stroke, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, ALS and spina \nbifida. We need research to see how these new interventions work on the \nentire population on individuals living with paralysis.\n  What we do know is the ordinary repetitive motions used in most \nrehabilitation centers, like squeezing a ball, are almost certainly not \nenough to appropriately address neurological injuries.\n  Patients are usually told that after one year, two at the most, they \nwill never make further progress in their abilities to move or feel \nsensation. Yet seven years after his accident, through a rigorous \nexercise plan, Chris Reeve is finally seeking results.\n  Due to efforts led by the National Institutes of Health and the \nChristopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation, our nation stands on the brink \nof amazing breakthroughs in science for those living with paralysis. \nHowever, the biotech and pharmaceutical industries have not invested in \nparalysis research because they believe the market does not support the \nprivate investment. There is an urgent need for the federal government \nto further step up its commitment in this area. The Christopher Reeve \nParalysis Act would do just that.\n  By establishing Paralysis Research Consortia at the National \nInstitute on Neurological Disorders and Stoke, we can substantially \nincrease our ability to capitalize on research advances in paralysis. \nThese consortia would be formed to explore unique scientific expertise \nand focus across the existing research centers at NINDS in an effort to \nfurther advance treatments, therapies and developments on one or more \nforms of paralysis that result from central nervous system trauma and \nstroke.\n  Additional breakthrough are under way in rehabilitation research on \nparalysis. Federal funding for rehabilitation research at the National \nCenter for Medical Rehabilitation Research at NIH is showing real \npotential to improve functional mobility; prevent secondary \ncomplications like bladder and urinary tract infections and ulcers; and \nto develop improved assistive technology. These rehabilitation \ninterventions have the potential to greatly reduce pain and suffering \nfor those suffering from neurological disorders and str9oke and, at the \nsame time, save millions in health care expenditures.\n  Over the past 20 years, overall days in the hospital and \nrehabilitation centers for those living with paralysis have been cut in \nhalf. Those living with paralysis face astronomical medical costs, and \nour best estimates tell us that only one-third of those individuals \nremain employed after paralysis. At least one-third of those living \nwith paralysis have income of $15,000 or less.\n  To date, there are no State-based programs at CDC that address \nparalysis and other physical disability with the goal of improving \nhealth outcomes and prevent secondary complications. This bill will, \nfor the first time, ensure that individuals living with paralysis get \nthe information they need; have access to public health programs; and \nsupport in their communities to navigate services. Ultimately these \nprograms will help remove the barriers to community participation and \nhelp improve quality of life. The bill also establishes hospital-based \nregistries on paralysis to collect needed data on the true numbers of \nindividuals with these conditions, and it invests in population-based \nresearch to see how individuals are faring.\n  We are on the brink of major breakthroughs for individuals impacted \nby neurological disorders and stroke that result in paralysis. This \nbill will ensure that the federal government does it part to help more \nthan 2 million Americans.\n  When Christopher Reeve was injured, he put a face on an issue that \nhas been neglected for too long. Since then, his tireless efforts to \nwalk again, coupled with his passion and commitment to improve quality \nof life for others living with paralysis, make him a role model for \neveryone.\n\n[[Page S9136]]\n\n  It is a pleasure, and an honor to lead a bipartisan group of \nSenators, along with the support of number of disability groups, \nincluding the American Stroke Association, the American Heart \nAssociation, the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation, the National \nFamily Caregivers Association, the National Spinal Cord Injury \nAssociation, Paralyzed Veterans of America and Eastern Paralyzed \nVeterans, in introducing this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/24/senate-section/article/S9123-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9123-S9136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Collins, \n        Mr. Wellstone, and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 2998. A bill to reauthorize the Child Abuse Prevention and \nTreatment Act, the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act, the \nChild Abuse Prevention and Treatment and Adoption Reform Act of 1978, \nand the Abandoned Infants Assistance Act of 1988, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from New \nHampshire, Senator Gregg, to introduce the Keeping Children and \nFamilies Safe Act. We are pleased to be joined by Senators Kennedy, \nCollins, Wellstone, and DeWine.\n  Child abuse and neglect continue to be significant problems in the \nUnited States. Recent reports present startling indications of child \nmaltreatment in the United States.\n  About 3 million referrals concerning the welfare of about 5 million \nchildren were made to Child Protection Services, CPS, agencies \nthroughout the Nation in 2000. Of these referrals, about two-thirds, 62 \npercent, were ``screened-in'' for further assessment and investigation. \nProfessionals, including teachers, law enforcement officers, social \nservice workers, and physicians made more than half, 56 percent, of the \nscreened-in reports. About 879,000 children were found to be victims of \nchild maltreatment. About two-thirds, 63 percent, suffered neglect, \nincluding medical neglect; 19 percent were physically abused; 10 \npercent were sexually abused; and 8 percent were emotionally \nmaltreated.\n  Many of these children fail to receive adequate protection and \nservices. Nearly half, 45 percent, of these children failed to receive \nservices.\n  The most tragic consequence of child maltreatment is death. The April \nmaltreatment summary data released by the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, HHS, shows that about 1,200 children died of abuse and \nneglect in 2000. Children younger than six years of age accounted for \n85 percent of child fatalities and children younger than one year of \nage accounted for 44 percent of child fatalities.\n  Child abuse is not a new phenomenon. For more than a decade, numerous \nreports have called attention to the tragic abuse and neglect of \nchildren and the inadequacy of our Child Protection Services, CPS, \nsystems to protect our children.\n  In 1990, the U.S. Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect concluded \nthat ``child abuse and neglect is a national emergency.'' In 1995, the \nU.S. Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect reported that ``State \nand local CPS caseworkers are often overextended and cannot adequately \nfunction under their current caseloads.'' The report also stated that, \n``in many jurisdictions, caseloads are so high that CPS response is \nlimited to taking the complaint call, making a single visit to the \nhome, and deciding whether or not the complaint is valid, often without \nany subsequent monitoring of the family.''\n  A 1997 General Accounting Office, GAO, report found, ``the CPS system \nis in crisis, plagued by difficult problems, such as growing caseloads, \nincreasingly complex social problems and underlying child maltreatment, \nand ongoing systemic weaknesses in day-to-day operations.'' According \nto GAO, CPS weaknesses include ``difficulty in maintaining a skilled \nworkforce; the inability to consistently follow key policies and \nprocedures designed to protect children; developing useful case data \nand record-keeping systems, such as automated case management; and \nestablishing good working relationships with the courts.''\n  According to the May 2001 ``Report from the Child Welfare Workforce \nSurvey: State and County Data and Findings'' conducted by the American \nPublic Human Services Association, APHSA, the Child Welfare League of \nAmerica, CWLA, and the Alliance for Children and Families, annual staff \nturnover is high and morale is low among CPS workers. The report found \nthat CPS workers had an annual turnover rate of 22 percent, 76 percent \nhigher than the turnover rate for total agency staff. The \n``preventable'' turnover rate was 67 percent, or two-thirds higher than \nthe rate for all other direct service workers and total agency staff. \nIn some States, 75 percent or more of staff turnovers were preventable.\n  States rated a number of retention issues as highly problematic. In \ndescending order they are: workloads that are too high and/or \ndemanding; caseloads that are too high; too much worker time spent on \ntravel, paperwork, courts, and meetings; workers not feeling valued by \nthe agency; low salaries; supervision problems; and insufficient \nresources for families and children.\n  To prevent turnover and retain quality CPS staff, some States have \nbegun to increase in-service training, increase education \nopportunities, increase supervisory training, increase or improve \norientation, increase worker safety, and offer flex-time or changes in \noffice hours. Most States, however, continue to grapple with staff \nturnover and training issues.\n  Continued public criticism of CPS efforts, continued frustration by \nCPS staff and child welfare workers, and continued abuse and neglect, \nand death, of our Nation's children, served as the backdrop as we \nsought to draft a CAPTA reauthorization bill this year.\n  The Child Protection System mission must focus on the safety of \nchildren. To ensure that the system works as intended, CPS needs to be \nappropriately staffed. The staff need to receive appropriate training \nand cross-training to better recognize substance abuse and domestic \nviolence problems. Triage can help in communities with numerous abuse \nreports so that those reports where children are most at-risk of \nimminent harm can be prioritized. More collaborations in communities \nbetween CPS, health agencies, including mental health agencies, \nschools, and community-based groups can help to strengthen families. \nPrevention programs and activities to prevent child abuse and neglect \nfor families at-risk can improve the likelihood that a child will grow \nup in a home without violence, abuse, or neglect.\n  Beyond the CAPTA title of this legislation, our bill reauthorizes the \nFamily Violence Prevention and Services Act, including the creation of \na new program to address the needs of children\n\n[[Page S9124]]\n\nwho witness domestic violence, the Adoption Opportunities Act, and the \nAbandoned Infants Assistance Act.\n  There is not much time before Congress adjourns for the session. And \nthere are many outstanding issues for Congress to address. Child \nprotection ought not be a partisan issue. I urge my colleagues to join \nus in supporting this bill and to strengthen child protection laws \nbefore we adjourn for the year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be printed in the \nRecord, followed by the text of the bill.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n          Keeping Children and Families Safe Act Brief Summary\n\n       The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, CAPTA, \n     authorizes research and demonstration projects related to \n     preventing and treating child abuse and neglect, grants to \n     States to improve child protection systems and, grants to \n     support community-based family resource and support services. \n     Authorization for CAPTA expired with FY2001 but Congress has \n     continued to fund its programs.\n       Reauthorizes CAPTA with increased funding. The bill would \n     reauthorize CAPTA through FY2007 and authorized $200 million \n     for CAPTA programs. The FY2002 appropriation for CAPTA \n     programs was $81.6 million.\n       Encourages new training and better qualifications for child \n     and family service workers. The bill would recommend grants \n     for a variety of training programs and research activities \n     designed to improve training to child protective services and \n     other child and family service workers, including \n     supervisors. Suggested projects include: training workers on \n     how to best work with families from initial investigation \n     through treatment; cross-training to better recognize \n     neglect, domestic violence or substance abuse in a family; \n     training to strengthen linkages between Child Protection \n     Services (CPS) and health agencies including physical and \n     mental health services; and to promote partnerships that \n     offer creative approaches to meet the needs of abused \n     children; as well as training for CPS workers on their legal \n     duties. The bill would also encourage attention to staff \n     recruitment and retention issues.\n       Encourages links between agencies to improve services to \n     children. The bill would seek to create or improve links \n     between child protection services and education, health, \n     mental health, and judicial systems to ensure that children \n     who are abused and neglected are properly identified and \n     receive referrals to appropriate services. It would further \n     encourage greater collaboration between child protective \n     services and the juvenile justice system to ensure that \n     children who move between these two systems do so smoothly \n     and receive appropriate services. In addition, the bill would \n     promote partnerships between public agencies and community-\n     based organizations to provide child abuse and neglect \n     prevention and treatment programs. The bill would also \n     require States, as a condition of receiving State grant \n     money, to have policies and procedures to have triage for the \n     referral of a child not at imminent risk of harm to a \n     community or voluntary child maltreatment prevention service; \n     to improve the training, retention, and supervision of \n     caseworkers; to address the needs of infants who have been \n     prenatally exposed to illegal substances, including referral \n     to CPS and other services; to have provisions requiring CPS \n     workers to inform individuals of child maltreatment \n     allegations made against them; and to perform background \n     checks on all adults in prospective foster care households.\n       Strengths and expands the National Child Abuse \n     Clearinghouse. The role of the National Child Abuse \n     Clearinghouse would be strengthened and expanded to not only \n     maintain information about effective child abuse prevention \n     programs, but also to maintain information about best \n     practices used for improving CPS and best practices for \n     making referrals related to addressing the physical, \n     developmental, and health needs of abused and neglected \n     children.\n       Broadens access to technical assistance and grant funds. \n     CAPTA currently authorize the Department of Health and Human \n     Services, HHS, to fund certain kinds of child maltreatment \n     related demonstration programs and to provide certain \n     technical assistance. In general, grants or contracts may be \n     made with public and nonprofit private entities. The bill \n     would allow for-profit private entities to access technical \n     assistance and to operate HHS-funded demonstration programs.\n       Strengthens local oversight. States are now required to \n     appoint citizen review panels to oversee the policies and \n     procedures of State and local child protection service \n     agencies. The bill would require these panels to also study \n     agency ``practices,'' do public outreach and allow for public \n     comment, and include recommendations for changes in an annual \n     report to the State. States would be required to make a \n     written response regarding whether or how they will \n     incorporate the recommendations to improve the State and \n     local child protection systems.\n       Requires new study. The bill would require HHS to conduct \n     the 4th National Incidence Study of Child Abuse and Neglect \n     and to report its findings within 4 years of enactment of the \n     legislation. The last National Incidence Study was conducted \n     in 1993.\n       Revises Title II Community-Based Family Resource and \n     Support Grants. The bill revises Title II to support \n     community-based efforts to develop, operate, enhance, and \n     where appropriate, to network, initiatives aimed at the \n     prevention of child abuse and neglect and supports \n     coordinated resources and activities to better strengthen and \n     support families to reduce the likelihood of child abuse and \n     neglect.\n       Title II reauthorizes the Family Violence Prevention and \n     Services Act (FVPSA), which provides assistance to states, \n     Tribes, and Tribal organizations to assist in efforts to \n     increase public awareness about family violence and provide \n     immediate shelter and related assistance to victims of family \n     violence and their children. The reauthorization: extends the \n     authorization of existing programs to 2007; repeals three \n     programs: The Family Member Abuse and Documentation Project, \n     Model State Leadership Grants, and the Youth Education and \n     Domestic Violence Program; increases the authorization for \n     the National Domestic Violence Hotline to $5 million; carves \n     out 10 percent of State Grant funds for State Domestic \n     Violence Coalitions; allows for the Secretary to retain \n     administrative funds to implement and evaluate FVPSA \n     programs; establishes a highly secure electronic network to \n     link domestic violence shelters and service providers and the \n     National Domestic Violence Hotline on a confidential website. \n     The website would provide a continuously updated list of \n     shelter availability anywhere in the United States at any \n     time and would provide comprehensive information describing \n     the services each shelter provides such as medical, social \n     and bilingual services. It would also provide internet access \n     to shelters that do not have appropriate technology; creates \n     the Children Exposed to Domestic Violence Program to provide \n     funds for: shelters and other domestic violence service \n     providers to run programs to address the physical, emotional \n     and logistical needs of children who enter programs with \n     their mothers who are abused; training of child welfare, and \n     where appropriate, court and law enforcement personnel to \n     assist them in addressing cases where child abuse and \n     domestic violence intersect; and, nonprofit agencies to bring \n     various service providers together to design and implement \n     intervention programs for children who witness domestic \n     violence.\n       Makes several technical corrections to the bill.\n       Title III of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment and \n     Adoption Reform Act of 1978, as amended (Public Law 95-266) \n     authorizes the Adoption Opportunities Program. The program is \n     intended to eliminate barriers to adoption and to provide \n     permanent homes for children who would benefit from adoption, \n     particularly special needs children and disabled infants with \n     life-threatening conditions.\n       Seeks to eliminate interjurisdictional barriers to \n     adoption. As part of a revised and updated findings section, \n     the bill would explicitly include the elimination of \n     jurisdictional barriers to adoption. It notes that the \n     Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 prohibited delay or \n     denial of placement of a child across jurisdictional lines, \n     where an appropriate adoptive family was available. The bill \n     would require the Secretary of HHS to fund public or private \n     entities, including States, to eliminate barriers to placing \n     children for adoption across jurisdictional lines. Purposes \n     of this funding would include: developing a uniform homestudy \n     standard and protocols for acceptance of homestudies between \n     States and jurisdictions; developing models of financing \n     cross-jurisdictional placements; expanding capacity of all \n     adoption exchanges to serve increasing numbers of children, \n     including older children least likely to currently be \n     adopted; developing training materials and training social \n     workers on preparing and moving children across State lines; \n     and developing and supporting models for networking among \n     agencies, adoption exchanges, and parent support groups \n     across jurisdictional boundaries.\n       Within one year of enactment, the bill would require HHS, \n     in consultation with the General Accounting Office, to \n     facilitate interjurisdictional adoption of foster children. \n     Separately, the bill would also make interjurisdictional \n     adoption issues, including financing and best practices, a \n     part of a larger study HHS would be required to conduct on \n     adoption placements. Current law generally allows HHS to fund \n     services provided by public and nonprofit private agencies \n     only. The bill generally allows HHS to include for-profit \n     agencies among eligible grantees.\n       Increases funding for Adoption Opportunities grants. The \n     current authorization for Adoption Opportunities is $20 \n     million. The bill would increase the authorization to $40 \n     million for FY2003 and such sums as necessary for FY2004-\n     FY2007. (The Adoption Opportunities program received an \n     appropriation of $27.4 million for FY2002.)\n       The Abandoned Infants Assistance Act of 1988, as amended, \n     Public Law 100-505, authorizes demonstration grants to public \n     and private nonprofit agencies for activities such as \n     preventing the abandonment of infants, identifying and \n     addressing the needs of abandoned infants, recruiting and \n     training foster families for abandoned children, providing \n     residential care for infants and young children who cannot \n     live with their families or be placed in foster care, \n     providing respite\n\n[[Page S9125]]\n\n     care for families and foster families, and recruiting and \n     training health and social services personnel to work with \n     abandoned children.\n       Broadens priority for services. Under current law grantees \n     must ensure priority for their services is given to abandoned \n     infants and young children who are HIV-infected, perinatally \n     exposed to HIV, or perinatally drug-exposed. The bill would \n     maintain priority service for these children but would also \n     broaden the priority category to include abandoned infants \n     and young children who have ``life threatening illness[es]'' \n     or ``other special medical need[s].''\n       Requires studies. The bill would require that HHS conduct a \n     study that: estimates the number of infants and young \n     children who are relinquished, abandoned or found deceased in \n     the United States and the number of young children who are \n     HIV positive, have a life-threatening illness or other \n     special medical need, or have been perinatally exposed to HIV \n     or a dangerous drug; estimates the annual number of infants \n     and young children who are victims of homicide; determines \n     the characteristics of parents who have abandoned a child \n     within a year of the child's birth; and estimates the annual \n     costs incurred by all levels of government to provide housing \n     and care for abandoned infants and young children.\n       The bill would further require HHS to report findings of \n     this study to Congress not later than 36 months after \n     enactment of the legislation. Separately, HHS would be \n     required to evaluate and report on effective intervention \n     methods to prevent abandonment of children and effective ways \n     of responding to the needs of abandoned children.\n       Increases funds for Abandonment Infants Assistance grants. \n     The current authorization for Abandoned Infants Assistance is \n     $35 million. The bill would increase authorization to $45 \n     million for FY2003 and such sums as necessary for FY2004-\n     FY2007. The Abandoned Infants Assistance program received an \n     appropriation of $12.2 million for FY2002.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                S. 2998\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to join my \ncolleagues in introducing the Keeping Children and Families Safe Act of \n2002.\n  This bipartisan bill authorizes funding and programs that support \nmore than 870,000 children in this country who are victims of child \nabuse and neglect each year. It is essential to do all we can to see \nthat these very vulnerable children are protected and feel safe, in \nspite of the abuse and neglect they have suffered.\n\n[[Page S9135]]\n\n  Every year in America, local child protective service agencies \nrespond to approximately 3 million reports of child abuse or neglect. \nAccording to Prevent Child Abuse America, this problem costs the U.S. \nover $9 billion a year in direct and indirect costs. We owe it to the \nNation's children to provide more effective prevention and treatment \nservices.\n  Often these children are caught up in a system that fails to protect \nthem today. Nearly half of the children in substantiated cases of abuse \nreceive no followup services. We can and must do better. Our bill will \nprovide funding for grants to community-based and prevention-focused \nprograms and activities to prevent child abuse and neglect.\n  In 2000, approximately 1,100 children died of abuse and neglect. \nEight-five percent of these children were younger than 6. We know that \nearly identification of risk and timely intervention can reduce abuse. \nOne major prevention strategy shown to work is good parent education.\n  Effective action also means preparing those who investigate \nallegations of child abuse to assess the risk and ensure appropriate \nfollowup, so that children receive the medical and emotional treatment \nthey need.\n  Included in this bill is Senator Wellstone's Children Who Witness \nViolence Act. This legislation is long overdue and very important in \nconfronting the impact of domestic violence on children. It addresses \nthe issue form multiple perspectives by supporting the development of \nintervention program for children who witness domestic violence. It \ntakes advantage of local resources such as counselors, courts, schools, \nhealth care providers and battered women's programs to address the \nneeds of children in violent homes.\n  Witnessing domestic violence directly affects school achievement. \nThese children have higher levels of impaired concentration and poor \nschool attendance. They are often labeled as underachievers and have \ndifficulties in cognitive and academic functioning.\n  Research demonstrates that the effects of abuse can continue long \nafter the bruises fade. We need to do much more to prevent abuse and \nhelp abused children find a way out of violence. I urge my colleagues \nto support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. \n        Specter):\n  S. 3000. A bill to enhance and further research into paralysis and to \nimprove rehabilitation and the quality of life for persons living with \nparalysis and other physical disabilities, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nBrownback, Kennedy, and Specter today in introducing legislation that \nwill provide hope to Americans living with paralysis.\n  Recent news reports about the medical miracle Christopher Reeve has \nexperienced this past year are an inspiration for every American living \nwith paralysis as a result of a spinal cord injury. When it was \nannounced that, for the firs time since his accident in 1995, Chris was \nable to wiggle his fingers and toes, there was hope for some of the two \nmillion Americans living with paralysis.\n  Today, through the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Act of 2002, we seek \nto achieve two primary goals. First to further advance the science \nneeded to help those living with paralysis take their next step. And \nsecond, to time build quality of life programs throughout the country \nthat will further advance full participation, independent living, self-\nsufficiency and equality of opportunity for individuals with paralysis \nand other physical disabilities.\n  Chris' recovery and recent scientific evidence show that there is \nhope for those living with paralysis . At research centers in the \nUnited States, Europe and Japan, new techniques of rigorous exercise \nhave helped an estimated 500 persons with paraplegic with limited \nsensations in their lower bodies walk for short distances, unassisted \nor using walkers.\n  While the results of these new methods are quite miraculous, the \nlimits of what physical exercise can do for patients remains grossly \nunderstudied. While each person and each injury in unique, and some \npeople recover spontaneously, an estimated 200,000 Americans are living \nwith spinal cord injuries that have not improved. Which therapy or \ncombination of therapies will work for each person is unknown. Today 2 \nmillion Americans are living with paralysis, including spinal cord \ninjury, stroke, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, ALS and spina \nbifida. We need research to see how these new interventions work on the \nentire population on individuals living with paralysis.\n  What we do know is the ordinary repetitive motions used in most \nrehabilitation centers, like squeezing a ball, are almost certainly not \nenough to appropriately address neurological injuries.\n  Patients are usually told that after one year, two at the most, they \nwill never make further progress in their abilities to move or feel \nsensation. Yet seven years after his accident, through a rigorous \nexercise plan, Chris Reeve is finally seeking results.\n  Due to efforts led by the National Institutes of Health and the \nChristopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation, our nation stands on the brink \nof amazing breakthroughs in science for those living with paralysis. \nHowever, the biotech and pharmaceutical industries have not invested in \nparalysis research because they believe the market does not support the \nprivate investment. There is an urgent need for the federal government \nto further step up its commitment in this area. The Christopher Reeve \nParalysis Act would do just that.\n  By establishing Paralysis Research Consortia at the National \nInstitute on Neurological Disorders and Stoke, we can substantially \nincrease our ability to capitalize on research advances in paralysis. \nThese consortia would be formed to explore unique scientific expertise \nand focus across the existing research centers at NINDS in an effort to \nfurther advance treatments, therapies and developments on one or more \nforms of paralysis that result from central nervous system trauma and \nstroke.\n  Additional breakthrough are under way in rehabilitation research on \nparalysis. Federal funding for rehabilitation research at the National \nCenter for Medical Rehabilitation Research at NIH is showing real \npotential to improve functional mobility; prevent secondary \ncomplications like bladder and urinary tract infections and ulcers; and \nto develop improved assistive technology. These rehabilitation \ninterventions have the potential to greatly reduce pain and suffering \nfor those suffering from neurological disorders and str9oke and, at the \nsame time, save millions in health care expenditures.\n  Over the past 20 years, overall days in the hospital and \nrehabilitation centers for those living with paralysis have been cut in \nhalf. Those living with paralysis face astronomical medical costs, and \nour best estimates tell us that only one-third of those individuals \nremain employed after paralysis. At least one-third of those living \nwith paralysis have income of $15,000 or less.\n  To date, there are no State-based programs at CDC that address \nparalysis and other physical disability with the goal of improving \nhealth outcomes and prevent secondary complications. This bill will, \nfor the first time, ensure that individuals living with paralysis get \nthe information they need; have access to public health programs; and \nsupport in their communities to navigate services. Ultimately these \nprograms will help remove the barriers to community participation and \nhelp improve quality of life. The bill also establishes hospital-based \nregistries on paralysis to collect needed data on the true numbers of \nindividuals with these conditions, and it invests in population-based \nresearch to see how individuals are faring.\n  We are on the brink of major breakthroughs for individuals impacted \nby neurological disorders and stroke that result in paralysis. This \nbill will ensure that the federal government does it part to help more \nthan 2 million Americans.\n  When Christopher Reeve was injured, he put a face on an issue that \nhas been neglected for too long. Since then, his tireless efforts to \nwalk again, coupled with his passion and commitment to improve quality \nof life for others living with paralysis, make him a role model for \neveryone.\n\n[[Page S9136]]\n\n  It is a pleasure, and an honor to lead a bipartisan group of \nSenators, along with the support of number of disability groups, \nincluding the American Stroke Association, the American Heart \nAssociation, the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation, the National \nFamily Caregivers Association, the National Spinal Cord Injury \nAssociation, Paralyzed Veterans of America and Eastern Paralyzed \nVeterans, in introducing this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/24/senate-section/article/S9136-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 146--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEAS OF \n                  NATIONAL TAKE YOUR KIDS TO VOTE DAY\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                            S.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Partial-Birth Abortion Ban \n     Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. __02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) A moral, medical, and ethical consensus exists that the \n     practice of performing a partial-birth abortion--an abortion \n     in which a physician delivers an unborn child's body until \n     only the head remains inside the womb, punctures the back of \n     the child's skull with a sharp instrument, and sucks the \n     child's brains out before completing delivery of the dead \n     infant--is a gruesome and inhumane procedure that is never \n     medically necessary and should be prohibited.\n       (2) Rather than being an abortion procedure that is \n     embraced by the medical community, particularly among \n     physicians who routinely perform other abortion procedures, \n     partial-birth abortion remains a disfavored procedure that is \n     not only unnecessary to preserve the health of the mother, \n     but in fact poses serious risks to the long-term health of \n     women, and, in some circumstances, their lives. As a result, \n     at least 27 States banned the procedure as did Congress, \n     which voted to ban the procedure during the 104th, 105th, and \n     106th Congresses.\n       (3) In Stenberg v. Carhart, 530 U.S. 914, 932 (2000), the \n     Supreme Court opined ``that significant medical authority \n     supports the proposition that in some circumstances, [partial \n     birth abortion] would be the safest procedure'' for pregnant \n     women who wish to undergo an abortion. Thus, the Supreme \n     Court struck down Nebraska's ban on partial-birth abortion \n     procedures, concluding that it placed an ``undue burden'' on \n     women seeking abortions because it failed to include an \n     exception for partial-birth abortions deemed necessary to \n     preserve the ``health'' of the mother.\n       (4) In reaching this conclusion, the Supreme Court deferred \n     to the Federal district court's findings that the partial-\n     birth abortion procedure was statistically and medically as \n     safe as, and in many circumstances safer than, alternative \n     abortion procedures.\n       (5) However, the great weight of evidence presented at the \n     Stenberg trial and other trials challenging partial-birth \n     abortion bans, as well as at extensive congressional \n     hearings, demonstrates that a partial-birth abortion is never \n     necessary to preserve the health of a woman, poses \n     significant health risks to a woman upon whom the procedure \n     is performed, and is outside of the standard of medical care.\n       (6) Despite the dearth of evidence in the Stenberg trial \n     court record supporting the district court's findings, the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit and the \n     Supreme Court refused to set aside the district court's \n     findings because, under the applicable standard of appellate \n     review, they were not ``clearly erroneous''. A finding of \n     fact is clearly erroneous ``when although there is evidence \n     to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is \n     left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has \n     been committed''. Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, North \n     Carolina, 470 U.S. 564, 573 (1985) (quoting United States v. \n     U.S. Gypsum Co. 333 U.S. 364, 395 (1948)). Under this \n     standard, ``if the district court's account of the evidence \n     is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, \n     the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced \n     that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have \n     weighed the evidence differently''. Id. at 573-74.\n       (7) Thus, in Stenberg, the Supreme Court was required to \n     accept the very questionable findings issued by the district \n     court judge--the effect of which was to render null and void \n     the reasoned findings and policy determinations of Congress \n     and at least 27 State legislatures.\n       (8) However, under well-settled Supreme Court \n     jurisprudence, Congress is not bound to accept the same \n     findings as the Supreme Court was bound to accept in Stenberg \n     under the ``clearly erroneous'' standard. Rather, Congress is \n     entitled to reach its own findings--findings that the Supreme \n     Court accords great deference--and to enact legislation based \n     upon these findings so long as it seeks to pursue a \n     legitimate interest that is within the scope of the \n     Constitution, and draws reasonable inferences based upon \n     substantial evidence.\n       (9) In Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641 (1966), the \n     Supreme Court articulated its highly deferential standard of \n     review of congressional findings when it addressed the \n     constitutionality of section 4(e) of the Voting Rights Act of \n     1965. Regarding Congress' finding that such section 4(e) \n     would assist the Puerto Rican community in ``gaining \n     nondiscriminatory treatment in public services'', the Supreme \n     Court stated that ``[i]t was for Congress, as the branch that \n     made this judgment, to assess and weigh the various \n     conflicting considerations . . . . It is not for us to review \n     the congressional resolution of these factors. It is enough \n     that we be able to perceive a basis upon which the Congress \n     might resolve the conflict as it did. There plainly was such \n     a basis to support section 4(e) in the application in \n     question in this case.''. Id. at 653.\n       (10) Katzenbach's highly deferential standard of review of \n     Congress's findings was relied upon by the United States \n     District Court for the District of Columbia when it upheld \n     the ``bail-out'' provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, \n     stating that ``congressional fact finding, to which we are \n     inclined to pay great deference, strengthens the inference \n     that, in those jurisdictions covered by the Act, state \n     actions discriminatory in effect are discriminatory in \n     purpose''. City of Rome, Georgia v. United States, 472 F. \n     Supp. 221 (D. D. C. 1979) aff'd City of Rome, Georgia v. \n     United States, 446 U.S. 156 (1980).\n       (11) The Supreme Court continued its practice of deferring \n     to findings in reviewing the constitutionality of the must-\n     carry provisions of the Cable Television Consumer Protection \n     and Competition Act of 1992. See Turner Broad. Sys., Inc. v. \n     Fed. Communications Comm'n, 512 U.S. 622 (1994) (referred to \n     in this section as ``Turner I'') and Turner Broad. Sys., Inc. \n     v. Fed. Communications Comm'n, 520 U.S. 180 (1997) (referred \n     to in this section as ``Turner II''). At issue in the Turner \n     cases was Congress' finding that, absent mandatory carriage \n     rules, the continued viability of local broadcast television \n     would be ``seriously jeopardized''. In Turner I, the Supreme \n     Court recognized that, as an institution, ``Congress is far \n     better equipped than the judiciary to `amass and evaluate the \n     vast amounts of data' bearing upon an issue as complex and \n     dynamic as that presented here''. 512 U.S. at 665-66. \n     Although the Supreme Court recognized that ``the deference \n     afforded to legislative findings does `not foreclose our \n     independent judgment of the facts bearing on an issue of \n     constitutional law' '', its ``obligation to exercise \n     independent judgment when First Amendment rights are \n     implicated is not a license to reweigh the evidence de novo, \n     or to replace Congress' factual predictions with our own. \n     Rather, it is to assure that, in formulating its judgments, \n     Congress has drawn reasonable inferences based on substantial \n     evidence.''. Id. at 666.\n       (12) Three years later in Turner II, the Supreme Court \n     upheld the ``must-carry'' provisions based upon Congress' \n     findings, stating the Supreme Court's ``sole obligation is \n     `to assure that, in formulating its judgments, Congress has \n     drawn reasonable inferences based on substantial evidence.' \n     ''. 520 U.S. at 195. Citing its ruling in Turner I, the \n     Supreme Court reiterated that ``[w]e owe Congress' findings \n     deference in part because the institution `is far better \n     equipped than the judiciary to ``amass and evaluate the vast \n     amounts of data'' bearing upon' legislative questions'' Id. \n     at 195, and added that it ``owe[d] Congress' findings an \n     additional measure of deference out of respect for its \n     authority to exercise the legislative power''. Id. at 196.\n       (13) There exists substantial record evidence upon which \n     Congress has reached its conclusion that a ban on partial-\n     birth abortion is not required to contain a ``health'' \n     exception, because the facts indicate that a partial-birth \n     abortion is never necessary to preserve the health of a \n     woman, poses serious risks to a woman's health, and lies \n     outside the standard of medical care. Congress was informed \n     by extensive hearings held during the 104th and 105th \n     Congresses and passed a ban on partial-birth abortion in the \n     104th, 105th, and 106th Congresses. The findings of these \n     hearings reflect the very informed judgment of Congress that \n     a partial-birth abortion is never necessary to preserve the \n     health of a woman, poses serious risks to a woman's health, \n     lies outside the standard of medical care, and should, \n     therefore, be banned.\n       (14) Pursuant to the testimony received during extensive \n     legislative hearings during the 104th and 105th Congresses, \n     Congress finds and declares that:\n       (A)(i) Partial-birth abortion poses serious risks to the \n     health of a woman undergoing the procedure.\n       (ii) Those risks include, among other things--\n       (I) an increased risk of suffering from cervical \n     incompetence, a result of cervical dilation, making it \n     difficult or impossible for a woman successfully to carry a \n     subsequent pregnancy to term;\n       (II) an increased risk of uterine rupture, abruption, \n     amniotic fluid embolus, and trauma to the uterus as a result \n     of converting a child to a footling breech position, a \n     procedure which, according to a leading obstetrics textbook, \n     ``there are very few, if any, indications for . . .  other \n     than for delivery of a second twin''; and\n       (III) a risk of lacerations and secondary hemorrhaging due \n     to a doctor blindly forcing a sharp instrument into the base \n     of the unborn child's skull while the child is lodged in the \n     birth canal, an act that could result in severe bleeding, \n     brings with it the threat of shock, and could ultimately \n     result in maternal death.\n       (B) There is no credible medical evidence that partial-\n     birth abortions are safe or are safer than other abortion \n     procedures. No controlled studies of partial-birth abortion \n     have been conducted nor have any comparative studies been \n     conducted to demonstrate its safety and efficacy compared to \n     other abortion methods. Furthermore, there have been no \n     articles published in peer-reviewed journals that establish \n     that partial-birth abortion is superior in any way to \n     established abortion procedures. Indeed, there are\n\n[[Page S9141]]\n\n     currently no medical schools that provide instruction on \n     abortions that include instruction on partial-birth abortion \n     in their curriculum, unlike other more commonly used abortion \n     procedures.\n       (C) A prominent medical association has concluded that \n     partial-birth abortion is ``not an accepted medical \n     practice'', that it has ``never been subject to even a \n     minimal amount of the normal medical practice development'', \n     that ``the relative advantages and disadvantages of the \n     procedure in specific circumstances remain unknown'', and \n     that ``there is no consensus among obstetricians about its \n     use''. The association has further noted that partial-birth \n     abortion is broadly disfavored by both medical experts and \n     the public, is ``ethically wrong'', and ``is never the only \n     appropriate procedure''.\n       (D) Neither the plaintiff in Stenberg v. Carhart, nor the \n     experts who testified on his behalf, have identified a single \n     circumstance during which a partial-birth abortion was \n     necessary to preserve the health of a woman.\n       (E) The physician credited with developing the partial-\n     birth abortion procedure has testified that the physician has \n     never encountered a situation where a partial-birth abortion \n     was medically necessary to achieve the desired outcome and, \n     thus, that partial-birth abortion is never medically \n     necessary to preserve the health of a woman.\n       (F) A ban on the partial-birth abortion procedure will \n     therefore advance the health interests of pregnant women \n     seeking to terminate a pregnancy.\n       (G) In light of this overwhelming evidence, Congress and \n     the States have a compelling interest in prohibiting partial-\n     birth abortions. In addition to promoting maternal health, \n     such a prohibition will draw a bright line that clearly \n     distinguishes abortion and infanticide, preserves the \n     integrity of the medical profession, and promotes respect for \n     human life.\n       (H) Based upon Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973) and Planned \n     Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992), a governmental \n     interest in protecting the life of a child during the \n     delivery process arises by virtue of the fact that during a \n     partial-birth abortion, labor is induced and the birth \n     process has begun. This distinction was recognized in Roe \n     when the Supreme Court noted, without comment, that the Texas \n     parturition statute, which prohibited one from killing a \n     child ``in a state of being born and before actual birth'', \n     was not under attack. This interest becomes compelling as the \n     child emerges from the maternal body. A child that is \n     completely born is a full, legal person entitled to \n     constitutional protections afforded a ``person'' under the \n     Constitution. Partial-birth abortions involve the killing of \n     a child that is in the process, in fact mere inches away \n     from, becoming a ``person''. Thus, the government has a \n     heightened interest in protecting the life of the partially-\n     born child.\n       (I) This interest, too, has not gone unnoticed in the \n     medical community, where a prominent medical association has \n     recognized that partial-birth abortion is ``ethically \n     different from other destructive abortion techniques because \n     the fetus, normally twenty weeks or longer in gestation, is \n     killed outside of the womb''. According to this medical \n     association, the `` `partial birth' gives the fetus an \n     autonomy which separates it from the right of the woman to \n     choose treatments for her own body''.\n       (J) Partial-birth abortion also causes confusion among the \n     medical, legal, and ethical duties of physicians to preserve \n     and promote life, as the physician acts directly against the \n     physical life of a child, whom the physician had just \n     delivered, all but the head, out of the womb, in order to end \n     that life. Partial-birth abortion thus appropriates the \n     terminology and techniques used by obstetricians in the \n     delivery of living children--obstetricians who preserve and \n     protect the life of the mother and the child--and instead \n     uses those techniques to end the life of the partially-born \n     child.\n       (K) Thus, by aborting a child in a manner that purposefully \n     seeks to kill the child after a child has begun the process \n     of birth, partial-birth abortion undermines the public's \n     perception of the appropriate role of a physician during the \n     delivery process, and perverts a process during which life is \n     brought into the world, in order to destroy a partially-born \n     child.\n       (L) The gruesome and inhumane nature of the partial-birth \n     abortion procedure and its disturbing similarity to the \n     killing of a newborn infant promotes a complete disregard for \n     infant human life that can only be countered by a prohibition \n     of the procedure.\n       (M) The vast majority of babies killed during partial-birth \n     abortions are alive until the end of the procedure. It is a \n     medical fact, however, that unborn infants at this stage can \n     feel pain when subjected to painful stimuli and that their \n     perception of this pain is even more intense than that of \n     newborn infants and older children when subjected to the same \n     stimuli. Thus, during a partial-birth abortion procedure, a \n     child will fully experience the pain associated with piercing \n     the child's skull and sucking out the child's brain.\n       (N) Implicitly approving such a brutal and inhumane \n     procedure by choosing not to prohibit it will further make \n     society indifferent to the humanity of not only newborns, but \n     all vulnerable and innocent human life, making it \n     increasingly difficult to protect such life. Thus, Congress \n     has a compelling interest in acting--indeed it must act--to \n     prohibit this inhumane procedure.\n       (O) For these reasons, partial-birth abortion is never \n     medically indicated to preserve the health of the mother, is \n     in fact unrecognized as a valid abortion procedure by the \n     mainstream medical community, poses additional health risks \n     to the mother, blurs the line between abortion and \n     infanticide in the killing of a partially-born child just \n     inches from birth, causes confusion of the role of the \n     physician in childbirth, and should, therefore, be banned.\n\n     SEC. __03.

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING THE AVAILABILITY OF \n                   THE SMALLPOX VACCINE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the smallpox virus has killed more people than any \n     other infectious disease in human history, and is estimated \n     to have killed approximately 400,000,000 people in the 20th \n     century;\n       (2) Congress and the Administration have determined that a \n     bioterrorist attack utilizing the smallpox virus is a present \n     threat to the nation's public health and safety;\n       (3) the Secretary of Health and Human Services has \n     contracted with private manufacturers to purchase \n     approximately 300,000,000 doses of smallpox vaccine, of which \n     100,000,000 doses have already been delivered;\n       (4) the Smallpox Response Plan and Guidelines released by \n     the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on September \n     23, 2002, calls for vaccinating the entire population of the \n     United States against smallpox within 5 days of an outbreak \n     of the disease;\n       (5) the plan would make the vaccine available to the \n     general public only in the event of an outbreak of the \n     disease;\n       (6) the strategy adopted by the Centers for Disease Control \n     and Prevention is an important step forward but it is short \n     of what is needed to adequately protect and defend against a \n     possible attack using the disease;\n       (7) because the initial symptoms of smallpox are flu-like, \n     the disease may go undetected or undiagnosed for up to 2 \n     weeks, and could spread to and kill thousands before the \n     first vaccinations could be administered;\n       (8) the more people who receive prompt vaccination against \n     smallpox, the lower the rate of transmission of the disease \n     and the greater the likelihood that such an outbreak could be \n     contained; and\n       (9) because there are known health risks associated with \n     the smallpox vaccine, the decision to be vaccinated should be \n     made by the individual, or parent or guardian, in \n     consultation with a doctor, and not the Federal Government.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Secretary of Health and Human Services, at the \n     request of any individual, or such individual's parent or \n     guardian, and in consultation with such individual's \n     physician, should make available to that individual vaccine \n     sufficient to inoculate such individual from the smallpox \n     virus;\n       (2) such vaccine should be provided at no cost or at \n     nominal cost to the individual;\n       (3) such vaccine should be provided to the individual if \n     the individual resides in the United States or any \n     commonwealth, possession, or territory of the United States \n     or the individual is an American citizen who resides outside \n     of the United States; and\n       (4) such vaccine should be provided only if it is Federally \n     licensed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4729.
