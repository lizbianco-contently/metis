Mr. President, we face no more serious decision in our \ndemocracy than whether or not to go to war. The American people deserve \nto fully understand all of the implications of such a decision.\n  The question of whether our Nation should attack Iraq is playing out \nin the context of a more fundamental debate that is only just \nbeginning--an all-important debate about how, when and where in the \nyears ahead our country will use its unsurpassed military might.\n  On September 20, the administration unveiled its new National \nSecurity Strategy. This document addresses the new realities of our \nage, particularly the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and \nterrorist networks armed with the agendas of fanatics. The Strategy \nclaims that these new threats are so novel and so dangerous that we \nshould ``not hesitate to act\n\n[[Page S10002]]\n\nalone, if necessary, to exercise our right of self-defense by acting \npre-emptively.''\n  In the discussion over the past few months about Iraq, the \nadministration, often uses the terms ``pre-emptive'' and ``preventive'' \ninterchangeably. In the realm of international relations, these two \nterms have long had very different meanings.\n  Traditionally, ``pre-emptive'' action refers to times when states \nreact to an imminent threat of attack. For example, when Egyptian and \nSyrian forces mobilized on Israel's borders in 1967, the threat was \nobvious and immediate, and Israel felt justified in pre-emptively \nattacking those forces. The global community is generally tolerant of \nsuch actions, since no nation should have to suffer a certain first \nstrike before it has the legitimacy to respond.\n  By contrast, ``preventive'' military action refers to strikes that \ntarget a country before it has developed a capability that could \nsomeday become threatening. Preventive attacks have generally been \ncondemned. For example, the 1941 sneak attack on Pearl Harbor was \nregarded as a preventive strike by Japan, because the Japanese were \nseeking to block a planned military buildup by the United States in the \nPacific.\n  The coldly premeditated nature of preventive attacks and preventive \nwars makes them anathema to well-established international principles \nagainst aggression. Pearl Harbor has been rightfully recorded in \nhistory as an act of dishonorable treachery.\n  Historically, the United States has condemned the idea of preventive \nwar, because it violates basic international rules against aggression. \nBut at times in our history, preventive war has been seriously \nadvocated as a policy option.\n  In the early days of the cold war, some U.S. military and civilian \nexperts advocated a preventive war against the Soviet Union. They \nproposed a devastating first strike to prevent the Soviet Union from \ndeveloping a threatening nuclear capability. At the time, they said the \nuniquely destructive power of nuclear weapons required us to rethink \ntraditional international rules.\n  The first round of that debate ended in 1950, when President Truman \nruled out a preventive strike, stating that such actions were not \nconsistent with our American tradition. He said, ``You don't `prevent' \nanything by war . . . except peace.'' Instead of a surprise first \nstrike, the nation dedicated itself to the strategy of deterrence and \ncontainment, which successfully kept the peace during the long and \nfrequently difficult years of the Cold War.\n  Arguments for preventive war resurfaced again when the Eisenhower \nadministration took power in 1953, but President Eisenhower and \nSecretary of State John Foster Dulles soon decided firmly against it. \nPresident Eisenhower emphasized that even if we were to win such a war, \nwe would face the vast burdens of occupation and reconstruction that \nwould come with it.\n  The argument that the United States should take preventive military \naction, in the absence of an imminent attack, resurfaced in 1962, when \nwe learned that the Soviet Union would soon have the ability to launch \nmissiles from Cuba against our country. Many military officers urged \nPresident Kennedy to approve a preventive attack to destroy this \ncapability before it became operational. Robert Kennedy, like Harry \nTruman, felt that this kind of first strike was not consistent with \nAmerican values. He said that a proposed surprise first strike against \nCuba would be a ``Pearl Harbor in reverse.''\n  For 175 years, [he said] we have not been that kind of country.\n  That view prevailed. A middle ground was found and peace was \npreserved.\n  Yet another round of debate followed the Cuban Missile Crisis when \nAmerican strategists and voices in and out of the administration \nadvocated preventive war against China to forestall its acquisition of \nnuclear weapons. Many arguments heard today about Iraq were made then \nabout the Chinese communist government: that its leadership was \nirrational and that it was therefore undeterrable. And once again, \nthose arguments were rejected.\n  As these earlier cases show, American strategic thinkers have long \ndebated the relative merits of preventive and pre-emptive war. Although \nnobody would deny our right to pre-emptively block an imminent attack \non our territory, there is disagreement about our right to preventively \nengage in war.\n  In each of these cases a way was found to deter other nations, \nwithout waging war.\n  Now, the Bush Administration says we must take pre-emptive action \nagainst Iraq. But what the Administration is really calling for is \npreventive war, which flies in the face of international rules of \nacceptable behavior.\n  There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein is a despicable dictator and \nthat he must be disarmed. But the Administration has not made a \npersuasive case that the threat is so imminent that we should risk \ngoing it alone. We should resort to war only as a last resort. If we \nwork through the United Nations for free, unfettered inspections, we \nstrengthen our hand with our allies, our hand against Saddam Hussein \nand our ability to disarm him.\n  The Administration's new National Security Strategy states ``As a \nmatter of common sense and self-defense, America will act against such \nemerging threats before they are fully formed.''\n  The circumstances of today's world require us to rethink this \nconcept. The world changed on September 11, and all of us have learned \nthat it can be a drastically more dangerous place. The Bush \nadministration's new National Security Strategy asserts that global \nrealities now legitimize preventive war and make it a strategic \nnecessity.\n  The document openly contemplates preventive attacks against groups or \nstates, even absent the threat of imminent attack. It legitimizes this \nkind of first strike option, and it elevates it to the status of a core \nsecurity doctrine. Disregarding norms of international behavior, the \nBush strategy asserts that the United States should be exempt from the \nrules we expect other nations to obey.\n  I strongly oppose any such extreme doctrine and I'm sure that many \nothers do as well. Earlier generations of Americans rejected preventive \nwar on the grounds of both morality and practicality, and our \ngeneration must do so as well. We can deal with Iraq without resorting \nto this extreme.\n  It is impossible to justify any such double standard under \ninternational law. Might does not make right. America cannot write its \nown rules for the modern world. To attempt to do so would be \nunilateralism run amok. It would antagonize our closest allies, whose \nsupport we need to fight terrorism, prevent global warming, and deal \nwith many other dangers that affect all nations and require \ninternational cooperation. It would deprive America of the moral \nlegitimacy necessary to promote our values abroad. And it would give \nother nations--from Russia to India to Pakistan--an excuse to violate \nfundamental principles of civilized international behavior.\n  The administration's doctrine is a call for 21st century American \nimperialism that no other nation can or should accept. It is the \nantithesis of all that America has worked so hard to achieve in \ninternational relations since the end of World War II.\n  This is not just an academic debate. There are important real world \nconsequences. A shift in our policy toward preventive war would \nreinforce the perception of America as a ``bully' in the Middle East \nand would fuel anti-American sentiment throughout the Islamic world and \nbeyond.\n  It would also send a signal to governments the world over that the \nrules of aggression have changed for them too, which could increase the \nrisk of conflict between countries such as Russia and Georgia, India \nand Pakistan, and China and Taiwan.\n  Obviously, this debate is only just beginning on the administration's \nnew strategy for national security. But the debate is solidly grounded \nin American values and history.\n  It will also be a debate among vast numbers of well-meaning Americans \nwho have honest differences of opinion about the best way to use United \nStates military might. The debate will be contentious, but the stakes, \nin terms of both our national security and our allegiance to our core \nbeliefs, are too high to ignore.\n  I look forward to working closely with my colleagues in Congress to \ndevelop an effective, principled policy that will enable us to protect \nour national security, and respect the basic\n\n[[Page S10003]]\n\nprinciples that are essential for the world to be at peace.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Wyden and Mr. Hatch pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 3063 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition, as noted, to \ndiscuss the pending resolution. At the outset, I commend the President \nfor coming to Congress. Originally the position had been articulated by \nthe White House that congressional authority was not necessary. The \nPresident, as Commander in Chief, has the authority under the \nConstitution to act in cases of emergency. But if there is time for \ndiscussion, deliberation, and debate, then in my view it is a matter \nfor the Congress.\n  Senator Harkin and I introduced a resolution on July 18 of this year \ncalling for the President to come to Congress before using military \nforce.\n  When the President made his State of the Union speech and identified \nthe axis of evil as Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, followed by the \ntestimony of Secretary of State Powell that there was no intention to \ngo to war against either North Korea or Iran, it left the obvious \ninference that war might be in the offing as to Iraq.\n  I spoke extensively on the subject back on February 13, 2002, raising \na number of issues: What was the extent of Saddam Hussein's control \nover weapons of mass destruction? What would it cost by way of \ncasualties to topple Saddam Hussein? What would be the consequence in \nIraq? Who would govern after Saddam was toppled? What would happen in \nthe region, the impact on the Arab world, and the impact on Israel? I \nbelieve it is vastly preferable on our resolution to focus on the \nquestion of weapons of mass destruction as opposed to the issue of \nregime change. When we talk about regime change, there is a sense in \nmany other nations that the United States is seeking to exert its will \non another sovereign nation. Much as Saddam Hussein deserves to be \ntoppled, when we move away from the focus of containing weapons of mass \ndestruction, it is my view we lose a great deal of our moral authority.\n\n  There is no doubt Saddam Hussein has been ruthless in the use of \nweapons of mass destruction with the use of chemicals on his own \npeople, the Kurds, and in the Iran-Iraq war. There is very substantial \nevidence Saddam Hussein has storehouses of biological weapons, and \nthere is significant evidence he is moving as fast as he can toward \nnuclear weapons. So when we talk about self-defense, when we talk about \nridding the world of the scourge, that is a very high moral ground. \nWhen we talk about regime change, it raises the concern of many leaders \nof many nations as to who is next--maybe they are next.\n  I suggest it is possible to achieve regime change in a way superior \nto articulating or planning an attack with the view to toppling Saddam \nHussein. I believe the way to achieve regime change, consistent with \ninternational principles, is to try Saddam Hussein as a war criminal. I \nintroduced a resolution on March 2, 1998, which was passed by the U.S. \nSenate on March 13, 1998, calling for the creation of a military \ntribunal, similar to the war crimes tribunal at The Hague, similar to \nthe war crimes tribunal in Rwanda, so that Saddam Hussein could be \ntried as a war criminal. There is no doubt on the evidence available \nthat Saddam Hussein has committed war crimes. Without going into all of \nthe details set forth in the resolution, I ask unanimous consent that \nit be printed at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Herein, there is a very ample statement for the basis \nfor trying Saddam Hussein and trying him successfully as a war \ncriminal. In doing that, we would be following the precedent of trying \nformer Yugoslavian President Milosevic as a war criminal. I have made \nsome seven visits to The Hague and have participated in marshaling U.S. \nresources from the Department of Justice, also specifically from the \nFBI, also from the CIA during the 104th Congress back in 1995 and 1996, \nwhen I was chairman of the Intelligence Committee; and we now see the \nhead of state, Slobodan Milosevic, on trial.\n  We had the experience of the war crimes tribunal in Rwanda, which \nachieved an international precedent in convicting former Prime Minister \nJean Kambanda of Rwanda, the first head of state to be convicted. He is \nnow serving a life sentence.\n  So it is my suggestion that the objective of regime change can be \naccomplished in accordance with existing international standards, on a \nmultilateral basis, without having other nations in the world saying \nthe superpower United States is trying to throw its weight around. It \nmight take a little longer, but as is evidenced from the proceedings in \nRwanda as to the former Prime Minister of Rwanda, and as evidenced from \nthe proceedings of Milosevic, that is an ordinary successful progress \nof the law. The most difficult issue pending on the resolutions as to \nthe use of force on Iraq, the most difficult issue, in my opinion, is \nthe question of whether the United Nations authorizes the use of force.\n  I commend the President for his efforts to organize an international \ncoalition. President George Herbert Walker Bush did organize an \ninternational coalition in 1991, and prosecuted the war against Iraq \nwith great success, enlisting the aid of the Arab nations, including \nEgypt, Syria, and other countries. That is the preferable way to \nproceed, if it can be accomplished.\n  The obvious difficulty in conditioning the President's authority to \nuse force on a United Nations resolution is the United States would be \nsubjecting itself to the veto by either China, or Russia, or even \nFrance, and we prize our sovereignty very highly--justifiably so. The \nconundrum, then, is whether we will get that kind of an international \ncoalition that would have the weight of world public opinion, would \nhave the weight of the U.N. behind them.\n  The difficulties of having the United States act alone would be the \nprecedent that would be set. It could be a reference point for China, \nfor example, looking at Taiwan, where China has made many bellicose \nwarlike statements as to its disagreements with Taiwan. If the United \nStates can act unilaterally, or without United Nations sanction, there \nwould be a potential argument for a country like China proceeding as to \nTaiwan. There would be a potential argument for a nation like India \nproceeding as to Pakistan, or vice versa, Pakistan proceeding as to \nIndia, which could be a nuclear incident. Both of those countries have \nnuclear power.\n  This is a question I believe has to be debated on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate. I have not made up my mind as to whether it is preferable \nto condition the use of force on a United Nations resolution, and I am \ncognizant of the difficulties of giving up sovereignty and being \nsubject to the veto of China, which I don't like at all, or being \nsubject to the veto of Russia, which I don't like at all, or being \nsubject to the veto of France, again something I do not like. But I \nthink we have to recognize when we are authorizing the use of force, \nand if the President takes the authorization and is not successful \ngoing to the U.N. to get a coalition, we will be establishing a \nprecedent that may have ramifications far into the future, at some \npoint in time when the United States may not be the superpower \nsignificantly in control of the destiny of the world with our great \nmilitary power.\n  I am glad to see the President is moving ahead with an effort to get \ninspections in the United Nations, and Secretary of State Powell met \nlast Friday with the U.N. inspection chief, who agreed there ought to \nbe broader authority for the U.N. inspection than that which was in \nplace in 1998 when Iraq ousted the U.N. inspectors. Hans Blix supported \nthe position the United States has taken. Yesterday, on a Sunday talk \nshow, the Iraqi Ambassador to the U.N. made a comment to the effect \nthere was no huge problem on having U.N. inspectors come, even to the \nPresidential compounds.\n  That is probably a typical Iraqi statement: holding out an offer one \nday\n\n[[Page S10004]]\n\nand revoking it the next. I do believe it is important that we exhaust \nevery possible alternative before resorting to the use of our armed \nforces, and to have the inspectors go back into Iraq is obviously \ndesirable. We must have the inspectors, though, go into Iraq in a \ncontext where there are no holds barred.\n  In August, Senator Shelby and I visited the Sudan. The Sudan is now \ninterested in becoming friendly with the United States. Our former \ncolleague, Senator Jack Danforth, has brokered the basic peace treaty \nwhich still has to be implemented in many respects. But as a part of \nthe new Sudanese approach, the Government of Sudan has allowed U.S. \nintelligence personnel to go to Sudanese factories, munitions plants, \nand laboratories with no announcement or minimal announcement of just \nan hour, break locks, go in, and conduct inspections. That would be a \ngood model for the inspection of Iraq. If, in fact, the Iraqis will \nallow unfettered, unlimited inspections, it is conceivable that would \nsolve the problem with respect to the issue of weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  Certainly that ought to be pursued to the maximum extent possible. \nIf, and/or when the Iraqis oust the U.N. inspectors or limit the U.N. \ninspectors, raising again the unmistakable inference that Saddam \nHussein has something to hide, then I think there is more reason to \nresort to force as a last alternative and, in that context, a better \nchance to get other countries, perhaps countries even in the Arab \nworld, to be supportive of the use of force against Iraq at the present \ntime as they were in the gulf war in 1991.\n  Extensive consideration has to be given, in my judgment, to the \nimpact on the Arab world. Egyptian President Mubarak has been emphatic \nin his concern as to what the impact will be there. So we ought to make \nevery effort we can to enlist the aid of as many of the nations in the \nArab world as possible.\n  If Saddam Hussein rebuffs the United Nations, again raising the \nunmistakable inference that he has something to hide, then I think the \nchances of getting additional allies there would be improved.\n  With respect to the situation with Israel, there is, again, grave \nconcern that a war with Iraq will result in Scud missiles being \ndirected toward Israel. Some 39 of those Scud missiles were directed \ntoward Israel during the gulf war. Their missile defense system was not \nvery good. Now we know that Israel has the Arrow system, but still all \nof Israel is not protected. The Arrow system has not been adequately \ntested.\n  In the gulf war in 1991, the Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir \nhonored the request of President Bush not to retaliate. It is a \ndifferent situation at the present time with Israeli Prime Minister \nSharon having announced if Israel is attacked, Israel will not sit back \nagain.\n  When former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft published a \nvery erudite op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal in August, he \nraised the grave concern that with Israeli nuclear power, there could \nbe an Armageddon in the Mideast. Former National Security Adviser Brent \nScowcroft was advising caution; that we ought not proceed without \nexhausting every other alternative.\n  A similar position was taken by former Secretary of State James Baker \nin an op-ed piece, again in August, in the New York Times urging that \ninspections be pursued as a way of possibly avoiding a war.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/07/senate-section/article/S10004-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10004-S10006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 DELEGATION OF CONGRESSIONAL AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, one other issue is of concern to me, and \nthat is the question of delegation of congressional authority to the \nPresident. The constitutional mandate--and I spoke to this subject last \nThursday and will not repeat a good bit of what I said--but the \ndoctrine of separation of powers precludes the Congress from delegating \nits core constitutional authority to the executive branch.\n  I had occasion to study that subject in some detail on the question \nof the delegation of congressional authority on base-closing \ncommissions. There is a substantial body of authority on the \nlimitations of the delegation of congressional authority.\n  In an extensive treatise by Professor Francis Wormuth, professor of \npolitical science at the University of Utah, and Professor Edwin \nFirmage, professor of law at the University of Utah, the historical \ndoctrines were reviewed leading to a conclusion that the Congress may \nnot delegate the authority to engage in war.\n  If we authorize the President to use whatever force is necessary, \nthat contemplates future action. While no one is going to go to court \nto challenge the President's authority, that is of some concern, at \nleast to this Senator.\n  I discount the argument of those who say that regime change of Saddam \nHussein is motivated by the failure to finish the job in 1991 or \nSaddam's efforts to assassinate President Bush, the elder. While it is \ntrue that Vice President Cheney and Secretary of State Powell were \nprincipal participants as Secretary of Defense and as Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff on the decision not to march to Baghdad in 1991, \ntheir experience benefits the United States in this current situation.\n  I further discount the argument that President George W. Bush seeks \nto correct any mistakes of his father or that it is a personal matter, \nas some have argued, from his comment: The guy tried to kill my dad. I \nam not unaware of the psychologist's contentions that motives are \nfrequently mixed and hard to sort out, but I do think our Nation is \nfortunate to have the leadership of President Bush, Vice President \nCheney, and Secretary Powell at this perilous time.\n  I have been briefed by administration officials on a number of \noccasions, and I am looking forward to another briefing tomorrow by \nNational Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice and CIA Director George \nTenet.\n  There is substantial information about the weapons of mass \ndestruction which Saddam Hussein has available, but I am interested in \nknowing with greater precision, to the extent that the administration \ncan release it, the situation with regard to Saddam's efforts to \ndevelop nuclear weapons.\n  In evaluating the time when preemptive action may be used, Secretary \nof State Daniel Webster, in dealing with the so-called Caroline \nincident, in 1837, when British troops attacked and sank an American \nship, then-Secretary of State Webster made a point that an intrusion \ninto the territory of another State can be justified as an act of self-\ndefense only in those:\n\n       Cases in which the necessity of that self-defense is \n     instant, overwhelming and leaves no choice of means and no \n     moment of deliberation.\n\n  It is very relevant, on an evaluation of meeting that goal, as to \njust where Iraq stands on the weapons of mass destruction. In previous \nbriefings, I have sought the administration plan as to what will be \ndone after Saddam Hussein is toppled, and I think that is an area where \na great deal more thought needs to be given. The situation in Iraq \nwould obviously be contentious, with disputes between the Sunnis and \nthe Shi'ites, with the interests of the Kurds in an independent state, \nand it means a very long-term commitment by the United States.\n  We know the problems we have in Afghanistan. Iraq has to defray some \nof the costs, but what happens after Saddam Hussein is toppled has yet \nto be answered in real detail.\n  On the issue of a battle plan, perhaps that is too much for the \nadministration to tell the Congress, but as a Senator representing 12 \nmillion Pennsylvanians, in a country of 280 million Americans, I think \nwe ought to have some idea as to how we are going to proceed and what \nthe casualties may be.\n  All of this is to say there are many questions and many issues to be \nconsidered. The predictions are numerous that the Congress of the \nUnited States will pass a resolution authorizing the use of force by an \noverwhelming majority. I am not prepared to disagree with that. And on \na proper showing of the imminence of problems with Saddam Hussein and \non a proper showing that this is the last recourse, my vote may well be \ncast with the administration as well. But I am interested in hearing \ndebate on the floor of the Senate as to the relative merits of \nrequiring U.N. multilateral action as a condition for the use of force, \ncontrasted with U.S. unilateral action.\n  If we require U.N. multilateral action, we do subject ourselves to \nthe\n\n[[Page S10005]]\n\nveto of France, China, and Russia, which is undesirable. If we \nauthorize the use of force unilaterally by the President, then we may \nwell be setting a precedent which could come back to haunt us with \nnations such as China going after Taiwan or a nation such as India or \nPakistan going after the other.\n  I look forward to the additional briefing tomorrow, and I look \nforward to the debate which we will be having on the Senate floor on \nthese very important issues.\n  I note that the distinguished President pro tempore has come to the \nfloor. While this is not prearranged and I have not given him any \nwarning--although I do not think Senator Byrd needs any warning on \nconstitutional issues--I would be interested in the views of the \nSenator from West Virginia, if he cares to give them, on this issue of \ndelegation of authority.\n  Earlier in my presentation, as I said last Thursday, I talked about \nthis issue and referred to the treatise by Professors Wormuth and \nFirmage of the University of Utah where in a chapter devoted to the \ndelegation of the war power the professors say:\n\n       That Congress may not transfer to the executive . . . \n     functions for which Congress itself has been made \n     responsible. Of course, the power to declare war is a core \n     congressional responsibility.\n\n  Chief Justice Marshall said--and I am leaving out some of the \nirrelevant parts--it will not be contended Congress can delegate powers \nwhich are exclusively legislative. And Hamilton argued in the \nFederalist to the effect that it is impossible for Congress to enact \ngoverning standards for launching future wars and, thus, spoke about \nthe impermissibility of delegating the power to declare war.\n  The treatise notes the prohibition against the delegation of such \npower:\n\n       To initiate a war in a future international environment in \n     which significant details, perhaps even major outlines, \n     change from month to month or even from day to day. The \n     posture of international affairs of the future cannot be \n     known to Congress at the time the resolution is passed.\n\n  According to Henry Clay, a great Senator, the Constitution requires \nthat Congress itself appraise the immediate circumstances before the \nNation voluntarily enters into a state of war.\n  Clay's argument went beyond that. He argued that:\n\n       Congress itself cannot make a declaration of a future war \n     dependent upon the occurrence of stipulated facts, because \n     war is an enterprise in which all the contemporary \n     circumstances must be weighed.\n\n  If we adopt the resolution, we will be saying that the President has \nthe authority to use force, and that will be a decision which the \nPresident will make in futuro--some time in the future.\n  I am interested in the views of my distinguished colleague from West \nVirginia as to whether that is an unconstitutional or constitutional \ndelegation of Congress' authority to declare war.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Lincoln). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. The distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania does me great \nhonor in making his inquiry. I am not prepared to respond at the \nmoment. I would be interested in reading the treatise by the persons \nnamed.\n  I might suggest that the Supreme Court, in its recent decision with \nreference to the line-item veto, strongly indicated that Congress \ncannot cede its powers under the Constitution.\n  I believe the court in that instance was alluding to certain powers \nover the purse.\n  This is a good question the distinguished Senator has posed. Based on \nhis wide and rich experience as a prosecuting attorney, I think such \nquestions as he raised are worthy of our attention. I would certainly \nwant to be better prepared than I am at this moment to attempt to deal \nwith the particular question he has asked. I thank him for his \nstatement. I have been listening to his statement from my office. He \nraises serious questions which ought to be answered, ought to be \ndebated.\n  I think we are hurrying too fast into this situation. I, as the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, have heard all of these predictions as to \nhow fast the Senate and House will act. It may be that the train has \ngathered such momentum it will not be possible to slow it down, but I \nhope and pray this decision can be put off until after the election. I \nthink it is too grave a decision. I think our fighting men and women \nneed to be shown much greater regard than this, that we would not rush \ninto having a vote on this resolution before it is adequately debated \nand amended.\n  I view with great concern the judgment that history will make of us \nfor rushing into this decision, as we seem to be doing. I am concerned \nthat Members of both Houses will have their decision tainted by the \nfact that it is going to be rendered in an atmosphere that is \nsupercharged with politics. I have always had a great deal of \nconfidence in the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter. He is not one \nto be rushed or stampeded into making a decision. He always asks \nquestions. He has the courage, the conviction, to stand up and state \nhis principles and ask questions. That is what I hear him doing now. I \nam sorry I cannot respond to the questions the Senator posed, but I am \nglad to have this opportunity to make the comment aboout the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania and what he is doing today, the questions he is \nasking.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nWest Virginia for his response. I have raised quite a number of \nquestions in the presentation I have made today. I am prepared to honor \nthe President's request that we vote on this matter before we adjourn, \nbut I think we ought to take the time to debate that need. There are a \ngreat many questions to be answered.\n  I look forward to having more of our colleagues on the floor. We were \nscheduled to go to this resolution at 1 p.m. today, and it is now 1:23. \nThese issues about where the inspections are going to lead are \nimportant. These questions about the ramifications of acting alone are \nimportant. We do not want to repeat the mistakes of not going after bin \nLaden, as we had good cause to prior to 9/11.\n  We accused the generals of always fighting the last war. We have \nlearned a bitter lesson from September 11, and we had cause to act in \nadvance. We have to ask all this.\n  There is another issue I mention briefly before concluding, and that \nis the difference in language between the 1991 resolution, which says \nthe President is authorized to use the Armed Forces in order to achieve \nthe implementation of Security Council resolutions, and contrast it \nwith the language of the two resolutions which are now pending, the \nresolution introduced by Senator Lieberman and another resolution \nintroduced by Senators Daschle and Lott which say the President is \nauthorized to use all means he determines to be appropriate.\n  ``All means that the President deems to be appropriate'' is a \nsubjective standard, which is different from the authority which the \nCongress gave President Bush in 1991, saying the President is \nauthorized to use the U.S. Armed Forces in order to achieve \nimplementation of Security Council resolutions, which we call in the \nlaw ``objective standard'' as opposed to subjective standard.\n  When we have other Senators on the floor, I will look for an \nopportunity to discuss this and to have a clarification as to what is \nmeant here.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague from West Virginia.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 78\n\n       Whereas the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg \n     was convened to try individuals for crimes against \n     international law committed during World War II;\n       Whereas the Nuremberg tribunal provision which held that \n     ``crimes against international law are committed by men, not \n     by abstract entities, and only by punishing individuals who \n     commit such crimes can the provisions of international law be \n     enforced'' is as valid today as it was in 1946;\n       Whereas, on August 2, 1990, and without provocation, Iraq \n     initiated a war of aggression against the sovereign state of \n     Kuwait;\n       Whereas the Charter of the United Nations imposes on its \n     members the obligations to ``refrain in their international \n     relations from the threat or use of force against the \n     territorial integrity or political independence of any \n     state'';\n       Whereas the leaders of the Government of Iraq, a country \n     which is a member of the United Nations, did violate this \n     provision of the United Nations Charter;\n       Whereas the Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of \n     Civilian Persons in Times of War (the Fourth Geneva \n     Convention) imposes certain obligations upon a belligerent \n     State, occupying another country by force of arms, in order \n     to protect the civilian population of the occupied territory \n     from some of the ravages of the conflict;\n       Whereas both Iraq and Kuwait are parties to the Fourth \n     Geneva Convention;\n\n[[Page S10006]]\n\n       Whereas the public testimony of witnesses and victims has \n     indicated that Iraqi officials violated Article 27 of the \n     Fourth Geneva Convention by their inhumane treatment and acts \n     of violence against the Kuwaiti civilian population;\n       Whereas the public testimony of witnesses and victims has \n     indicated that Iraqi officials violated Articles 31 and 32 of \n     the Fourth Geneva Convention by subjecting Kuwaiti civilians \n     to physical coercion, suffering and extermination in order to \n     obtain information;\n       Whereas in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention, from \n     January 18, 1991, to February 25, 1991, Iraq did fire 39 \n     missiles on Israel in 18 separate attacks with the intent of \n     making it a party to war and with the intent of killing or \n     injuring innocent civilians, killing 2 persons directly, \n     killing 12 people indirectly (through heart attacks, improper \n     use of gas masks, choking), and injuring more than 200 \n     persons;\n       Whereas Article 146 of the Fourth Geneva Convention states \n     that persons committing ``grave breaches'' are to be \n     apprehended and subjected to trial;\n       Whereas, on several occasions, the United Nations Security \n     Council has found Iraq's treatment of Kuwaiti civilians to be \n     in violation of international law;\n       Whereas, in Resolution 665, adopted on August 25, 1990, the \n     United Nations Security Council deplored ``the loss of \n     innocent life stemming from the Iraq invasion of Kuwait'';\n       Whereas, in Resolution 670, adopted by the United Nations \n     Security Council on September 25, 1990, it condemned further \n     ``the treatment by Iraqi forces on Kuwait nationals and \n     reaffirmed that the Fourth Geneva Convention applied to \n     Kuwait'';\n       Whereas, in Resolution 674, the United Nations Security \n     Council demanded that Iraq cease mistreating and oppressing \n     Kuwaiti nationals in violation of the Convention and reminded \n     Iraq that it would be liable for any damage or injury \n     suffered by Kuwaiti nationals due to Iraq's invasion and \n     illegal occupation;\n       Whereas Iraq is a party to the Prisoners of War Convention \n     and there is evidence and testimony that during the Persian \n     Gulf War, Iraq violated articles of the Convention by its \n     physical and psychological abuse of military and civilian \n     POW's including members of the international press;\n       Whereas Iraq has committed deliberate and calculated crimes \n     of environmental terrorism, inflicting grave risk to the \n     health and well-being of innocent civilians in the region by \n     its willful ignition of 732 Kuwaiti oil wells in January and \n     February, 1991;\n       Whereas President Clinton found ``compelling evidence'' \n     that the Iraqi Intelligence Service directed and pursued an \n     operation to assassinate former President George Bush in \n     April 1993 when he visited Kuwait;\n       Whereas Saddam Hussein and other Iraqi officials have \n     systematically attempted to destroy the Kurdish population in \n     Iraq through the use of chemical weapons against civilian \n     Kurds, campaigns in 1987-88 which resulted in the \n     disappearance of more than 182,000 persons and the \n     destruction of more than 4,000 villages, the placement of \n     more than 10 million landmines in Iraqi Kurdistan, and ethnic \n     cleansing in the city of Kirkuk;\n       Whereas the Republic of Iraq is a signatory to \n     international agreements including the Universal Declaration \n     on Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and \n     Political Rights, the Convention on the Prevention and \n     Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, and the POW Convention, \n     and is obligated to comply with these international \n     agreements;\n       Whereas section 8 of Resolution 687 of the United Nations \n     Security Council, adopted on April 3, 1991, requires Iraq to \n     ``unconditionally accept the destruction, removal, or \n     rendering harmless, under international supervision of all \n     chemical and biological weapons and all stocks of agents and \n     all related subsystems and components and all research, \n     development, support, and manufacturing facilities'';\n       Whereas Saddam Hussein and the Republic of Iraq have \n     persistently and flagrantly violated the terms of Resolution \n     687 with respect to elimination of weapons of mass \n     destruction and inspections by international supervisors;\n       Whereas there is good reason to believe that Iraq continues \n     to have stockpiles of chemical and biological munitions, \n     missiles capable of transporting such agents, and the \n     capacity to produce such weapons of mass destruction, putting \n     the international community at risk;\n       Whereas, on February 22, 1993, the United Nations Security \n     Council adopted Resolution 808 establishing an international \n     tribunal to try individuals accused of violations of \n     international law in the former Yugoslavia;\n       Whereas, on November 8, 1994, the United Nations Security \n     Council adopted Resolution 955 establishing an international \n     tribunal to try individuals accused of the commission of \n     violations of international law in Rwanda;\n       Whereas more than 70 individuals have faced indictments \n     handed down by the International Criminal Tribunal for the \n     former Yugoslavia in the Hague for war crimes and crimes \n     against humanity in the former Yugoslavia, leading in the \n     first trial to the sentencing of a Serb jailer to 20 years in \n     prison;\n       Whereas the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda has \n     indicted 31 individuals, with three trials occurring at \n     present and 27 individuals in custody;\n       Whereas the United States has to date spent more than $24 \n     million for the International Criminal Tribunal for the \n     Former Yugoslavia and more than $20 million for the \n     International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda;\n       Whereas officials such as former President George Bush, \n     Vice President Al Gore, General Norman Schwarzkopf and others \n     have labeled Saddam Hussein a war criminal and called for his \n     indictment; and\n       Whereas a failure to try and punish leaders and other \n     persons for crimes against international law establishes a \n     dangerous precedent and negatively impacts the value of \n     deterrence to future illegal acts: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the President should--\n       (1) call for the creation of a commission under the \n     auspices of the United Nations to establish an international \n     record of the criminal culpability of Saddam Hussein and \n     other Iraqi officials;\n       (2) call for the United Nations to form an international \n     criminal tribunal for the purpose of indicting, prosecuting, \n     and imprisoning Saddam Hussein and other Iraqi official who \n     are responsible for crimes against humanity, genocide, and \n     other violations of international law; and\n       (3) upon the creation of such an international criminal \n     tribunal seek the reprogramming of necessary funds to support \n     the efforts of the tribunal, including the gathering of \n     evidence necessary to indict, prosecute and imprison Saddam \n     Hussein and other Iraqi officials.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 4 \np.m. shall be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or \ntheir designees with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 15 \nminutes each.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent I may have an additional 5 minutes \nover the 15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, tonight at 8:00 p.m., President Bush will \nmake a televised address to speak to the Nation about the threat of \nIraq. According to press reports from this weekend, the President is \nexpected to lay out, in detail, his case against Saddam Hussein, \nincluding the repressive dictator's long history of violence and \naggression.\n  There is no disagreement about the character of Saddam Hussein, \nneither on Capitol Hill nor in the minds of every American. But while \nthe President continues to make his case against Saddam Hussein, the \nissue on the minds of Senators and our constituents is, what exactly is \nthe United States planning to do?\n  Rather than hearing more about Saddam Hussein--we know enough about \nhim--what we need to hear from the President are answers to our \nquestions about what he plans to do in Iraq. We need to know why the \nPresident is demanding that we act now. We need to have some idea of \nwhat we are getting ourselves into, what the costs and consequences may \nbe, and what the President is planning to do after the fighting has \nstopped. After Iraq. After Saddam Hussein. It is not unpatriotic to ask \nthese questions, especially when they are already on the minds of all \nAmericans.\n  Why now? Those two little words: Why now?\n  Why now? What has changed in the last year, 6 months, or 2 weeks that \nwould compel us to attack now?\n  Is Iraq on the verge of attacking the United States? If so, should \nour homeland security alert be elevated? Shouldn't the President be \nspending more time with his military advisors in Washington, instead of \nmaking campaign speeches all over the country?\n  The media reports suggest that the administration does not plan to \nact\n\n[[Page S10007]]\n\nuntil February. Why is the President telling Congress it has to act \nbefore the elections? Why are our own leaders telling us we have to act \nbefore the elections.\n  What are we signing up for?\n  We are about to give the President a blank check to deal with Iraq \nhowever he sees fit. What exactly is he planning to do with this power?\n  Does the President have clear objectives for this war? Does he want \nto disarm Saddam Hussein, or remove him from power?\n  When might the fighting end? What conditions must be met before the \nPresident would determine that the war is over?\n  The President has said several times that he wants to use force in \norder to bring Iraq into compliance with its international obligations. \nWhy is he then demanding that Congress go even further and give him a \nblank check that would give him the power to commit our country to \nyears or even decades of bloody war without the support of our allies?\n  We have already given the President a blank check to deal with al-\nQaida, which he used to invade and occupy Afghanistan. Does the \nPresident plan to fight these two wars separately, or will the \nPresident combine them into a broader regional campaign?\n  What will be the costs of this war?\n  How many troops will be involved? Will we exercise the heavy ground \noption or will we exercise the heavy air option? Or might we exercise \nboth options? How many reservists will have to leave their jobs to \nserve in uniform?\n  Will they be fighting door-to-door combat in downtown Bagdad?\n  Do our troops have adequate protection against the chemical and \nbiological weapons that Saddam Hussein might employ?\n  How many American casualties is the Department of Defense \nanticipating in case the heavy ground option is utilized? How many \nAmerican casualties is the Department of Defense anticipating. ?\n  In addition to the cost in blood, war is also a drain on the national \ntreasury. How much will it cost to fight this war and to maintain an \noccupation force? Larry Lindsey said it would cost $100 billion to $200 \nbillion, talking about this war and what it would cost. One hundred to \ntwo hundred billion dollars, and he said: That's nothing. During the \nGulf War, our allies contributed $54 billion of the $61 billion cost of \nthe war. Leaving the United States holding the bag for roughly $7 \nbillion, a little over $7 billion out of the $61.1 billion total. Will \nour allies give us financial assistance in this war? Has anyone been \nasking them to divvy it up, to help pay the financial cost, or do we \nplan to shoulder it all?\n  Do we have the resources to care for our injured and sick veterans \nwhen they return from Iraq? Are our hospitals in this country prepared \nfor that event?\n  Will there be other consequences to a war with Iraq?\n  How will the war against Iraq affect the fight against terrorism? How \nmany of us will feel safer here in this country at night, when the \nshades of evening fall? How many of us will feel safer, once an attack \nagainst Iraq is launched? Will National Guard troops be removed from \nimportant homeland security missions in the United States?\n  If we act without the approval of the international community, what \nhappens to the international cooperation in the war on terror we worked \nso hard to foster after 9/11?\n  How will a war between the United States and Iraq affect regional \nstability in the Middle East?\n  What will we do if Iraq attacks Israel? Can we persuade Israel to \nstay out of the war, or will we just stand by and watch them join in \nthe fighting?\n  Are we putting more moderate regimes in the Middle East at risk, like \nJordan, or Pakistan, which already has nuclear weapons. If a more \nradical government takes over in Pakistan, are we prepared to act there \nas well?\n  What happens after the war?\n  Who will govern a defeated Iraq?\n  How long will our troops be expected to occupy Iraq?\n  Do we expect Iraqis to rise up against Saddam Hussein, or take arms \nagainst us?\n  What plans do we have to prevent Iraq from breaking up and descending \ninto civil war?\n  How can we contain the instability that will likely result in the \nnorth of Iraq that may threaten Turkey, our friend and NATO ally? Are \nwe giving any thought to this? Is anybody in the administration giving \nthoughts to this question?\n  In his weekend radio address, the president told us that:\n\n     should force be required to bring Saddam to account, the \n     United States will work with other nations to help the Iraqi \n     people rebuild and form a just government.\n\n  What does he mean by that? Is the President advocating a new Marshall \nPlan for the Middle East? Are the American people ready to make that \nkind of long-term regional commitment?\n  How much will the American taxpayer pay to rebuild Iraq? How much \nwill our allies pay? If the United States should act alone in attacking \nIraq, can we really expect the rest of the world to help rebuild Iraq \nafter the war? Have any other countries committed to assisting in these \npeacekeeping duties? If so, how many? Can we afford to rebuild Iraq and \nAfghanistan at the same time? We may have to rebuild Israel as well.\n\n  I have a lot of questions. The American people have a lot of \nquestions. But apparently the American people are not going to be \nasked. They are not going to be given the opportunity to ask their \nquestions.\n  We are going to be stampeded and rushed pellmell into a showdown \nright here in the Senate and in the House, and in the next few days. \nWhy all the hurry? Why are we in such a hurry? Election day is 4 weeks \naway from tomorrow. Wouldn't it be better to go home and listen to the \npeople, hear what they have to say, and answer their questions before \nvoting on this far-reaching, grave, and troubling question?\n  Every one of the questions the American people have is important. \nWithout better answers from the President, we will only be getting part \nof the story, which is a dangerous position for Congress to be in as we \nprepare to vote on a war resolution this week or next week.\n  It is a sad thing that the elected representatives of the American \npeople are being asked to vote on this troubling question before the \nelection.\n  But the administration is not giving us meaningful answers to these \nquestions. All we are getting are vague threats and political pressure \nfrom the White House. The President has not backed up his case against \nIraq with a consistent justification based on clear reason and \nevidence. When the President and his advisers are pressed for clarity, \nthey have responded with evasive and confusing references to the \ndangers of terrorism which they now seem to think has more to do with \nSaddam Hussein than Osama bin Laden. Defense Secretary Rumsfeld \nrevealed that recently when he told the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee:\n\n       I suggest that any who insist on perfect evidence are back \n     in the 20th century and still thinking in pre-9-11 terms.\n\n  In other words, it is just too hard for them to answer all of these \nquestions, so Congress should just hand everything over to the \nPresident, and he will determine by himself what is ``necessary and \nappropriate'' when the time comes. Until then, the administration will \nprovide Congress and the American people with very little information.\n  We need to know this information, and we need to know it now, before \nwe are pressured into making a hasty decision about whether to send the \nsons and daughters of Americans to war in a foreign land; namely, Iraq.\n  The President's military doctrine will give him a free hand to \njustify almost any military action with unsubstantiated allegations and \narbitrary risk assessments, and Congress is about to rubberstamp that \ndoctrine and simply step out of the way.\n  I cannot understand why much of the leadership of this Congress has \nbought into the administration's political pressure. Congress will be \nout of the business of making any decisions about war, and the voice of \nthe people will quickly be drowned out by the White House beating the \ndrums of war.\n  There is no need for Congress to underwrite the President's new \nmilitary doctrine. If the United States uses force against Iraq, then \nCongress can provide the President with enough authority to act \ndecisively in Iraq. Any\n\n[[Page S10008]]\n\nfurther actions the President wants to take should be decided on a \ncase-by-case basis. We should not get carried away by all of the war \nrhetoric and turn this Iraq resolution into a blank check for the \nPresident to enforce some vague new doctrine in every corner of the \nMiddle East or the world beyond. Granting him such broad power would \nnot only set a dangerous international precedent but would severely \nundermine our own constitutional system of checks and balances.\n  Some say that the process laid out in the Constitution will be \nsatisfied once Congress votes on whether to authorize war. But Congress \nmust not grant the use of force authorization without a full \nunderstanding of the consequences. We will be voting to decide whether \nwe will allow the President to declare war at his convenience for an \nunlimited period of time. That does not satisfy the Constitution. After \nall, the President has repeatedly said he has not decided whether we \nmust go to war.\n  Do we want to just give the President and all future Presidents an \nauthorization for war that they can put in their hip pockets, to be \npulled out whenever it is convenient? That is not the course of action \nworthy of the greatness the Founding Fathers expected when they created \nthe legislative branch.\n  We should not have this vote on the issue for war or for peace before \nthe Congress has answers to these questions. The President, when he \nspeaks to the Nation tonight, must provide real answers to these \nquestions that the American people are asking.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I say to my valued friend and colleague \non the Senate Armed Services Committee that I thought we had an \nexcellent debate on Friday afternoon, at which time a number of the \npoints the Senator from West Virginia raised today were discussed. But \nI believe the administration has worked diligently in consultation with \nthe Congress--most particularly the appropriate committees--the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, on which my colleague from West Virginia and \nI are privileged to serve, and also our colleague from Georgia, as well \nas the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  These questions, I believe, and the information that can be made \navailable are and perhaps will again in the next day or so be made \navailable to the Congress. I know I have, I say to my good friend from \nWest Virginia, pressed the administration to see whether or not further \ninformation that now has classification can be given.\n  I and other Members of the Senate were back with our constituencies \nthis weekend. I had about five meetings with my constituents at various \nplaces, and foremost in their minds is the seriousness of this \nsituation we face with Saddam Hussein and his regime which possesses \nthese weapons of mass destruction.\n  I believe this debate is evolving. I believe the Congress is in \npossession of those facts to justify a vote on the resolution, which \nSenator Lieberman, Senator Bayh, Senator McCain, and I have drawn up in \naccordance with consultations with the White House and the leadership.\n  I thought we got off to a good start on Friday. I thank my colleague \nfor the opportunity to debate him--and we do very vigorously, and \nundoubtedly we will continue. But I believe, if I might say \nrespectfully to my colleague from West Virginia, it is a good, strong \nrecord for the Congress and the American people. And there may be \nadditional facts forthcoming. Certainly, we should await the \nPresident's message to the Nation and to the world with great respect \nbecause he has time and time again said war is the last option, the use \nof force is the last option. He pursued diligently diplomatic means \nbefore, not only with the United Nations but in one-to-one meetings \nhimself, and the Secretary of State with the heads of state and \ngovernments in a great many nations.\n  I believe progress has been made in all directions.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Madam President, we as Members of the Senate, are now \nbeing asked by the Commander in Chief to make the most serious decision \nwe can make: the decision to authorize him potentially to send our \nyoung American men and women in the American military into harm's way. \nWhen I was a young man in the mid-1960s, the U.S. Congress authorized \nthe use of force against North Vietnam, and I volunteered to fight in \nthat war. Three times since I came to the Senate--on Iraq in 1998, on \nKosovo in 1999, and then last year on al-Qaida and international \nterrorism--I have been asked by the Commander in Chief to authorize the \nuse of military force to achieve our Nation's objectives, and all three \ntimes I voted to authorize the use of force. This is now the fourth \noccasion I have been asked to give my consent to such action, and each \ntime I have thought back to the words of one who occupied the same seat \nin the Senate I now have the privilege to hold, Dick Russell. Senator \nRussell said:\n\n       While it is a sound policy to have limited objectives, we \n     should not expose our men to unnecessary hazards to life and \n     limb in pursuing them. As for me, my fellow Americans, I \n     shall never knowingly support a policy of sending even a \n     single American boy overseas to risk his life in combat \n     unless the entire civilian population and wealth of our \n     country--all that we have and all that we are--is to bear a \n     commensurate responsibility in giving him the fullest support \n     and protection of which we are capable.\n\n  That was a marvelous quote by Senator Russell in the 1960s.\n  While we need to update Senator Russell's statement to encompass the \nyoung women who now also put themselves into harm's way when we go to \nwar, I think it stands the test of time very well and speaks to us all \nnow as we contemplate our second declaration of war in the last 12 \nmonths. I believe its counsel of limited ends but sufficient means is \nsage advice now, as it was when first uttered under the shadow of the \nVietnam war.\n  The leading military analyst of the Vietnam War, the late Col. Harry \nSummers, wrote in his excellent book, ``On Strategy: The Vietnam War in \nContext'':\n\n       The first principle of war is the principle of The \n     Objective. It is the first principle because all else flows \n     from it . . . How to determine military objectives that will \n     achieve or assist in achieving the political objectives of \n     the United States is the primary task of the military \n     strategist, thus the relationship between military and \n     political objectives is critical. Prior to any future \n     commitment of U.S. military forces our military leaders must \n     insist that the civilian leadership provide tangible, \n     obtainable political goals. The political objective cannot \n     merely be a platitude but must be stated in concrete terms. \n     While such objectives may very well change during the course \n     of the war, it is essential that we begin with an \n     understanding of where we intend to go. As Clausewitz said, \n     we should not ``take the first step without considering the \n     last.'' In other words, we (and perhaps, more important, the \n     American people) need to have a definition of ``victory.''\n\n  Colonel Summers continues:\n\n       There is an inherent contradiction between the military and \n     its civilian leaders on this issue. For both domestic and \n     international political purposes the civilian leaders want \n     maximum flexibility and maneuverability and are hesitant to \n     fix on firm objectives. The military on the other hand need \n     just such a firm objective as early as possible in order to \n     plan and conduct military operations.\n\n  Since we are indeed being asked to authorize the commitment of U.S. \nmilitary forces, it is our responsibility--I would say it is our \nobligation--as the civilian leadership to provide our Armed Forces with \n``tangible, obtainable political goals.'' In other words, we have to \ndefine now, before the fighting starts, what the objective is.\n  It is crystal clear to me what the appropriate, achievable, \ninternationally supported and sanctioned objective is at the present \ntime and in the present case: not simply the admission of weapons \ninspectors but the verified destruction of Saddam Hussein's store of \nweapons of mass destruction. This is the matter which makes the Iraqi \nregime a danger requiring international attention beyond that which is \nafforded to the all too numerous other regimes which oppress their own \npeople, or threaten regional peace, or fail to fulfill their \ninternational obligations. It is the objective which President Bush has \nbeen increasingly centered on in his calls for action by the UN. For \nexample, in his September 26 meeting with congressional leaders, the \nPresident put it very well. He said:\n\n\n[[Page S10009]]\n\n\n       We are engaged in a deliberate and civil and thorough \n     discussion. We are moving toward a strong resolution . . . \n     And by passing this resolution we'll send a clear message to \n     the world and to the Iraqi regime: the demands of the U.N. \n     Security Council must be followed. The Iraqi dictator must be \n     disarmed. These requirements will be met, or they will be \n     enforced.\n\n  And this objective, the disarming of Saddam Hussein, is the objective \nwhich this Senate, this Congress is prepared to overwhelmingly endorse \nas we close ranks behind the President.\n  Adoption of the force resolution authorization will satisfy our \nobligations to make it clear to the international community that \nAmerica stands united in its determination to rid the world of Iraq's \nweapons of mass destruction. And it will fulfill our responsibility to \nour military and our service men and women to provide a tangible, \nmilitarily obtainable objective. But it will not discharge this \nCongress of all responsibility with respect to our policy on Iraq.\n  In retrospect, it seems to me that the real failure of Congress in \nthe Vietnam war was not so much passage of the open-ended Gulf of \nTonkin resolution by near unanimous margins in both Houses--based as it \nwas on what we now regard as very dubious information supplied by the \nexecutive branch and what those Senators and Representatives had to \ntake at face value--but its subsequent failure for too many years to \nexercise its constitutional responsibilities as that authorization lead \nto a cost and level of commitment that few, if any, foresaw at the \ntime. I would note that Senator Russell actually got the following \nlanguage added to the Gulf of Tonkin resolution itself:\n\n       This resolution shall expire when the President shall \n     determine that the peace and security of the area is \n     reasonably assured by international conditions created by \n     action of the United Nations, or otherwise, except that it \n     may be terminated earlier by concurrent resolution of the \n     Congress.\n\n  Our duty, and the duty of this Congress and its successors, to our \nNation's security and to our service men and women with respect to Iraq \nwill not end merely with the passage of the pending resolution. We have \na constitutional and moral responsibility to continue to review the \nevolving situation and to ask the hard questions. I did so on each of \nthe three previous occasions when I have supported an authorization of \nthe use of military force. I asked those questions on Iraq in 1998, on \nKosovo in 1999, and then last year on al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden and \nthe international terrorism war. And I will do so again with respect to \nIraq.\n  After the 1990-1991 gulf war and after the final end of the cold war, \nthen Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Colin Powell, propounded a \nlist of six questions which he believed must be addressed before we \ncommit to a military intervention:\n\n       Is the political objective important, clearly defined, and \n     well understood?\n       Second, have all nonviolent means been tried and failed?\n       Additionally, will military force actually achieve the \n     objective?\n       What will be the cost?\n       Have the gains and risks been thoroughly analyzed?\n       And finally, after the intervention, how will the situation \n     likely evolve and what will the consequences be?\n\n  I have already discussed the first question, the mission, and to the \nextent we focus on disarmament, I believe we satisfy Colin Powell's \nfirst criterion. The second, as to nonmilitary means, is being asked \nright now, at the United Nations, at Vienna, and in other world \ncapitals. And while what the President calls a ``decade of deception'' \nby Iraq must make one very skeptical about the possibility for a \nsatisfactory diplomatic resolution, I believe we should and must give \nit one final chance before considering the military option. As to the \neffectiveness of military force, since the President has not made any \nfinal decisions, he says, as to what kind of military operation, if \nany, will be undertaken, it is premature to make a firm determination, \nbut in principle, given the outstanding capabilities of our Armed \nForces, and what will hopefully be a well-defined mission, I believe we \ncan answer in the affirmative. So far, so good.\n  But when we turn to the final three of General Powell's questions \nthat he asked years ago, we see the need for some serious and sustained \nattention not only by the administration but by the Congress as well.\n  What will be the cost? And here we need to factor in not only the \ncost in terms of the immediate military operation, but also potential \ncosts of what could be a very long-term occupation and nation-building \nphase. Among the many reasons we need to actively seek to build as \nlarge an international coalition as possible behind whatever we \neventually undertake in Iraq is to help with the aftermath. I want to \nsingle out the leadership of my friends and colleagues from across the \naisle, Senators Lugar and Hagel, in calling the country's and the \nSenate's attention to the importance of this aspect of our Iraq policy.\n  And what about the cost for our economy? The mere threat of war has \nsent oil prices upward and caused shudders on Wall Street. What will a \nfull blown war do?\n  Have the gains and risks been thoroughly analyzed? And after the \nintervention, how will the situation likely evolve and what will be the \nconsequences? These two are closely related in that, in my view, the \nlong-term consequences have been the least discussed part of the \nequation thus far. If, as some believe, the consequence of a U.S. \ninvasion of Iraq will be a united, democratic Iraq which can serve as a \n``role model'' for the rest of the Arab world. Maybe, but such an \noutcome would not only fly in the face of Iraq's entire history since \nbeing created out of a British mandate at the end of the First World \nWar but would appear to be contrary to much of what we have seen in the \naftermath of other recent U.S. interventions, including most recently \nin Afghanistan. Perhaps, most importantly, we need to make absolutely \ncertain that whatever we do in Iraq does not distract or detract from \nthe war we authorized 12 months ago, our war on terrorism, which \nremains, in my view, job No. 1, mission No. 1, objective No. 1, one for \nour national security policy.\n  So these are the kinds of questions I will be asking, and I hope I \nwill be joined by colleagues from both sides of the aisle in asking, as \nwe move forward.\n  It now appears the Senate may have at least three alternatives to \nconsider as we move forward on authorizing force against Saddam \nHussein: the Biden-Lugar-Hagel resolution; a Levin resolution; and the \nresolution endorsed by the President, the House leadership and a \nbipartisan group of Senators. I certainly wish to pay tribute to all of \nthe Senators involved in crafting all of these alternatives. Without \nexception, they are acting out of conscience and conviction in \npromoting our national security. And I believe most Senators share the \nviews that diplomacy is preferential to force, and that proceeding with \nthe input and support of the international community, including the \nUnited Nations, is far better and more effective than going it alone.\n  I will be supporting the resolution backed by the President and \nopposing the alternatives because I believe it is imperative that we \nnow speak with one voice to Saddam Hussein, to the entire international \ncommunity and, most importantly, to our servicemen and women. A strong, \nbipartisan vote for the pending resolution will strengthen the \nPresident's hand in his efforts to get the international community to \nstep up to the plate and deal effectively with the threat posed by \nIraq's weapons of mass destruction, and give the diplomats one last \nchance to secure Saddam Hussein's final, unconditional surrender of \nthose weapons, as he has pledged since 1991.\n  The objective of our policy against Saddam Hussein should be a regime \nof unfettered inspections leading to full disarmament of Iraq's weapons \nof mass destruction. If diplomacy fails, the military objective must be \nthe complete destruction of such weapons. Regime change may come but, \nbecause of the large costs and massive uncertainties this will \ninevitably produce, this should be the last resort, not the first.\n  We must not repeat the most disturbing display of partisanship with \nrespect to national security to have occurred in the time I have served \nin the Congress. I am referring to the extremely disturbing spectacle \nof disunity and irresolution displayed by the House of Representatives \non April 28, 1999 when, with American servicemen and women already in \ncombat against Milosevic and Serbia, the House cast a series of votes \nthat: prohibited the deployment of ground forces, which the\n\n[[Page S10010]]\n\nPresident had never asked for; defeated an attempt to remove US forces; \nand most dismaying of all, on a tie vote of 213-213, defeated the \nSenate-passed resolution authorizing the very air operations and \nmissile strikes which were even then underway. What kind of message was \nthat to send our Armed Forces personnel, or our NATO allies or \nMilosevic?\n  I implore the Senate to pull together behind the one resolution \nendorsed by the President, by the bipartisan House leadership and by a \nbipartisan group of Senators. That resolution affirms the importance of \nworking in concert with other nations, gives preference to a diplomatic \nover military solution, focuses attention where it should be on \ndisarming Saddam Hussein, seeks to ensure that we not be diverted from \nfighting the war on terrorism, and provides for the ongoing and \nConstitutional role of the Congress as events unfold in our policy \ntoward Iraq. I urge a strong and bipartisan vote in favor of the \nresolution.\n  God Bless our country and the young men and women who serve in \nuniform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rockefeller). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wonder if I might ask my very valued \nfriend and colleague a question or two.\n  With his indulgence, I would like to make a few preliminary comments. \nFirst and foremost is that we have shared for some years now a strong \nfriendship and strong working relationship, primarily through his \nservice on the Senate Armed Services Committee. There has been no \nSenator who has been more mindful of the needs of the men and women of \nthe Armed Forces than our colleague from Georgia. I felt his remarks \ntoday were exceedingly well taken, and in particular the need for a \nstrengthened resolution here in the Congress, House and Senate \ntogether, acting on a resolution which is clear in its terms, in such a \nway that there be no daylight, no perceived or actual difference \nbetween the legislative bodies of our Government--the Congress, the \nSenate and the House, and the Executive, the Commander in Chief, the \nPresident. I commend him on that point and share it.\n  In previous days on this floor, most particularly on Friday, I have \nsaid that repeatedly. That is the key, the arch of this whole debate is \nthe need to have unity of the two branches of Government.\n  I was also drawn to his excellent analysis of what we call the Powell \ndoctrine, enunciated by General Powell during his period as Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs. It is interesting today, of course, in his role as \nSecretary of State and in his testimony before the Foreign Relations \nCommittee here in the Senate, those criteria he set down are basically \nthe criteria he follows today as he represents this Nation on behalf of \nthe President and all others in the United Nations and in his constant \nseries of meetings with heads of state and government in an effort to \nbuild a coalition much like that which was built by the first President \nBush in 1991.\n  The Senator from Georgia hit on the key part of the formula of \nSecretary Powell: What is the cost? And he quite properly enunciated \nsome concerns and areas in there.\n  The question I ask is the question that has to be asked: What is the \ncost if we don't act now, act as we are doing; namely, through the \nUnited Nations, trying to exhaust all diplomatic means, act as we are \nnow acting in consultation with the heads of state and government in \norder to build a coalition, and, as I understand it, supporting in some \nway the writing of a new resolution to be considered by the Security \nCouncil which would enable a new inspection regime, this time with \nclear absolute authority, no equivocation whatsoever about the \nauthority of those going in to perform it and the consequences? \nHopefully that resolution would be forthcoming, spelling out the \nconsequences of the failure of Saddam Hussein to accept the resolution \nand indicate cooperation.\n  As my colleague knows, cooperation is essential in discharging any \ninspection regime. So that is where we are now.\n  What would be the cost, had our President not taken the initiative \nhere in the past months to bring to the very forefront of the entire \nworld the problem facing liberty and freedom with the potential of \nweapons of mass destruction being made night and day by Saddam Hussein \nin amounts far exceeding anything he would ever need to defend a \nsovereign nation?\n  What is the cost, had we not elevated this debate, had we not gone to \nthe U.N., had not the Congress been asked by the President to have a \nresolution? What is your estimate of the cost? What would be the course \nof action for the world to take?\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank the Senator for those kind words. In terms of \nthe Powell doctrine, I had a chance to listen to it up front and close \nwhen I encountered him as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the \nPentagon. We had a long discussion about being fellow Vietnam veterans, \nabout what we learned out of that war, and how he approached the world \nnow as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.\n  I can remember two elements to the Powell doctrine. The first is \nsometimes overlooked. The first should be how to use the American \nmilitary to stay out of war and, if we do get in it, win quickly. The \nsecond part of the Powell doctrine is the doctrine of superior force, \nwhat Nimitz called in the Second World War in the Pacific ``superior \nupon the point of contact.''\n  I am delighted we have a Secretary of State who understands the power \nof the first, which is using the American military to stay out of war. \nI think that is step one for me in the Powell doctrine. Step two is \nobviously if diplomacy fails, use superior force to accomplish your \nobjective. In many ways, we have been acting since 1991. We have had \nIraq under Operation Northern Watch and Southern Watch. We are covering \n40 percent of Iraqi territory as we speak, we have a naval blockade, \nand we have sanctions, so we have not been inactive since 1991.\n  What is the status of his weapons of mass destruction, which is the \nfocus of this entire debate? We really don't know, since the U.N. \ninspectors were kicked out about 4 years ago, where we stand in that \nregard. That poses a question and a threat. We know he has biological \nand chemical weapons, and he is working on a nuclear weapon. So that \nposes great danger to the Middle East, our allies, Western Europe, and \npotentially to us. Therefore, I think it is appropriate for the U.S. \nSenate to support, and the Congress to support, a resolution \nauthorizing the President to take all necessary means, including to use \nforce, to back up the original 1991 U.N. resolution authorizing \ndisarmament of Saddam Hussein and his weapons of mass destruction. For \nme, that is the political objective and the military objective.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator also made reference to the period of the \nClinton administration when President Clinton, again, in consultation \nwith the Congress, acted on the seriousness of the issues of Saddam \nHussein after he kicked out the inspectors and defied all 16 \nresolutions. We in the Senate acted, and I am going to read the \nresolution we adopted in the Senate:\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That the \n     Government of Iraq is in material and unacceptable breach of \n     its international obligations, and therefore the President is \n     urged to take appropriate action, in accordance with the \n     Constitution and relevant laws of the United States, to bring \n     Iraq into compliance with its international obligations.\n\n  Both the Senator from Georgia and I supported it, am I not correct?\n  Mr. CLELAND. That is correct. I voted for that resolution in 1998. At \none point, the resolution did not authorize the American forces to \ninvolve themselves in a regime change. In this resolution we are \nconsidering now, we are considering using American forces to not only \norder Saddam Hussein to comply with the 1991 resolution in terms of \ndisarmament, there is an ``or else'' clause that says the President can \nuse force as well.\n  Mr. WARNER. As my colleague, I assume, agrees with me, whoever is \nPresident of the United States--be it President Clinton or now \nPresident George Bush--has the inherent power to utilize the Armed \nForces of our Nation when he deems there is a threat to our security. \nThat, of course, is the essence of the debate we are undertaking now. \nSo when I read the clause where\n\n[[Page S10011]]\n\nthe Congress said ``therefore the President is urged to take \nappropriate action, in accordance with the Constitution and relevant \nlaws of the United States,'' to me, that implies a recitation of what \nwe all know since the very first President--he has the authority to use \nforce, if he deems it necessary, to bring Iraq into compliance with its \ninternational obligation.\n  I wonder if the Senator would agree with this Senator one thing that \nhas changed since this resolution is the situation in Iraq has worsened \nin the sense Saddam Hussein has had these years to proceed with his \nscheme of building weapons of mass destruction, and I think the open \nevidence shows he has achieved it in terms of the biological, and he \nhas achieved it in terms of the chemical. With respect to the nuclear \nweapons, I believe the agreed-upon set of facts is he is doing \neverything he can to complete a program. There is a difference of \nopinion as to the time within which he can complete a program to give \nhim a nuclear weapon.\n  So, in my judgment, what has changed since 1998 is the situation has \ngotten worse and more threatening from Saddam Hussein. Does my \ncolleague have a view in concurrence with the Senator from Virginia?\n  Mr. CLELAND. Two points. First, the 1998 resolution, which I \nsupported, the Senator from Virginia supported, and most of us \nsupported, called for regime change but did not authorize the use of \nAmerican military force. This resolution is different because I believe \nthe situation is different, as the Senator pointed out. The situation \nis we really don't know the exact status of the biological and chemical \ncapability of Saddam Hussein to wage warfare on his neighbors, our \nallies, our friends in the Middle East, and on us. Therefore, the 4 \nyears the inspectors have not been there gives us great pause and great \nconcern.\n  Therefore, our first step should be access to those military sites, \nthose weapons of mass destruction sites, and the destruction of those \nweapons of mass destruction and complete disarmament according to the \n1991 resolution. It is worth, in my opinion, authorizing the use of \nmilitary force to accomplish that objective.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague very much. I have enjoyed his \nobservations. I respect him very much, as he bears the scars of a brave \nsoldier on behalf of freedom while defending this country.\n  Mr. President, to conclude our colloquy, I want to read a brief \nstatement that was given by President Clinton at the time of this \nresolution:\n\n       In the next century, the community of nations may see more \n     and more the very kind of threat Iraq poses now: a rogue \n     state with weapons of mass destruction, ready to use them or \n     provide them to terrorists, drug traffickers, or organized \n     criminals, who travel the world among us unnoticed. If we \n     fail to respond today, Saddam and all those who would follow \n     in his footsteps will be emboldened tomorrow by the knowledge \n     that they can act with impunity--even in the face of a clear \n     message from the United Nations Security Council and clear \n     evidence of a weapons of mass destruction program.\n\n  Mr. President, I see others on the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, all I know is what I read in the \nnewspapers. Based on what I do know about public policy and what I read \nin the newspapers, I would be very frightened if all I knew was what I \nread in the newspapers because newspapers often get things wrong. It \nhas been interesting to me, as we have had the buildup to this \ndiscussion in the Senate about Iraq, there have been a number of very \nthoughtful pieces written that have appeared in the newspapers, and I \nwish to draw on some of those and quote from some of them at length \nhere today.\n  It so happens that both of the pieces I will use today appeared in \nthe Washington Post, but there have also been useful pieces in the New \nYork Times and the Wall Street Journal.\n  Before I get to that, I want to describe a conversation I had once as \na younger man that has been an absolute paradigm conversation in my \nunderstanding of politics.\n  I was having lunch with an old friend, a very experienced political \nhand, a man who had once served President Eisenhower as a close member \nof his staff. We were discussing a certain candidate for President.\n  I said, somewhat improperly, because it was rather arrogant for me to \ndo this: Is this candidate smart enough to be President of the United \nStates?\n  My old friend answered immediately. He said: Of course not. Nobody \nis. Then he went on to explain.\n  As I say, he was a man who had been at Eisenhower's elbow during some \nof the most significant decisions of our time, and he made this point. \nHe said: Every truly Presidential decision is so loaded down with \nunknowable consequences, with unforeseen possibilities, and \nunforeseeable challenges that no truly Presidential decision is ever \nmade on the basis of intellect. It is made on the basis of instinct.\n  He mentioned this same candidate, and he said: He has good instincts, \nand you can back him with a clear conscience.\n  I have thought about that ever since that conversation, and I have \nrealized the wisdom of it. If difficult decisions could be made by \nsmart people and resolved, they would be resolved before they got to \nthe President of the United States because any President in either \nparty has plenty of smart people around him who can figure things out \nand come to a neat, tidy, absolutely defensible conclusion. But those \ndecisions that do not lend themselves to neat and tidy and absolutely \ndefensible conclusions are the ones that ultimately end up on the \nPresident's desk and are ultimately made, as my old friend said, on \ninstinct, out of the gut, rather than intellect out of the analysis.\n  I remember a President who many people thought was lacking in \nintellectual candle power, who made a very momentous decision. His name \nwas Harry Truman. He described how he was at his mother-in-law's home \nfor Sunday dinner back in Missouri when the phone rang. He went to the \nentry hall of that old home where the phone was kept--showing how long \nago this really was. There was no black box following him around. There \nwas no communications apparatus with instant ties to the White House, \njust a phone in the entry hall where the phone used to be put in the \ndays when there was only one phone per house, and that would be in a \ncentral location.\n  He answered the phone. It was Dean Acheson, who told him the North \nKoreans had just started across the border into South Korea. President \nTruman said: We have to stop the--expletives deleted.\n  In later years, he was asked to outline his decisionmaking analysis \nof the decision to hold the line in North Korea, and he told of the \nphone call and said: My decisionmaking analysis was that one sentence \nwhen I told Dean Acheson: We have to stop the--expletives deleted. He \ndid not think about it any more than that. That came straight out of \nhis gut. And it was Harry Truman's gut that made him one of the \nPresidents we now revere as one of the greatest of the past century.\n  This decision is about going to war in Iraq or about, putting it more \nproperly, giving the President authorization to move ahead with force \nif at some point it becomes clear to him that is what we should do. It \nis in the category of those truly Presidential decisions.\n\n  As I listen to the debate on the floor, the questions being asked, \nthe analysis being demanded, the effort being made to come up with a \nclear set of tidy pros and cons that can then be weighed on a balance \nsheet or an accounting statement and then a carefully crisp decision \nmade on the basis of all of that evidence, I go back to my conversation \nwith my friend. We do not know. No one knows what will be the situation \nin Iraq if we attack after it is over. We do not know whether the \nMiddle East will be a more beneficent place or a more malevolent place \nif that attack takes place, and no one does.\n  I can find experts who will tell us this would be the very best thing \nwe could possibly do, and that the Middle East will be much more \npeaceful, and that liberty will be on the march if we just stand firm. \nOut of the newspapers we can find plenty of columnists who will tell us \nthat.\n  I can find other experts who will say this is the greatest disaster \nwe would possibly bring upon the Middle East, and that if we attack \nIraq, we will unleash a whole Pandora's box of problems. The Arab \nstreet will rise up, and\n\n[[Page S10012]]\n\nAmerica will be hated for 100 years. There are plenty of columnists in \nthe newspapers who will tell us that.\n  I can find experts who will say: Weapons of mass destruction will be \nused against Israel if we move ahead against Iraq; that there will be \nbiological and chemical attacks not only against Israel but against \nAmerican installations everywhere; that American multinational \ncompanies will become the targets of biological and chemical attacks; \nand that all of this can be averted if we just continue the \ndiscussions. I can find plenty of columnists and people in the \nnewspapers who will tell us that.\n  Then there are those who say: If we do not act, we will so embolden \nSaddam Hussein and all the other dictators of the area that they will \nnever move in a peaceful direction; we will have inevitable war, and it \nwill be many times worse than anything that would be triggered by \naction taken now. Again, in the newspapers, I can find plenty of \ncolumnists who will tell us that.\n  So this is a truly Presidential decision, and it will be made not in \nGeorge Bush's head or in the heads of those around him--Dick Cheney, \nColin Powell, Don Rumsfeld, Condoleezza Rice, brilliant people all; \nthey stack up their degrees, they stack up their accomplishments in the \nworld, and this is as glittering an array of talent as any President \nhas ever assembled to advise him on foreign policy matters--but the \nultimate decision will be made in the President's gut because this is a \ntruly Presidential decision fraught with so many unknowable \nconsequences and possible side effects that no one, no matter how \nsmart, can accurately analyze them in advance and come to a neat and \ntidy and firm conclusion.\n  I take some comfort in an analysis that has been made of what I would \ncall the long-term and big-picture question, a big-picture question \nthat perhaps can be analyzed a little better than the specifics of \nwhether or not we move ahead with force in Iraq. I refer first to a \npiece that appeared in the Washington Post written by Jackson Diehl \nentitled ``Bush's Foreign Policy First--But no one seems to notice--\neven at the White House.'' That is the subhead.\n\n  The ``foreign policy first'' that Mr. Diehl is talking about is the \nfact that the Bush administration, for the first time since the cold \nwar, has laid down a coherent doctrine and strategy with respect to \nAmerica's role in the post-cold war world.\n  We all sat in the House Chamber 10 days after the attack, perhaps a \nweek or so after the attack, on September 11, and we heard President \nBush deliver a fabulous speech. It had some of the most dramatic \nrhetoric I expect to ever hear in my lifetime, and it was the finest \nPresidential speech I have ever heard in my lifetime. As I stepped away \nfrom that speech and the emotion of the moment and analyzed it, \nrealized President Bush had, in fact, for the first time in the post-\ncold war world, laid down a vision of that world and America's role in \nit. That speech was more than a rhetorical masterpiece. It was a \nserious policy statement of where America should be.\n  That has been fleshed out in a 34-page statement of foreign policy \nissued by the White House. That is what Jackson Diehl is referring to \nwhen he says Bush's foreign policy first--the first statement of the \nsituation post-cold war as seen by an American administration looking \nat it in toto.\n  Quoting from Mr. Diehl's presentation, he says:\n\n       For a decade U.S. internationalists bemoaned the absence of \n     any coherent policy for engaging the world after the fall of \n     Communism. The Clinton administration, like the Bush team \n     before it, was excoriated for stumbling from crisis to crisis \n     and for consistently making bad judgments about where and how \n     to use America's sole-superpower strength. Now, at last, the \n     internationalists have gotten what they wanted, and the \n     reaction of too many of them is to be aghast.\n\n  Continuing the quote:\n\n       The national security doctrine issued this month by the \n     White House packs into just 34 pages everything the foreign \n     policy of the 1990s lacked. It begins by embracing two facts \n     that have been observed since 1991, but hard for a democratic \n     and sometimes insular society to accept: that America has \n     unmatched and unprecedented power in the world and therefore \n     no choice but to shape the international order; and that it \n     faces threats that are utterly different but in some ways \n     more dangerous than the threats from the old Soviet Union.\n\n  I think that is exactly what the President was saying in his \nstatement to the Joint Session of Congress. We must face the fact that \nwe have power unmatched in history and, therefore, cannot abdicate our \nresponsibility to shape the international order and, two, we must face \nthe fact that we still live in a dangerous world and we are ironically \nmore vulnerable now than we were before.\n  Mr. Diehl goes on, after talking about the situation surrounding the \nword ``unilateral,'' or ``presumptive action,'' and he makes this \npoint:\n\n       American presidents have been engaging in unilateral and \n     preemptive military actions all along--most recently in \n     Panama, Grenada and Haiti, and in Iraq following the 1998 \n     expulsion of the inspectors. And what the new policy actually \n     says is this: Because terrorists and rogue dictators now have \n     the potential to do enormous harm to Americans with weapons \n     of mass destruction and are not easily deterred, it may be \n     necessary to strike at some before they can act. Should \n     we again sit still if a future al-Qaida operates large \n     terrorist training camps in a future Afghanistan? Rice's \n     document treats this question as a matter of common sense, \n     which it is. It also says, sensibly, that preemption is \n     not the answer to all threats--and so far, at least, it \n     hasn't been the legal basis for the White House campaign \n     against Iraq.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to continue for an \nadditional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator may proceed.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Jackson Diehl summarizes this way:\n\n       The real heart of the doctrine, the proposition that U.S. \n     strength be wielded to spread liberty throughout the world, \n     has been barely acknowledged by a policy apparatus that \n     continues to cultivate old and new autocratic allies in the \n     Middle East and Asia.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire article appear at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BENNETT. Turning to a piece which also appeared in the Washington \nPost written by Bernard Lewis, who is considered by some to be the \nultimate authority on conflicts in the Middle East, it is entitled: \n``Targeted By a History of Hatred--The United States Is Now the \nUnquestioned Leader of the Free World, Also Known as the Infidels.'' \nThat is an interesting tie: We are the unquestioned leader of the free \nworld, also known in many parts of the world as the infidels.\n  Put that headline against the statement contained in Jackson Diehl's \nsummary of the Bush position paper authored primarily by Condoleezza \nRice, and once again you see the big picture. We do live in a world \nwhere we are the only superpower. We have the responsibility to do \nsomething with that, and President Bush and his advisers have now come \nto the conclusion that the ultimate test of how we use our power should \nbe how will it ultimately spread liberty throughout the world. That is \nthe kind of flag to which I can repair. That is the kind of standard I \ncan follow.\n  If we were the British in the 1700s and 1800s presiding over the \nworld, the grand scheme would be: How can we enhance and increase \nBritish Imperial power? If we were the Romans when they were the only \nsuperpower in that portion of the world they cared about, the only big \npicture item would be: How can we secure and extend the power of the \nRoman legions? But as President Bush makes this truly Presidential \ndecision out of his gut, he has made it clear that the ultimate \nquestion he is asking, and we must ask with him, is, How will this \nexpand the role of liberty throughout the world? That, as I say, is a \nstandard I can follow.\n  So I will be voting in favor of the resolution, not because I have \nfigured out all of the unknowables and imponderables relating to it and \nnot because I am absolutely sure that the Presidential power will be \nused in the right possible way in every possible circumstance. I will \nbe doing it because I trust George W. Bush's instincts as outlined as \nclearly as any post-war President has ever outlined America's role in \nthe post-war world.\n  He will use his power to expand and defend liberty throughout the \nworld. He may use it by mistake. He may do things that do not produce \nthat result. But that will be his polestar; that\n\n[[Page S10013]]\n\nshould be America's polestar; that should be the policy we lay down and \nhold now for generations to come. It resonates with the decision of the \nFounding Fathers when the country was created. It is a worthy position \nfor us to take now that the country has become preeminent in the world. \nLet us hope and pray that as we give this President this power it is \nalways used to that end.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n                      Bush's Foreign Policy First\n\n                           (By Jackson Diehl)\n\n       For a decade U.S. internationalists bemoaned the absence of \n     any coherent policy for engaging the world after the fall of \n     communism. The Clinton administration, like the Bush team \n     before it, was excoriated for stumbling from crisis to crisis \n     and for consistently making bad judgments about where and how \n     to use America's sole-superpower strength. Now, at last, the \n     internationalists have gotten what they wanted--and the \n     reaction of too many of them is to be aghast.\n       The national security doctrine issued this month by the \n     White House packs into just 34 pages everything the foreign \n     policy of the 1990s lacked. It begins by embracing two facts \n     that have been obvious since 1991, but hard for a democratic \n     and sometimes insular society to accept: that America has \n     unmatched and unprecedented power in the world and therefore \n     no choice but to shape the international order; and that it \n     faces threats that are utterly different but in some ways \n     more dangerous than the threats from the old Soviet Union.\n       The Bush doctrine commits the United States to act \n     aggressively, with others or alone, ``to promote a balance of \n     power that favors freedom.'' The phobias about engaging \n     abroad that paralyzed policy in the '90s, and infuriated the \n     internationalists, are banished. This isn't just the \n     Jacksonian assertion of American interests, though that is \n     surely part of it. There is also a Wilsonian promise to \n     ``bring the hope of democracy, development, free markets and \n     free trade to every corner of the world''--and a Kissingerian \n     strategy of maintaining a ``great power balance'' that \n     decisively favors the United States. the ambition is \n     breathtaking; ``We will work to translate this moment of \n     influence,'' declares the doctrine, ``into decades of peace, \n     prosperity and liberty.'' It is, in short, a bold--and mostly \n     brilliant--synthesis, one that conceivably could cause \n     national security adviser Condoleezza Rice, who executed it, \n     to be remembered as the policymaker who defined a new era.\n       The first proof that Rice and her team are on to something \n     is the alarmist reactions that have greeted her paper. \n     Scandalized members of the foreign policy establishment are \n     calling its treatment of preemptive action an unprecedented \n     policy departure that endorses blitzkrieg as the remedy for \n     anti-Americanism. In a chat with National Public Radio, \n     historian Douglas Brinkley claimed that it ``is simply \n     saying, `We do what we want when we feel like it, and we will \n     declare war on anybody if we think they might be declaring \n     war on us.' ''\n       Policy perestroika usually provokes such first responses. \n     But American presidents have been engaging in unilateral and \n     preemptive military actions all along--most recently in \n     Panama, Grenada and Haiti, and in Iraq following the 1998 \n     expulsion of the inspectors. And what the new policy actually \n     says is this: Because terrorists and rogue dictators now have \n     the potential to do enormous harm to Americans with weapons \n     of mass destruction and are not easily deterred, it may be \n     necessary to strike at some before they can act. Should we \n     again sit still if a future al Qaeda operates large terrorist \n     training camps in a future Afghanistan? Rice's document \n     treats this question as ``a matter of common sense,'' which \n     it is. It also says, sensibly, that preemption is not the \n     answer to all threats--and so far, at least, it hasn't been \n     the legal basis for the White House campaign against Iraq.\n       That Colin Powell now is negotiating the text of another \n     Security Council resolution on U.N. inspections with Russia, \n     Syria and France points to the real weakness of the Bush \n     doctrine--not that it is too radical but that it lacks the \n     political momentum needed to overcome decades of encrusted \n     old thinking and bureaucratic inertia. It's not just that \n     liberal academics haven't signed on to the new doctrine. \n     Inside the administration, it's hard to find anyone--other \n     than Rice--who subscribes to every part of it. Instead, some \n     push the unilateral offense, some the democratic nation-\n     building--and no one quite gets his or her way. In practice, \n     despite all the alarms, the administration's foreign policy, \n     when not entirely paralyzed by internal infighting, mostly \n     follows the old norms.\n       George Kannan's theory of containment eventually won over \n     challengers from the right and left, and thus became the \n     consensus doctrine of the Cold War. Will Rice have the same \n     luck? So far preemption is no more than a scary word used to \n     motivate the United Nations--which, at least in the case of \n     Iraq, is perhaps its best use. Meanwhile, the real heart of \n     the doctrine--the proposition that U.S. strength be wielded \n     to spread liberty through the world--has been barely \n     acknowledged by a policy apparatus that continues to \n     cultivate old and new autocratic allies in the Middle East \n     and Asia. Does George Bush really subscribe to the doctrine \n     issued in his name? Ask Hosni Mubarak, or Pervez Musharraf.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank our distinguished colleague for an excellent \ncontribution to this debate. He has a remarkable way of tying it to the \nreality of the present day and the present time and also looking toward \nthe future. So, again, I thank him for his participation and hope he \ncan perhaps return to the floor in the future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks, an op-ed piece \nthat appears today, Monday, October 7, in the Wall Street Journal, \nauthored by our distinguished colleague Joe Lieberman, whose name \nappears in the first place on the resolution that is before the Senate, \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. I read the following excerpt:\n\n       It is time to authorize the use of our military might to \n     enforce the United Nations resolutions, disarm Iraq, and \n     eliminate the ongoing threat to our security, and the \n     world's, posed by Saddam Hussein's rabid regime.\n\n  Later he asks the question, Why now? He replies:\n\n       For more than a decade we have tried everything--diplomacy, \n     sanctions, inspections, limited military action--except war \n     to convince Saddam Hussein to keep the promises he made, and \n     the U.N. endorsed, to end the Gulf War. Those steps have not \n     worked . . .\n       So my answer to ``why now?'' is, ``Why not earlier?'' And, \n     of course, that question has new urgency since September 11, \n     2001.\n\n  Further, he quotes from former Secretary of Defense Jim Schlesinger, \nunder whom I was privileged to serve as Secretary of the Navy. Senator \nLieberman states:\n\n       As former secretary of defense Schlesinger recently told \n     the Senate Armed Services Committee, ``Vigorous action in the \n     course of an ongoing conflict hardly constitutes preventive \n     war.''\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 7, 2002]\n\n                             Our Resolution\n\n                           (By Joe Lieberman)\n\n       The most fateful and difficult responsibility the \n     Constitution gives to members of Congress is to decide when \n     the president should be authorized to lead the men and women \n     of the U.S. military into war. We are now engaged in such a \n     debate regarding Saddam Hussein's belligerent dictatorship in \n     Iraq.\n       Although I disagree with many other aspects of President \n     Bush's foreign and domestic policy, I believe deeply that he \n     is right about Iraq, and that our national security will be \n     strengthened if members of both parties come together now to \n     support the commander-in-chief and our military. That's why I \n     have cosponsored the Senate resolution that was negotiated \n     with the White House. It is time to authorize the use of our \n     military might to enforce U.N. resolution, disarm Iraq, and \n     eliminate the ongoing threat to our security, and the world's \n     posed by Saddam Hussein's rabid regime.\n\n\n                             responsibility\n\n       Making the case for such action is a responsibility to be \n     shouldered by those of us who have reached these conclusions. \n     If we do so convincingly, not long will the American people \n     and our allies better understand our standards for \n     engagement, but governments around the world who defy the \n     dictates of the U.N. to make weapons of mass destruction or \n     to support terrorists will appreciate how painful the \n     consequences of their brutality and lawlessness can be.\n       In that spirit, let me now address a few of the most \n     critical questions my Senate colleagues and many American are \n     asking.\n       Why has military action against Saddam become so urgent? \n     Why not give diplomacy and inspections another chance? Why \n     now?\n       For more than a decade we have tried everything--diplomacy \n     sanctions, inspections, limited military action--except war \n     to convince Saddam to keep the promises he made, and the U.N. \n     endorsed, to end the Gulf War. Those steps have not worked.\n       In 1998, Bob Kerry, John McCain, and I sponsored the Iraq \n     Liberation Act declaring it national policy to change the \n     regime in Baghdad. The act became law, but until recently \n     little has been done to implement it. In the meantime, Saddam \n     has not wavered from his ambition for hegemonic control over \n     the Persian Gulf and the Arab world: He has invested vast \n     amounts of his national treasure in building inventories of \n     biological and chemical weapons and the means to deliver them \n     to targets near and far. Saddam once told his Republican \n     Guard that its national honor would not be achieved until \n     Iraq's arm reached out beyond its borders to ``every point in \n     the Arab homeland.''\n       So, my answer to ``Why now?'' is, ``Why not earlier?'' And, \n     of course, that question has new urgency since Sept. 11, \n     2001.\n       Won't a war against Iraq slow or stop our more urgent war \n     against terrorism?\n       To me, the two are inextricably linked. First, remember \n     that Iraq under Saddam is\n\n[[Page S10014]]\n\n     one of only seven nations in the world to be designated by \n     our State Department as a state sponsor of terrorism, \n     providing aid and training to terrorists who have killed \n     Americans and others. Second, Saddam himself meets the \n     definition of a terrorist--someone who attacks civilians to \n     achieve a political purpose. Third, though the relationship \n     between al Qaeda and Saddam's regime is a subject of intense \n     debate within the intelligence community, we have evidence of \n     meetings between Iraqi officials and leaders of al Qaeda, and \n     testimony that Iraqi agents helped train al Qaeda operatives \n     to use chemical and biological weapons. We also know that al \n     Qaeda leaders have been, and are now, harbored in Iraq.\n       Saddam's is the only regime that combines growing \n     stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons and a record of \n     using them with regional hegemonic ambitions and a record of \n     supporting terrorists. If we remove his influence from the \n     Middle East and free the Iraqi people to determine their own \n     destiny, we will transform the politics of the region. That \n     will only advance the war against terrorism, not set it back.\n       Why should we launch a strike against a sovereign nation \n     that has not struck us first?\n       We should and will soon have a larger debate about the \n     president's new doctrine of pre-emption, but not here and \n     now, because the term is not apt for our current situation. \n     We have been engaged in an ongoing conflict with Saddam's \n     regime ever since the Gulf War began. Every day, British and \n     American aircraft and personnel are enforcing no-fly zones \n     over northern and southern Iraq; the ongoing force of about \n     7,500 American men and women in uniform costs our taxpayers \n     more than $1 billion a year. And this is not casual duty. \n     Saddam's air defense forces have shot at U.S. and British \n     planes 406 times (and counting) in 2002 alone.\n       As former Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger recently \n     told the Senate Armed Services Committee, ``Vigorous action \n     in the course of an ongoing conflict hardly constitutes \n     preventive war.''\n       Why not have two congressional resolutions, one now \n     encouraging the U.N. to respond to President Bush's call for \n     inspections without limits, and another one later authorizing \n     U.S. military action if the U.N. refuses to act?\n       This is sometimes described as the way to stop ``go-it-\n     alone'' action by the U.S. unless and until absolutely \n     necessary. But I believe that the best way to encourage \n     forceful U.N. action, so that we never have to ``go it \n     alone,'' is for Congress to unite now in authorizing the \n     president to take military action, if necessary. I am \n     convinced that if we lead decisively, others will come to our \n     side, in the U.N. and after. If we are steadfast in pursuit \n     of our principles, allies in Europe and the Middle East will \n     be with us.\n       Why not just authorize the president to take military \n     action to disarm the Iraqis instead of giving him a ``blank \n     check''?\n       Our resolution does not give the president a blank check. \n     It authorizes the use of U.S. military power only to ``defend \n     the national security of the United States against the \n     continuing threat posed by Iraq'' and to ``enforce all \n     relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions \n     regarding Iraq.''\n       There are 535 members of Congress who have the \n     constitutional responsibility to authorize American military \n     action, but there is only one commander-in-chief who can \n     carry it out. Having reached the conclusion I have about the \n     clear and present danger Saddam represents to the U.S., I \n     want to give the president a limited but strong mandate to \n     act against Saddam. Five hundred and thirty-five members of \n     Congress cannot wage war; we can only authorize it. The rest \n     is up to the president and our military.\n\n\n                          a record of strength\n\n       We in Congress have now begun a very serious debate on \n     these questions and others. Each member must act on values, \n     conscience, sense of history and national security. When it \n     is over, I believe there will be a strong majority of \n     senators who will vote for the bipartisan resolution that \n     John Warner, John McCain, Evan Bayh and I have introduced. I \n     am equally confident that a strong majority of Democrats in \n     the Senate will support it. In doing so, they will embrace \n     the better parts of our party's national security legacy of \n     the last half century. From Truman's doctrine to prevent \n     communist expansion to Kennedy's ``quarantine'' of Cuba to \n     prevent Soviet missiles from remaining there, to Bill \n     Clinton's deployment of American forces to the Balkans to \n     stop genocide and prevent a wider war in Europe, Democrats \n     should be proud of our record of strength when it counted the \n     most.\n       Each of the Democratic presidents above tried diplomacy, \n     but when it failed, they unleashed America's military forces \n     across the globe to confront tyranny, to stop aggression, and \n     to prevent any more damage to America or Americans. That is \n     precisely what our resolution would empower President Bush to \n     do now.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will use my 15 minutes to speak on the \nIraq resolution at a subsequent time. I will speak today on something I \nthink is extremely important to what we are doing militarily around the \nworld; that is, as a result of an article I saw in today's Washington \nPost, and I am sure it is running all over the world.\n  Mr. WARNER. Could I ask my colleague, could your very important \ncolloquy which I will have with you on this subject appear in a place \nelsewhere in the Record?\n  Mr. REID. I want it at this point. Sorry, but I really do. I think \nthis is important to what we are doing today, I say to my friend, the \ndistinguished Senator and my good friend from Virginia.\n  This headline reads: ``Bush Threatens Veto of Defense Bill.''\n  I cannot believe the President is involved in this--maybe some of the \npeople around him--I cannot believe the President would do this. I \ncannot accept that. I cannot accept George W. Bush, a person I have \nfound to be very sensitive to people--I hope my feelings are warranted.\n  We have statements from the same article:\n\n       David S.C. Chu, Undersecretary of defense for personnel and \n     readiness, said VA disability compensation is intended not to \n     supplement military pensions.\n       ``We're going to rob Peter to pay Paul.''\n\n  He was speaking for the President of the United States on this very \nimportant issue, saying:\n\n       ``We're going to rob Peter to pay Paul''--``and the \n     question is, should Peter really lose here?''\n\n  This is legislation I authored and others have supported over the \nyears to allow military retirees to receive not only their retirement \nbenefits from the military but also their disability benefits. That is \nall this is. Somebody who is in the U.S. military, who is disabled, can \nreceive that pension in addition to their retirement benefits. The law \nnow says you can't. I say that is wrong.\n  If you retire from the Department of Energy or Sears & Roebuck and \nhave a disability pension from the military, you can draw both \npensions. Why shouldn't you be able to if you retire from the military?\n  I am troubled with this administration's opposition of concurrent \nreceipt of retirement pay and disability pay for disabled military \nretirees.\n  America's veterans have long been denied concurrent receipt based on \nan antiquated law that in effect says if you have 20 years in uniform \nyou cannot draw your disability.\n\n  This ``robbing Peter to pay Paul'' troubles me. As we speak today, \nstarting at 2:45 today until 2:45 tomorrow, 1,000 World War II veterans \nwill die. A number of those have disabilities, and they are entitled to \nreceive those disability benefits as a result of their service in the \nmilitary. They are entitled to that. But not legally.\n  This law which has passed the Senate on two separate occasions--\npassed the House this year--is being threatened by the President. He is \nnot going to OK this bill.\n  I held a press conference with Senator Warner and Senator Levin last \nyear saying they fought a good fight, and we were sorry we could not \nget it done. I will not accept that this year; neither are the veterans \nof this country. I know how dedicated Senator Warner and Senator Levin \nare to the military of this country. Don't let them be bamboozled by \nthis administration saying he will veto the bill.\n  I dare them to veto the bill based on disability benefits to \nveterans, 1,000 of whom are dying every day, World War II veterans. Not \nall 1,000 will draw benefit. They have exaggerated how man people will \ndraw these benefits. But there are some.\n  And now I see a proposal in the same article, the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona saying maybe we will compromise and say those who \nhave a service-connected disability can draw their benefits.\n  If you are in battle--at most, there are 10 percent during a conflict \nwith military people on the front lines in combat--if someone gets shot \nand their shoulder is ruined, they should be entitled to the benefits. \nIf someone is not in the front lines, but in the back lines, or even in \nAmerica, not over in a foreign country, and they fall off a truck and \nruin their shoulder, they are entitled to those benefits just like \nsomeone who was shot. They are doing their best to represent our \ncountry, and they are just as important. If you did not have those \npeople behind the lines, you would not have the people on the front \nlines able to fight.\n  Career military retired veterans are the only group of Federal \nretirees required to waive their retirement pay to\n\n[[Page S10015]]\n\nreceive disability. Other Federal retirees get both disability and \nretirement pay.\n  Some officials have been quoted in recent newspaper articles stating \nthat retirement pay is two pays for the same event. Come on, get real, \nMr. President. These people say this is doubledipping. These statements \nare simply untrue--or people do not know what they are talking about. \nMilitary retirement pay and disability compensation are earned from \nentirely different purposes. Therefore, a disabled veteran should be \nallowed to receive both.\n  Current law ignores the distinction. Military retired pay is earned \ncompensation for the extraordinary demands and sacrifices inherent in a \nmilitary career. It is a reward promised for serving two decades or \nmore under conditions that most Americans would find intolerable. When \na person goes into the military, they are expecting to draw retirement \npay. When they go in the military, they are not expecting to come out \ndisabled. But it happens. Veterans disability compensation is \nrecompense for pain, suffering, and loss of earning power caused by a \nservice-connected illness or injury. Few retirees can afford to live on \ntheir retired pay alone, and a severe disability makes the problem \nworse, limiting or denying postservice working life.\n  The Presiding Officer of this body is the chairman of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, and on a daily basis he deals with the problems, the \nburdens of veterans in our country. No group of people have more \nproblems than veterans. Whether you are a World War II veteran, Korean \nwar veteran, or a Vietnam veteran, you have problems. We have people \nfrom all those conflicts, plus others who have served in recent years \nwho have disabilities. They are entitled to this. It has passed the \nSenate. It is the will of the people of this country. It is the will of \nthe Senate. For, now, the President--his representative, a Mr. Chu--to \ncome in and say:\n\n       The President is not going to support this legislation. It \n     would be robbing Peter to pay Paul.\n\n  What is that supposed to mean? We are not going to be able to buy a \ntank or airplane? Instead, we are going to have to give the money to \nsomebody like Senator Inouye, who has lost an arm, or Senator Cleland, \nwho has lost three limbs?\n  A retiree should not have to forfeit part or all of his or her earned \nretired pay as a result of having suffered a service-connected \ndisability. There are those who have suggested a compromise for limited \nconcurrent receipt to only combat-injured military retirees. I don't \naccept that. Many of our veterans have not been injured in combat, but \nthey are no less injured or any less deserving of fair compensation. \nThis is simply bowing to the administration's threat of a veto.\n  Likewise, the administration's assertion that if the concurrent \nreceipt passes, ``1.2 million veterans could qualify'' for extra \nbenefits is simply not credible. The Department of Defense and \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs previously informed Congress about \n550,000 disabled retirees would qualify if the Senate concurrent \nreceipt plan were approved. So where do they come up with another \n700,000 people?\n  The administration's argument that funding benefits for America's \ndisabled veterans would hurt current military personnel is misleading. \nCongress is not cutting funding for those who are now serving our \ncountry in order to provide benefits for those from previous \ngenerations who served loyally and made tremendous sacrifices. Congress \nwill appropriate the money to pay for that.\n  Enacting this concurrent receipt legislation will not cause current \nservice members to live in substandard quarters, as some say, in a \nmisguided attempt to turn one generation of patriots against another. \nMoreover, at a time when our Nation is calling upon our Armed Forces to \ndefend democracy and freedom, we must be careful not to send the wrong \nsignal to those in uniform. All who have selected to make their careers \nin the United States military are now facing an additional unknown risk \nin our fight against terrorism. If they were injured, they would be \nforced to forego their earned retired pay in order to receive their VA \nbenefits. In effect, they would be paying for their own disability \nbenefits from their retirement checks unless this legislation is passed \noverwhelmingly.\n  If the President vetoes this bill because of this, how many Senators \nare going to come here and vote to sustain that veto? I don't think \nvery many. Who would they rather have on their backs? The President or \nthe veterans of this country? I know from Nevada, I would rather have \nthe President on my back than those veterans--and they are right.\n  At a time when our Nation is calling on our Armed Forces, we need to \ndo this. We must send a signal to these brave men and women the \nAmerican people and Government take care of those who make sacrifices \nfor our Nation. We have a unique opportunity this year to redress the \nunfair practice of requiring disabled military retirees to fund their \nown disability compensation. It is time for us to show our appreciation \nto these people.\n  Finally, the assertion the veterans who would benefit from concurrent \nreceipt are already doing well financially is ridiculous. NBC, the \nNational Broadcasting System, recently aired three news stories in \nwhich they documented the dire situation veterans are facing today. The \nPentagon has acknowledged its studies of retiree income included \nextremely few seriously disabled retirees.\n\n  For too long America's disabled military retirees have been unjustly \npenalized by concurrent offset, and they are demanding action be taken \nnow, not in the future. With such strong bipartisan support on both \nsides of the Congress, these men and women do not understand the \nopposition of the administration. As I say, I hope the President \ndoesn't know what is going on.\n  Let me say again to my friend, the Senator from Virginia, who is on \nthe floor--I have spoken to him today. I have spoken to Senator Levin \ntoday. I think this is so important we do this. At a time when our \ncountry finds itself in crisis, what could be wrong with a veteran \ngetting retirement pay and disability pay at the same time? They are \ntwo separate earnings, one for being hurt, one for spending a lot of \ntime in the military.\n  I have worked hard on this. I appreciate the support of the Senator \nfrom Virginia and the Senator from Michigan. But I am saying here we \ncan't let this opportunity pass. We would be letting down people whom \nwe should not be letting down.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to commend my distinguished \ncolleague and friend on this particular issue. Among the group of us, \nyou have been primarily the leader. My recollection is this is about \nthe fourth year we have brought this up for attention and really asked \nthe Senate to focus upon it. This year it was a direct focus upon it by \nthe Senate and the House, and both Chambers put a provision in their \nbill.\n  Mr. REID. I would also say to my friend from Virginia, not only that, \nbut the House--we don't have a budget here, but the House budget \nincludes this. They didn't include----\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. They included it to 60 percent disabled. They have the \ndollars budgeted in the House. They did that. So the answer is \nabsolutely correct.\n  I vote for these defense budgets. I am for a strong military. I \nremind everyone here in this Iraq season we are in, I was the first \nDemocrat to announce publicly to support the first President Bush. I \nhad no problem doing that. I want a good, strong military. But I think \npart of that is rewarding these people for having been injured. Why \nshould we take their retirement away from them because they have been \ninjured? There is no reason.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to my colleague, we are now, as you know, in \nconference. Senator Levin and I work daily on this with our two \ncolleagues from the House, Chairman Stump and Ike Skelton. This has not \nbeen resolved as yet.\n  We, of course, have to take notice of what is stated here. Presumably \nthe statement in the Pentagon, by Mr. Chu, would not have been made had \nthere not been some consultation with the staff of the President. I \ndon't know the extent this has been brought to his attention. After \nall, he has been among\n\n[[Page S10016]]\n\nthe staunchest defenders of the men and women of the Armed Forces--\npast, present and for the future.\n\n  So I say to my friend, I will join him and others and continue to try \nto work this issue in our conference. But I believe your statement at \nthis time, I say to my colleague, comes at a critical moment. Because \nthat decision could be made, indeed, today, tomorrow, the next day, as \nto how, finally, to constitute the provisions of the House-Senate \nconference document which would then be brought back to both Chambers \nfor vote.\n  So I take to heart your comments. I will share them with our \nconferees. I express again my appreciation to you for your staunch--\nstaunch defense of our veterans. I humbly say, modestly: I am a \nveteran. As a matter of fact, I would not be here had it not been for \nwhat the military did for me. I have often said they did a lot more for \nme than I ever did for them in my modest service. But I assure you, I \nam contemporary with the World War II generation, and you are \nabsolutely right. One thousand a day are departing.\n  I have met with them. They have been among the more vigorous, to try \nand bring forth congressional action on this, as have any number of \nveterans' groups and groups associated with our military.\n  I say to my friend, your message is timely. We should take it to \nheart and do our very best.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I can say to my friend, the ``gentleman'' \nfrom Virginia--and certainly he is the epitome of a gentleman--I \nappreciate very much his remarks.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator from Nevada yield for 2 brief questions?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. I have no objection, of course, but we are proceeding on \nthe Iraq resolution. Following colleagues' comments and questions to \nour distinguished Democratic whip, we will return to, I believe, \nSenator Kyl to be recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am mindful there are others waiting to \nspeak. But when I learned Senator Reid was going to speak today, I was \ngoing to ask him a couple of questions on this issue. I will just be 2 \nto 3 minutes, if I can ask the indulgence of my colleagues.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If the Senator will yield, can I ask for the record \nthat I follow Senator Kyl?\n  Mr. WARNER. Certainly I have no objection. I think that is very \nhelpful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is ordered without objection.\n  Mr. REID. And following Senator Dorgan, Senator Kyl be recognized for \n15 minutes and Senator Domenici for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wanted to say to the Senator from Nevada, he has raised \na very important issue at this point. Twenty-three of us in the Senate \nsent a letter to the authorizing committee on this subject, saying \nthose soldiers who have earned a retirement should receive it, and \nthose same soldiers who are entitled to a disability payment should \nreceive that as well. It is that simple. Senator Reid of Nevada has \nmade the case. It is just a very simple issue of equity.\n  What I wanted to do is point out that NBC News did a story recently. \nI don't know whether the Senator mentioned this on the floor of the \nSenate. Hank Nix, from Ozark, AL, 52 years ago was shot in the chest. \nHe took a bullet leading his platoon. He earned a Silver Star. He is \nnow talking about having to move from their home because of what is \ncalled a broken promise. The Government is reducing his retirement pay \nbecause he is not allowed to collect both his disability--he is 100 \npercent disabled, he took a bullet in the chest leading his platoon in \nthe Korean war, but he is not allowed to collect the retirement he \nearned and a disability payment he is due. Why? Because there is a \nquirk in the law that applies only to disabled soldiers and no other \nFederal worker. About half a million soldiers are in this circumstance.\n\n  It is, in my judgment, totally unforgivable that we don't fix this. \nIt has been around for a long while. Many of us have talked about it on \nthe floor of the Senate. I know the Senator from Virginia is in support \nof fixing it, as are, I think, most of our colleagues.\n  I appreciate the fact that the Senator from Nevada brought this to \nthe floor today because this is critically important. If we are going \nto get it fixed, now is the time to get it fixed. A military career is \nfilled with hardships, family separations, and sacrifices, and all too \noften being put in harm's way. There are promises made to those folks \nwho wear America's uniform, and then we are not keeping the promise \nwith respect to this issue.\n  Finally, let me say this: I have, as many of my colleagues have since \nSeptember 11, 2002, visited military bases in Central Asia, \nAfghanistan, and elsewhere. You can see the pride in the eyes of those \nsoldiers--men and women--who are fighting terrorism on behalf of our \ncountry. You know and they know we have an obligation to keep our \npromise to our veterans.\n  George Washington said it 200 years ago. I will not repeat the quote \nthat has been repeated many times on the floor of this Senate. But when \nwe send young men and women to war to defend freedom, we have an \nobligation to keep our promises to them. One of those promises is to \nsay: If you earn a retirement, we will pay you that retirement. If you \nare disabled because of your service to our country, you are entitled \nto that disability payment. It is just that simple.\n  I appreciate the Senator from Nevada bringing it to the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate very much having worked with the Senator from \nNorth Dakota on this most important issue as we have on a number of \nissues.\n  My point is, the conferees must not cave in on this. Let them veto \nthis issue. We will override the veto. This isn't something that is, \noh, well, we will see. As I said, let everyone here in the Senate \ndecide whom they want to support--the President's people or the \nveterans of their States. This is an issue on which conferees cannot \nlet us down.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The President threatened a veto today--or the White House \ndid, apparently. They said they cannot afford this. We can't afford not \nto do this. You just have to keep the promises here. I am talking about \nour country. We must keep our promise to veterans. I hope he will not \nveto. If he does, it will be overridden, I believe, by a very large \nmargin here in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Feinstein). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I support S.J. Res. 45 authorizing the use \nof force against Iraq.\n  Perhaps the most difficult decision one can make as a Member of this \nbody is to vote to send American troops into harm's way. It forces one \nto consider every question, every possibility, and every option short \nof war. But this does not mean we should eschew action simply because \nwe have not yet tried every other option. Some threats must be dealt \nwith before implausible alternatives are allowed to play out because of \nthe consequences of delay. Preemption may be the only logical course of \naction in some situations. A nation need not allow itself to be struck \nto be justified in acting to protect itself.\n  With these principles in mind, we can evaluate the need to authorize \nthe use of force against Iraq. Actually, use of force against Iraq has \nalready been authorized by both the United States and the United \nNations. And the United States and Great Britain are already using \nforce on a weekly basis.\n  Notwithstanding his obligations to allow aerial inspections in the \nno-fly zones, Saddam Hussein regularly attempts to shoot down our \nunarmed reconnaissance planes, and we either react by destroying the \noffending anti-aircraft site or seek to discover and destroy it before \nit can fire--preemption. No one questions our right to do this.\n  Two facts can, therefore, be established: No. 1, Saddam Hussein is \nnot willing to allow unconditional inspections as he claims. He is not \ndoing it now. No. 2, his continued violation of the United Nations \nresolutions requires a military response. That is assuming the \nresolutions were intended to be enforced when they were adopted. Delay \nin doing so only degrades our claim of authority to act and makes more \ndifficult the task.\n  No one can argue that the United States and the international \ncommunity have not exhausted the full range of legal, diplomatic, and \nother alternatives to try to compel Saddam Hussein to obey all of the \nterms of the cease-fire to which he agreed at the end\n\n[[Page S10017]]\n\nof the gulf war. His continuing defiance of that agreement, including \nhis desire to acquire nuclear weapons and his support of terrorism, \npresents a real and growing threat to U.S. national security. We have \nnow reached a juncture where the risks of inaction outweigh the risks \nof action.\n  Those who oppose the authorization of force usually define the test \nas whether there is an immediate threat, asking, Why do we have to act \nnow? But I submit this is the wrong question. Our intelligence will \nnever be good enough to allow us to calibrate our action to a threat \njust a few days or a few weeks away. We simply do not know enough to do \nthat. We cannot wait until we are sure that Iraq has a nuclear weapon \nand is about to use it because it is unlikely we will ever have that \nevidence, and it will be too late when we do.\n  I find it ironic that some of the people insisting on this standard \nare also some of the loudest critics of our intelligence failures \nbefore September 11, arguing that we should have known an attack was \nimminent and we should have taken action to prevent it. If September 11 \nhad not happened, my guess is that these same people would be urging \ncaution, arguing that since we haven't yet ``connected all the dots,'' \nany preemptive action at that time would be too risky and premature.\n\n  Moreover, action is warranted now because there is no realistic hope \nthat the United Nations resolutions and Saddam's promises to us at the \nend of the gulf war will otherwise be enforced, and each month that \npasses increases the danger.\n  Finally, Iraq is another front in this war on terror. Eliminating \nSaddam's threat will give us greater latitude in other actions we will \nhave to take, and it will create a more willing group of allies in the \nregion. For some of these countries to throw in with us, they need to \nknow that we are absolutely committed to winning and that they are \nbetter off joining the winning side than continuing to pay tribute to \nterrorists in order to protect their regimes from terrorists.\n  While there is much about Iraq's capabilities we do not know, there \nare also some things we do know. No one, for example, can doubt the \nextent of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. The only question is when \nand how he will use them and how long it will be before he can add \nnuclear weapons to his existing chemical and biological capabilities.\n  In recounting Iraq's nasty capabilities, it is useful to remind \nourselves that Baghdad has continued to pursue the development of these \nweapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them in violation \nof numerous U.N. resolutions. There are 13 such resolutions.\n  During the 7 years that the United Nations Special Commission--\nUNSCOM--inspectors were present in Iraq, Saddam Hussein went to great \nlengths to obstruct inspections to conceal his stockpiles and continue \nhis programs under cloak of secrecy. It has now been 4 years since \nUnited Nations inspection teams last set foot in Iraq. We have evidence \nthat Saddam has used that time to enhance his weapons and his \ndevelopment programs. I need not detail that evidence here. It has been \namply discussed in a variety of open and closed sources of information \nprovided by the administration, and it includes everything banned by \nthe United Nations--chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, and the \nmeans of delivering them.\n  In addition, Saddam Hussein has demonstrated proclivity to use force \nto achieve his objectives--twice against his neighbors. And his \naggressive ambitions have already led him to deploy the devastating \nweapons if his stockpiles. He used chemical weapons against Iran. He \nagain used them against his own Kurdish population. And he has launched \nballistic missiles against four neighbors. He is devoting enormous \nresources of his country to upgrade his threat, which is not an action \nof one who only wants to survive.\n  There should be little doubt that Saddam Hussein will use his weapons \nof mass destruction again either to back up a threat to harm us if we \nstand in the way of some future aggression or in actual attack against \nus or our allies, including, potentially a terrorist type attack on our \nhomeland. A recent article by Kenneth Pollack in the Arizona Republic \namplifies this point. In the article, Pollack concludes, ``. . . there \nis every reason to believe that the question is not one of war or no \nwar, but rather of war now or war later--a war without nuclear weapons \nor a war with them.''\n  Saddam Hussein's abuse of the Iraqi people is also deplorable, not to \nmention a violation of a U.N. resolution passed just after the Gulf \nWar, resolution 688. His hideous treatment of Iraqi men, women, and \nchildren is documented. A report published by Human Rights Watch in \n1990 described the shocking brutality of the Iraqi regime:\n\n       Large numbers of persons have unquestionably died under \n     torture in Iraq over the past two decades. Each year there \n     have been reports of dozens--sometimes hundreds--of deaths, \n     with bodies of victims left in the street or returned to \n     families bearing marks of torture. . . . The brazenness of \n     Iraqi authorities in returning bodies bearing clear evidence \n     of torture is remarkable. Governments that engage in torture \n     often go to great lengths to hide what they have done. . . . \n     A government so savage as to flaunt its crimes obviously \n     wants to strike terror in the hearts of its citizens. . . .\n\n  And, as Iraqi citizens starve, Saddam has illegally used oil revenues \nfrom the U.N. oil-for-food program to rebuild his military \ncapabilities, including his weapons of mass destruction. Then, of \ncourse, Saddam blames the United States and the United Nations for the \nsuffering of the Iraqi people.\n  Finally, there is Saddam Hussein's support for international \nterrorism. In his address to the Nation following the September 11 \nattacks, President Bush presented the countries of the world with two \nunambiguous options. He said: ``Every nation in every region now has a \ndecision to make. Either you are with us, or you are with the \nterrorists.'' Saddam Hussein made his decision.\n  Iraq was the only Arab-Muslim country that failed to condemn the \nSeptember 11 attack. In fact, the official Iraqi media stated on that \nday that America was ``reaping the fruits of [its] crimes against \nhumanity.'' We know that Iraq has hosted members of al-Qaeda. And \nNational Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice has commented specifically \non Iraq-al-Qaeda ties.\n\n  ``We clearly know,'' she said, ``that there . . . have been contacts \nbetween senior Iraqi officials and members of al Qaeda. We know too \nthat several of the [al Qaeda] detainees, in particular some high-\nranking detainees, have said that Iraq provided some training to al \nQaeda in chemical weapons.''\n  And Iraq has supported other terrorists. For example, Abu Abbas, the \nmastermind of the 1985 Achille Lauro hijacking and murderer of American \nLeon Klinghoffer, lives in Baghdad. The notorious Abu Nidal lived in \nBaghdad from 1974 to 1983, and then again recently until he was gunned \ndown earlier this year. And Saddam Hussein has provided over $10 \nmillion to the families of Palestinian homicide bombers.\n  Now, the question is, what has the international community been doing \nabout all of this? The answer, Madam President, is not much. The much-\ntouted doctrine of deterrence only works if agreements are enforced. \nSaddam obviously has not been deterred because no one has been willing \nto stop him from continuing his unlawful activities.\n  Saddam Hussein has failed to live up to his cease-fire obligations. \nThe U.N. has failed to enforce them. President Bush described it \nsuccinctly in his speech before the United Nations:\n\n       Just months after the 1991 cease-fire, the Security Council \n     twice renewed its demand that the Iraqi regime cooperate \n     fully with inspectors, condemning Iraq's serious violations \n     of its obligations. The Security Council again renewed that \n     demand in 1994, and twice more in 1996, deploring Iraq's \n     clear violations of its obligations. The Security Council \n     renewed its demand three more times in 1997, citing flagrant \n     violations; and three more times in 1998, calling Iraq's \n     behavior totally unacceptable. And in 1999, the demand was \n     renewed yet again.\n\n  If nothing else, the decade following the Gulf War has illustrated \nclearly the limits of U.N. diplomacy. But the U.S. does not have to \nparticipate in this folly. Our word must mean something. If we fail to \nforce Saddam Hussein to comply with his obligations, we will have sowed \nthe seeds of even greater and more threatening action in the future.\n  Is it possible that we could avoid military actions by accepting \nIraq's offer to allow unlimited inspections? The answer, I submit, is \nno. It would\n\n[[Page S10018]]\n\nhave been hard enough for UNSCOM, but it has been replaced by a new \nentity negotiated between Secretary General Kofi Annan and Iraq in \n1998. Unlike UNSCOM, this new entity, the U.N. Monitoring, \nVerification, and Inspection Commission, known as UNMOVIC, is staffed \nby U.N. employees, rather than officials on loan from member \ngovernments.\n  The inspectors--who are not even required to have expertise in \nrelevant weapon programs--will not be able to make effective use of \nintelligence information. They can't receive intelligence information \non a privileged basis, and the information that they gather can't flow \nback to national intelligence agencies, like our CIA. As Gary \nMillholin, Director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms control \nrecently commented, ``This eliminates the main incentive for \nintelligence sources to provide UNMOVIC with information in the first \nplace.'' Since most of what we learned during inspections was the \nresult of intelligence gathered from Iraqi defectors, it is doubtful \nUNMOVIC could produce much of value.\n  The absurdity of this set-up can only be trumped by the absurdity of \nbelieving that this commission could possibly succeed against a vicious \ndictator who has spent the last 11 years perfecting the arts of \nconcealment and deception in a country the size of France. As David \nKay, former head of the U.N.'s nuclear inspection team, recently \nremarked, ``The only way you will end the weapons of mass destruction \nprogram in Iraq is by removing Saddam from power.''\n  Let me repeat that. This is from the former head of the nuclear \ninspection team of the United Nations:\n\n       The only way you will end the weapons of mass destruction \n     program in Iraq is by removing Saddam from power.\n\n  Here is the bottom line on the international community's ability to \ndeal with the Iraqi threat: Since the end of the Gulf War, Saddam has a \nnearly perfect record in violating U.N. Security Council resolutions. \nThe United Nations, in turn, has a nearly perfect record in failing to \nenforce them.\n  It is time to end this whole charade. Knowing that diplomacy will \ncontinue to fail, we have an obligation to act, and not allow diplomacy \nto be used as a weapon by a brutal dictator. That is a lesson we should \nhave learned through our experiences with the likes of Hitler, Stalin, \nHo Chi Minh, and Slobodan Milosevic. Moreover, too much is at stake to \nplace American security in the hands of unaccountable bureaucrats at \nthe U.N.\n  It is time for military action that will terminate the regime of \nSaddam Hussein and destroy his weapons of mass destruction. We cannot \nbe assured of peace unless this threat is removed.\n  Some observers still insist that we should try to contain Saddam \nthrough the doctrine of deterrence. After all, they say, we relied on \ndeterrence to contain the Soviets for 50 years, and maybe that will \nwork against Saddam. Mr. President, perhaps we should be thankful that \nwe suddenly have so many new converts to deterrence, since many of \nthese same voices were 20 years ago arguing instead for a nuclear \nfreeze and unilateral U.S. disarmament. I'll remember their newfound \ncommitment to deterrence as we attempt to deal with China's growing \nmilitarization in the coming months and years.\n  There are situations where deterrence can work. This is not one of \nthem for two reasons. First deterrence has a shelf life. If there is no \nresponse to violations, a dictator is not deterred--the threat of \nretaliation is no longer credible. The U.N. has done nothing and the \nU.S. next to nothing. As a result, Saddam has not been deterred. In any \nevent, containment and deterrence do not apply well in this case.\n  President Bush was absolutely correct when he declared at West Point \nthat ``deterrence means nothing against shadowy terrorist networks with \nno nation or citizens to defend;'' and, ``containment is not possible \nwhen unbalanced dictators with weapons of mass destruction can deliver \nthose weapons on missiles or secretly provide them to terrorist \nallies.''\n  While belatedly embracing deterrence, critics of force reject a \ndoctrine of preemption. Yes, they say, there have always been \nsituations where countries had to act with force to prevent some attack \non them, but that's different from an announced doctrine of preemption.\n  There are several answers. The first is: no it is not. Preemption \nonly applies to certain situations--like Iraq. Though Iran presents \nmany of the same circumstances as Iraq, there are differentiating \nfactors that make preemption less appropriate vis-a-vis Iran. There is \nno ``outstanding warrant'' as with Iraq; regime change could come from \nwithin Iran; and, militarily, force is much less an option--to name \nthree differences.\n  Second, it is senseless to require a ``smoking gun'' in order to act. \nAs Secretary Rumsfeld has said: ``A gun doesn't smoke until it's been \nfired and the goal has to be to stop such an attack before it starts.''\n  Since September 11, this takes on a whole new meaning. Don't think \nsmoking gun--think World Trade Center and Pentagon.\n  As we stand here more than one year after 3,000 innocent civilians \nperished at the hands of vicious terrorists, we need to ask ourselves, \ndo we really want to wait until another attack, perhaps one using \nweapons of mass destruction? What opponents really mean is, wait until \njust before such an attack, and only act if we're reasonably sure the \nattack is coming. Obviously, we can't count on knowing that, and the \npotential consequences are too great to risk it.\n  So the answer to that question is an emphatic no. September 11 \nchanged everything, or at least should have changed everything, in the \nway we approach these matters. September 11 moved us out of the realm \nof international relations theory and into the realm of self-defense. \nIf the President decides to move against Iraq, it will be an act of \nself-defense. And by voting to authorize the President to take that \naction, this body will be authorizing an act of self-defense. Knowing \nwhat we know, how could we explain inaction if we were subsequently \nattacked?\n  What's more, it should be obvious that if Saddam acquires nuclear \nweapons, it will give him the ability to deter us. We are already \nhearing arguments against the use of force because of the potential of \nIraq using chemical or biological weapons against our forces. Consider \nhaving this debate a few months or years from now after we've \nascertained that he definitely has a nuclear saber to rattle. This will \nmake a move against Saddam, or any other American action in the Middle \nEast, more dangerous, and in all probability, less likely. It is \nSaddam's dream come true. He will be able to check our actions. So, \nagain, the time to act is now.\n  But, some critics say, we must wait for international approval. Mr. \nPresident, I submit that the proponents of ``multilateralism,'' in \naddition to willfully ignoring the fecklessness of the U.N. and certain \nother countries, neglect the special leadership role that our country \nplays in the world.\n  It is no accident that it devolved to us to end German imperialism in \nWorld War I, stop Adolf Hitler in World War II, and defeat the forces \nof international communism in the Cold War. It is no accident that the \noppressed peoples of the world look at us, rather than other countries \nor the U.N., as their ray of hope. That is why we lead, and why we must \nlead.\n  We are fortunate to have a President today who appreciates this. \nWhile much of the rest of the world insists on burying its head in the \nsand or clinging to failed approaches, President Bush understands that \nnow is the time to confront Saddam. And while others insist on a false \ndistinction between the Iraqi threat and the war on terrorism, \nPresident Bush has, as Noemie Emery has written in The Weekly Standard, \nconnected the dots. In so doing, writes Emery, President Bush has, like \nHarry Truman when the Soviets encroached on Greece and Turkey in the \n1940s, perceived ``an ominous and enlarging pattern'' that demanded a \nresponse. Emery continues, ``Several presidents have had to wage wars, \nbut only two, Bush and Truman, have had to perceive them, and then to \ndefine them as wars.''\n  This is the essence of leadership. By perceiving that we can no \nlonger afford to be attacked before we act, President Bush's doctrine \nof preemption allows us, where appropriate, to act first\n\n[[Page S10019]]\n\nagainst terrorist organizations and states.\n  Our use of force in self-defense against Iraq will also help liberate \nthe beleaguered people of Iraq. Aside from the moral imperative, there \nare a number of tangible benefits to the United States that a more \ndemocratic Iraq will bring.\n  First, if real democracy can take hold, it will dispel the notion \nthat the people of the Middle East are incapable of democratic \ngovernance, just as Taiwan and the Philippines have destroyed the \n``Asian values'' myth in recent years. It's notable that the scourge of \nIslamic terrorism has been nurtured, not in democratic Muslim countries \nsuch as Turkey, but in repressive dictatorships like Iraq, Iran, Syria, \nand Saudi Arabia. A democratic regime in Baghdad will set an example \nand hopefully spark other badly-needed changes in governments in the \nregion. And, in the long run, democracy will prove to be the antidote \nto Islamic-based terrorism.\n  A democratic regime that follows our removal of Saddam Hussein will \nalso provide us with a new and reliable ally in this critical part of \nthe world. The war on terrorism will almost certainly entail additional \nactions, and the intelligence, political support, overflight rights and \nthe like from an allied regime in Iraq could prove critical to those \nefforts.\n  Lastly, a democratic Iraq will bring that nation's vast oil \nproduction capabilities back onto the world market. This will help the \nworld economy by, among other things, lessening the ability of the \nSaudis and others to manipulate oil prices.\n  While I support this resolution and support using force to rid the \nworld of Saddam Hussein, I do want to offer a few caveats.\n  First, our commitment to this effort must be total. Our goal here \nmust be nothing short of the destruction of the current Iraqi regime. \nThere is no other realistic way to permanently disarm Iraq of its \nweapons of mass destruction. And providing our Armed Forces with \nanything less than everything they need to accomplish that goal is \nunacceptable. And that includes the support of our intelligence \ncommunity.\n  Second, after removing the regime, we must resist the temptation to \nrush home. As I just stated, there are enormous benefits in helping \nIraq achieve democracy. However, it is most unlikely that Iraq can be \nstabilized and democratized without a significant U.S. presence after \nthe defeat of Saddam.\n  There can be no questioning the fact that the U.S. occupation of \nGermany and Japan after World War II was critical to forging those two \ncountries into the democracies they now are. I am not saying we need to \ncopy those examples precisely, but it would be short-sighted and \ndangerous for us to leave a shattered Iraq on its own or in the hands \nof the United Nations after the removal of Saddam.\n  Third, we must not undertake this struggle on the cheap. We should \nmake no mistake: this operation is going to require a great deal of \nmanpower, weapons platforms and equipment, possibly for quite some \ntime. Those forces need to come from somewhere, and our forces have \nalready been stretched thin by the profusion of peacekeeping missions \nand the budget cuts of the 1990s.\n  Meanwhile, we need to maintain and, I would say, even augment our \ndeterrent posture elsewhere in the world. For example, last year's \nQuadrennial Defense Review, mostly drafted before September 11, called \nfor increasing our carrier presence in the Western Pacific. This seems \nto me to be quite necessary, given that we normally have only one \ncarrier--the Kitty Hawk--in that region, but two potential conflict \nzones, Korea and Taiwan. Yet, when we began our operations in \nAfghanistan last year, the Kitty Hawk was called to duty in the Arabian \nSea, leaving us with no carrier in the Western Pacific for months.\n  We will almost certainly face this situation again if we go to war \nagainst Iraq, and it is not something that we should ignore. The \nupshot, is that this body needs to come to grips with the need for a \ndefense budget that supports the cost of operations like Afghanistan \nand Iraq, defense transformation and an adequate global force posture. \nAt current spending levels, we are going to come up short of that goal.\n  Last, but not least, I believe the administration needs to be very \ncareful in its diplomatic efforts to secure a new U.N. Security Council \nresolution. That body includes the terrorist regime of Syria, Communist \nChina, which threatens our friends on Taiwan and sells fiber-optics to \nIraq, and Russia, which has forged close economic ties with Iraq over \nthe past decade. Principle, not expedience, must be our ultimate guide \nin dealing with these countries that hold the votes to deny or \nauthorize U.N.-backed action.\n  If we need to make concessions to these regimes that undermine our \ninterests elsewhere--in Taiwan, for example--then it is not worth \nsecuring their votes in the Council. Ultimately, we should be prepared \nto defend our interests with or without the U.N.\n  Which bring me to my conclusion, Mr. President.\n  This resolution we are considering today, and this action the \nPresident is contemplating in Iraq, is not about carrying out the will \nof the United Nations or restoring its effectiveness. It is not about \nassuring the world that the United States is committed to \n``multilateralism.''\n  Section 3(a)(1) is the heart and soul of this resolution. It \nauthorizes the President to use the Armed Forces of the United States \nto ``defend the national security of the United States against the \ncontinuing threat posed by Iraq.''\n  That is what we are doing here today, defending our national \nsecurity.\n  It is a sobering, and humbling, task. But as members of the United \nStates Senate, it is our solemn duty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I compliment our distinguished \ncolleague. I say to the Senator, even though you have given your \nstatement, I anticipate this debate in the Senate will continue for 2 \ndays, and perhaps you will find the opportunity to revisit the floor \nand, again, personally elaborate on your points.\n  Today, you have given a very important and timely historical context \nof the events, and the sequence of those events. And you have placed \nextremely important emphasis on what the U.N. is trying to do today, as \nwe are right here, in fashioning an inspection regime that is much \nstronger than the one that is on the books from when Hans Blix was \nappointed. But I am sure the Senator observed Hans Blix, after visiting \nwith Iraqi officials in Austria, said he would like to wait until the \nSecurity Council acted.\n  So what we are looking forward to now is the evolving process of a \nregime which I think has to meet the criteria established by our \nPresident and the Prime Minister of Great Britain, and others, before \nwe can accept that as a workable solution. Would the Senator agree?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I hope to have the opportunity to speak to \nthis issue again, but I will say two quick things in response to the \nSenator from Virginia.\n  First, I note that Hans Blix has largely, it appears to me from news \nmedia accounts, agreed with the position of the United States on what \nwould be necessary to conduct meaningful inspections that would result \nin the disarmament of Saddam Hussein because, as he noted, the object \nhere is not inspections; the object is disarmament. And inspections \nwould be but a way to achieve that.\n  Secondly, as I said, I think that only the most naive would believe \nthat it is possible to have an effective regime, irrespective of what \nkind of resolution were adopted, as long as Saddam Hussein is in power. \nThat is why I quoted the former U.N. inspection team leader David Kay, \nwho made the point, with which I totally agree, that as long as Saddam \nHussein is in power there, it is impossible to have disarmament of the \nkind that was called for at the end of the gulf war.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague. Assuming the Security Council will \nact, I will personally await the judgment of our President and that of \nthe Prime Minister of Great Britain with regard to the structure and \neffectiveness, potentially, of such a new regime.\n  In this debate we have sort of gone back and forth in a very \neffective discourse on the issues. I wonder if at this time I might ask \nunanimous consent that the junior Senator from Virginia, Mr. Allen, \nmight follow our distinguished colleague, Mr. Domenici.\n\n[[Page S10020]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I have 15 minutes, I believe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed. He does.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I would like to talk about the Iraqi \nsituation for a small portion of my 15 minutes.\n  The more I have been reading about this, the more I have been \nstudying it, the more I come to an answer that I have to make as to \nwhether I will give the President authority to use our military forces \nalong with other countries so as to avoid the use of weapons of mass \ndestruction by Saddam Hussein. I have to ask myself a question: How is \nhe most apt to disarm? What is most apt to make him disarm? Talk? \nResolutions? I think not.\n  When we are finished, a huge majority of the Senate will say this is \nnot necessarily a question of war or peace.\n  This could be a question of whether an America armed for war, with \nthe full knowledge on the part of Saddam Hussein that we are armed for \nwar, and the President has the authority, might that bring about \ndisarmament on the part of Saddam Hussein sooner than any other means \nthat we know about thus far as we look at the Middle East and its \nvarious problems.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business on the \nAmerican economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Domenici are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized under \nthe unanimous consent agreement for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to \nspeak for up to 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, I rise to address the most pressing and \ndifficult issue facing our Nation today. Over the course of the next \nfew days, we will be debating in the Senate and we will vote on the \nmost serious responsibility the U.S. Constitution delegates to \nCongress, which is authorizing the use of military force against \nanother nation.\n  I have only been here for about a year and a half. I passed in the \nhallway the senior Senator from Virginia, John Warner, who told me, \n``This is the first time you will have to do this.'' He said he has \nbeen through this experience seven times. I am sure he takes the same \nsort of care and consideration each time. But for me, this is the first \ntime I have had to face such a question and such an issue as to where I \nstand.\n  It is my view the use of military force to resolve a dispute must be \nthe last of all options for our Nation. Before entering into such a \ndecision, it is absolutely necessary Government officials sincerely and \nhonestly are confident they exhausted all practical and realistic \ndiplomatic avenues and understand the short-term as well as the long-\nterm ramifications and implications of such actions.\n  Exercising our best judgment based on the evidence of the threat, we \nmust look at the consequence not only on the international community, \nbut, more importantly, on the effect such action would have on the \npeople of our country.\n  In considering the use of military action, my thoughts immediately \nturn to the people of the Commonwealth of Virginia. While the use of \nArmed Forces affects all Americans, it has traditionally had a \nsignificant impact on Virginia. The Commonwealth is home to literally \ntens of thousands of brave men and women who risk their lives to defend \nthe freedoms we enjoy. The prospect of war places the lives of many of \nthese men and women in jeopardy, and it means constant anxiety and fear \nfor their families, wherever they may be based--whether in the U.S. or \noverseas, whether on land or on the seas.\n  I know from my experience as Governor how we rely heavily on the \nNational Guard and Reserves whenever military action is necessitated, \nespecially in the past decade. Military action will call up more \nReserves and more of the National Guard when they are protecting our \nsafety. It will disrupt those families and businesses and communities \nall across our great land.\n  This is not a decision I come to easily or without prayers for \nguidance and wisdom. The use of our Armed Forces means lives are at \nrisk. The history of military action shows there are frequently \nunintended consequences and unseen dangers whenever the military is \nutilized. Fiscally, military action is expensive and can cause unrest \nboth in the U.S. and international markets. When considering these \noutcomes, it is obvious using force to resolve the dispute is the least \ndesirable and the last option for our country. But military action must \nremain an option for our diplomatic efforts to have any credibility or \nsuccess.\n  I have listened and read comments from constituents and people all \nover this country, sincere words from the Religious Society of Friends \nand Pax Christi. They are well-meaning in pointing out their sentiments \nand the risks involved. However, we must weigh these risks and probable \noutcomes in the context of the threat Iraq poses to the U.S. and to our \ninterests. I agree with the President, and the CIA, and the Department \nof Defense, and the State Department, that Iraq and Saddam Hussein's \nregime are a credible threat to the United States and our interests and \nour allies around the world. Because that threat is present and real, I \nbelieve the dangers will become substantially greater with continued \ninaction by the international community, or the United States acting in \nconcert with allies.\n  The ``whereas'' clauses of the resolution we are debating effectively \nspell out good reasons, and reasons I look at for authorizing the \nPresident to use military action, if necessary. Saddam Hussein has \ncontinually, brazenly disregarded and defied resolutions and orders to \ndisarm and discontinue his pursuit of the world's worst weapons. To \nbring an end to the Gulf War and Saddam's violent attempt to occupy \nKuwait, the Iraqi leader unequivocally agreed to eliminate chemical, \nbiological, and nuclear weapons programs, as well as putting severe \nlimits on his missiles and the means to deliver and develop them. Since \nthat armistice was reached in 1991, it has been consistently and \nconstantly breached by Saddam's regime, and has not been enforced at \nall by the U.N. for the past 4 long years.\n  Can one imagine a nuclear weapon in the hands of Saddam Hussein? \nLet's not forget this is a head of state who has demonstrated his \nwillingness to use chemical weapons on other nations and his own \ncitizens with little or no reservation.\n  If the current Iraqi regime possessed a nuclear weapon, it would \ndrastically alter a balance of power in an already explosive region of \nthe world. Such a capability would renew Saddam's quest for regional \ndominance and leave many U.S. citizens, allies, and interests at great \nperil.\n  This man has no respect for international laws or rules of \nengagement. I share President Bush's fear that increased weapons \ncapability would leave the fate of the Middle East in the hands of a \ntyrannical and very cruel dictator.\n  Most dangerous, currently, is not his desire to have nuclear weapons, \nbut stockpiling of chemical weapons, the stockpiling of a variety of \nbiological weapons; and also his missile range capabilities, that far \nexceed U.N. restrictions.\n  There is another concern not only that he has stockpiled biological \nand chemical weapons and the means of delivering them, but also the \njustifiable and understandable fear that he could transfer those \nbiological or chemical agents to a terrorist group or other \nindividuals. After all, Saddam Hussein is the same heartless person who \noffers $25,000 to families of children who commit suicide terrorist \nacts in Israel.\n  The goal of the United States and the international community needs \nto be disarmament. Saddam Hussein must be stripped of all capabilities \nto develop, manufacture, and stockpile these weapons of mass \ndestruction, meaning chemical, biological agents, and the missiles and \nother means to deliver them by himself or by a terrorist subcontractor.\n  If regime change is collateral damage of disarmament, I do not \nbelieve there\n\n[[Page S10021]]\n\nis anyone in the world who will mourn the loss of this deposed \ndictator. True disarmament can only be accomplished with inspection \nteams that have the ability to travel and investigate where they deem \nappropriate. To ensure they have full access to inspections is a key \ncomponent of what the President of the United States is trying to get \nthe United Nations to do.\n  We are trying to get full and unimpeded inspections. It would be \nappropriate for us to say noncompliance would result in forced \ndisarmament.\n  The U.S. and the world cannot afford to have this mission undermined \nby wild goose chases and constant surreptitious, conniving evasion and \nlarge suspect areas being declared by Saddam to be immune from \ninspection.\n  I commend President Bush for recognizing the importance of including \nall countries in this effort. His statement to the United Nations on \nSeptember 12, 2002, clearly and accurately spelled out the dangers Iraq \nposes to the world. By placing the onus on the United Nations, the \nPresident has given that international body the opportunity to re-\nestablish its relevance in important world affairs, and finally enforce \nthe resolutions that its Security Council has passed for the last \neleven years.\n  Passing a new resolution will increase the credibility of the United \nNations, which has steadily eroded since the mid 1990s. The Security \nCouncil has an obligation to provide weapons inspectors with the \nflexibility to accomplish their mission. This can only be realized if a \nresolution is passed with consequences for inaction or defiance.\n  That is why as the United Nations debates a new and stronger \nresolution against Iraq, the United States must be united in our \nresolve for disarmament. Passing a resolution authorizing our President \nto use military force in the event that diplomatic efforts are \nunsuccessful sends a clear message to the international community that \nAmericans are united in our foreign policy.\n\n  I respectfully disagree with the premise that the President must \nfirst petition the United Nations before asking Congress for authority. \nI question: How can we expect the United Nations to act against Iraqi \ndefiance if the U.S. Government does not stand with our President and \nour administration's efforts to persuade the United Nations and the \ninternational community to enforce their own resolutions?\n  It is right for us to debate the resolutions before the Senate, to \nvoice concerns and sentiments in support or opposition. Each Member \nwill take a stand and be accountable, and when the debate concludes, I \nrespectfully ask my colleagues, when a resolution is agreed to, stand \nstrong with our troops, our diplomats, and our mission. From time to \ntime, one sees elected officials who moan in self-pity about having to \nmake a tough decision that may not be popular. Well, I know the vast \nmajority of the Senators, regardless of their ultimate position on this \nissue, can make tough decisions with minimal whimpering. Senators have \nall been elected by the people of their States to exercise judgment \nconsistent with principles and promises.\n  As the Senate debates the merits of each resolution, it must be \nprepared for the possibility of continued inaction by the United \nNations. Americans cannot stand by and cannot cede any authority or \nsovereignty to an international body when the lives and interests of \nU.S. citizens are involved.\n  I believe it would be a grave mistake for the United Nations to shirk \nits responsibility regarding Iraq; however, a consensus might not be \nreached with all nations on the U.N. Security Council. If that \ncircumstance arises, the United States and the President will have a \nduty to garner as much international support as is realistically \npossible.\n  Blissful, delusional dawdling, wishful thinking, and doing nothing is \nnot an option for the United States. However, continuing the diplomatic \nwork in face of the Security Council veto is necessary not only for \ndiplomacy, but to gain allies to help shoulder the logistical and \noperational burdens that would be a part of any military campaign.\n  It is true the United States can disarm Saddam Hussein alone. \nHowever, as we continue to pursue the venomous, vile al-Qaida \nterrorists and other terrorist supporters, we would greatly benefit \nfrom allied support in these extended efforts. I believe we will see \nmore allies join this effort to disarm Saddam Hussein's regime. Britain \nwill not be our sole teammate in this effort. As other countries begin \nto understand the severity of the threat, they will recognize it is in \ntheir best interest to disarm Iraq.\n  The UK along with Spain, Italy and some countries from the Middle \nEast have supported our position. Kuwait, Qatar, and the Saudis have \nalso indicated that maybe they will not send troops in, but have \noffered logistical bases that would be helpful for our tactical air \nstrikes.\n  We do not want to make this a war against a particular group or \ncertain religious beliefs. We must guard against any rhetoric or \nstatement that is targeted against Muslims or Arabs. Our mission is to \nprotect the United States, its allies, and interests by upholding \ninternationally agreed-upon resolutions to disarm Iraq of biological, \nchemical, nuclear, and missile technologies. I urge the President to \nmake absolutely clear that in the event we have to seek support from \nallies, that we continue to do so in the Middle East.\n\n  As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I have participated \nin committee meetings and top secret briefings and analyzed this issue \nvery closely, and with questions. After reviewing the several \nresolutions offered by our colleagues, I believe the best way to \nprovide the President with the authority and the support he may need is \nby passing the authorization for use of military force against Iraq.\n  This resolution, introduced and offered by Senator Warner and Senator \nLieberman, as well as Senator McCain and others, gives the President \nthe authority and flexibility to ensure the protection of the United \nStates. I am particularly pleased that the resolution will task the \nPresident with determining that diplomatic means will not adequately \nprotect the national security of the United States. This determination \nwill ensure the United States is exhausting every diplomatic option \nbefore authorizing the use of our Armed Forces.\n  I refer to section 2 on page 7 of the resolution and those clauses \ntherein: Where the Congress of the United States supports the efforts \nof the President to strictly enforce United Nations Security Council \nresolutions applicable to Iraq and encourages him in those efforts. It \nalso encourages the President to obtain prompt and decisive action by \nthe Security Council to ensure that Iraq abandons its strategy of \ndelay, evasion, and noncompliance, and promptly and strictly complies \nwith all relevant security resolutions.\n  I interpret this as also, in dealing not just with the United \nNations, but also garnering allies in the process.\n  I will continue to listen intently to the debate on all the \nresolutions regarding Iraq. However, I truly and sincerely believe that \nSenate Joint Resolution 46, which I referenced earlier, will provide a \nsense of the Senate that the Congress, and most importantly, in our \nreflection in representation, a reflection that Americans are united \nbehind our President and we support efforts to garner allied and U.N. \nsupport in the event that diplomatic options fail to disarm Saddam \nHussein.\n  We all know that Saddam Hussein is a vile dictator with regard for \nonly his own survival. He compromises the well-being of all Iraqis in \nhis efforts to maintain power and accumulate wealth. History shows the \nIraqi leader only responds when there is a gun put to his head. Sweet \ntalking will not do any good with this man.\n  Now we are seeing this phenomenon play out as he allows weapons \ninspections to resume only after intense, consistent pressure from the \ninternational community. But even then what we are seeing again is the \nsame shell game of conditions and prevarications that led to the \ndeparture of inspectors 4 years ago. We must not allow him to continue \nwith these ploys of deception.\n  I do not believe any American welcomes the prospect of deploying our \nbrave men and women for military action. However, standing strong and \nunited as a country, together with our President, our diplomats, and \nour defense forces, and in favor of congressional authority to use \nforce if it is absolutely necessary, is the best way to ensure Saddam \nHussein is disarmed and military conflict is actually avoided.\n\n[[Page S10022]]\n\n  The greatest responsibility of this Government and its officials is \nto protect and ensure the national security of the United States and \nour citizens. We know Saddam Hussein poses a threat to our country, and \nit is incumbent upon every Member of this body to help neutralize that \nthreat. I am hopeful this problem will be resolved peacefully, through \ninternational diplomacy. But in the event those efforts fail, I do not \nwant our President to be hobbled without the authority to protect the \ncitizens of the United States of America.\n  Therefore, when my name is called, I will stand with President Bush, \nstand with our diplomats, stand with our troops and support this \nserious and necessary resolution, which is designed to save innocent \nAmerican lives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I think this is one of the most serious \nissues I have ever addressed on this floor, and I thank Lindsay Hayes \nand Karina Waller, who are with me today, for their help in preparing \nthis statement.\n  There are few of us still around who lived through events which led \nto World War II. I was in high school, as a matter of fact, and I \nstudied Hitler's actions month after month in history class. I vividly \nremember watching the world appease Hitler while he pursued an \naggressive military policy aimed at dominating the world.\n  The current situation reminds me of the agreements we studied in high \nschool which were made after World War I. Hitler just waved them away. \nWhen Hitler flaunted the terms of the Versailles Peace Treaty, France \nand Britain did nothing to enforce it. When Hitler occupied the \nRhineland and the Anschluss in Austria, no nation tried to stop him. \nInstead, the world repeatedly gave into an obnoxious, aggressive leader \nto avoid war.\n  When I was a senior in high school many of my friends left school to \nenlist. I left Oregon State College in December of 1942. Only seven of \nus in the Senate today served during World War II, but as one who \nfought in China, the ``Forgotten War,'' I see the next Hitler in Saddam \nHussein.\n  Senator Warner, Senator Inouye, Sam Nunn, and I also experienced the \nhorror of the gulf war firsthand. In 1991, in an Israeli defense \nconference room we were told a Scud had been fired at Tel Aviv, which \nis where we were, and it could be carrying chemical or biological \nagents. Gas Masks were passed around the room and we waited about 20 \nminutes before being told that the Scud had fallen. The next morning we \nwent to locate the Scud and found that it had been grazed by a Patriot \nmissile. It had hit an apartment complex.\n  This was quite an interesting experience to Senator Inouye and I \nbecause several years before this incident Senator Dan Inouye and I had \ndemanded that the anti-aircraft Patriot be modified to become an anti-\nmissile system, and we were in Israel witnessing the use of that \nPatriot system.\n  Over 20 years ago, the Israelis saved the world a great deal of pain \nwhen they destroyed the Iraqi nuclear reactor. That action delayed an \nIraqi bomb by at least 15 years, and that raid also made Hussein more \ncautious. Today he has spread out and carefully concealed his military-\nweapons infrastructure to make destruction of those weapons more \ndifficult.\n  We seek peace.\n  We abhor war.\n  We work to assure our military capacity is second to none because we \nbelieve in this new world no nation has time to re-arm. We must be \nready instantly to defend our interests at home and abroad or perish.\n  Our President is right to shake Hussien's cage. The Middle East is a \ntinder box, but only one nation has the ability to ignite the entire \nworld, and that is Iraq.\n  Saddam Hussein cannot be allowed to expand beyond his borders again \nand he cannot continue developing weapons of mass destruction.\n  President Bush has an important role as the leader of the free world \nas he repeatedly states there is a menace in Iraq and it is growing.\n  This is the most serious situation we have faced since World War II.\n  Since the end of the Persian Gulf war, our forces have been enforcing \nthe United Nation's mandate that there should be two no-fly zones in \nIraq. Our planes fly patrols for the United Nations, over those no-fly \nzones daily and have been shot at almost every day. We cannot allow \nthis continued risk to the lives of our own pilots.\n  The threat of weapons of mass destruction was real during the Persian \nGulf war. It is even more real today. Five years ago, weapons \ninspectors were forced out of Iraq. Based on classified briefings I \nhave received I have no doubt that Saddam Hussein has used this \nopportunity to expand his weapons program.\n  Iraq has not accounted for hundreds of tons of chemical precursors \nand tens of thousands of unfilled munitions canisters. It has not \naccounted for at least 15,000 artillery rockets previously used for \ndelivering nerve agents or 550 artillery shells filled with mustard \ngas. When inspectors left Iraq in 1998, the regime was capable of \nresuming bacterial warfare agent production within weeks. Hussein has \nhad time to produce stockpiles of anthrax and other agents, including \nsmallpox, and he is not afraid to use these weapons.\n  He has used weapons of mass destruction against Iranians, against his \nown people, and, I believe, against some of our military in the gulf \nwar.\n  When Hussein begins blackmailing his neighbors and using his \nresources, The world will face an impossible situation. If Hussein's \nweapons program continues unchecked our allies--his neighbors--face an \nunconventional threat of immense proportions--a threat more horrible \nthan all Hitler's legions.\n\n  The President needs our support to form a coalition that can confront \nthis crisis. We must grant President Bush the same powers that Congress \nhas given his predecessors.\n  We must pass this resolution now or our children, or our \ngrandchildren, are going to shed a monstrous amount of blood to deal \nwith this threat in the future.\n  Hussein will use these weapons if he is not stopped now. He will \nbecome a Hitler. He will continue as Hitler started--dominating one \ncountry after another. With the weapons he has, he need only to \nthreaten their use, or to use them as he did in Iran. Then ours will be \na terrible dilemma: how does the world deal with a madman who has \nweapons against which the world cannot defend?\n  If any Senator has doubts about this resolution, I ask them to ask \nthemselves this question: is Saddam Hussein really ready to become part \nof the family of nations again? Can anyone on this Senator floor answer \nthat question ``Yes''?\n  The U.N. has told Hussein that he must disarm 16 times. Sixteen times \nhe has defied that body. He has lied. He has not once complied. Between \n1991 and 1998, Iraq practiced a series of deceitful tactics designed to \nprevent U.N. inspectors from completing inspections. The same course of \naction will bring the same results.\n  As I have traveled at home, I am often asked ``How do we know Hussein \nis so bad?'' Our intelligence agencies have developed an enormous \namount of evidence on his activities, his use of weapons of mass \ndestruction, and his lies and deceptions. Unfortunately, this \ninformation is mostly classified to protect sources and methods by \nwhich the information was acquired.\n  As one of the Senate who is briefed on a regular basis I believe our \nintelligence agencies understand the nature of the threat Iraq poses. \nHowever, while it is likely that Iraq has large amounts of biological \nand chemical weapons, our knowledge of their ability to deliver those \nagents against long-range targets outside of Iraq is limited.\n  To assure the formation of a coalition to contain Hussein, we must \npass this resolution.\n  The President must have this authority. We want the U.N. to demand \nfull inspections before this threat becomes even greater. This \nCongressional authorization to use force if necessary will send a \nmessage to the United Nations: Congress is united. We stand behind our \nCommander in Chief.\n  In 1945 the world community gathered together to denounce the \natrocities committed by Hitler and form the United Nations. That action \nmade a commitment to protect succeeding generations from the scourge of \nwar\n\n[[Page S10023]]\n\nand promised such horrors would never again take place. Now it is \nincumbent upon the United National to fulfill that promise. The U.N. \nmust send a message that the international community will not tolerate \nregimes which commit genocide against their own people, employ weapons \nof mass destruction against other countries, and harbor terrorists.\n  The world community must confront this Iraqi threat. This resolution \ngives the President the support he needs to convince the U.N. to join \nin building that coalition.\n  United States policy must be clear. Should the United Nations fail to \nlive up to its promise, this resolution authorizes the President to \ntake the necessary steps to protect the United States and ensure the \nstability of the world community.\n  With this authority the President may state clearly to members of \nother nations: Are you with us? Do you support our determination to \nface this threat now?\n  We are not alone, Great Britain and other nations are already \nsupporting our President.\n  A new history of international courage can be written now. This \ngeneration need not endure a long and bloody world war if our leaders \nstand together and state clearly: the world will not condone defiance \nand deception, we will not allow a dictator to rise from the ashes of \ndefeat to menace the world with awesome weapons.\n  I support our Commander in Chief.\n  I shall vote for the administration's bipartisan resolution.\n  Our Nation is the last real superpower. The burden of that status is \nthat every nation in the world must know we will use our military \nforce, if necessary, to prevent tyrants from acquiring and using \nweapons of annihilation.\n  It is my belief that with this authority President Bush may prove \nthat determination to the United Nations and there will be a coalition \nthat will bring peace through strength to the Middle East.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank our distinguished colleague from Alaska. It was \nvery helpful for him to make references to his knowledge of the pre-\nworld War II days. He had a very distinguished career in World War II \nas a member of the Army Air Corp and as a pilot. I had a very modest \none at the tail end, just in training, in the Navy. But both of us \nremember that period very well.\n  The Senator emphasized quite forcibly the need for the United Nations \nto face up to this. Having lived through that period, we remember the \nLeague of Nations. We remember the blatant attack by the Italian \nmilitary under the leadership of Mussolini against then Abyssinia, now \nreferred to as the nation of Ethiopia, and how the league began to look \nat that situation, and look at it and look at it and look at it and did \nnothing, and then the aggression during the attacks by Japan on China.\n  The Senator recalls these periods in history. Eventually the league \nwent out of business. It fell into the dust bin of history and in some \nsmall vestige was absorbed into the United Nations.\n  I have a strong view, and I think our President has made reference to \nthis, that unless the United Nations lives up to its charter and \nassumes the responsibility of enforcing its own Security Council \nresolution, that organization, too, could fall into the dust bin of \nhistory, not unlike the League of Nations.\n  Does the Senator share those views?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I certainly do. I share deeply the views of the Senator \nfrom Virginia. It does seem to me that we should have learned a lesson \nfrom the period of World War II. It took a terrible attack upon Pearl \nHarbor to bring us to the point where we were willing to enter that \nwar. Our Nation was part of the group trying to brush Hitler under the \nrug, thinking somehow or another this would go away. But President \nRoosevelt, to his great credit, had the courage to stand up and try to \nfind ways to help those who were willing to stand in Hitler's way.\n  Now is the time to recognize that once a person becomes President of \nthe United States and becomes Commander in Chief, there is an awesome \nresponsibility, and particularly after the events of September 11 of \nlast year, we have to recognize that as Commander in Chief he needs our \nsupport. Politics in my mind has always stopped at the water's edge. We \nought to be united behind our President when he is dealing with \nproblems such as Saddam Hussein. We certainly ought to be united in \nterms of voicing the sentiment that the United Nations must stand up \nand be counted this time.\n  Sixteen times. How many times does he have to go to the well before \nhe finds out that he must comply with these U.N. mandates? There is \nenough evidence out there now that Saddam Hussein has failed to comply \nwith the mandates that give rise to a world coalition to contain him. \nWe thought we already had.\n  We have our Coast Guard stopping ships going into the station. We \nhave pilots flying over the two no-fly zones every day. And on the \nground he has palaces all over the place and will not let anyone know \nwhat is in them.\n  Mr. WARNER. Might I add that those pilots to whom the Senator \nreferred, American and Great Britain, were shot at 60 times in just the \nmonth of September alone and they have been at it now for over a \ndecade. It is the only enforcement of any resolution undertaken by any \nof the member nations. It is the United States, Great Britain, and at \none time France. They have now discontinued. That is the only \nenforcement of any resolution.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have spoken to those young pilots at the Prince Sultan \nairbase in Saudi Arabia and at our offices in Kuwait and even in \nLondon. Many of our own pilots who flew those missions day in and day \nout did not reenlist. They just got tired of the stress of flying over \nthe no-fly zone and being shot at daily by missiles that are capable of \ndowning their aircraft.\n  Thank God we have some of the systems to defend against those \nmissiles, but the U.N. has absolutely had blinders on. They have not \neven seen that. Both British and American pilots are shot at daily by \nthis person. Why? Because they are flying over no-fly zones. They have \nevery right under international law to be there because Saddam Hussein \nagreed they could be there.\n  Mr. WARNER. In writing.\n  Mr. STEVENS. In writing.\n  He is shooting missiles at them every day.\n  It is high time we did away with that concept that the area of \nBaghdad is off limits. If they down an airplane, I don't think there is \nany question in the world we should declare war against them because he \nhas violated the United Nations agreement he entered into himself. The \nidea of allowing him to shoot at pilots day in and day out with \nimpunity is totally beyond my comprehension.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. The purpose of this resolution is to prevent a pilot from \nbeing downed. If we are resolute in this Chamber, if we clearly show, \nnot only to the American public but to the whole world, that we stand \narm in arm with our President, no daylight between us which can be \nexploited by Saddam Hussein and perhaps weak nations--if we are arm in \narm, it is the extent to which this United Nations is more likely to \nfulfill its obligations under the charter and, hopefully, devise a \nresolution which can bring about an inspection regime which has teeth \nin it this time, and make it very clear if Saddam Hussein's regime does \nnot live up to it, then member nations such as ours and others in the \ncoalition can utilize and resort to force.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator is absolutely correct. The \nreal problem is until the members of the United Nations know we mean \nbusiness, they are not going to come and join a coalition. It takes \nmoney, it takes time, it takes commitment, it takes internal debates \nlike this in every democracy. But the necessity is there for us to tell \nthe world we are ready. We are ready to bring an end to this man's \ndeceitful action against the world. But until we do, who is going to \njoin a coalition until they know the superpower is really in there? We \nhave to put our money on the table first. We have to put our hand out \nthere to anyone who is ready to join this coalition, to say: We are \nthere. Are you with us or not? If you are not, then you are not part of \nhistory, as far as I am concerned. History will read the nations who \nstood together and stopped Saddam Hussein, saved the world, as well\n\n[[Page S10024]]\n\nas those who joined with us in World War II saved the world.\n  I think this threat is even worse, though, than the one we faced. It \nis the most awesome thing possible, the more I learn about these \nweapons he has, weapons of mass destruction that can be deployed and \nused in so many ways. To think a person is there who has been willing \nto use them against Iran, against his own people, the Kurds. I still \nbelieve some of the problems our people had in the Persian Gulf war \ncame from his testing some of those weapons. There is no question in my \nmind.\n  Mr. WARNER. My colleague is absolutely right. Now with the \ntransportability of some of those weapons of mass destruction, and if \nhe were to place them in the hands of the international terrorist \nring--I don't say he hasn't done it already. We don't have the specific \nknowledge--that is an imminent danger to the United States.\n  But you concluded on history. I would like to read one brief \nstatement. June 1936, Haile Selassie, Emperor of Abyssinia--Ethiopia \ntoday--in an appeal to the League of Nations.\n\n       I assert that the problem submitted to the Assembly today \n     is a much wider one. It is not merely a question of the \n     settlement of Italian aggression. It is a collective \n     security. It is the very essence of the League of Nations. It \n     is the confidence that each state is to place in \n     international treaties. It is the value of promises made to \n     small states that their integrity and their independence \n     shall be respected and ensured. It is the principle of \n     equality of states on the one hand, or otherwise the \n     obligation laid upon small powers to accept the bonds of \n     vassalship. In a word, it is international morality that is \n     at stake. Do the signatures appended to a treaty have value \n     only insofar as the signatory powers have a personal, direct \n     and immediate interest involved?\n\n  The rest is history. The League did nothing but debate and debate and \ndid nothing. And this country perished.\n  We are at that juncture now, I say respectfully to the United \nNations. Will they fall into the dustbin of history as did the League?\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator and I are of another \ngeneration. There is no question about that. I never thought I would \nlive to see the day I would say there is no question in my mind this is \na greater threat than what we faced when we were young. But we had \ntime. There was time to adjust. Even in the Persian Gulf war, we had \ntime to take the actions that were necessary to evict Saddam Hussein's \nlikes from Kuwait.\n  But now it is not a matter of time. I am convinced the clock is \nticking on the world as far as this threat is concerned. These are \nweapons of mass destruction. Even one of them should lead a person to \nhave some fear. The only thing we can do is to join together with the \nworld.\n  Someone said to me the other day we can't do it alone. Whoever said \nthat is absolutely right. This is not something one nation can do \nalone. But this is something where one nation can lead. That is what is \nhappening right now. We must lead. We must form this coalition, and we \nmust convince the U.N. to be a part of that coalition and to be firm. \nAnd this time--this time, to know either they enforce those mandates \nthat come from the U.N., or we will lead the world to enforce them. It \nmust be done.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we thank our colleague. The advancement of \ntechnology is what makes things different. The advances of technology \nare what underlies this doctrine of preemptive strike, which our \nPresident says must be addressed now, not only by our Nation, but other \nnations that wish to protect themselves and their own security. That is \na very important issue, and I give great credit to this President for \nhaving the courage to bring to the forefront of the world--not just the \nUnited States, but the forefront of the world--the threats we face with \nnow rapid technology and the development of weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to praise my two learned, worthy \ncolleagues who have done so much through the years to make sure our \ncountry is free and many areas of the world are free as well. I want to \nassociate myself with their remarks.\n  I was particularly impressed with the remarks of the distinguished \nSenator from Alaska, whom we all revere and respect, and, I might add, \nparticularly with the remarks of the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia. I was very aware of the Abyssinia problem--now we call it \nEthiopia. I think his point is well taken. I would just like to \nassociate myself with the remarks of both of my dear colleagues.\n  I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to use such time as I need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this week, as we know, we debate the most \nserious topic Congress can ever face, whether we will authorize the \nPresident to use force to address a looming threat to our national \nsecurity. Right here and now I wish to say I will support this \nPresident, should he determine we need to deploy the military of the \nUnited States to force Iraq into compliance with the resolutions of the \ninternational community requiring it--transparently and permanently--to \ndisarm itself of weapons of mass destruction.\n  If this requires the removal of Saddam Hussein from power, as I \nbelieve it will, I will support this President's policy of regime \nchange, and I respectfully urge my colleagues to join me. It may be \nearly in our Senate debate on this resolution, but we have been \ndiscussing our policy options for years. The President and his advisers \nhave regularly consulted with us, with our allies, with the \ninternational community, and with the American public. As a result, I \nbelieve this administration will act with a coalition of willing \nnations, fully within the boundaries of international law, with the \nsupport of this Congress, and with the support and prayers of the \nAmerican people.\n  I am honored to have served the people of Utah for 26 years. Utahans \nare a patriotic people. Almost all, Republicans and Democrats, will \nsupport the President of the United States when he makes his final \ndetermination the vital interests of this country are at risk and we \nmust take military action to protect those vital interests. Tonight the \nPresident will make that case before the American people, and we will \nall listen intently to his words.\n  As a Senator who represents the interests of Utah but also the \ninterests of our country, I know a decision on the use of force is the \nmost serious consideration I can make because the costs may be measured \nby the ultimate sacrifice of good Americans. I make this decision with \nthe deepest of study and prayer, and I offer my prayers to support any \nPresident who must make such a final decision.\n  President Bush has acted conscientiously and openly in determining \nhis administration's policy toward Iraq. I do not understand criticisms \nof this administration as being secretive, unilateral, militaristic, \nand uncooperative. From my perspective, none of these adjectives \nrepresent an objective reality. President Bush has warned us of the \nthreat from Saddam Hussein's Iraq since he stepped into the national \nspotlight during the Presidential campaign. I was there. He has been \nexpressing what most observers, expert analysts, and honest brokers \nhave long recognized.\n  Iraq has broken all of its pledges to cooperate with the \ninternational community and disarm;\n  Iraq has refused to allow international inspectors since 1998;\n  Iraq has never completely accounted for materials used for weapons of \nmass destruction, specifically biological and chemical weapons, since \nits defeat in 1991;\n  Iraq has violated every U.N. resolution passed since 1991;\n  Iraq has repeatedly fired on U.S. and allied aircraft patrolling the \nnorthern and southern ``no-fly'' zones;\n  Saddam Hussein has continued to threaten his neighbors and has never \nceased his hostile rhetoric toward the United States;\n  And, Iraq has never proven to the international community that it has \nabandoned its pursuit of nuclear weapons.\n  In fact, as a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, \nI can tell you Iraq has never really abandoned that.\n  Charges that the President has been unilateralist are completely \nunfounded. The pace of diplomatic activity conducted by administration \nofficials in the capitals of our friends and\n\n[[Page S10025]]\n\nallies, as well as in Geneva and in New York, is as active as any \nadministration's diplomacy in modern times. Every day there is another \nrespectful consultation, as the President's Secretaries of State and \nDefense, and the National Security Adviser's team, have repeatedly \ndemonstrated.\n\n  The President's speech before the United Nations 1 day and 1 year \nafter September 11 was the most eloquent and forceful presentation of a \nU.S. President before that body.\n  His appeal was ethical and it was logical. He stood before the body \nof the international community and he said:\n\n       The United States stands with you behind the resolutions \n     that are the core reason for this body's existence.\n       If this body is to mean anything, the President logically \n     implored, then this body must stand behind the resolutions \n     that Iraq is flaunting today.\n       Never before has a President made such a dramatic and \n     persuasive appeal before the U.N.\n       Never before has the U.N. been confronted with such a clear \n     choice: Stand by what you say . . . . . . or stand aside in \n     irrelevance.\n\n  The President has consulted with every Member of Congress, and with \nmost of us many times.\n  His representatives have dutifully and constructively testified \nbefore numerous of our committees, and they have always been available \nfor more discussions when needed.\n  While the Constitution gives the foreign policy-making prerogative to \nthe executive branch, I have always thought it sound judgment that a \nPresident voluntarily seek support and authorization from the U.S. \nCongress.\n  Clearly, that is what this President has done with numerous \nconsultations over the past weeks, including discussions that have \nculminated in this resolutions we will debate this week.\n  This administration has respectfully included the public in this most \nserious of deliberations. Virtually all of these presentations, \ntestimonies, and speeches have been done in the public eye.\n  While a few congressional briefings have had to be conducted in \nclosed settings due to the necessary review of classified materials, \nthe arguments and most of the evidence for the determination of this \nadministration's policy on Iraq have been there for the public to \njudge.\n  The President's speech tonight will crystalize for the American \npeople the important decision before us.\n  In the past 2 weeks, there have been a few partisan eruptions.\n  I believe we should never shirk from debate, and I believe that the \nmatters of war and peace must be thoroughly debated as long as we \nrecognize that, in the world of human affairs, there is no perfect \nwisdom, particularly of how the future will unfold.\n  But let us not presume there are limits to good faith.\n  There is not a single Democrat or Republican who glibly supports a \ndecision that may have the consequence of shedding blood.\n  And there is no Democrat or Republican who would ever seek to \njeopardize the national security of this country by refusing to engage \na threat that is looming.\n  The decision to go to war cannot, must not, ever be a function of \npolitics.\n  In 1996, I warned that Osama bin Laden was a threat to this country. \nBin Laden's activities had been of concern to a few prior to this. But, \nin that year, a number of interviews and articles with this man led me \nto conclude that he had large and evil intentions. I believed that he \nwould distinguish himself from other terrorists by taking his \ngrievances out of his homeland and his region and that some day--at a \ntime we could not predetermine--he would be a threat to this country.\n  I cannot raise this point with any pride. I warned about bin Laden, \nand many good people in the intelligence and law enforcement agencies \nbegan to respond to this growing threat.\n  For reasons the historians will someday study, based in part on the \ninquiries we have already begun, we did not stop bin Laden. And he \nbrought the terrorism war home to us.\n  Two years later after I first warned about bin Laden, he attacked two \nU.S. embassies in the same morning, destroying buildings, and killing \nAmerican diplomats and their families, as well as hundreds of Africans \nin Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.\n  A few days later, the President addressed the Nation, telling us he \nhad responded to the Africa attacks by bin Laden with cruise missiles \nagainst Sudan and Afghanistan.\n  While some raced to criticize him for ``wagging the dog'' trying to \ndistance himself from the unfolding drama of his personal troubles I \npersonally spoke out and approved of the President's initiative.\n\n  I was in Salt Lake at the time. Because I had raised bin Laden so \nmany times and had become thoroughly involved in trying to help the \nPresident with some of his problems, they interviewed me there, and I \nsaid at that time that he did the right thing, but I also said he \nshould follow up and not just do it once.\n  We were attacked and the U.S. had to respond, because if we did not \nrespond, our passivity would invite further attacks.\n  I also urged the President not to let that be a single set of \nstrikes. I knew that any response we made short of eliminating the \nthreat of bin Laden would embolden bin Laden.\n  Since the days after September 11, I have often thought of those key \nmoments in the late 1990s. I do so not to cast blame. The lives lost in \nNew York, at the Pentagon, and in that Pennsylvania countryside will \nalways be a reminder of how we failed to anticipate, failed to respond, \nfailed to eliminate a threat we knew was out there.\n  But let these not be lessons lost.\n  The lives lost in New York, Washington, Pennsylvania, and in our \ncampaign in Afghanistan demonstrate that if we are not prepared to \nengage an enemy before he strikes us then we must accept that we will \npay a cost for pursuing him afterward.\n  To me and to many Utahns and citizens throughout the Nation, the \nlesson of September 11 is: do not wait for your enemy to attack--\nespecially when he has access to weapons of mass destruction.\n  If you have evidence of your enemy's capabilities and with Saddam \nHussein we do and if you have evidence of his enmity and with Saddam \nHussein we do--then do not err on the side of wishful thinking. With \nenemies with the destructive capabilities of Saddam Hussein, we must be \nhard-headed.\n  The administration has argued that Saddam's Iraq poses a threat, a \nthreat that must be eliminated. If we cannot eliminate the threat of \nweapons of mass destruction through coercive, thorough and \ncomprehensive inspections backed by the threat of force supported by \nthe international community--then the U.S. must seek to build our own \ncoalition of willing nations to disarm Iraq by force and allow for a \nregime that will replace Saddam and return Iraq to the community of \nnations.\n  I believe the President should continue to work with the \ninternational community to seek ways to disarm Iraq short of military \nintervention. Military force should never be our first course of \naction.\n  But I will not support a resolution that conditions our authorization \non actions by the United Nations.\n  Such a move would set a precedent over sovereign decisions conducted \nby this country to defend its national interests.\n  Supporting such language would, in my opinion, infringe upon the \nconstitutional prerogative that resides with the President to conduct \nand manage the Nation's foreign policy.\n  Congress must resist attempts to micromanage a war effort.\n  The resolution we debate today is an authorization. But, the timing \nand modalities of action need to be--and must be controlled by the \nadministration, with consultation wherever possible, so long as that \nconsultation does not hamper the war effort.\n  Traditional geopolitics requires us to think about national security \nin categories of our interests.\n  Our vital interests are defined as the security of our homeland and \nour way of life; we must defend them at any costs, and we must be \nwilling to defend them alone, if necessary.\n  There are areas of vital national interest to this country, that if \nthey were threatened or succumbed to hostile control, would jeopardize \nour homeland or our way of life.\n  They are: the Western Hemisphere; Japan; Europe; and the Persian \nGulf.\n  Saddam Hussein continues to threaten the stability of the Persian \nGulf. From this perspective, I believe that the frightening \ncapabilities of\n\n[[Page S10026]]\n\nSaddam's chemical and biological weapons pose a threat to the region, \nand to the stability of the Gulf, and therefore to our vital national \ninterests.\n  In addition, nontraditional geopolitics recognizes that international \nphenomena other than nation states must be considered when assessing \nthe national security of the United States.\n  Terrorism is the number one non-traditional threat to the U.S. today. \nThis may seem obvious after September 11. It was not obvious enough \nbefore September 11.\n\n  The American people know that we are at war with al-Qaida.\n  The American people recognize that never again can we be complacent \nabout threats to this country and our interests.\n  And the American people understand that this war on al-Qaida cannot \nbe used as an excuse to ignore other grave threats, such as the threat \nthat Iraq continues to pose.\n  We should not assume that Saddam Hussein will politely stand in line \nbehind al-Qaida.\n  With the questions remaining about Iraq's weapons of mass \ndestruction, with too many suggestions of Iraq's ties with terrorists, \nand with no question about Iraq's animosity to the United States, and \nother countries as well, including many in the Middle East, should the \nUnited States consider an option of doing nothing, or too little, as we \ndid with al-Qaida before September 11?\n  Perhaps, as a result of the diplomatic pressure building on Saddam \nHussein in recent days, his regime will comply with a forceful and \ncomprehensive international inspection regime.\n  However, we should not for a single moment forget Saddam's history of \nobfuscation and delay. His record of noncompliance is 100 percent. Any \ninspection regime which we agree to support must complete the actions \nrequired in all Security Council resolutions, including the ones being \ndrafted now, that would demand compliance with inspections or face the \nuse of force.\n  Some have suggested that a war on Iraq would be the beginning of a \nradical doctrine of preemption--that we are now setting a precedent for \nunilateral military action against regimes that we find odious.\n  The idea of ``preemption'' is as old as Grotius, the father of \ninternational law, who wrote in the 17th century.\n  U.S. policymakers have never foresworn the option of preemption, and \nhave never seen the U.N. Charter as restricting the use of preemption \nin the event of a threat to our national security. There are many \nexamples of this thinking in both Republican and Democratic \nadministrations.\n  Recall that U.S. nuclear doctrine never adopted a no-first-use \npolicy.\n  Nor is the policy decision we are facing today opening up a new, \nmilitaristic, and unilateral approach to dealing with other countries \nwith which we have conflicts.\n  Some have suggested that, if we authorize the use of force against \nIraq, we are automatically implying that we support the use of force \nagainst the other two countries in the ``axis of evil'' termed by the \nPresident.\n  Today, the administration is using diplomacy to control the ongoing \nconfrontation on the Korean Peninsula.\n  And while Iran remains a geopolitical threat, as it continues to fund \nterrorists operating in the Middle East, and is extending its influence \nin Afghanistan, the political foment within Iran is also providing a \nchallenge to that Islamic fundamentalist dictatorship, as more and more \nIranians seek to overthrow their corrupt and repressive tyranny.\n  Despite some leftist revisionist histories, America has always been \nreluctant to use force overseas. As a democracy, we are imbued with \nvalues of caution and respect for human rights, reluctance and a desire \nto let other nations choose their own paths.\n\n  But the world changed for us on September 11, 2001.\n  The American people are patient, but we should never let that \npatience be used against us. As the President has said, if we are to \nwait until we have definite proof that Iraq intends to use weapons of \nmass destruction against us, then it may be too late.\n  For too long, we were hesitant to attack al-Qaida, presuming that \nthey would never dare to attack us in the heart of our financial \ncenter, at the core of our defense establishment, in the openness of \nour commercial airways. We were wrong.\n  Can we accept the consequences of being wrong with Saddam Hussein's \nIraq?\n  If this Congress authorizes the use of force, and if the President \nconcludes that force is the only option in removing Saddam Hussein from \npower and disarming Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, then I believe \nthat every member of this body will fully support our President and our \nArmed Forces.\n  Iraq has been in a dangerous geopolitical limbo since Saddam Hussein \nwas ejected from Kuwait in 1991, and then left to oppress his people \nover the ensuing decade.\n  If the United States must act to remove Saddam Hussein, we must be \ncommitted to help reconstruct Iraq. This will take sustained policy \nfocus. The U.S. will, once again, pay for a large portion of the costs \nof war. We would expect our allies to pay for a large portion of the \nreconstruction.\n  U.S. policy must commit to the long-term stability of Iraq. We must \nwork with the various Iraqi ethnic groups to build their own vision of \na tolerant, educated, modern Iraq. Many of the Iraqi people have a \nhistory of valuing education, modernity and multiethnic society. We \nmust commit to staying in Iraq until the basic institutions that will \nprovide long-term stability are built.\n  A stable, tolerant, modern Iraq may transform the Arab Middle East. \nOther traditional states will have to explain to their own peoples why \nthey hesitate to grant democratic rights and privileges, basic human \nrights, and respect for women, if an Iraqi government were to arise \nfrom the repression of Saddam to blossom as an example of tolerance and \nmodernity.\n  If we commit to the liberation of the Iraqi people, and we assist \nthem in rising out of decades of Saddam Hussein's depredations, the \nwhole world will be able to see that the Arab world is not predestined \nto tyranny, radical regimes, anti-Western hatred, willful ignorance.\n  I believe that this is President Bush's vision. The President \nunderstands that the use of force against Saddam Hussein--if it comes \nto this--will be the beginning of the end--not just of that dictator's \nbrutal reign, but also of nearly a century of Arab despotism.\n  I pray that Saddam Hussein capitulates to the international community \nand allows unfettered and comprehensive inspections, and that he \nremoves himself from power or is removed by some brave Iraqi.\n  But if we are not so fortunate, I pray Godspeed for our men and women \nin the military when they, once again, go beyond our shores to protect \nthose of us within them.\n  Mr. President, I again thank our very fine leader on our side and \nothers on the other side for their efforts in this regard, for the \nsupport they have for this country, for our President, and for doing \nwhat is right.\n  I personally respect the distinguished Senator from Virginia very \nmuch. I have watched him through the years work with both sides, trying \nto bring people together and to accomplish the best things for our \ncountry. I personally express my respect for him here today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our colleague for his kind \ncomments, and also for his important statement he has delivered to the \nSenate.\n  I want to pick up on one thing that the Senator mentioned, and there \nhas not been as much discussion as yet on this subject. It is a very \nimportant one.\n  The President has repeatedly said the use of force is the last \noption. But should that be taken, and there be force used by presumably \nour country, Great Britain, and hopefully others in the coalition, then \nthe responsibility devolves upon those nations, primarily those who use \nforce--again, hopefully, the United Nations would take a strong role, \nbut that remains to be seen--in trying to reestablish, for the people \nof Iraq, against whom we hold no animosity--the people--a nation \nbringing together the factions in the north, the Kurds, and the \nShi'ites in the south, and hold that country together.\n  But I find, in studying, as my astute colleague will undoubtedly \nbelieve, as we look at the situation in Kosovo, we\n\n[[Page S10027]]\n\nhad to come in there with other nations and help establish the economy, \nand we are still there. Indeed, in South Korea, how well you know we \nhave been there now over 50 years.\n  It seems to me there are several points with regard to Iraq which \ndifferentiate the responsibilities of our Nation and other nations \nfollowing such hostility, as hopefully will not occur, but should they \noccur; that is, Iraq, at one time, was an absolute extraordinary \nnation, a nation of well-educated people, a nation which had a number \nof natural resources, primarily petroleum, from whence to gain a \nrevenue flow.\n  So far as I can determine, much of that infrastructure of \nintellectual people and well-educated, hard-working people and, indeed, \nthe oil that is present there, once it is properly cared for and put in \nthe competitive world market, it seems to me that the dollars involved \nwould be, comparatively speaking, much less because of the natural \nresources, and the problem of reconstructing a government, hopefully, \nwould not be as challenging as maybe some say because of the presence \nof such a fine citizenry, almost all of whom, not all, have been \nseverely depressed by Saddam Hussein and the brutality of his regime.\n  Does the Senator share those thoughts?\n  Mr. HATCH. I do. Our intelligence shows that the Iraqi people know \nthey are repressed, that there are many of them who wish things would \nchange, but there is such repression that they are afraid to strike \nout, afraid to speak out, or afraid to react in ways other than the way \nthe current leadership in Iraq wants them to react.\n  This is a very important country. It has tremendous resources, \nresources that are fully capable of helping that country to resuscitate \nitself, to reconstruct. Those resources are being ripped off of the \nIraqi people right now by Saddam Hussein and others around him. They \nare being spent on matters that really do not benefit the country of \nIraq, and they are being spent on matters that do not uplift the \naspirations and hopes of the people in Iraq.\n  As we all know, there is no question that if we could get rid of this \nrepressive regime, Iraq could become a real player in the Middle East \nand help everybody in the world to understand that Islam is not a \nreligion of destruction. It is not a religion of warfare in particular. \nIt is a very good religion with tremendous ethics and responsible \napproaches towards life and towards living in the world community.\n  Nor do I agree with some of our critics in the evangelical movement \nin this country who have been outspoken in their criticism of Islam, \nblaming the radical elements of Islam, who are not the majority, for \nmany of the things that are going on, that are reprehensible, including \nthe Osama bin Laden group, al-Qaida, and so many other terrorist \ngroups.\n  The Senator is absolutely right. We believe, and our intelligence \nshows, that Iraq could become a major player in world affairs, a major \nconstruct for good, if it had different leadership and if the people \nhad the privilege of democratic principles.\n  I thank my colleague because he has been pointing out all day, as he \nhas served here, very important nuances upon which every one of us \nshould take more time to reflect.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague. He has many years of \nexperience in the Senate. His wisdom is being brought to bear on this \ncritical issue. All of us feel a weight on our shoulders, the \nimportance of this debate, and the importance of the vote we will cast. \nIf there was ever a vote that would be clearly a matter of conscience \nbetween all of us, this is it.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. WARNER. I see our valued colleague on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. I look forward to hearing his remarks.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from \nVirginia for the opportunity to be here today and for his close \nattention to these matters of war and these matters of peace that so \noften come before us on the U.S. Armed Services Committee, and for his \ncounsel and wisdom. I thank him so much.\n  I rise today to discuss our Nation's Iraq policy, and the resolution \nwe are now debating. This resolution could give the President the power \nto send the United States Armed Services into a military conflict with \nIraq.\n  As I am sure most of my colleagues will agree, for the U.S. Congress \nthere is no more important debate than one that involves a decision \nthat may lead to loss of life of our brave men and women in uniform.\n  It is without question that Saddam Hussein poses a threat to the \nMiddle East, our allies in the region, and our international interests \nthat include rebuilding Afghanistan and making peace between the \nIsraelis and Palestinians.\n  Saddam has refused to comply with United Nations resolutions that \nwere the basis for a cease-fire during the Persian Gulf war in 1991. He \nagreed to those terms in order to prevent the multinational coalition \nfrom proceeding into Iraq and removing him from power by force.\n  Throughout most of the 1990s Saddam was held in check through U.N. \nweapons inspectors, a naval blockade and United States and allied air \npatrols over the southern and northern areas of Iraq.\n  During that time the U.N. inspectors uncovered Saddam's chemical and \nbiological programs and dismantled those they located. However, since \n1998, Saddam has not allowed U.N. weapons inspections.\n  Now, nearly 4 years have passed with no outside reporting on progress \nmade in Saddam's chemical, biological, or nuclear programs. Moreover, \nwe know that Saddam recently attempted to purchase aluminum rods used \nto refine uranium. These rods could be used to develop materials for \nnuclear weapons.\n  President Bush and his advisers have determined that Saddam Hussein's \nquest for weapons of mass destruction must end now. The President said \nin his speech before the U.N. that Saddam poses an immediate, unchecked \nthreat to our Nation and our allies, and unless we act now his arsenal \nwill only grow.\n  Any resolution on action involving Iraq that the United States \nCongress would approve must focus on the imperative of disarmament of \nIraq.\n  By disarming Saddam and removing his nuclear, biological and chemical \ncapability, he will pose no strategic threat to the United States or \nour allies. Saddam would be contained.\n  If, in order to disarm Iraq, we need to use military force that \nresults in the removal of the current regime, then we should do so. \nSaddam Hussein must know that the United States will support President \nBush's use of force to remove him, if he does not comply with orders to \ndisarm and destroy all weapons of mass destruction.\n  The President has suggested that ``regime change'' may be the only \nway Iraq will comply with the 16 existing U.N. resolutions. However, a \nresolution whose primary focus is ``regime change'' does not address \nthe fact that the next regime in Iraq, even if it is more friendly to \nthe United States, would inherit all weapons systems and programs that \nthe United States did not destroy.\n  Additionally, if we pursue ``regime change'' as an objective, we will \nseverely limit our ability to form a multinational coalition of support \nas President Bush's father did so successfully during the gulf war.\n  Our allies worldwide have expressed support for disarming Saddam, but \nlittle enthusiasm for regime change.\n  Alone among President Bush's advisers, Secretary of State Colin \nPowell has suggested that putting weapons inspectors back in and making \nsure they can do their job is the proper avenue to pursue.\n  The heart of this resolution should outline precisely what access \nweapons inspectors should be afforded as they inspect the Iraqi \nmilitary capabilities. It should demand complete transparency of \nSaddam's military inventory, and unrestricted and unfettered access to \nall of Iraq by U.N. weapons inspectors, including the presidential \npalaces.\n  In concert with a focus on disarmament, a congressional resolution \nshould also strongly urge the President to exhaust all diplomatic \nefforts within and outside the United Nations. Total disarmament of \nIraq should be a multinational effort.\n  Nevertheless we must reserve the right, and give the President the \nauthority, to act unilaterally provided\n\n[[Page S10028]]\n\nthe presence of an immediate and grave threat to the United States.\n  This congressional resolution should not give the President an \nimmediate and unconditional pass to wage war, but should place an \nemphasis on his diplomatic effort to resolve the issue of disarmament \nwithout loss of life.\n  If Saddam's defiance leads to war, we must also focus on what will \nneed to be accomplished after the war in order to ensure stability in \nthe region.\n  More thought must be given to the effort that will be required to \nmaintain peace and provide for the Iraqi people in the event that \nSaddam fails to resolve this issue peacefully.\n  We seek no quarrel with the people of Iraq and the international \ncommunity must be prepared to assist them. It is an endeavor that the \nUnited States should not undertake alone which, in my opinion, \nstrengthens the need for any use of force to be multilateral.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I have heard many hours \nof testimony from administration officials outlining their case for \nwar. But I fear we have not yet heard enough about what Iraq will look \nlike when the smoke clears.\n  I am willing to debate and support a resolution that has the \ncharacteristics that I have mentioned, but there needs to be equal \ndebate and thought into how we will leave Iraq and what kind of \ncommitment we are willing to give.\n  This resolution will serve as Saddam's last chance at a peaceful \nconclusion to his years of defiance of international law if it meets \nthese conditions: The primary objective of the United States is the \ndisarmament of Iraq rather than regime change; the United States will \nwork to establish international support and cooperation and exhaust all \ndiplomatic avenues before going it alone in Iraq; and the United \nNations weapons inspectors will be allowed unfettered access to inspect \nIraqi weapons systems and facilities and they will be supported by \narmed U.N. troops.\n  With these objectives, the United States will demonstrate that we \nseek a peaceful and diplomatic solution, but if diplomacy fails the \nUnited States will take every measure necessary to defend our country, \nour allies, and our interests. This is our responsibility to our \nnational security, our international interests, our citizens, and the \npeople of the world.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nVirginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our colleague for his contribution \nto this debate. Listening to him, as I have to all the others who have \nspoken today, underscores the importance of each Senator hoping to \ncontribute to this debate.\n  My understanding is the leadership will announce shortly the \nintention to have periods tomorrow that this debate can take place. I \nhope we will experience tomorrow as robust and important debate as we \nhave had today on the floor.\n  I yield the floor, and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the order that has been guiding us all day \ncontinuing until 4 o'clock was the time be equally divided between the \ntwo leaders, and that Senators have up to 15 minutes to speak on the \nIraq resolution. We have done a good job in doing that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that any Senators who wish to come yet today, \nbefore we adjourn for the evening, still be guided by the 15-minute \nlimitation. Senator Daschle and I have spoken about this, and I am sure \nSenator Lott would agree--although I have not spoken with him--that we \nwould be well advised that Tuesday we are going to be very busy, with a \nlot of people speaking. Senators who wish to speak would be well \nadvised to notify their respective cloakrooms. So people will not have \nto wait all day for their turn, we can set up a sequence. If an equal \nnumber of Democrats and Republicans wish to speak, we will alternate, \nand that way we can have an orderly debate and move on to the ultimate \ndisposition at a subsequent time.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think I can speak for our leadership on that. That is a \nconstructive observation. I am sure my distinguished colleague would \nthink almost all 100 Senators will want, at one point in time prior to \nthe vote, to express themselves on this important issue. So that will \nresult in a considerable amount of the Senate's time. It is the most \nimportant thing before us. I think that is wise counsel.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Byrd asked me if I would clear a \nunanimous consent request in regard to this matter with him. So I ask \nthat everyone be recognized for 15 minutes, and I am sure he will agree \nto a reasonable time. I don't have his permission now. So I will \nreiterate my unanimous consent request, with the exception of Senator \nByrd.\n\n  I also ask Senators who wish to speak to get word to their \ncloakrooms, and we can set up a time for them to speak during the day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have just been advised possibly someone \non our side might want some additional time, and the matter will be \nmanaged here by the designees, the respective leaders. I have offered \nto work with Senator Lott, and he accepted that offer. There may be \nothers who want more time. We will try to facilitate the management of \nthe floor.\n  My point is those Senators who might desire to exceed 15 minutes, I \nam sure the Senate will consider why they need that additional time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as usual, our staff saw a possible problem \nwith this. So what I think would be best to do is just not worry about \nSenator Byrd. We will have this limitation apply for the rest of the \nevening and until 12:30 tomorrow when we go into the party conferences.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that any further speeches \ntonight on the Iraq matter be limited to 15 minutes, and that when we \ncome in tomorrow morning to go on the Iraq matter, the speeches be \nlimited to 15 minutes until 12:30.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is my understanding it will be around \n10 o'clock.\n  Mr. REID. It will be 9 or 10 o'clock.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank our colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am going to depart the floor. I see no \ncolleague on either side wishing to address further the debate on Iraq, \nalthough the opportunity has been offered.\n  I ask unanimous consent at the conclusion of my brief remarks an \narticle that appeared today in the Washington Post be printed in \ntoday's Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  The article is well composed in the sense it asks eight questions of \nthose participating in the Iraqi debate about issues at the heart of \nwhat we are discussing. I hope by including it in the Record it is more \nreadily available to colleagues as they work on their remarks. These \nare the very questions I encountered this weekend and last weekend as I \ntraveled in my State. I daresay, other Senators will be asked these \nquestions by their constituents and therefore this article is very \nhelpful.\n  I will not pick up without specifically pointing to those provisions \nwhich prompt me to do so. I pick up comments to the effect by others \nthat if Saddam Hussein does this, then everything will be one way or \nthe other. If he does not do that, then this will happen, one way or \nthe other. I call it the doctrine of giving Saddam Hussein the benefit \nof the doubt. I urge colleagues to think about that because we are \ndealing with an individual who is\n\n[[Page S10029]]\n\nextremely complex, at the least. People are trying to read his mind. \nSpeaking for myself, I have no capability of reading his mind. Nor do I \never predicate action I take or support on what he might do if he does \nthis. I can't follow that line of reasoning. Therefore, I do not \nsubscribe to giving the benefit of the doubt to Saddam Hussein.\n\n  What dictates my views about this man is the clear record that he \nused poison gas against his own population, his own citizens of Iraq. \nIt is reputed, and I think it is well documented, he has actually \nbeheaded individuals who have stood up to disagree with him. So I \nsomehow feel he has not earned a place in leadership that you can, in \nany way, pontificate about, or figure out what he might do. I think we \nhave to decide as a free Nation what we are going to do, and urge the \nUnited Nations to lay that out very clearly in a resolution that leaves \nno doubt, gives no benefit of the doubt to him as to what he might do. \nWe should plan a course of decisive action because our very future is \ndependent upon, hopefully, the United Nations taking such actions as \nare necessary, clearly, to enforce their resolutions and such \nadditional resolution--and I hope it is only one--as they may devise.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\nDebate Over Iraq Focuses on Outcome--Multiple Scenarios Drive Questions \n                               About War\n\n                         (By David Von Drehle)\n\n       Congress plans this week to debate a joint resolution that \n     would give President Bush broad powers to disarm Iraq--\n     including the authority to invade the country and depose \n     President Saddam Hussein.\n       The resolution is expected to pass easily, in part because \n     leading Democrats want to get the issue of war behind them, \n     and in part because there is widespread agreement on Capitol \n     Hill that Hussein must be dealt with. ``We begin with the \n     common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to \n     the peace and stability of the Middle East,'' said Sen. Carl \n     M. Levin (D-Mich.), chairman of the Armed Services Committee.\n       There is also general agreement that if it comes to war, \n     the United States will win.\n       But beyond this first level of agreement lie major disputes \n     over important questions--about the alternatives to war, the \n     timing and, most of all, the outcomes. The debate in Congress \n     is likely to distill these disputes.\n       And although these questions may not be answerable without \n     a crystal ball--experts have already debated them without \n     researching consensus in congressional hearings, op-ed and \n     journal articles, speeches and interviews--they frame the \n     risks and the assumptions of the U.S. approach.\n       Here are eight of the most important questions:\n       (1) Can Hussein be ``contained'' and ``deterred''?\n       For more than 50 years of the Cold War, the United States \n     faced an enemy armed with thousands of high-yield bombs \n     mounted on sophisticated missiles and managed to avoid a \n     direct military confrontation. How? By ``containing'' the \n     enemy--that is, trying to prevent communist expansion--and \n     ``deterring'' attacks with threats of apocalyptic \n     retaliation.\n       Some experts believe that this strategy, applied \n     aggressively, can work with Iraq. After all, continued \n     containment and deterrence is the U.S. policy for dealing \n     with Iran, which is widely believed to be more advanced in \n     nuclear capability and deeply involved in supporting \n     terrorists. Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser to \n     then-President George H.W. Bush, recently argued that \n     ``Saddam is a familiar . . . traditional'' case, ``unlikely \n     to risk his investment in weapons of mass destruction, much \n     less his country, by handing such weapons to terrorists'' or \n     by using them for blackmail. ``While Saddam is thoroughly \n     evil, he is above all a power-hungry survivor.''\n       Hussein's behavior has not always squared with this view. \n     In 1993, he tried to use secret agents to assassinate George \n     H.W. Bush, and Iraqi guns routinely fire at allied aircraft \n     over the Iraqi ``no-fly'' zones. But proponents of continued \n     containment think there is a line that the Iraqi leader will \n     not cross for fear of the consequences.\n       This assumption drives the thinking of figures such as \n     Morton H. Halperin of the Council on Foreign Relations, who \n     advocates a policy of tougher weapons inspections and a more \n     effective embargo on trade with Iraq--``containment-plus,'' \n     as he calls it. This strategy, ``if pursued vigorously . . . \n     will, in fact, succeed in preventing Saddam from using \n     weapons of mass destruction or supplying them to terrorist \n     groups,'' Halperin recently assured Congress.\n       But many people, President Bush among them, believe \n     deterrence is no longer enough after the Sept. 11 attacks--\n     not when weapons might be delivered secretly to fanatics \n     willing to destroy themselves in an attack. Sen. John W. \n     Warner (R-Va.), the ranking Republic on the Armed Services \n     Committee, put it this way: ``The concept of deterrence that \n     served us well in the 20th century has changed. . . .  Those \n     who would commit suicide in their assaults on the free world \n     are not rational and are not deterred by rational concepts of \n     deterrence.''\n       (2) Is Hussein in league with al Qaeda?\n       Somewhere, there is a cold, hard answer to this question, \n     but so far, no one has publicly proved it one way or the \n     other. Though administration officials have charged that al \n     Qaeda operatives are living in Iraq, the same is believed to \n     be true of more than 50 other countries. Daniel Benjamin, \n     former director of counterterrorism for the National Security \n     Council, recently argued that secular Iraq and fundamentalist \n     al Qaeda are natural rivals, not co-conspirators.\n       But if the answer is yes, it strengthens the case for \n     moving quickly.\n       ``We must remove threats such as those [posed by] Saddam \n     Hussein, al Qaeda and other terrorist groups,'' retired Air \n     Force Lt. Gen. Thomas McInerney told a Senate hearing. The \n     same gaps in intelligence gathering that make it hard to know \n     whether Hussein deals with al Qaeda make it dangerous to \n     assume he doesn't, McInerney argued. ``We face an enemy that \n     makes its principal strategy the targeting of civilians. . . \n     . We should not wait to be attacked with weapons of mass \n     destruction.''\n       (3) Is disarmament possible without ``regime change''?\n       No one in the mainstream believes that Hussein will disarm \n     voluntarily, but some experts--including Secretary of State \n     Colin L. Powell--entertain the possibility that he will if it \n     is his last hope of survival.\n       That said, skepticism is very high that the Iraqi weapons \n     problem can be solved while Hussein runs the country. Charles \n     Duelfer, a veteran of previous weapons inspections in Iraq, \n     recently said, ``In my opinion, weapons inspections are not \n     the answer to the real problem, which is the regime.'' \n     Finding and destroying offending weapons now would not \n     prevent the regime from developing new ones after the \n     inspectors have left.\n       Even many proponents of renewed U.N. weapons inspections \n     see them mainly as a tool for building international support \n     for war. As retired Gen. Wesley Clark, a former supreme \n     commander of NATO, put it: ``The closer we get to the use of \n     force, the greater the likelihood. And the more we build up \n     the inspections idea, the greater the legitimacy of the \n     United States effort in the eyes of the world.''\n       (4) In the event of war, what would Hussein's military do?\n       There are two scenarios: one ghastly, one hopeful.\n       In the first, his commanders fire chemical and biological \n     weapons into Israel, trying to ignite a pan-Arabic war, and \n     lob gas bombs at approaching U.S. troops. In the other, Iraqi \n     officers refuse to commit such futile war crimes in the face \n     of certain defeat and turn on the dying regime.\n       ``Most of the army does not want to fight for Saddam,'' \n     McInerney maintained. ``We are already seeing increasing \n     desertions from the regular army as well as the Republican \n     Guards.'' He cited reports from inside Iraq that Hussein has \n     arrested or executed scores of disaffected officers and won't \n     allow even some elite Republican Guard units into Iraq's \n     cities, for fear of a coup. ``That's why I think there will \n     not be urban fighting.''\n       But retired Gen. Joseph Hoar, a former commander in chief \n     of U.S. Central Command, sees it differently. ``The nightmare \n     scenario is that six Iraqi Republican Guard divisions and six \n     heavy divisions, reinforced with several thousand \n     antiaircraft artillery pieces, defend the city of Baghdad. \n     The result would be high casualties on both sides, as well as \n     the civilian community . . . [and] the rest of the world \n     watches while we bomb and have artillery rounds exploded in \n     densely populated Iraqi neighborhoods,'' Hoar testified \n     before Congress. ``It looks like the last 15 minutes of \n     `Saving Private Ryan.' ''\n       (5) What would the Iraqi people do?\n       Again, there are two scenarios (always with the possibility \n     that the truth is somewhere in between).\n       One emphasizes the relative sophistication and education of \n     the Iraqi population, and its hatred for Saddam Hussein. \n     These qualities, according to the optimists, would make the \n     Iraqis unwilling to defend him, grateful for the arrival of \n     American liberators and ready to begin building a new, pro-\n     Western country as soon as the smoke cleared. ``We shall be \n     greeted, I think, in Baghdad and Basra with kites and boom \n     boxes,'' Arab scholar Fouad Ajami of Johns Hopkins University \n     has predicted.\n       The aftermath of the war would not necessarily be chaos, \n     Duelfer has theorized. ``There are national institutions in \n     Iraq that hold the country together: the regular army; \n     there's departments of agriculture, irrigation; there's a \n     civil service.''\n       The pessimistic view emphasizes the deep divisions in Iraq. \n     There are Kurds in the oil-rich north, yearning for an \n     independent state. There are Shiite Muslims concentrated in \n     the South and seething at the discrepancy between their large \n     numbers and small influence in Iraq. For all their education \n     and institutions, Iraqis do not have experience with self-\n     government. Iraq might trade one despot for another.\n       In this scenario, the only thing that would prevent a messy \n     breakup of the former Iraq would be a long American \n     occupation--a prospect the Bush administration has been \n     reluctant to discuss.\n       (6) How will the Middle East react to the war and to the \n     subsequent peace?\n       This may be the most potent of the unanswered questions. \n     Here, there seems to be agreement that rank-and-file Muslims \n     won't like an American war in Iraq. Michael\n\n[[Page S10030]]\n\n     O'Hanlon, a defense analyst at the Brookings Institution, has \n     referred to the ``al-Jazeera effect''--millions of Muslims \n     watching televised scenes of destruction and death, and \n     blaming the United States. Halperin is one of many who have \n     theorized that al Qaeda recruiters would be inundated. \n     ``Certainly if we move before there is a Palestinian \n     settlement . . . what we will stimulate is a large number of \n     people in the Arab world who will be willing to take up a \n     terrorist attack on the United States and on Americans around \n     the world.''\n       Some experts predict that the regional reaction would then \n     go from bad to worse.\n       According to Geoffrey Kemp, director of Regional Strategic \n     Studies at the Nixon Center in Yorba Linda, Calif., \n     ``Iranians . . . worry about a failed or messy U.S. operation \n     that would leave the region in chaos. They would then be on \n     the receiving end for possibly millions of new Iraqi Shi'a \n     refugees.'' Mark Parris, a former U.S. ambassador to Iraq's \n     northern neighbor, Turkey, has raised the specter of a war \n     between the Turks and the Kurds over the oil cities of Mosul \n     and Kirkuk. The fragile reign of Jordan's moderate King \n     Abdullah II would be shaken by an expected anti-American \n     reaction among that nation's many Palestinians. Said Kemp: \n     ``The Saudis will ride it out, the Egyptians will ride it \n     out, the Qataris will--but we're all a little worried about \n     the king.'' Against this, there is a school of thought that \n     says a moderate government in Iraq could lead to \n     modernization and liberalization throughout the region. ``A \n     year after [Hussein falls], Iran will get rid of the \n     mullahs,'' McInerney recently predicted. ``The jubilation \n     that you see in Baghdad . . . will change the whole tenor of \n     the world, and the sum of all your fears will disappear, I \n     assure you.''\n       (7) Would a military campaign in Iraq help or hurt the war \n     on terrorism?\n       Sources as diverse as the conservative Weekly Standard \n     magazine and former president Bill Clinton scoff at the idea \n     that it would be too much to pursue al Qaeda and deal with \n     Iraq simultaneously, both saying: ``The U.S. can walk and \n     chew gum at the same time.'' However, former NATO commander \n     Clark worries about ``a diversion of effort'' on the part of \n     U.S. military and intelligence forces, and Halperin counsels \n     that there is a limit on the number of things government \n     bureaucracies can handle at once.\n       But the deeper problem, many believe, is that U.S. action \n     in Iraq could spoil the spirit of cooperation with many \n     nations--including many Arab nations--that is essential to \n     fighting terror.\n       To ``drive a stake in the heart of al Qaeda,'' Hoar \n     recently said, it is essential to have ``broad support from \n     our European allies and from our friends in the Arab world.'' \n     Like many experts, he believes that a war in Iraq could dry \n     up that support like fire under a damp skillet.\n       On the other hand, retired Gen. John Shalikashvili, a \n     former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff--while insisting \n     on the importance of building more international support for \n     U.S. policy on Iraq--has argued that dealing with Iraq \n     cannot, ultimately, be separated from the war on terror. ``It \n     really falls under the same umbrella,'' he told a Senate \n     committee. ``The war against terrorism isn't just al Qaeda. . \n     . . It is also denying terrorists the means of getting to \n     weapons of mass destruction.''\n       (8) In the end, will the United States be more secure?\n       One's answer to this question is a sort of scorecard for \n     one's answers to the previous seven. If Hussein is indeed \n     impossible to deter and willing to engage in terror, if a new \n     regime is the only way to eliminate the threat he poses, and \n     if that can be done with a minimum of chaos and relatively \n     few bad consequences--then the case for war might seem \n     strong. Different answers to these questions can change the \n     equation dramatically.\n       In the coming debate, Americans will watch scores of \n     elected leaders wrestle with some or all of these disputes, \n     but if the resolution passes, as expected, they will \n     ultimately come to a final calculus on a single desk. As Sen. \n     John D. ``Jay'' Rockefeller IV (D-W. Va.) said last week: \n     ``You don't have all the answers and you never will have all \n     the answers. . . . It rests in the hands of the president of \n     the United States.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, while the Senator from Virginia is still \non the floor, I wonder if he would be willing to have a brief \ndiscussion on the resolution and the action before the United Nations?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, I would be privileged to do so.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Earlier today I had discussed the considerations on \nconditioning authority for the President to use force on a United \nNations resolution which called for the use of force, very much like \nthe 1991 incident, contrasted with authorization by the Congress for \nthe President to use force unilaterally, without a United Nations \nresolution, or perhaps with the assistance of Great Britain. The \ndisadvantage, to which I had referred earlier today, on having a \nresolution which required U.N. action is that, in effect, we would be \nsubordinate or subject to a veto by China, which is undesirable; \nFrance--undesirable; Russia--undesirable.\n  But the difficulty with authorizing the President to use force \nunilaterally is it might set a precedent for other countries to say \nthey could do the same. While these analogies are not perfect, one \nwhich comes to mind is China on Taiwan, or India on Pakistan, or the \nreverse--Pakistan on India.\n  My question to one of the managers of the bill, one of the coauthors \nof the bill, is: Do you see any problem at all on a precedent being \nestablished if Congress authorizes the President to use force without a \nU.N. resolution to use force, on justifying some action by some other \ncountry like China and Taiwan, or Pakistan and India, or some other \nsituation in the future?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my distinguished colleague, \nspeaking for myself--and I hope the majority of the Senate--in no way \nshould this Nation ever subordinate itself in its decision making with \nrespect to our national security, to actions or inactions by the United \nNations.\n  Let me just give a wonderful quote that I, in my research on this \nsubject, have referred to before. This was October 22, 1962, when our \nNation, under the leadership of President Kennedy, was faced with the \nlooming missile crisis down in Cuba. I know my colleague knows that \nperiod of history very well.\n  Kennedy said the following:\n\n       This Nation is prepared to present its case against the \n     Soviet threat to peace and our own proposals for a peaceful \n     world at any time and in any forum in the Organization of \n     American States, in the United Nations, or in any other \n     meeting that could be useful, without limiting our freedom of \n     action.\n\n  That, to me, answers the question.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the citation by the Senator from Virginia \nis a very impressive one, beyond any question, that some might think \nthere was some difference in circumstances between the imminence of a \npossible attack in 1962, with the so-called Cuban missile crisis, \ncompared to the present time with respect to Iraq. I would be \ninterested to know what the Senator from Virginia was doing at that \ntime. I can tell the Senator from Virginia that was the one occasion \nwhere my wife and I went out to the supermarkets and stocked up on \nfood, as did most Americans, and put them in the basement of our house.\n  The television was replete with maps showing the missile range from \nCuba to Philadelphia--the ones I particularly noted. They passed by \nVirginia en route to Philadelphia.\n  I quite agree with the Senator from Virginia, we ought never \nsubordinate our sovereignty when we face that kind of a threat.\n  But I think the threat is significantly different with respect to \nIraq--although I concede the threat. But the point is missed, at least \nsomewhat, and that is whether U.S. unilateral action could set a \nprecedent for some other country taking unilateral action, such as the \nones to which I referred.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, any action by a strong, sovereign Nation \nsuch as ours, which I say with humility is a leader in the world in so \nmany issues of foreign policy, can be used as a precedent. But I say to \nmy friend, what is the precedent of inaction? I have given some \ncomments about the League of Nations here earlier today. Throughout the \nhistory of the League, it is documented inaction, from Mussolini's \nattack on Abyssinia in the 1930s, to other operations militarily, naked \naggression--inaction.\n  So what is the precedent of inaction, if our President and our Nation \ndoes nothing collectively with Great Britain, in the face of this \ncrisis? So, of course, it would be a precedent.\n  But the times have changed. I also put a list in the Record the other \nday of some 13 instances where Presidents of our United States, going \nback as far as 1901, have instituted--you might characterize it, as I \ndo, as preemptive; I certainly so characterize it--preemptive strikes \nin the use of the military, the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines. \nLook here; it is documented: Panama, 1901; Dominican Republic, 1904, \n1914 and 1965; Honduras, 1912; Nicaragua, 1926; Lebanon, 1958; Cuba, \nthe naval quarantine in 1962; Grenada, 1983; Libya, 1986; Panama--just \ncause--1989; Somalia, 1992; Sudan and Afghanistan, August 1998; Iraq, \nDesert Fox--you recall that one. The eve of Christmas.\n  I remember my good friend and your good friend, Bill Cohen, was \nSecretary\n\n[[Page S10031]]\n\nof Defense. I went over and visited with him in his office as ranking \nmember of the Armed Services Committee, where we discussed the coming \nDesert Fox operation, a form of consultation between the executive and \nlegislative branch. That was December of 1998.\n  Kosovo, there was preemption. I will hand this to the Senator. That \nwas March of 1999.\n  International law recognizes the concept of anticipatory self-\ndefense. That is a phrase known in international law--if a country is \nimminently threatened.\n  I think the record at this point is replete with facts, where we \ncould be in imminent threat of the use of weapons of mass destruction \nby Saddam Hussein, and more likely his surrogates--any one of which in \nthis international coalition of terrorists.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, without going through the entire litany, \nI agree that those are all illustrations of anticipatory self-defense. \nThe Afghanistan missile attack on August 20 of 1998 was in response to \nal-Qaida because of the destruction of our embassies in Africa at about \nthat time. I don't think you could call the Grenada incident a matter \nof anticipatory self-defense. I don't think you can call it self-\ndefense at all. I think what the Senator from Virginia referred to is \nnot a case of anticipatory self-defense--action by the United States, \nbut not anticipatory self-defense. The quarantine of Cuba, as I said \nbefore, certainly does qualify, but under very different circumstances.\n  But I thank my colleague from Virginia. During the course of the \ncoming days, I think we are going to have very extended discussions on \nthese issues as we debate this resolution.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my good friend we have been \nfortunate to serve in this institution for many years together, and I \nhope, with luck perhaps, a few more. But the Senator has always been \nvery careful, very thoughtful, and well prepared. While I haven't \nalways agreed with the Senator, it is not for lack of a strong case \nthat he has worked up on his side. I hope in due course he can see the \nwisdom of joining in this resolution which I and three others--Senators \nMcCain, Lieberman, and Bayh--have put together. We really believe--and \nit is the one which is before the House of Representatives right now--\nthat this is the wisest course of action for this Congress to take to \nsupport the President, and do it in a way that leaves no doubt in \nanyone's mind--Saddam Hussein or any other nations in the United \nNations--who are thinking that a different course should be taken.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Virginia for \nthose comments. We form a long-time mutual admiration society. The \nSenator from Virginia was elected in 1978, and I was elected 2 years \nlater. So he has been here finishing up his 24th year, and I, 22. We \nhave worked together on many matters.\n  I am raising questions only because I think it is in the tradition of \nwhat they call the world's greatest deliberative body. I am not sure \nthat is accurate. But when we face an issue of this sort, we ought to \nbe considering it very carefully. That is what I intended to do with \nthis very brief colloquy today along that line.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his kind remarks. \nWe have had a very healthy debate here for 4\\1/2\\ hours on Friday \nafternoon--Senator Byrd, Senator Kennedy, Senator Dodd, and myself. We \nresumed today with, I think, seven colloquies on both sides of the \naisle addressing this issue. I think we are going to perhaps even \nexceed the thoroughness, the thoughtfulness, and the strength in the \ndebate we had in 1991 on a similar resolution that I dealt with at that \ntime, along with my distinguished friend and colleague, Senator \nLieberman.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. Specter. Mr. President, it is true that in 1991 we had a debate \nwhich was characterized as historic. I recall the occasions when I was \nin the Chamber with the Senator from Virginia seated over there on the \nright-hand side. Senator Nunn was in the Chamber. We were debating that \nextensively in the Chamber today. I think it will be reassuring to the \nAmerican people to see this kind of analysis and this kind of \ndiscussion--that we are not rushing to judgement.\n  Mr. WARNER. They deserve no less. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, I now will comment on the pending \nnomination of a very distinguished lawyer to the Court of Appeals for \nthe District of Columbia Circuit, Miguel A. Estrada, who has been \nnominated by President Bush for the Court of Appeals for the District \nof Columbia Circuit.\n  Mr. Estrada has an extraordinary background. He received his law \ndegree from Harvard, magna cum laude, in 1986. He received his \nbachelor's degree, magna cum laude, from Columbia College.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nhis employment record, which shows the very outstanding work he has \ndone.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Miguel Estrada, Nominee to the Court of Appeals for the District of \n                     columbia--Biography/Experience\n\n       Miguel A. Estrada is currently a partner in the Washington, \n     D.C. office of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, where he is a \n     member of the firm's Appellate and Constitutional Law \n     Practice Group and the Business Crimes and Investigations \n     Practice Group.\n       Mr. Estrada has broad appellate experience--he is widely \n     regarded as one of the country's best appellate lawyers, and \n     has argued 15 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n       The American Bar Association--the Democrats' ``gold \n     standard'' for judicial nominees--unanimously rated Estrada \n     ``well qualified.''\n       If confirmed, Estrada would be the first Hispanic-American \n     ever to sit on the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.\n       From 1992 until 1997, he served as Assistant to the \n     Solicitor General of the United States. From 1990 to 1992, he \n     served as Assistant U.S. Attorney and Deputy Chief of the \n     Appellate Section, U.S. Attorney's Office, Southern District \n     of New York.\n       Mr. Estrada served as a law clerk to the Honorable Anthony \n     M. Kennedy of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1988-1989, and to \n     the Honorable Amalya L. Kearse of the U.S. Court of Appeals \n     for the Second Circuit from 1986-1987.\n       He received a J.D. degree magna cum laude in 1986 from \n     Harvard Law School, where he was editor of the Harvard Law \n     Review. Mr. Estrada graduated with a bachelor's degree magna \n     cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa in 1983 from Columbia College, \n     New York. He is fluent in Spanish.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, during the course of the hearings on Mr. \nEstrada, the issue was raised about obtaining memoranda which Mr. \nEstrada had worked on in the Solicitor General's office from 1992 to \n1997, internal memoranda which would be very troublesome for disclosure \nbecause of the need for candid expressions by lawyers who work in the \nSolicitor General's office.\n  A letter, dated, June 24, 2002, was submitted by a former Solicitor \nGeneral, Seth P. Waxman, on behalf of all seven living ex-Solicitors \nGeneral, objecting to the request by the Judiciary Committee for these \ninternal memoranda, signed by Mr. Waxman, on behalf of Walter \nDellinger; Drew S. Days, III; Kenneth W. Starr; Charles Fried; Robert \nH. Bork; and Archibald Cox. It is apparent, on the face of those \nsignatories, that you have people from a broad spectrum, from very \nliberal to very conservative.\n  But of more importance than the range of Solicitors General on the \npolitical spectrum are the reasons set forth in the letter. And the \nessence is contained in a couple of paragraphs:\n\n       As former heads of the Office of the Solicitor General--\n     under Presidents of both parties--we can attest to the vital \n     importance of candor and confidentiality in the Solicitor \n     General's decision-making process.\n\n  Then, in a later paragraph, it continues:\n\n       It goes without saying that, when we made these and other \n     critical decisions, we relied on frank, honest, and thorough \n     advice from our staff attorneys, like Mr. Estrada. Our \n     decision-making process required the unbridled, open exchange \n     of ideas--an exchange that simply cannot take place if \n     attorneys have reason to fear that their private \n     recommendations are not private at all, but vulnerable to \n     public disclosure. Attorneys inevitably will hesitate before \n     giving their honest, independent analysis if their opinions \n     are not safeguarded from future disclosure. High-level \n     decision-making requires\n\n[[Page S10032]]\n\n     candor, and candor in turn requires confidentiality.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this \nletter be printed at the conclusion of my statement. That will \nabbreviate the time of the statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. Estrada was questioned about an article which \nappeared in The Nation, which referred to anonymous sources on the \nsubject that Mr. Estrada was questioning prospective clerks for Justice \nKennedy and was applying a litmus test. This is what is set forth in \nthe article in The Nation in the October 7, 2002, issue:\n\n       Perhaps the most damaging evidence against Estrada comes \n     from two lawyers he interviewed for Supreme Court clerkships. \n     Both were unwilling to be identified by name for fear of \n     reprisals. The first told me: ``Since I knew Miguel, I went \n     to him to help me get a Supreme Court clerkship. I knew he \n     was screening candidates for Justice Kennedy. Miguel told me, \n     `No way. You're way too liberal.' I felt he was definitely \n     submitting me to an ideological litmus test, and I am a \n     moderate Democrat. . . .''\n\n  A second unnamed person in the article said:\n\n       ``I was a clerk for an appeals court judge,'' the professor \n     told me, ``and my judge called Justice Kennedy recommending \n     me for a clerkship with him. Justice Kennedy then called me \n     and said I had made the first cut and would soon be called \n     for an interview. I was then interviewed by Miguel Estrada \n     and another lawyer. Estrada asked most of the questions. \n     He asked me a lot of unfair, ideological questions, a lot \n     about the death penalty, which I told him I thought was \n     immoral. I felt I was being subjected to an ideological \n     litmus test. . . .''\n\n  And it goes on, but that is the pertinent part.\n  During the course of the Judiciary Committee hearings, Mr. Estrada \nwas questioned about these two unidentified sources. He said he had not \nasked such questions, and then later responded to further questions \nsaying that he couldn't remember if it had ever happened, that it might \nhave been possible but he had no recollection.\n  His answer was:\n\n       Now, that you have drawn that to my attention, it is \n     possible that interviewing a candidate--I can't think of any \n     now, but it is possible that I may have come to the \n     conclusion that the person's ideology was so strongly engaged \n     in what he thought as a lawyer that he would not be able to \n     follow the instructions in the chambers as set forth by \n     Justice Kennedy.\n\n  Then, when the questions are pursued, Mr. Estrada says candidly he \ncan't remember ever having said that but would not rule out the \npossibility.\n  It seems to me that when someone is being questioned, and being \nquestioned from sources which refuse to reveal their identify, that it \nis impossible for a witness, a nominee for a judgeship, to give a \nresponsive answer.\n  One of the very basic principles of American jurisprudence is that an \nindividual is entitled to confront his accuser. That is a basic \nconstitutional requirement, of course, in a different context in the \nfifth amendment of right to confrontation. But as a matter of basic \nfairness anywhere, if a person is to have an opportunity to focus on a \nquestion, to focus on the event, he or she should be told who it was \nwho made the statement, so there can be an appropriate focus of \nattention.\n  And a prospective nominee ought not to be ruled out, ought not to be \ncriticized, or ought not have it held against him if people are \nchallenging him who will not be disclosed.\n  And the article in The Nation magazine says specifically it came from \ntwo lawyers, both unwilling to be identified by name for fear of \nreprisals. It is a little hard to see what the reprisals would be.\n  If somebody has something to say about a judicial nominee, let him \ncome forward. If they are not going to be identified, how can you \nexpect a responsive answer to be given by an individual, which is \napparent on its face, as Mr. Estrada tries to respond to these \nquestions without knowing precisely what they are?\n  Other issues were raised as to Mr. Estrada because of clients he \nrepresented and causes he undertook. I regrettably could not be present \nfor all of the Estrada hearings because we were debating homeland \nsecurity on the day his hearing was up, and I was there for part of it \nbut not there for all of it.\n  It was reported to me that Mr. Estrada was questioned about comments \nwhich he had made in representing a client, trying to have the case of \nMiranda v. Arizona overruled, a 1966 decision where the Supreme Court \nlaid down certain requirements for warnings and waivers.\n  The Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1968, passed by the Congress, sought \nto change the Miranda rule by providing that the confession be judged \non the totality of the circumstances. An act of Congress is \npresumptively constitutional, and it was a matter for argument. The \nSupreme Court considered the issue and decided that Miranda would not \nbe overruled, considered it, many years later.\n  Shortly after the Omnibus Crime Control Act was passed in 1968, I was \nasked by the National District Attorneys Association to argue a case \ncaptioned Frasier v. Cupp where there was a confession at issue under \nEscobedo. I appeared in the Supreme Court and argued that the \nconfession which was given, the statements which were given should be \njudged under the 1968 Omnibus Crime Control Act which said \nvoluntariness should be decided on the basis of the totality of \ncircumstances.\n  In a State prosecution, the due process clause picks up the right to \ncounsel of the sixth amendment and the privilege against self-\nincrimination of the fifth amendment. The argument which I made was \nthere ought not to be a higher standard imposed on the States under the \ndue process clause than on the Federal Government.\n  Under the 1968 statute gauging the admissibility on the totality of \nthe circumstance, the act was presumptively constitutional. The Supreme \nCourt did not reach the issue in deciding the case of Cupp v. Oregon \nwhere the confession was upheld. But I had appeared before a \ncongressional committee, the McClellen committee, in 1966 and said I \nagreed with Miranda and that I thought as a matter of public policy \nMiranda was the correct decision. I said that not withstanding the fact \nthat I was a district attorney at that time and had to deal with the \nlimiting effects. It seemed to me it placed the suspect on an equal par \nwith the interrogators for them to be required to say you have a right \nto counsel, you have a right to remain silent.\n  But notwithstanding my own personal view that Miranda was the correct \ndecision, I felt entirely free to argue to the Supreme Court the \nposition that the 1968 act ought to govern, and the totality of the \ncircumstances ought to prevail.\n  This is just one of what I understood to be a number of concerns \nexpressed by some members of the Judiciary Committee. I think there \nought to be a sharp distinction between what an individual believes as \na matter of judicial philosophy or ideology and what an individual does \nby way of presenting a case for argument.\n  Under our adversarial system, all sides are to be presented, both \nsides are to be presented, and the court is to make the decision. An \nattorney has the liberty of making arguments which he thinks are good-\nfaith arguments for resolution by the court.\n  It is my hope that the Judiciary Committee will report out Mr. \nEstrada. Frankly, it looks as if they are not going to do so. The \nreason, really, the excuse will be given that the Solicitor General's \nopinions will not be forthcoming. But they realistically cannot be \nforthcoming for reasons set forth by the Solicitor General's letter \nthat if they are to be able to have honest and frank discussions, they \nhave to have the honest opinions of their lawyers.\n\n  And if you are going to make public disclosure in the context of a \njudicial confirmation proceeding, the lawyers are always going to be \nworried about that and are not going to give their frank opinions.\n  Ultimately, I hope we are able to adopt a protocol. Perhaps the year \n2004 would be a good time. We have a Republican President now and a \nSenate controlled by Democrats and nominations were being held up. I am \ncandid to say and have said, when we had a President who was a Democrat \nand the Judiciary Committee was controlled by Republicans, that \nnominations were held up.\n  I crossed party lines and voted for President Clinton's nominees when \nI thought they were qualified. In the spirit of reciprocity, I have \nbeen able to get Pennsylvania judges confirmed. But perhaps in the year \n2004, when no\n\n[[Page S10033]]\n\none knows exactly what 2005 will bring, we can end this politicization \nof the Judiciary Committee process and adopt a protocol which I have \nsubmitted but which would say that after so many days after a \nnomination, the committee would consider it with a hearing; so many \ndays after the hearing, the committee would vote; and so many days \nlater, it would come to the floor. We could get rid once and for all of \nthis politicization of the nomination process.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my resolution of protocol be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                   Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 2002.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: We write to express our concern about \n     your recent request that the Department of Justice turn over \n     ``appeal recommendations, certiorari recommendations, and \n     amicus recommendations'' that Miguel Estrada worked on while \n     in the Office of the Solicitor General.\n       As former heads of the Office of the Solicitor General--\n     under Presidents of both parties--we can attest to the vital \n     importance of candor and confidentiality in the Solicitor \n     General's decisionmaking process. The Solicitor General is \n     charged with the weighty responsibility of deciding whether \n     to appeal adverse decisions in cases where the United States \n     is a party, whether to seek Supreme Court review and adverse \n     appellate decisions, and whether to participate as amicus \n     curiae in other high-profile cases that implicate an \n     important federal interest. The Solicitor General has the \n     responsibility of representing the interests not just of the \n     Justice Department, nor just of the Executive Branch, but of \n     the entire federal government, including Congress.\n       It goes without saying that, when we made these other \n     critical decisions, we relied on frank, honest, and thorough \n     advice from our staff attorneys, like Mr. Estrada. Our \n     decisionmaking process required the unbridled, open exchange \n     of ideas--an exchange that simply cannot take place if \n     attorneys have reasons to fear that their private \n     recommendations are not private at all, but vulnerable to \n     public disclosure. Attorneys inevitably will hesitate before \n     giving their honest, independent analysis if their opinions \n     are not safeguarded from future disclosure. High-level \n     decisionmaking requires candor, and candor in turn requires \n     confidentiality.\n       Any attempt to intrude into the Office's highly privileged \n     deliberations would come at the cost of the Solicitor \n     General's ability to defend vigorously the United States' \n     litigation interests--a cost that also would be borne by \n     Congress itself.\n       Although we profoundly respect the Senate's duty to \n     evaluate Mr. Estrada's fitness for the federal judiciary, we \n     do not think that the confidentiality and integrity of \n     internal deliberations should be sacrificed in the process.\n           Sincerely,\n     Seth P. Waxman.\n     Walter Dellinger.\n     Drew S. Days, III.\n     Kenneth W. Starr.\n     Charles Fried.\n     Robert H.

Madam President, it isn't often that a Senator from New \nMexico and a Republican quotes an editorial by the Washington Post \nregarding economics and economic activity and America's economic \nfuture. This morning I caught an editorial in that newspaper which I \nhave here behind me. It is from Saturday, October 5. It is styled \n``Negative Al Gore.''\n  I didn't put it up here to be negative to Al Gore. I put it up here \nbecause the editors of this newspaper have come to the conclusion, and \nhave come to it rather firmly, that the President of the United States, \nGeorge Bush, is not responsible for the current state of the American \neconomy, nor did he do anything to cause the recession--how mild it \nwas, how deep it was, how long it has lasted. He didn't cause it.\n  I would like to start first with a statement which I will print in \nthe\n\n[[Page S10034]]\n\nRecord which has gotten a lot of notoriety since I issued it and put it \nin the Record some days ago. It is a statement by Joseph Stiglitz, \nchairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisors. I don't \nthink we can quote it enough, as those on the other side think they are \ngoing to convince the American people, who are already rather doubtful, \nthat they are going to convince them that President George Bush is \nresponsible for this slow economy.\n  This is a man, Dr. Joseph Stiglitz, who speaks for the Democrats, if \nhe speaks for either party. He worked for President Clinton. He \nanswered the question: When did the downturn start? I quote:\n\n       [T]he economy was slipping into recession even before Bush \n     took office, and the corporate scandals that are rocking \n     America began much earlier [than that.]\n\n  We ought to be able to carry one of these around for the next 4 or 5 \nweeks, just as our friend Senator Byrd carries the Constitution. Every \ntime we hear a Democrat, wearing his partisan clothes, get up and say \nPresident Bush did this, we will refer him to one of the best \neconomists that ever served America, served the previous President on \nhis Council of Economic Advisors, and later on was a member of the \nFederal Reserve with the distinguished President we have there now, and \nhe wrote this as a part of a dissertation with reference to the \nAmerican economy.\n  Along comes the Washington Post a few weeks later, Saturday, October \n5. Let me just read the yellow print and you can all be looking at the \nrest of it:\n\n       But President Bush's main economic policy--the large tax \n     cut of last year--was not responsible for any of the current \n     damage. Indeed, given the twin shocks of 9/11 and the post-\n     Enron stock market decline, the short-term stimulus created \n     by the tax cuts has turned out to be fortuitously well timed.\n\n  You might recall, on a number of occasions, Senators who were putting \nforth the President's tax policy--I think the occupant of the Chair \nmight have even supported that tax policy--would get up and say: It \njust might be the right time. We might be doing something right for a \nchange, where we are getting a tax cut to come in just at the time that \nthe American economy starts to stutter, starts to stammer around. And \nfor once we might be on time, I said, in proposing it and getting the \nreconciliation instruction through here.\n  I said, in addition, spending additional resources rather than \ntightening the budget would be in order also. Sure enough, the tax cuts \nwere supplemented by an increase in expenditures. And, guess what. The \nFederal Reserve Chairman lowered the interest rates, and we had the \nthreefold attack which normally works in terms of the American economy.\n  We seldom do it right and punctual enough, but we did. So the \nAmerican economy is stuttering for some other reason. It may very well \nbe that we had such an extensive balloon-type economy when the stock \nmarket was driving almost everything to outlandish prices coming on to \nthe market that maybe when those start to fall, it takes a little bit \nlonger for things to catch on and push that back up the ladder because \nso much is falling down on us. Some say $11 trillion is the amount--\ntrillion--of diminution in value. I put ``value'' in quotes as I say it \nbecause I am not sure what that value meant. I am not sure that was \nvalue like you had dollar bills, but I am not sure what it was. People \nare having difficulty saying how much of that was nothing more than the \nhot air of the stock market. I don't know the answer to that. I haven't \nstudied that.\n  I would like very much to say to the editors of the Washington Post, \nI have some additional comments on the editorial that they have \nwritten. Obviously, I have taken parts of it and put it in my \nstatement, obviously giving the Washington Post credit wherever I \nthought it was right, that that language was consistent with what I am \ntalking about.\n  The lead editorial on Saturday, titled ``Negative Al Gore,'' \nseriously questions the Senate leader's attack on President Bush. Let \nme highlight once more a couple of items:\n\n       But President Bush's main economic policy--the large tax \n     cut of last year--was not responsible for any of the current \n     damage.\n\n  That is not the Senate Republican Policy Committee saying that. That \nis the Washington Post.\n  Another quote:\n\n       Given the twin shocks--\n\n  I have read that to you. It ends with:\n\n     . . . fortuitously well timed.\n\n  That is again not mine, not the Republican Senatorial Committee. That \nis the Washington Post's summary of how their editors see things in \nterms of the stock market and other things related to the American \neconomy.\n  Another quote:\n\n       But to blame the weak American economy on Mr. Bush is \n     nonsense.\n\n  That is the editorial of the Washington Post I am showing you here. \nAnyone who doesn't want to listen can read this and see what the \nWashington Post says. Let me proceed. I think the writers of the \neditorial have it just about right. The economic blame and the blame \ngame that Leader Daschle and former Vice President Gore have launched \nis, for certain, wrong. There is little truth to it, and there is \nlittle economic veracity attendant. It is not accepted as being \nrealistic by those in the highest echelons of economic terms and \nassessments in America.\n  From the long-term economic history, we know a speculative boom, once \nstarted, cannot end without some disruption. I believe the American \npublic understands this, and understands that to blame the current weak \neconomy on President George Bush is nonsense.\n  Having said that, I know we are engaged today, and for the next few \ndays, in a serious discussion. Some would like to put the economy back \nfront and center, and some think that would not be right. I believe we \nshould proceed with dispatch to give the President the authority, if \nnecessary, to see to it Saddam Hussein does not use weapons of mass \ndestruction, and to use force, if he has to do that. I will speak in \nmore detail and in more depth on that subject later on.\n  I think we are capable of discussing two major issues at the same \ntime and getting them both right. We surely can discuss this issue the \nwriters in the Washington Post editorial bring to our attention. I, for \none, am not fearful of standing up and discussing that issue with \nanybody, any color of politics, any party that wants to talk about \nPresident Bush and the relevancy of his actions to the current status \nof the American economy.\n  I believe almost everything that was done--the lowering of the \ninterest rates, extra expenditures that were put on rather than keeping \nthe strings tightened around the budget and, obviously, a tax cut that \ncame in just as the recession started to occur--I think we can discuss \nthose and we can ask anyone around, what would you have done? They \nwould come up with three of them, or two out of the three. When a \nPresident gets that done and he is starting his first term, and he has \none body that is not of his party, it seems he deserves some very \nsignificant accolades. It is not every President who would have gotten \nthat done.\n  I believe we all looked for the right way to do it and the right \nthings to do--what we did in urging a tax cut, urging the Fed to lower \ninterest rates, and making the strings a little bit looser instead of \ntighter so we can spend more money. Some other reason is causing the \nslowdown, but it is not President Bush and his policies. It is not what \nthe Senate voted in when we were in the majority and carrying it out \nunder the majority of the Democrats, who have the body by one vote. We \nmust remember one of our Members became an Independent and now votes \nwith the other side.\n  Whoever would like to discuss the American economy, I am willing. I \nhave a lot of other Senators who are willing. We will be here whenever \nyou care to speak about it, and we might be here even when you don't \ncare about speaking about it. We may speak to it ourselves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/07/senate-section/article/S10034-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10034-S10035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  21ST CENTURY DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE APPROPRIATIONS AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to Section \n2202 of the 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations \nAuthorization Act which directs the President--in consultation with the \nAttorney General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the \nSecretary of Education--to review all Federal drug and\n\n[[Page S10035]]\n\nsubstance abuse treatment, prevention, education and research programs \nand make recommendations about how to ``streamline, consolidate, \ncoordinate, simplify, and more effectively conduct and deliver'' these \nservices.\n  Mr. HATCH. I understand that this provision is intended to allow the \nadministration to assess current treatment, prevention, education and \nresearch programs. The conference report directs the President to \nconduct the study. The President's logical choice to conduct this study \nwould be Drug Czar John Walters, the President's point person on the \ndrug issue, wouldn't you agree?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes, I would.\n  Mr. President, I want to make it clear that Section 2202 of the 21st \nCentury Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act was not \nincluded because the Senate wants to cut substance abuse treatment, \nprevention, education and research programs. After all, when the Senate \nunanimously passed S. 304, the Drug Abuse Education, Prevention and \nTreatment Act, which Senators Hatch, Leahy and I introduced, it went on \nrecord supporting an increase in funding for demand reduction programs, \nincluding providing treatment for some of the 3.9 million people in \nthis country who need it but are not receiving it. I know that the \nPresident does not want to shrink these programs either. Recall that \nwhen he announced Mr. Walters' nomination to be drug czar, he said that \n``the most effective way to reduce the supply of drugs in America is to \nreduce the demand for drugs in America'' and he pledged that his \nadministration ``will focus unprecedented attention on the demand side \nof the problem.'' As I see it, the study is meant to assess current \nprograms in order to identify where there may be duplication of effort \nand where we need to increase effort.\n  The belief that demand reduction programs are a valuable part of our \nnational drug policy needs to guide this report. That does not mean \nthat the authors should be afraid of recommending ways to deliver \nservices more efficiently or to suggest that there is duplication of \neffort that needs to be streamlined. What it means is that the report \nshould not be interpreted as a directive from Congress to decrease the \nlevel of effort dedicated to demand reduction.\n  Increasing access to treatment is critical. Drug addiction is a \nchronic relapsing disease. And as with other chronic relapsing \ndiseases, such as diabetes, hypertension and asthma, there is no cure, \nalthough a number of treatments can effectively control the disease. \nAccording to the Journal of the American Medical Association, the rate \nof adherence to treatment programs and relapse rates are similar for \ndrug addiction and other chronic diseases. That means that treatment \nfor addiction works just as well as treatment for other chronic \nrelapsing diseases. I hope these facts will be reflected in the drug \nczar's report, particularly in terms of relapse. We should not be \nskimping on the amount of time a patient spends in treatment because \nsomeone thinks that would be more efficient. In truth, it would be less \nefficient. Studies have shown that the longer a patient spends in \ntreatment the more likely that patient is to stay off drugs. But even \nwith the best treatment protocol, patients relapse. That does not mean \nthat treatment does not work, however.\n  Research is another area where returns on investment are not always \nlinear or predictable. But I believe that we need to be doing more \nresearch on new forms of treatment, particularly when it comes to \ndeveloping new anti-addiction medications. In the last Congress, I \nworked with Senators Levin and Hatch and former Senator Moynihan to \npass a law to allow qualified doctors to prescribe certain anti-\naddiction medications from their offices rather than requiring patients \nto pick them up at special clinics. The bill helps to move drug \ntreatment using anti-addiction medications into the medical mainstream. \nAnd buprenorphine, the first medication that could be prescribed under \nthe system created by the bill, is expected to be approved any day now. \nWe need to develop additional medications for this new system to treat \ncocaine and methamphetamine addiction as well as to curb the cravings \nassociated with addiction.\n  The last item that I would suggest that the drug czar keep in mind \nwhen drafting his report is the importance of prevention, particularly \nschool-based prevention programs. After several years of a stable level \nof drug use in the United States, this year drug use is up 11 percent \namong 12 to 17-year-olds and 18 percent among 18 to 25-year-olds. It is \nvital that we increase our current efforts at preventing drug use among \nteens and young adults. After all, we know that if we can get a child \nthrough age 21 without abusing drugs, they are unlikely ever to do so.\n  My goal is not to dictate what the drug czar writes in his report. \nRather, I want to make clear that when Congress directs that the drug \nczar write a report on how to ``streamline, consolidate, coordinate, \nsimplify, and more effectively conduct and deliver'' Federal drug and \nsubstance abuse treatment, prevention, education and research programs, \nit does not mean that we are trying to minimize the importance of these \nprograms. We are merely looking for guidance on how they could be \ndelivered more effectively and more efficiently.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/07/senate-section/article/S10035-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10035-S10036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SENATOR JESSE HELMS\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to North \nCarolina Senator Jesse Helms, a dedicated public servant who has served \nwith distinction for five terms in the United States Senate. During \nthis time, Senator Helms has had a tremendous influence on the issues \nwhich have faced our country and his reasoned and determined beliefs on \nforeign policy have helped to shape the direction of America's \nrelationships around the globe. In doing so, Senator Helms has always \nput the interests of the United States above all else, and his efforts \nwere often rewarded with hard-fought concessions. Indeed, when others \nwould hope to expedite and rush through legislation, it was often \nSenator Helms who called for deliberation and patience. Senator Helms \ntruly understands the Senate's function as a deliberative body and \ntakes to heart the great responsibility the Constitution has given the \nSenate in its role as a check to the powers of the Executive branch. I \nhave had the pleasure to work with Senator Helms for the past 16 years \nand it is with great appreciation and respect that I commend him for \nall of his meaningful work as he retires at the end of the 107th \nCongress.\n  Senator Helms was born in Monroe, NC in 1921. A product of the public \nschools of Monroe county, he took to heart the lessons he learned early \nin life. A firm believer in family, respect for one's elders, morality, \npatriotism and religious faith, Senator Helms has let these convictions \nbe his guide throughout his life. After serving his country in the Navy \nduring World War II, Senator Helms came back to his home State as a \ncity editor of the Raleigh Times. It was not long before he received \nhis first exposure to Senatorial duties working as an Administrative \nAssistant to U.S. Senator Willis Smith and later for Senator Alton \nLennon. Politics seemed to agree with Senator Helms, for in 1952, he \ndirected the radio-television division of the presidential campaign of \nDemocratic Senator Richard B. Russell of Georgia. For the next 7 years, \nSenator Helms served as the Executive Director of the North Carolina \nBankers Association and editor of the Tarheel Banker, which grew under \nhis guidance into the largest banking publication in the United States. \nFollowing this remarkable success, Senator Helms in 1960 became the \nVice-President, Vice-Chairman of the Board and assistant Chief \nExecutive Officer of Capitol Broadcasting Company. It was from this \npost that Senator Helms became a familiar voice in politics, filing \ndaily editorials for WRAL-TV and the Tobacco Radio Network. Over the \nnext 12 years, Senator Helms became known as an articulate conservative \nacross the nation, where his editorials were printed regularly in more \nthan 200 newspapers throughout the United States and broadcast by more \nthan 70 stations in North Carolina. Senator Helms capitalized on his \nfamiliarity and popularity with the voters of North Carolina in 1972, \nwhen he was elected to the U.S. Senate on his first attempt at state-\nwide elective office. His election marked the beginning of a long and \ndistinguished career in the Senate, where\n\n[[Page S10036]]\n\nSenator Helms has been an active and consistent presence dedicated to \npreserving American freedom and liberty.\n  Senator Helms has had a tremendous influence on policy matters over \nthe last 30 years. He has been an outspoken critic of ceding American \npower to international organizations and an ever-vigilant watch dog of \nany treaty or agreement which may not be in the best interests of the \nUnited States. He has been a reliable conservative voice on many social \nissues and a consistent critic of government bureaucracy. Of his many \nachievements, Senator Helms has been the most active through his \nposition on the Foreign Relations Committee, which he took over as \nChairman in 1994. He sponsored the Helms-Burton Act, which codified the \nU.S. trade embargo against Cuba and allowed lawsuits against foreign \ncompanies who benefitted from American property expropriated by \nCastro's Communist dictatorship. Senator Helms also achieved another \nremarkable feat, when in 1998, he worked across the aisle to achieve \npassage of historic legislation reorganizing the State Department. \nSenator Helms has also maintained flexibility in his thinking, working \nclosely with other members of the Foreign Relations Committee to \nexamine and solidify the relationship of the United States and the \nUnited Nations, examine trade relations with China and examine the \npolicies surrounding U.S. foreign aid.\n  Senator Helms has had a significant impact in his 30 years here in \nWashington. His absence from important policy decisions will truly be \nmissed. Anyone who has dealt with Senator Helms knows that he is a man \nwhose conviction to his beliefs will not be easily swayed. They will \nalso tell you that there are few people who are more congenial and \ncharming than Senator Helms. I wish he and his wife, Dorothy, and the \nrest of his family all the best. It is with great appreciation and \nadmiration that I offer these words to commemorate his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/07/senate-section/article/S10036-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10036-S10037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we held the 26th hearing for judicial \nnominees since the change in majority in the summer of 2001. The \nJudiciary Committee has now considered 103 nominees in less than 15 \nmonths. It took the Republican-controlled Senate 33 months--almost 3 \nfull years--to hold hearings for 100 of President Clinton's judicial \nnominees, although more than 100 were pending well before that. We have \nreached that mark in less than half that time.\n  Since the summer of 2001, we have held more hearings for more \njudicial nominees--103 candidates--than in any comparable 15-month \nperiod of the 6\\1/2\\ years before the Senate changeover last year.\n  We have also held more hearings for circuit court nominees--20--than \nin any comparable period of that previous 6\\1/2\\ years, when our \npredecessors allowed an average of only seven circuit court nominees to \nbe confirmed per year. In the past three weeks we held two back-to-back \nhearings for controversial circuit court nominees back to back. In \ncontrast, at 11 of the judicial nomination hearings held during the \nprior period of Republican control, no circuit court nominees were on \nthe agenda.\n  During their 6\\1/2\\ years of control of the Senate, there were also \n30 months in which Republicans held no hearings at all. Democrats have \nheld at least one hearing per month and have held almost two per month \non average. We have been working nonstop to address the vacancy crisis \nwe inherited. In the 6\\1/2\\ years of Republican control, before the \nreorganization of the committee last summer, vacancies on the Courts of \nAppeals more than doubled from 16 to 33 and overall vacancies rose from \n65 to 110.\n  Added to that were the 47 new vacancies that have arisen since last \nsummer. Thus, rather than 157 vacancies, with the 80 circuit and \ndistrict court nominees we have confirmed, there are now 77 vacancies.\n  The President has yet to nominate anyone for 30 of these vacancies. \nWith today's hearing for 7 judicial nominees, we will have held \nhearings for 21 of the 47 nominees currently pending.\n  Many of the 26 judicial nominees who have not yet had a hearing were \nnominated only recently toward the end of this congressional session. \nDue to the White House's refusal to allow ABA peer reviews to begin \nprior to nomination and because the ABA peer reviews have been taking \nbetween 50 and 60 days from the time of nomination, the White House \nknows that many of these late nominees will not have their files \ncompleted in time for hearings.\n  Thus, of the 26 who have not yet had a hearing, only seven have \ncompleted files--especially, ABA reviews and the consent of both of \ntheir home-State Senators. That is, the majority of the nominees who \nhave not yet had a hearing--19--do not have completed files. Of the \nseven who are eligible for a hearing, but who have not yet had a \nhearing, six have relatively controversial records which require more \nreview. The only remaining district court nominee did not have a \ncomplete file by the time the last hearing was noticed.\n  Accordingly, with today's hearing, since the changeover last year we \nwill have held hearings for 103 of the 110 eligible judicial nominees \nwith complete files. Thus, 94 percent of this President's judicial \nnominees who had completed files have been given hearings. This \nremarkable achievement is irrefutable evidence of the good-faith \nefforts we have made to restore order to the confirmation process--good \nfaith efforts that we continue to hope will be matched by the White \nHouse.\n  I am certain that President Clinton would have been overcome with \ngratitude if the Republicans ever gave 94 percent of his judicial \nnominees hearings in the years Republicans controlled the confirmation \nprocess during his administration. They never did. Instead, in 1995 for \nexample, Republicans allowed only 58 of the 86 pending judicial \nnominations of President Clinton to be confirmed, nowhere near 100 \npercent or even 90 percent.\n  In 1996, Republicans allowed only 17 of the 49 pending judicial \nnominees, or 35 percent, to be confirmed, and none were circuit court \nnominees. In 1997, Republicans allowed only 36 of the 79 Clinton \nnominees to be confirmed, or 46 percent. In 1998, Republicans allowed \n66 of 92 pending judicial nominees to be confirmed. In 1999 they \nallowed only 33 of the 71 judicial nominees to be confirmed, about 46 \npercent, and in 2000 they allowed only 39 of the 81 pending judicial \nnominees to be confirmed, or 48 percent. Thus, during their 6 years of \nSenate control during the Clinton administration, Republicans allowed \nonly about half of the judicial nominations to be confirmed on average \nper year. Their percentages are even worse for circuit court nominees. \nThese are detailed in my floor statement of October 4.\n  To this point, the Senate Judiciary Committee has voted on more \njudicial nominees--83--and on more circuit court nominees--17--than in \nany comparable 15-month period of prior Republican control. The \nDemocratic-led Senate has already confirmed 80 of the judicial \nnominations of President George W. Bush. In so doing, we have confirmed \nmore judicial nominees in less than 15 months that were confirmed in \nthe last 30 months that a Republican majority controlled the Senate. We \nhave done more in half the time.\n  The expeditious pace should not be construed as a rush to process the \nappointment of judges to lifetime positions. I ask unanimous consent to \nprint in the Record several recently published editorials from the \nRutland Herald, the Barre Montpelier Times Argus and the Los Angeles \nTimes. Each of these articles emphasize the important obligation of the \nSenate to thoroughly review the records of the President's judicial \nnominees. They serve as an important reminder that our outstanding \nrecord of treating President Bush's nominees more fairly and more \nexpeditiously than President Clinton's nominees were treated.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, Oct. 3, 2002]\n\n                       Caution on Court Nominees\n\n       Since George Washington took the oath of office, U.S. \n     presidents have nominated 140 men and women to the Supreme \n     Court and many more to the federal courts of appeal and trial \n     courts. In two centuries, the Senatee has rejected 11 Supreme \n     Court nominees and an uncertain number of prospective lower \n     court judges. Seven others withdrew their high court \n     nominations, some to avoid likely defeat.\n\n[[Page S10037]]\n\n       The Senate has blocked ideologues, including die-hard \n     Federalists during the 18th and early 19th centuries, who it \n     concluded would not put aside their political beliefs on the \n     bench. It killed the nominations of men viewed as shills for \n     special interests and rejected others for being ethically \n     compromised or simply not smart enough or wise enough to sit \n     on federal courts for life.\n       That history matters as the Senate Judiciary Committee \n     considers Dennis Shedd, Michael McConnell and Miguel Estrada \n     for seats on the U.S. Court of Appeals. Republicans insist \n     that the Senate panel, now with a one-vote Democratic edge, \n     has dragged its feet in confirming President Bush's picks and \n     that the tough questions senators have asked these three men \n     and others about their judicial philosophy and temperament \n     are a partisan effort to destroy the reputations of qualified \n     men and women. Neither charge holds water.\n       In the 14 months since the Democrats took narrow control of \n     the Senate, the Judiciary Committee has confirmed 78 judges, \n     14 of them to appellate courts. That compares with an average \n     of 39 confirmations a year during the six-plus years of \n     Republican control.\n       The committee has readily approved men and women more \n     centrist in their views and more likely to be fair-minded on \n     the bench. But committee members are right to hestitate over \n     Shedd, McConnell and Estrada.\n       Shedd has published a scant 60 opinions in 12 years as a \n     judge. He has backed employers against claims by workers \n     almost without exception. In criminal cases, he has \n     generously interpreted the law to favor police. He held \n     quixotically that the federal family leave law does not apply \n     to state employees, a ruling that, by extension, could \n     invalidate other federal civil rights protections for state \n     workers.\n       McConnell has repeatedly asserted that Supreme Court \n     precedents should not bind the current court. He has argued \n     before the Supreme Court that religious schools should \n     receive certain types of government aid on the same basis as \n     public schools.\n       Estrada, a corporate lawyer who helped make Bush's case in \n     the Florida recount battle, has virtually no public writings \n     and no judicial experience. The committee needs to see the \n     memos he wrote at the U.S. solicitor general's office, which \n     Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft has refused to release.\n       The Senate's obligation in confirming judges is to the \n     people, not the president. All three men now before the \n     Judiciary Committee should give members pause.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Rutland Herald, Oct. 7, 2002]\n\n                     Messe Off Base Critizing Leahy\n\n                           (By Leslie Black)\n\n       Former Attorney General Ed Meese and his so-called ``truth \n     squad'' have a nerve coming to Vermont to berate Senator \n     Leahy and insult the intelligence of Vermont citizens.\n       Senator Leahy, in his important role as chair of the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee, is holding hearings on judicial \n     nominations responsibily and admirably.

Leahy has been accused by some Vermont Republicans of \n     partisanship for not confirming Charles Pickering's \n     nomination to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       On the contrary, the Republican members of Leahy's \n     committee voted the party line in support of a judge whose \n     judicial record was often devoid of impartial objective \n     considerations relating to existing law, and most \n     importantly, to constitutional provisions.\n       Aside from the Pickering nomination, the fact is that under \n     Leahy's chairmanship the Senate Judiciary Committee has \n     approved 42 consecutive Bush administration appointees to the \n     federal bench, including, though not Pickering, the 5th \n     Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       Forty-two approvals out of 43 Bush nominations can hardly \n     be considered partisan. Orrin Hatch, Leahy's Republican \n     predecessor as chairman, sat on 53 of Clinton nominees. \n     Didn't even give them a hearing. The partisanship in the \n     Senate is clearly with the party of Leahy's accusers.\n       Patrick Leahy may be imperfect along with the rest of us. \n     But as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee he has \n     restored fairness and objectivity to the advise-and-consent \n     role of the Senate.\n                                  ____\n\n\n         [From The Barre Montpelier Times Argus, May 15, 2002]\n\n                            Political Triage\n\n       Edwin Meese, former U.S. attorney general, came to \n     Montpelier on Monday to apply a bit of political pressure \n     aimed at forcing Sen. Patrick Leahy to take speedier action \n     in confirming judicial nominations.\n       Leahy, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has \n     responsibility for holding hearings on President Bush's \n     nominees to the federal bench. Bush himself has criticized \n     the delays to which he says Leahy has subjected his nominees, \n     saying vacancies on the bench threaten the administration of \n     justice.\n       That was also the pitch made by Meese on Monday. His was \n     another voice in the partisan wrangling that surrounds the \n     issue. But Meese needn't have bothered.\n       Vermont Republicans no doubt took comfort in the boost \n     their cause received from Meese's appearance. But on the \n     whole, Vermonters are probably pleased by the idea that Leahy \n     is giving Bush's more extreme nominees a closer look.\n       Leahy has played a shrewd game on the issue. Contrary to \n     the accusations of his Republican opponents, he has actually \n     been more efficient than his Republican predecessors in \n     taking action on judicial nominees.\n       Figures from Leahy's office show that the number of \n     vacancies on the bench grew from 65 to 110 from 1995 to 2001 \n     when Republicans controlled the committee. That was a time \n     when Sen. Orrin Hatch, the Republican chairman, failed to \n     give a hearing to numerous nominees sent up by President \n     Clinton.\n       By contrast Leahy's committee has already confirmed 52 Bush \n     nominees, which exceeds the number of nominees confirmed by \n     the Republican Senate during the final four years of \n     Clinton's presidency. And the number of vacancies has fallen \n     to 84.\n       So what are the Republicans complaining about?\n       They are complaining because, even though Leahy is moving \n     quickly to confirm nominees, he is not moving so quickly on \n     all of them. Those whom the Democrats view as extreme \n     conservatives are getting a long, careful look from the \n     committee, and their hearings have been delayed.\n       The committee has already rejected the nomination of \n     Charles Pickering for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. But \n     a nomination fight like that over Pickering takes a political \n     toll, and Leahy knows he cannot subject his committee to that \n     kind of grueling battle on all questionable candidates.\n       When the Republicans controlled the Senate, they understood \n     the strategic value of delay. They defeated 24 Clinton \n     nominees to the appellate courts, but they did not defeat \n     them by an outright vote. They refused to allow a vote.\n       Leahy has urged Bush to nominate moderate judges around \n     whom his committee can reach a consensus. But among Bush's \n     nominees there is a cadre of extreme conservatives with \n     questionable records on women's rights, workers' rights, and \n     consumers' rights.\n       So Leahy is performing a sort of political triage. There \n     are so many judges to confirm that, in order to move quickly, \n     he has decided to act on those who can be confirmed quickly. \n     That leaves the more controversial nominees cooling their \n     heels.\n       When Sen. James Jeffords abandoned the Republican Party, he \n     made it possible for Leahy to assume the chairmanship of the \n     Judiciary Committee. Jeffords was concerned about the \n     extremist tendencies of the Bush administration, and now \n     Leahy has been able to exercise power to moderate those \n     extremist tendencies.\n       Meese should know that most Vermonters were pleased that \n     Jeffords gave Leahy that chance and that Leahy is making the \n     most of the opportunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/07/senate-section/article/S10037-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred October 1, \n2000 in Traverse City, MI. A 23-year-old bartender at a gay bar was \nattacked as he was removing the trash out of the back door of the \nbuilding around 2 a.m. An attacker grabbed him by the shoulders and \nbegan shouting ``faggot'' and other obscenities at him.

The \nbartender was able to run away after the initial attack, but was \nassaulted again after trying to return to the club several minutes \nlater.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/07/senate-section/article/S10038-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10038]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S10038]]\n                     HONORING DR. SALVATOR ALTCHEK\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Dr. Salvator \nAltchek, the beloved ``$5 doctor'' of Brooklyn, NY, who passed away \nlast month at the age of 92. I ask unanimous consent to print in the \nRecord the beautiful obituary commemorating the life of Dr. Altchek \nwritten by Douglas Martin of the New York Times.\n  Dr. Altchek was warmly known as ``the $5 doctor'' because he spent \nvirtually his entire 67-year career treating anyone who showed up at \nhis basement office in a working class section of Brooklyn Heights, \ncharging them little or nothing for his services.\n  Despite treating thousands of people, and delivering thousands of \nbabies, most people never heard of Dr. Altchek. That's because he \nsought neither fame nor fortune. His only goal in life was to help as \nmany people as possible. In so doing, he touched the lives of so many \nindividuals and so many families. He was truly an American treasure.\n  I leave it to the words of Douglas Martin's obituary to tell the \nstory of Dr. Salvator Altchek, whose lifetime of selfless devotion to \nhelping strangers will continue to serve as an inspiration to us all. I \nurge all of my colleagues to read this special tribute to a very, very \nspecial American.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 15, 2002]\n\n      Salvator Altchek, ``the $5 Doctor'' of Brooklyn, Dies at 92\n\n                          (By Douglas Martin)\n\n       Salvator Altchek, known for 67 years as the $5 doctor to \n     the melting pot of Brooklyn, especially the poorer residents \n     of affluent Brooklyn Heights, died on Tuesday. He was 92.\n       He continued to work until two months ago, but gave up \n     house calls five years ago. He delivered thousands of babies \n     and generally attended to the health needs of anyone who \n     showed up at his basement office in the Joralemon Street row \n     house in the Heights where he lived, charging $5 or $10 when \n     he charged at all. The office, with its faded wallpaper of \n     Parisian scenes, cracked leather furniture and antique \n     medical devices, had not changed much since Jimmy Rios got \n     his first penicillin shot there half a century ago.\n       ``You could walk into his office and he could tell you what \n     you had before you sat down,'' Mr. Rios said.\n       Dr. Altchek often made his house calls on foot, carrying \n     his black medical bag. He treated the poorest people, \n     angering his wife by sending one away with his own winter \n     coat. He welcomed longshoremen and lawyers, store owners and \n     streetwalkers. One patient insisted on always paying him $100 \n     to make up for some of those who could not pay at all.\n       A few years ago, a homeless man knocked on his door and \n     said he had walked all the way from Long Island to have a \n     wounded finger treated. He had last seen the doctor as a \n     toddler growing up in Brooklyn Heights more than 50 years \n     before.\n       The doctor sometimes greeted 70-year-olds he had delivered. \n     While it is unclear whether he was the oldest and longest-\n     working physician in the city, he was very likely the only \n     one nicknamed ``the $5 doctor.'' When his practice opened, he \n     treated Arab-Americans around Atlantic Avenue and was the \n     favored doctor of the Puerto Ricans who began to live in the \n     row houses of Columbia Place, near the waterfront, in the \n     1930's.\n       ``He wasn't out to make money; he was out to help people,'' \n     said Sara Mercado, whose daughter was delivered by Dr. \n     Altchek. People in her family were among his first patients.\n       Ramon Colon, in his book about a Puerto Rican leader, \n     ``Carlos Tapia: A Puerto Rican Hero in New York'' (Vantage, \n     1976), wrote:\n       ``He is a physician who treated the poor and never asked \n     for money from the oppressed community. they paid when they \n     had it, and he treated them as though they were Park Avenue \n     residents.''\n       Salvator Altchek was born in 1910 in Salonika, then part of \n     the Turkish Ottoman Empire, now part of Greece. As Sephardic \n     Jews, with roots long ago in Spain, the Altcheks spoke \n     Ladino, a form of Spanish spoken by Sephardim that dates \n     back to the 15th century.\n       The family became part of New York's ethnic rainbow when \n     his father, David, who spoke a half-dozen additional \n     languages, brought the family to the city in 1914, in \n     steerage. They lived at first on the Lower East Side, but \n     moved to Spanish Harlem, where they felt more comfortable \n     with Spanish-speaking people.\n       Dr. Altchek's father took a variety of jobs, including \n     selling fudge at Macy's. But as a professional fermentation \n     engineer, his main income, even during Prohibition, came from \n     the ouzo, cherry brandy and wine he discreetly made and sold.\n       Salvator Altchek and his seven brothers and sisters made \n     deliveries. In a favorite family story, he delivered wine to \n     a buyer who admired it and speculated on the vintage.\n       ``That's fresh,'' the boy chirped. ``He just made it.''\n       He graduated from Columbia and attended New York Medical \n     College, then in Manhattan and now in Westchester County. \n     Emanuel Altchek, the oldest brother and the first of three of \n     the brothers to graduate from medical school, paid Salvator's \n     tuition. Salvator, in turn, paid his brother Victor's way.\n       Salvator Altchek worked in Prospect Heights Hospital, long \n     since closed. But he decided that he wanted his own practice. \n     For more than half a century, he began his workday at 8 a.m., \n     took a half-hour off for dinner at 5 p.m. and closed the \n     office door at 8. He then made house calls, often until \n     midnight.\n       He knew everyone, and everyone knew him. Walking down a \n     street, he would recognize gay lovers, Mafia soldiers and \n     prominent lawyers. He often greeted someone by grabbing his \n     hand and taking his pulse. His passion for preventive \n     medicine surpassed his tact.\n       ``Hello, dear, you're looking well,'' he would say to a \n     patient. ``You put on a little weight, didn't you?''\n       When his wife, Blanche, died 32 years ago, he fell into a \n     depression. His sister Stella Shapiro heard him advise a \n     patient to find another doctor. But he gradually recovered by \n     throwing himself into his work.\n       He never remarried and was especially proud of the tall \n     linden tree in front of his house, which he dedicated to his \n     wife. He built a bench around it that neighbors and strollers \n     could use.\n       In addition to his brother Victor and sister Stella, both \n     of Manhattan, he is survived by his daughters, Susan Aroldi \n     of Saddle River, N.J., and Phyllis Sanguinetti of Buenos \n     Aires; four grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.\n       Dr. Altchek was a constant personality in a neighborhood \n     that changed many times, from proper society enclave to \n     wartime boardinghouse district to artistic bohemia to haven \n     for young professionals. When Truman Capote, then a Brooklyn \n     Heights resident, invited him to his famed Black and White \n     Ball in 1966, the doctor did not know who Capote was until he \n     finally recalled his face from the steam bath of the St. \n     George Hotel, Caren Pauley, a niece, said.\n       Once when he was held up at gunpoint, Dr. Altchek said he \n     could not give the would-be robber any money because he had a \n     date with an attractive woman, Ms. Pauley recalled. The \n     robber, recognizing him, reached into his pocket and gave him \n     $10.\n       Dr. Ozgun Tasdemir, a physician who immigrated from Turkey, \n     made Turkish candy for him, having noticed his cache of \n     Turkish desserts in the office refrigerator. She said he \n     brought the latest literature on her ailment to share with \n     her.\n       Dr. Altchek stopped making house calls only when he could \n     no longer walk up steps easily. He did not renew his \n     malpractice insurance when it expired in July. He began \n     calling up other doctors, asking them to take his patients \n     who had no insurance.\n       His brother Victor said that Dr. Altchek had correctly \n     diagnosed the abdominal condition that led to his own death. \n     His last spoken thought was to remember that he owed a \n     patient a medical report.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/07/senate-section/article/S10038-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10038-S10039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              NATIONAL 4-H YOUTH DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM WEEK\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my friend and \ncolleague from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe, to pay tribute to 4-H, one of \nthe strongest youth organizations in the country. I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of the legislation that Senator Inhofe introduced recently to \ndesignate October 6, 2002, through October 12, 2002, as ``National 4-H \nYouth Development Program Week.''\n  4-H began in Clark County, OH. Just minutes away from where I grew \nup. In 1902, a century ago this year, A.B. Graham established a ``Boys' \nand Girls' Agricultural Club.'' There were approximately 85 children \nwho attended that first meeting in the basement of the Clark County \nCourthouse in Springfield, OH. This was the start of what would be \ncalled a ``4-H Club'' within a few years. The first projects included \nfood preservation, gardening and beginning agriculture.\n  4-H has grown from its 85 original members to approximately 300,000 \nin Ohio and over 6.8 million nationwide. One out of every six people in \nOhio has been or is currently involved with 4-H youth development \nprograms either as a member, parent, volunteer, or donor. The project \nselection has also grown from the original three to over 200. A \nsampling of today's projects include health, family life, photography, \naerospace science, bicycles, natural resources, safety, horticulture \nand nutrition.\n  We need organizations, like 4-H, to help guide our next generation of \nagriculturists, teachers, and even elected officials toward a better \ntomorrow. I\n\n[[Page S10039]]\n\nalso am proud to say, that my wife, Fran, and I have had children go \nthrough the 4-H program for 24 straight years now, in fact, last year \nwas our eighth and youngest child Anna's first year in 4-H.\n  4-H clubs have expanded from rural to urban areas, where they provide \na new group of kids with essential leadership skills and community \nservice involvement. National 4-H conferences have even become \nplatforms for presidents and other national officials to voice their \nideas for agriculture and other policies.\n  Although today's 4-H organization may be larger than the original 100 \nmembers and our communication has increased from town meetings to \nInternet chat rooms, the organization's principles of Head, Heart, \nHands, and Health remain the same. Without question, the lessons and \nskills 4-H members learn will last a lifetime.\n  I am pleased to report that in Ohio, 4-H members, Nationwide \nInsurance, and the Ohio Farm Bureau have teamed together to create a \nbrand new 4-H Center on the campus of The Ohio State University. The \ngroundbreaking ceremony occurred just last month. This new Center will \nprovide research, teaching resources, and service opportunities for \nyouth, adult volunteers, and community organizations. The development \nof this Center is a result of partnerships, one of the many skills our \nyouth learn through 4-H.\n  In closing, I take this opportunity to challenge other Senators to \nbecome involved in 4-H either as a parent or volunteer. I guarantee it \nwill be one of the most rewarding experiences of their lives.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the week of \nOctober 6 as National 4-H Youth Development Program Week.\n  The need to provide a quality education and opportunities for our \nyouth is ever-present. In order to ensure that our country continues to \nprogress, we must encourage our youth to take active roles in their \nschools and their communities.\n  One hundred years ago, groups of concerned community members \norganized boys' and girls' agricultural clubs to provide better \nagricultural education to young people. These clubs adopted a model of \nlearning by doing, and their popularity continued to grow. By \naddressing the needs of the local community, these small boys and girls \nclubs rapidly evolved into the National 4-H Program that now can be \nfound in communities across America.\n  Today, 7 million youth and 50 million 4-H alumni participate in over \n1,000 4-H programs, ranging from robotics and biotechnology to \nskateboarding and agriculture. These programs provide opportunities for \nyouth to participate in innovative programs through which they can \ndevelop valuable, lifelong skills.\n  During my tenure as a U.S. Senator, I have enjoyed meeting with 4-H \nleaders and members throughout the State of Illinois, and have seen \nfirst-hand how the 4-H program has changed the lives of our young \npeople. I have also appreciated the extraordinary dedication that 4-H \nleaders bring to their clubs.\n  It was with pride that I cosponsored the resolution submitted by \nSenator Inhofe and Senator Stabenow declaring the week of October 6 as \n``National 4-H Youth Development Program Week.'' I hope that the 4-H \nprogram will build on the successes of the last one hundred years and \nhold true to the 4-H motto ``to make the best better'' in the years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/07/senate-section/article/S10039-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ELECTION JUDGES\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I am pleased today to pay tribute to those \nAmericans who play a very special role in our democracy, the citizens \nwho volunteer to serve as election judges. They work at the polls on \nElection Day, safeguarding our most precious right as Americans, the \nright to choose our leaders whom we then trust to govern, legislate on \nour behalf, and protect our rights and freedoms. Having received \ntraining in election laws and rules, judges open and close the polls, \nmaking a formidable commitment of time, energy, and stamina to work all \nday, often from before dawn until after dark. Some judges must promise \nto remain inside the polling place all day. They distribute ballots, \ntend to ballot boxes, count ballots, strictly adhering to prescribed \nprocedures to ensure secrecy and accuracy of election materials. The \njudges process absentee ballots, help voters who require assistance, \nregister new voters, and make certain that only qualified voters are \npermitted to vote. Recent history has taught us, all too dramatically, \nhow important this process of validation is.\n  To undertake this form of volunteer service is truly to exercise \none's civic responsibility while also facilitating that right and duty \nfor one's fellow citizens. While voters with strong party interests \nmight be drawn to the position, a judge's job is not to influence \nvoters. To be an election judge is to be a citizen-activist on a very \nbasic, very human level. The activities of a judge, although routine, \nfigure among the most rewarding and meaningful that an ordinary citizen \ncan perform. Older Americans, especially retirees, regard it as a \nwelcome way to keep in touch with what's happening in the broader \ncommunity and to connect with their neighbors.\n  Election judges are people of character and dedication. The official \nfunctions they pledge to perform are honorable and indispensable to our \nsociety. On Election Day, November 5th, many thousands of fine \nAmericans will invest their time by fulfilling the role of election \njudge. We are most fortunate to have these conscientious citizens. I am \nproud to express my appreciation for their valuable service which makes \nour form of government work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/07/senate-section/article/S10039-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10039-S10040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                            HEALTH CARE HERO\n\n   Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, today I rise to salute \nTerry O. Finklein, a true healthcare and community hero for Oregon. \nTerry is the chief executive officer of Columbia Memorial Hospital in \nAstoria, OR. Columbia Memorial evolved from the north coast's oldest \nhospital in 1927, and has served the people of Clatsop County, OR for \ngenerations.\n  Not long ago, Columbia Memorial Hospital was on the brink of closing \nbecause of financial problems. Terry arrived at Columbia Memorial in \nlate 1989 and promptly turned the financially troubled hospital around. \nWhen you lead a rural hospital, financial heroics are an ongoing \nnecessity.\n  Over the last decade Terry's accomplishments include implementation \nof a $3.5 million dollar hospital building project, successive 3-year \nJCAHO accreditations, creation of a Home Health Care program and the \nestablishment of a Medicare certified hospice program.\n  Terry is counted among the pioneers of Oregon's statewide trauma \nsystem. He built a helipad on Columbia Memorial's front lawn, something \neveryone swore ``couldn't be done'', brought the hospital's Emergency \nRoom and staff up to a standard of excellence that earned the hospital \nState designation as a Level III Trauma Center, and doubled the size of \nthe ER.\n  Last year, Terry's community lost the services of five physicians in \none week with the closure of a clinic. As most of my colleagues from \nrural States know, physician recruitment in rural communities is tough. \nSo is the clinic business. In order to ensure that the residents of \nClatsop County had access to stable health care, Terry took Columbia \nMemorial into the non-profit clinic business. He implemented the \nColumbia Memorial Hospital Women's Center, which is now staffed by \nthree excellent physicians and a certified nurse midwife.\n  Statistically, Clatsop County's children are an at-risk population. \nTerry decided to tackle this issue at its roots by administering the \nHealthy Families program of Clatsop County. This program offers at-risk \nbabies and parents a ``how to'' helping hand with regular home visits \nand access to other agencies as needed.\n  In Clatsop County, 45 percent of the population has incomes at or \nbelow 200 percent of the federal poverty level. Combine that with a \nshortage of physicians, and access to health care becomes a major \nissue. About a year ago, Terry envisioned a federally funded clinic. \n``It can't be done,'' folks said. This time Terry went directly to his \ncommunity partners for support. He received dozens of letters of \nsupport. He funded and implemented research and a grant proposal. He \nspent, and still spends, hours on project implementation.\n\n[[Page S10040]]\n\n  In December of this year, the Coastal Family Health Center will open \nfor business. It will provide general health care, dental care and \nmental health services in a community where these services are \ndesperately needed.\n  For his service and dedication to the health of the people in Clatsop \nCounty, OR, I salute Terry O. Finklein, a true hero for Oregon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/07/senate-section/article/S10040-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COMMENDING ISRAEL BROOKS\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS.

A bill to establish a Citizens Health Care Working Group to \nfacilitate public debate about how to improve the health care system \nfor Americans and to provide for a vote by Congress on the \nrecommendations that are derived from this debate; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I join with Senator Orrin Hatch, one \nof the most caring and thoughtful public officials I have ever known, \nin offering a bipartisan roadmap to creating a health care system that \nworks for all Americans. Our country has been trying to find such a \npath since President Harry Truman's proposal to cover all Americans was \nvoted down in 1945. I believe the Wyden-Hatch proposal can succeed \nafter 57 years of failure because our bipartisan plan begins with the \npublic discussing and deciding their health care priorities, followed \nby a guarantee Congress will actually vote on the recommendations that \nresult from this grassroots debate.\n  This approach has never been tried before. Now, when major health \nlaws are written, politicians sit down and prescribe what benefits will \nbe offered, and then try to come up with the money to pay for them. \nAfter the politicians write their plans, the special interest lobbies \nstart attacking one feature or another through shrill television \ncommercials. Pretty soon, the public gets understandably confused, the \nchance for building consensus is lost, and important health care needs \ngo unmet.\n  The 280 million Americans whose survival depends on quality, \naffordable health care have never been given the chance to shape their \nhealth care future before the special interest lobbyists weigh in. The \nWyden-Hatch bill changes that. Under our proposal, the public gets to \njump-start health reform by stating their priorities at the outset, \nrather than being treated as an afterthought. We believe our \nlegislation can serve as an illuminated route to a health care system \nwhere each American has the ability to obtain quality, affordable \nhealth care coverage. We placed three signposts on our roadmap to \nprovide guidance to the American people and their elected officials as \nthey make the tough choices inherent in tackling health care reform.\n  At the first signpost, the public is given an extensive opportunity, \nin their home communities and on line, to state their personal health \ncare priorities and how they should be paid for. In addition, the \npublic will be asked to look beyond their personal needs, to those of \nthe community at large, and how those needs should be paid for.\n  Our legislation forthrightly asks the questions that must be answered \nto have meaningful health reform--questions such as: What kind of \nhealth care do you want most? How much are you willing to pay? How \nshould costs be contained without sacrificing the quality of care? \nShould the Government or private businesses be required to pay a \nportion of your costs? How about those of your neighbors?\n  Our national Government has never directly asked the public these \nquestions. After asking these questions, the Government ought to keep \nquiet for a bit and listen to the people because without some sense of \nthe public's view, it is always going to be virtually impossible to \ncreate a health care system that works for everyone, with the consensus \nthat is needed to get it done.\n  To ask the key questions and follow up on the suggestions given by \nthe American people, the Wyden-Hatch legislation creates a Citizens' \nHealth Care Working Group. The Working Group is made up of a \nrepresentative cross-section of our people. It is not just another \nWashington, DC commission of so-called policy experts.\n  The Working Group directs the public participation portion of this \nproposal. For example, as a guide to help the public in formulating \ntheir views on the tough choices that lie ahead, the Wyden-Hatch \nlegislation directs the Working Group to prepare and make widely \navailable a ``Health Report to the American People.''\n  The legislation we have authored requires that this report be written \nin understandable language and describe the cost and availability of \nthe major public and private health choices now available--and also \ncontain enough information so the public can create alternatives. Here \nare the kinds of issues we want to address: ``If covering liver \ntransplants under government health programs requires cutting other \nservices, what services are you willing to cut, or would you rather not \nhave liver transplants covered? If government coverage of long-term \ncare for the elderly would require workers to begin contributing to the \nprogram at age 40, is it still worth it to you?''\n  These are moral choices about what health care the public has a right \nto expect. These are economic choices that affect the finances of our \nfamilies. These are legal and social choices that will be difficult for \nour people to make. The Wyden-Hatch proposal is built around the \nproposition that these choices are too important to duck any longer.\n  After establishing a sense of how the public feels about these hard \nchoices, the legislation directs that the Working Group move to the \nsecond signpost on our roadmap. There the Working Group is to take the \nideas offered by the American people, and translate these views into \nrecommendations for our elected officials to create a health care \nsystem that works for all. With the Working Group's involvement in the \npublic participation requirement of this legislation, we believe they \nare the right people to take this historic step: to synthesize the \nopinions and information provided by the public and then present a \nfaithful picture to Congress.\n  At the third signpost, the Congress takes the recommendations from \nthe Working Group and utilizes the legislative process to develop one \nor more plans for the recommendations, with a guarantee to the public \nthat the plans will be voted on in both Houses of Congress. We believe \nthat the assurance that Congress will vote after the public's will is \nexpressed provides an added measure of credibility for this \nlegislation. Simply put, people will be able to see their voices, their \nparticipation, lead to actual votes on the floors of both Houses of \nCongress to create a health care system that works for all. With these \nsteps I have described, our country can as never before discuss, decide \nand deliver on health care reforms.\n  I know there will be many questions about this proposal, and I'll try \nto answer them in the coming days. I'd like to briefly answer just one \nquestion I've already been asked: ``Why now? This is the end of the \nCongressional session; we are all concerned about the possibility of \nwar with Iraq. Why are you putting this before Congress today?''\n\n  My answer is that the lack of decent health care for so many \nAmericans,\n\n[[Page S10042]]\n\nand the skyrocketing costs of coverage for insured Americans, threaten \ncountless lives and our economic security just as tenaciously as any \nforeign enemy our Nation has ever faced. Just as we are beginning a \ndebate about how best to address the Nation's security interests, it is \nhigh time Congress resumed the debate about how to address the \ninequities and failures of the American health care system.\n  On health care, our families can't afford to wait any longer. \nCongress is completing another session without significant progress on \nmajor health care issues. A demographic tsunami of baby boomer retirees \nis coming soon. It is increasingly evident that piecemeal health \nreform--considering prescription drugs one day, patients' rights \nlegislation the next, something else after that--isn't working.\n  I have no intention on giving up on any one of those important issues \nwhen it's possible to get Congress to consider them separately. I still \nbelieve the bipartisan prescription drug bill I authored with Olympia \nSnowe could bring the Senate together and help seniors get and afford \nprescription medicine now.\n  Yet is clear that because health care is like an ecosystem, with one \npart affecting all others, it is extremely difficult to make real \nprogress on a single important issue without factoring in the way it \nwill ripple through our entire health care system.\n  So as the Congress pushes ahead on prescriptions and other urgent \nneeds, let us simultaneously reopen the debate about creating a health \ncare system that works for all. That debate stopped in 1994, and needs \nto begin again. The Wyden-Hatch bill provides an opportunity to reopen \nthis debate, and by introducing our bill now we believe it will be \nready for full Congressional deliberation when the next Congress begins \nin January.\n  One way or another, it is urgent that Congress find a way to do \nbetter by the people's health care needs.\n  My constituents at home in Oregon make this case constantly. At town \nmeetings, Chamber of Commerce lunches, labor halls, non-profit board \nmeetings, after church coffee hours, and especially at my ``sidewalk \noffice hours'' where I just set up a card table to listen, they ask, \n``Ron, when's Congress going to get going on health care and help us \nout?''\n  One Oregon business after another has been telling me their health \npremiums are going up by as much as 20 percent a year. The number of \nuninsured is going up, with many of these individuals working at small \nbusinesses whose owners desperately want to offer health coverage and \ncan't figure out how to do it and keep their doors open. Many \nphysicians have been leaving government health programs because of \ninadequate reimbursements. Thousands and thousands of pages of health \ncare regulations now exist and the system is almost choking on all the \nbureaucracy.\n  We know that America's health care system is scientifically \nprodigious. Every day our dedicated and caring health care providers \nare performing miracles. Last year more than $1.4 trillion was spent on \nhealth care in America. Divide that sum by the number of Americans, and \nthere would be enough for every family of four to receive more than \n$18,000 for health care. With all this money, and so much talent and \ncreativity in America, shouldn't it be possible to create a health \nsystem that works for everyone?\n  Senator Hatch and I believe it is. We know it will be hard, but we \nbelieve it can be done if our roadmap is used.\n  For example, to achieve real reform our elected officials are going \nto have to reject the blame game. Republicans can no longer say the \nproblem in health care is primarily the trial lawyers. Democrats can no \nlonger say the problem in health care is primarily the insurance \ncompanies. All--let me repeat, all--of the powerful lobbies are going \nto have to accept some changes they have rejected in the past if \nAmerica is to have a health care system that works for everyone. I \nbelieve that's what we'll hear from the public if they're given the \nchance to discuss and decide their health care priorities as the Wyden-\nHatch legislation envisions.\n  Before I wrap up, I wish to offer a few thank yous.\n  The first thank you is to the people of Oregon. They have honored me \nwith a chance to serve, and I get up every morning feeling like the \nluckiest guy around. It was not very long ago, as codirector of the \nOregonian Gray Panthers, I was driving to senior citizens meetings in a \nbeat-up station wagon, and I never thought I would have the privilege \nof being able to serve in this capacity.\n  Oregonians can see I have modeled much of this legislation after the \ndebate that Oregon has had on health care. And we are proud that we are \nthe first of the initiatives to ask the tough questions.\n  Oregonians began asking those difficult questions more than a decade \nago in community meetings, for one reason: Gov. John Kitzhaber, an \nemergency room physician, insisted that we do it. He deserves great \ncredit for his efforts, his courage, and his tenacity. When I told him \nI was going to push Congress to build on Oregon's public process, the \nGovernor said: Go for it.\n  Senator Hatch--and I note that Senator Hatch is in the Chamber this \nmorning--could easily have said he wanted no part of this whole \ndiscussion. Senator Hatch has written several vital health care laws, \nfrom his S-CHIP legislation, to his community health centers bill, to \nthe Hatch-Waxman legislation, to make sure there are pharmaceuticals \navailable for the public, and that they are affordable. All of those \npieces of legislation have made a huge contribution.\n  Senator Hatch has about the fullest plate in the Senate, with his \nJudiciary and Intelligence responsibilities, but he and Patricia Knight \nand Patricia DeLoatche have been thoughtful and patient as we went \nthrough draft after draft of this proposal in an effort to start the \ndiscussion now. I want Senator Hatch to know how grateful I am to him.\n  Dr. Paul Ellwood, who founded the Jackson Hole Health Group, has been \nworking for more than three decades to create a health system that \nworks for everybody. Now, when he could be enjoying retirement, riding \nhorses in beautiful Wyoming, he is still bringing together health care \npolicymakers, at 7 o'clock on a Sunday morning, in an effort to try to \nfind a consensus on the kinds of common ground that Senator Hatch and I \nare pursuing.\n  Dr. Ellwood has been so helpful in the development of this proposal \nand his own new plan called Heroic Pathways, which encourages the use \nof information technologies and evidence-based medicine, which is a \nfancy way of saying health care that actually works. I am of the view \nthat Dr. Ellwood's ideas have great potential. To Paul and Barbara \nEllwood, I say this morning, we would not be here today without you.\n  In my office, Stephanie Kennan and Carole Grunberg kept us tethered \nto reality, and Ms. Daphne Edwards, a young lawyer in the legislative \ncounsel's office, produced eight separate drafts of this legislation \nalone.\n  Finally, I went into public life because I have always believed if \npeople could not get affordable, quality health care, they were not in \na position to be able to do much of anything else. Since those Gray \nPanther days, I have believed that it is wrong for people in this \ncountry to die because they could not get health care or because it \ncame too late.\n  America is now hemorrhaging dollars into a health care system that \nsimply does not work at all for too many people. The longer people go \non dying needlessly, and the longer prosperity and security allude our \nfamilies, the less America looks like the America of our dreams. No one \nI know thinks it should be so easy to slip through the cracks in our \nhealth care system. No one I know believes America is supposed to be a \nplace where people forfeit their well-being for doing honest work that \njust does not pay enough for good medical care.\n  The Wyden-Hatch legislation is a chance to move toward America as it \nis meant to be. People can voice their vision for health care in \nAmerica. Their voices can count. Their vision can come to pass.\n  So today I ask the Senate to give our people this opportunity. The \nWyden-Hatch bill provides a roadmap. The great people of this country, \nworking with their public servants, can use it as a guide to a health \ncare system that works for everyone.\n  Mr. President, I see that my colleague is on the floor this morning. \nI\n\n[[Page S10043]]\n\nwrap up by again expressing my appreciation to Senator Hatch. I have \ncome to the conclusion that if you want to get anything important done, \nparticularly in health care, it has to be bipartisan. Senator Hatch and \nI have been talking about this health care reform for an awfully long \ntime. He has been extraordinarily patient--he and his staff--in working \nwith me. I think we bring to the Senate today a chance, as we end this \nsession--a session where there has not been the progress the people \ndeserve on health care--a chance to move forward in a bipartisan way. I \nam just especially grateful to my colleague from the State of Utah, who \nis one of the most caring people I have known in public life, for all \nhis help.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3063\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Health Care That Works for \n     All Americans Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In order to improve the health care system, the \n     American public must engage in an informed national public \n     debate to make choices about the services they want covered, \n     what health care coverage they want, and how they are willing \n     to pay for coverage.\n       (2) More than a trillion dollars annually is spent on the \n     health care system, yet--\n       (A) 41,000,000 Americans are uninsured;\n       (B) insured individuals do not always have access to \n     essential, effective services to improve and maintain their \n     health; and\n       (C) employers, who cover over 170,000,000 Americans, find \n     providing coverage increasingly difficult because of rising \n     costs and double digit premium increases.\n       (3) Despite increases in medical care spending that are \n     greater than the rate of inflation, population growth, and \n     Gross Domestic Product growth, there has not been a \n     commensurate improvement in our health status as a nation.\n       (4) Health care costs for even just 1 member of a family \n     can be catastrophic, resulting in medical bills potentially \n     harming the economic stability of the entire family.\n       (5) Common life occurrences can jeopardize the ability of a \n     family to retain private coverage or jeopardize access to \n     public coverage.\n       (6) Innovations in health care access, coverage, and \n     quality of care, including the use of technology, have often \n     come from States, local communities, and private sector \n     organizations, but more creative policies could tap this \n     potential.\n       (7) Despite our Nation's wealth, the health care system \n     does not provide coverage to all Americans who want it.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to provide for a nationwide public debate about \n     improving the health care system to provide every American \n     with the ability to obtain quality, affordable health care \n     coverage; and\n       (2) to provide for a vote by Congress on the \n     recommendations that result from the debate.\n\n     SEC. 4.

The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his kind remarks, \nespecially his kind remarks with regard to me. I share a mutual \naffection for him because, as a leader in the House on health care, he \ndid so many good things. We are so happy to have him in the Senate \nwhere he has continued his work on health care. I am very grateful to \nhim.\n  Mr. President, I rise to associate myself with the remarks of my good \nfriend and colleague, the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden.\n  Last week, we were all dismayed to learn the Census Bureau figures \nindicate the number of uninsured in our country has risen from 39.8 \nmillion in 2000 to 41.2 million in 2001.\n  Of even greater concern is the fact that most of the newly uninsured \npreviously had employer-based coverage.\n  Obviously, this is a trend in the wrong direction despite years of \nefforts here in Washington to improve our country's health care \ndelivery system.\n  Clearly, we must take another approach.\n  In a nutshell, the legislation that Senator Wyden and I are \nintroducing today will stimulate fruitful discussion and debate on how \nwe can really effect improvements to our nation's health care system--\nimprovements that can be accepted at all levels, from communities on up \nto the Federal government.\n  We have worked on this bill for several months and are proud to have \nreached bipartisan consensus.\n  Bipartisanship, it seems, is a rare occurrence these days. But, in \nour opinion, the only way to resolve our country's health crisis is to \nput politics aside and work together toward common goals.\n  The Health Care That Works for All Americans Act of 2002 reflects our \ncommon goals on how to resolve this country's health care woes.\n  We accomplish these important goals by fostering candid discussions--\nin every corner of our country--through which the public can have an \nearnest discussion about our current health care system.\n  These discussions will lead to recommendations on how to improve \nhealth care coverage which will help guide the Congress as it moves \nforward in this area.\n  It is our hope that, in the end, this legislation will provide \nAmericans with the proper tools to access high quality, affordable \nhealth care coverage.\n  Basically, our legislation envisions three steps: public meetings; \nrecommendations to Congress; and congressional action.\n  We see this an as interactive process, which will help all of us be \nmore informed consumers and which can produce real changes for the \npublic.\n  At this point, I would like to take this opportunity to discuss each \nof these steps in more detail.\n  The first step of this bill is to stimulate community gatherings at \nwhich individuals from all walks of life can provide their viewpoints \non which health benefits they believe should be covered.\n  Obviously, a necessary component of that discussion will be how the \nbenefits can be paid for, and by whom. Strange as it may seem, our \ngovernment has never actually asked the American people what they want \nfrom our health care system. These community meetings would pose \nquestions to individuals such as, ``What type of health coverage do you \nwant how much are you willing to pay?''\n  In addition, debate would focus on the financial responsibilities of \nthe government, businesses, and individual citizens.\n  I believe these issues must be discussed at the beginning of a new \ndebate on health coverage, because the public's response is essential \nto building a nationwide consensus for creating a new health care \nsystem. It is critical to receive feedback from those who use the \nhealth care system on a daily, weekly or even annual basis.\n  Our plan is to hear from everyone who has had first-hand experience \nwith the health care system. We want to hear what people like and \ndislike about the current system and their proposals for change. And, \nwe also hope to hear from those who do not use health services and the \nreasons why they have not sought health care coverage.\n\n  We hope to stimulate a provocative discussion based on key questions. \nIs health care too expensive? Too complicated? Or is it just not \navailable to certain segments of our society?\n  The Wyden-Hatch legislation creates a Citizens' Health Care Working \nGroup which would be charged with posing these tough questions and \noverseeing this crucial debate on how to improve upon our current \nhealth care system.\n  The Citizens' Health Care Working Group will be comprised of \nindividuals who have a deep interest in health care: patients; \nproviders, community leaders; and key state and federal officials.\n  The Working Group will coordinate nationwide community meetings and \nfacilitate the public in expressing their views on the complex and \noften difficult choices concerning health care coverage.\n  To achieve this objective, our bill directs the Working Group to \nproduce a ``Health Care Report to the American People.'' This report \nwill be used as a guidebook designed to describe the cost and \navailability of health choices available to Americans across the \ncountry--taking into account geographic differences.\n  Since this issue has been visited over and over again without \nnoticeable results, we believe that it is time to have an honest \ndialogue about sensitive health care issues with the public so that \nindividual citizens will have a better idea of what choices members of \nCongress and key health officials are facing when health care issues \nare being debated.\n  We envision asking citizens about a whole range of services and \nprocedures, a ``bottom-up'' review of the health\n\n[[Page S10046]]\n\ncare system, if you will. We hope these community discussions will look \nat current coverage issues, such as whether Medicaid should provide \nbetter coverage for transplants, recognizing that these are very \nexpensive, labor-intensive procedures that may use scarce resources \nthat might have been used elsewhere.\n  Another area we hope might be explored is how to improve coverage of \nlong-term care services, and how this should be paid.\n  These choices--economic, moral, legal and social--will be difficult \nones, but the purpose of our legislation is this--to start discussing \nthese vital issues with those on whom there will be the greatest \nimpact--the American people. We cannot afford to put off these \ndiscussions any longer.\n  In the past, health reform debates have not included the voice of the \npeople who actually need to live with these decisions. The Wyden-Hatch \nlegislation will ensure that those Americans who depend on quality, \naffordable health care are at the forefront of the discussion before \nthe special interests weigh in with their objectives.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues, given the failures of the past, \nisn't it time that we approach this problem by listening to citizens' \nviewpoints on health care coverage?\n  The second step of this legislation is to direct the Working Group to \ntake the ideas offered by the public and translate these comments into \nrecommendations for our elected officials, specifically Members of \nCongress and the President.\n  The Working Group will have substantial awareness of our citizens' \npreferences because of their involvement in the public meetings across \nthe country. After the meetings are completed, the Working Group will \nhighlight the issues raised by the public and provide them to members \nof Congress and the President for evaluation.\n\n  The third step of this legislation involves drafting these \nrecommendations into legislation which will eventually be voted upon by \nboth the House and the Senate.\n  Never before has Congress voted on a health care proposal built on a \nfoundation created by the public making difficult heath care choices.\n  If enacted, the Wyden-Hatch bill will provide for just such a vote.\n  Senator Wyden and I both know there will be many questions about this \nproposal, but, in my opinion, the most important question is ``Why \nnow?''\n  The answer is simple--the American people cannot afford to wait any \nlonger. The number of uninsured Americans, which had been declining for \nthe past couple of years, is now increasing.\n  In addition, the costs of gridlock are simply too great--on human, \nsocial, economic and moral grounds. Congress is on the verge of \ncompleting another session without significant progress on major health \ncare reforms.\n  Once again, we have not passed prescription drug coverage for \nMedicare beneficiaries. Once again, we have not addressed the issue of \nthe uninsured. Once again, we have not approved legislation that \nincludes patient protections.\n  And the reason for this inaction is partisan politics--no one is \nwilling to compromise so we end up doing nothing and the American \npublic suffers. In my opinion, something must be done to address these \nimportant issues, sooner rather than later.\n  One issue that must be addressed is the overwhelming cost of health \ncare. Every time I go home to Utah, I hear complaints from my \nconstituents about escalating health care premiums and the price of \nprescription drugs. People are having a difficult time paying for their \nhealth insurance premiums, their physicians' visits and their \nmedicines. We were all disturbed last year to hear about a recent \nTowers Perrin survey indicating that the cost of health benefit plans \nat large companies is expected to rise an average of 15 percent--15 \npercent!--in 2003.\n  Some businesses, especially smaller employers, are worried that they \nwill no longer be able to provide health insurance coverage to their \nemployees. Utah physicians complain to me about the inadequate Medicare \nreimbursement rates and are threatening to leave the state.\n  In fact, many of the federal health programs have complicated and \nover-bearing regulations that are confusing to participating providers. \nFor example, is it necessary to have a book of Medicaid regulations \nthicker than the Black's Law Dictionary?\n  While our health care system provides the highest quality services in \nthe world and is the most technologically advanced, America's health \nsystem has fundamental flaws. The purpose of this legislation is to \nbuild on the positive components of our current system and improve the \nflaws.\n  We believe that the best way to improve the current system is to \nlisten to public input and implement their ideas and suggestions.\n  We must get past playing the blame game. All of the powerful special \ninterests are going to have to accept some reforms they have rejected \nin the past if America is to have a health care system that works for \nall.\n  I believe this is what we will hear from the American people if they \nare given the chance to drive the debate on health reform as envisioned \nby this legislation. Unfortunately, there never has been a system to \ngather that public input until now.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to be the lead Republican sponsor of the \nHealth Care that Works for All Americans Act of 2002. I urge my \ncolleagues to work with us so this legislation will be enacted into law \nin a timely manner. The American people cannot afford to wait any \nlonger.\n  I praise my colleague again for his leadership in so many areas, but \nespecially the area of health care. He is sincere. He is dedicated. He \nis smart. He works hard on these issues. I am proud to work with him on \nthis issue, and hope we can be successful in passing this bill and \ngetting this very worthwhile effort started.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida:\n  S. 3064. A bill to prohibit the use of patient databases for \nmarketing without the express consent of the patient; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, privacy concerns continues to \ngrow not only in Florida, but throughout the Nation. This past August, \nthe Administration finalized rules which will allow pharmacies and \nother health care entities to profit from their confidential patient \ndatabases by entering marketing agreements with giant health \ncorporations.\n  Under the new rules, a pharmacy can search its database for patients \nusing a specific prescription drug and then turn around and send an \nunsolicited advertisement on behalf of a drug maker peddling a more \nexpensive alternative drug, even if it's less effective. And to make \nmatters worse, the consumer can't ask the company to stop.\n  Instead of banning this anti-consumer practice, the Administration \nissued non-binding guidelines asking third parties not to provide \nfinancial incentives to doctors or pharmacies in exchange for \nsuggesting certain drugs to patients. While the guidelines are well \nmeaning, this terrible practice won't stop if the government doesn't do \nmore than offer suggestions. We need to pass a law to prohibit this \nbehavior.\n  Today, I'm introducing a bill that allows consumers to decide if they \nwant to receive health advertisements generated as a result of their \npersonal health characteristics. Under my legislation, pharmacies, \ninsurance companies and other health entities would be prohibited from \nusing private, personally identifiable health information to provide \nmarketing services to any entity without providing notice to the \nconsumer about its disclosure practices and obtaining the consumer's \nexpress written consent.\n  The legislation makes an exception for treatment communications \nunless the covered entity receives direct or indirect remuneration from \na third party for making the communication. The free flow of \ninformation is important when sought by the consumer, but treatment \ncommunications tarnished by the marketing dollars of third parties \ncreate an inherent conflict of interest by encouraging patients, who \ndon't know their pharmacist has been paid, to purchase high-cost \nalternative drugs that are not necessarily more effective than those \nprescribed by their doctor. Unnecessary spending driven by this \npractice, not only hurts individual consumers, but also the American \ntaxpayer as Medicare and Medicaid costs skyrocket.\n\n[[Page S10047]]\n\n  My goal is to restore control to the consumer, so that they can make \na decision to receive, or not receive, these advertisements once they \nhave been informed that their personal information will be used for \nthat purpose and once they understand that the covered entity is being \npaid to make a particular recommendation.\n  I look forward to working with all interested parties to resolve this \nproblem in a timely manner for consumers and ask unanimous consent that \nthe text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3064\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 44, United States Code, to make \nGovernment information security reform permanent, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill which \nwill make permanent a law which was intended to protect the security of \nFederal computers and information systems. Over the years, numerous \nGovernmental Affairs Committee hearings and General Accounting Office \nreports uncovered and identified systemic failures of government \ninformation systems which highlighted our Nation's vulnerability to \ncomputer attacks, from international and domestic terrorists to crime \nrings to everyday hackers. As a result, Congress enacted the Government \nInformation Security Reform Act as part of the Floyd D. Spence National \nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, Public Law 106-398. \nSince its passage in the 106th Congress, the law has required Federal \nagencies to develop and implement security policies and provided the \nOffice of Management and Budget authority to demand from agencies \nbetter plans for improving computer security. Unfortunately, this \nrelatively new law is set to expire next month.\n  The information security legislation upon which the law is based, \nwhich I sponsored along with Senator Lieberman, was reported by the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee and passed by the Senate with no sunset \nprovision. A two-year sunset was added in conference providing that the \nlaw expire on November 29, 2002.\n  The bill I am introducing today would repeal the sunset and restore \nthe language to what originally was approved by the Governmental \nAffairs Committee and the Senate last Congress. Further, given that the \nlaw is commonly referred to as the ``Government Information Security \nReform Act,'' the bill also would codify that short title.\n  We must ensure that Federal agencies continue to protect their assets \nand prevent hackers and cyberterrorists from wreaking havoc with \ncitizens' sensitive information, such as taxpayer data, veterans' \nmedical records, and social security portfolios. We must not let this \nlaw expire.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 3068. A bill to amend the Agricultural Adjustment Act to require \nthe Secretary of Agriculture to use the price of feed grains and other \ncash expenses as factors to determine the basic formula price for milk \nunder milk marketing orders; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I had sought recognition initially to \ndiscuss two other subjects. While the issue of Iraq is very much on the \nminds of the American people and the focus of attention worldwide, \nthere are other important considerations which are pending and are of \ninterest to Pennsylvanians and what is happening with the economy.\n  We really cannot let our attention focus solely on Iraq.\n  There are many matters which involve important economic issues and \ngreat numbers of jobs. That is a subject that is very much on my mind \nwith respect to the Pennsylvania dairy farmers. I propose to introduce \nlegislation this afternoon on that subject.\n  Agriculture is the largest industry in Pennsylvania, and dairy is its \nsingle largest component. Pennsylvania is the fourth largest dairy \nproducer in the Nation. We have approximately 10,300 dairy farms which \nproduce $1.710 billion worth of milk each year.\n  Regrettably, over the past decades, Pennsylvania has lost an average \nof 300 to 500 dairy farmers per year. In the years 1993 to 1998, \nPennsylvania lost more than 11 percent of its dairy farmers. That is \nbecause Pennsylvania farmers have had to deal with drought and other \nnatural disasters, high feed and transportation costs, and other \nvariables that challenge their ability to sustain their farms, but \nmostly because the cost of production exceeds what has been the average \nprice for class 3 dairy products. It varies tremendously. It was $15.90 \nin September of last year. It went down to $9.92 in September of this \nyear. The cost has been tremendous.\n  Meanwhile, the average cost of production of milk in Pennsylvania per \nhundredweight is calculated by the Pennsylvania Department of \nAgriculture. The average was $14.32 in the year 2001. The price for \nmilk in January of 2002 was $11.87 per hundredweight, going down to \n$10.82 per hundredweight in May, and $9.54 per hundredweight in August \nof this year. The cost of production exceeds what the Pennsylvania \ndairy farmers are able to obtain for their milk.\n  I serve on the Agriculture Subcommittee of Appropriations. On May 14 \nof last year at an extensive hearing in Philadelphia, we heard from \neconomists, we heard from farmers, and an analysis for merchants and an \nanalysis of what was happening on dairy farming.\n  It is a complex matter. While the price of milk goes down for dairy \nfarmers, the cost of milk goes up to the consumer. I know at the shop \nwhere I buy a half-gallon of milk, it was $1.89, and it jumped to $2.19 \nfor a half-gallon of milk at the precise time when the payments made to \nthe dairy farmers were going down. It seems to me there really has to \nbe an additional factor in the calculation of these prices by the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture.\n  It is for that reason that I am proposing legislation today which \nwould amend section 8(c)(5) of the Agriculture Adjustment Act with \namendments by the Agriculture Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 to add \nthe following:\n  Subsection M, using as factors to determine the basic formula price \nfor milk under an order issued pursuant to this section (i) the price \nof feed grains, including the cost of concentrates, by-products, \nliquid, whey, hay, silage, pasture, and other forage; and (ii) other \ncash expenses, including the cost of hauling, artificial insemination, \nveterinary services and medicine, bedding and litter, marketing, custom \nservices and supplies, fuel, lubrication, electricity, machinery and \nbuilding repairs, labor, association fees, and assessments.\n  During the course of the July and August break, I traveled \nextensively on open house town meetings throughout Pennsylvania. I \nheard recurrent complaints from the dairy farmers about being unable to \nmaintain the dairy farms. It is a very important matter that the small \ndairy farmers be able to continue to produce milk, which is a very \nimportant item in our daily diets. I don't think I need to expand upon \nthat point.\n  But the dairy farmers are facing enormous problems. We had hoped \nthere would be a dairy compact. There had been one for the New England \nStates. Legislation has been introduced--S. 1157--which is now pending \nbefore the Judiciary Committee. And the dairy compact would be of \nmaterial assistance to farmers generally but certainly farmers in \nPennsylvania.\n  We had many Senators supporting the dairy compact concept but have \nhad contentious battles on the Senate floor. And while the proposed \nlegislation on the dairy compact was pending, I do propose the \nlegislation to which I refer, and I send that amendment to the desk.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/07/senate-section/article/S10051-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10051-S10052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      SENATE RESOLUTIONS 335--RELATIVE TO THE DEATH OF JO-ANNE COE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE (for himself and Mr. Lott) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

She was a Fairfax County \n     resident.\n       Mrs. Coe had worked for Senator Dole for nearly 35 years, \n     first joining the staff of then-Congressman Dole in early \n     1968 as he prepared for his first Senate race. initially a \n     constituent caseworker, she rose through the ranks to become \n     office manager.\n       In late 1975, she briefly left the senator's staff to \n     accept an appointment in the Ford Administration. A few \n     months later, President Ford tapped Senator Dole to be his \n     Vice Presidential running mate and Mrs. Coe became Office \n     Manager for the Vice Presidential campaign.\n       After the campaign, she returned as Office Manager in the \n     Dole Senate office and became the staff member designated as \n     political liaison to his campaign committee under the new \n     Federal Election Campaign Act regulations.\n       When Senator Dole became Senate Majority Leader in 1985 he \n     nominated Mrs. Coe as his choice for Secretary of the Senate. \n     She was the first woman in history to be elected to this \n     post. As well as supervising the Senate's vast administrative \n     apparatus, historical and archival functions and\n\n[[Page S10053]]\n\n     Interparlimentary relations with other countries; the \n     Secretary of the Senate has numerous legislative and \n     parliamentary functions including presiding over the Senate \n     during the election of the President Pro Tempore.\n       Upon the Democrats regaining control of the senate in 1987, \n     she returned to the Dole Senate staff until joining Senator \n     Dole's 1988 Presidential campaign. Following the campaign, \n     she was named Executive Director of Campaign America, the \n     leadership PAC she had helped Senator Dole found.\n       Never one to seek the limelight for herself, she was \n     surprised at the media attention she received during the 1996 \n     campaign as the GOP Presidential nominee's confidante. \n     However, in many ways she was seen politically as Senator \n     Dole's alter ego. In a feature article during the 1996 \n     campaign, the New York Times Rick Berke called her ``Bob Dole \n     in ultra suede suit.''\n       Following the Presidential campaign, senator Dole joined \n     the Washington law firm of Verner Liipfert MacPherson and \n     Hand as Special Counsel and Mrs. Coe joined him there as his \n     chief of staff, and advised clients on legislative strategy. \n     She also managed Senator Dole's personal business interests, \n     including relationships with speakers bureau and the \n     publishers of his books, and assisted on a voluntary basis \n     with fundraising for a number of causes promoted by senator \n     Dole, including the World War II Memorial Commission, the \n     Dole Institute of Politics at the University of Kansas, and \n     the Families of Freedom Scholarship fund, co-chaired by \n     Senator Dole and Former President Clinton to assist the \n     families of 9/11 victims.\n       Born Jo-Anne Lee Johnson in Coronado, California in 1933, \n     Mrs. Coe was the daughter of Admiral Roy Lee Johnson, \n     Commander in Chief of the US Pacific Fleet during the Vietnam \n     conflict and the first commander of the USS Forrestal; and of \n     the former Margaret Louise Gross of Georgetown, now both \n     deceased. On her mother's side, she was a seventh generation \n     Washingtonian.\n       Mrs. Coe attended the College of William and Mary and spent \n     a year at Alexandria's George Washington High School during \n     one of her father's many assignments in the Washington area. \n     She was briefly married while in college to Benjamin P. Coe \n     of New York and leaves one daughter, Kathryn Lee Coe Coombs, \n     of Alexandria, Virginia.\n       She first came to Capitol Hill as an aide to Representative \n     Harold D. Cooley, a conservative Democrat and powerful \n     chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, who was credited \n     with brokering the deal whereby then-Senator John F. Kennedy \n     chose Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson as his running \n     mate.\n       In 1962-67, she left the Washington area to follow her \n     parents in her father's various assignments to senior U.S. \n     Navy posts in Nebraska, Japan and Hawaii. She worked as a \n     secretary for the U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force, returning to \n     Capitol Hill in early 1968 upon her father's retirement. She \n     interviewed for jobs among her Agriculture Committee contacts \n     on both sides of the aisle and accepted a job with then-Rep. \n     Bob Dole, whom she'd briefly met when he was a freshman \n     Congressman on the Committee in 1961.\n       A former children's church choir instructor, she was an \n     active parishioner at the church of St. Lawrence the Martyr \n     in Franconia and a donor to a variety of Catholic and other \n     charities. A month before her death, she had bought a \n     historic farmhouse in King George County, Virginia and was in \n     the midst of planning to work part time and telecommute so \n     that she could spend more time painting and pursuing other \n     hobbies.\n       In addition to her daughter she also leaves a nephew, Kevin \n     Lee Johnson of Scottsdale, Arizona and niece, Kindra Lee \n     Johnson Vincent, of Seattle; children of her late brother Roy \n     Lee Johnson, Jr. The family and friends are establishing the \n     Jo-Anne Coe Memorial Foundation to aid a variety of \n     charitable and educational causes, including establishing an \n     annual award to recognize up and coming young women on \n     Capitol Hill who exhibit the traits of honesty, integrity, \n     loyalty and humility for which Mrs. Coe was known.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the resolution and \npreamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid on the \ntable, and that any statements related to this matter be printed in the \nRecord, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Mr. President, let me thank the distinguished assistant \nDemocratic leader for his characteristic leadership and cooperation as \nwe have worked through so many of these procedural issues. I thank him \nso much for all he has done on the floor in the last few weeks.\n  We have had the debate on the resolution now for a couple of days. \nThey have been good days. I think Senators have used the time wisely \nand productively, and I think it has been very constructive and \nrespectful debate, as we hoped it would be.\n  I have indicated to Senator Lott it is my hope we can reach an \nagreement tomorrow about how we might proceed to the completion of the \ndebate. I am hopeful we might propound a unanimous consent request that \nwould accommodate the Senators who wish to offer amendments, that those \namendments be debated tomorrow, Wednesday, and Thursday, and that we \nhave a vote on final passage on Thursday night.\n  That would allow an entire week to have debate on this resolution. \nSenators will have ample time to be heard and to speak tomorrow, \nWednesday, and Thursday. We will go late into the night, if we have to, \nto accommodate Senators who wish to be heard. But I think that is \nsufficient time. So I will make such a request after further \nconsultation with colleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  I hope Senators will accommodate our desire, recognizing first that, \nas important as this is, there are other issues that still have to be \naddressed prior to the time we leave. We have to deal with the \ncontinuing resolution; we have to deal with the budget enforcement \nresolution; we have to deal with homeland security.\n  Given the fact that tomorrow will be 1 month to the day before the \nelection, that is a lot to be done in a very short period of time. So I \nurge Senators to work with us to accomplish these legislative goals and \nrecognize there are other issues as well that we hope to deal with, \nsuch as nominations, perhaps conference reports; the election reform \nconference report ought to be done. I would like to see bankruptcy \ndone.\n  In any case, we have work that cannot be done unless we are cognizant \nof the limited time available and make use of every day. Again, I \nappreciate everyone's cooperation to date. I hope we can reach that \nagreement tomorrow and we can complete our work on this resolution by \nsometime Thursday night.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/07/senate-section/article/S10054-4", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9 A.M.
