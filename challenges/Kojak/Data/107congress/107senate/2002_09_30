Mr. President, I come to the floor today regarding \nTropical Storm Isidore, which made landfall last Wednesday just south \nof New Orleans and dumped nearly 25 inches of rain in 24 hours. This \nmassive and destructive storm brought winds of 60 miles per hour to \nSoutheast Louisiana and a storm surge of up to 6 feet.\n\n[[Page S9562]]\n\n  I was able to see the flooding first-hand when I traveled to \nLouisiana on Thursday with the FEMA Director, Joe Allbaugh, to survey \nthe damage.\n  I was relieved and grateful to learn that on Friday, the President \ndeclared a Federal disaster for the area. This declaration triggered \nthe release of Federal funds to bring much-needed recovery assistance \nto the towns, communities, businesses, and citizens that suffered great \nloss. I would like to thank President Bush and FEMA Director Joe \nAllbaugh for their support of Louisiana's recovery efforts.\n  Although the final cost of Tropical Storm Isidore is still being \ndetermined, Louisianans know all too well the damage a storm on this \nparticular path can bring. Had this storm reached the level of strength \nearlier predicted, it would have been a category 3 hurricane, packing \nwinds of 130 miles per hour and a storm surge of up to 12 feet.\n  As nearly all of New Orleans area rests below sea level, a hurricane \nof that magnitude alone on the path that Tropical Storm Isidore has \ntaken would devastate southeast Louisiana.\n  In Louisiana and throughout the Gulf South, we deal with the threat \nof hurricanes every year. From all reports, this storm could have been \nmuch worse, and we are thankful it was not. But I must take this \nopportunity to bring to light what is at stake when a hurricane or \nstorm takes aim on the Louisiana coast. Not only is the safety, lives \nand property of Louisiana residents at risk the Nation's critical \nenergy infrastructure and energy supply as well as crucial conservation \nmeasures are in danger.\n  Tropical Storm Isidore should serve as a wake-up call to the Federal \nGovernment, which must do more to protect the nation's resources in \nLouisiana.\n  Because the City of New Orleans is below sea level and surrounded by \nlevees, every drop of rain that lands there must be pumped out. This \nimportant job is accomplished by local, State, and Federal agencies \nworking together to ensure that the necessary infrastructure is in \nplace and working much of this work is done by the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers. However, in the President's budget request submitted to \nCongress this year, funding for the southeast Louisiana Flood Control \nProject, (SELA), was cut by an astonishing 50 pecent.\n  The SELA flood control project is a smart investment. By investing in \nthese flood control projects, we could prevent the expenditure of \nhundreds of millions of dollars that will otherwise be spent in Federal \nflood insurance claims and other disaster assistance programs. \nFortunately, the Senate Appropriations Committee understands this \ninvestment and has approved an increase for this project, which will \nallow the construction already underway to continue. However, this is \nnot enough. I urge the administration to rethink its priorities and to \ninclude sufficient funding for the SELA project in its budget request \nfor fiscal year 2004.\n  Although protecting life and property should be reason enough to \ninvest in infrastructure in Louisiana, there is an even bigger problem \nthat faces the entire Nation when severe flooding occurs in South \nLouisiana. More than 80 percent of the Nation's offshore oil and gas is \nproduced off Louisiana's coast and 25 percent of all the Nation's \nforeign and domestic oil comes across Louisiana's shores by tanker, \nbarge or pipeline. In fact, according to the Minerals Management \nService, (MMS), of the 571 million barrels of oil produced from the \nOuter Continental Shelf in 2001, 502 million were produced offshore \nLouisiana. That translates to 88 percent of production.\n  Let me also tell you all about a very special highway in south \nLouisiana. This highway also happens to be a main artery for the \nNation's energy supply. This highway is aptly named Louisiana Highway \n1. Nearly one-fifth of the Nation's entire energy supply depends on \nLouisiana 1, and we cannot continue to leave its future to the whims of \nmother nature.\n  Louisiana Highway 1 connects Port Fourchon, Louisiana with the rest \nof the country. Why is it important? Consider these facts: 85 percent \nof the deep-water drilling rigs working in the Gulf are supported by \nPort Fourchon; the Department of Interior's Mineral Management Service \nhas identified Port Fourchon as the focal point of deep-water activity \nin the Gulf; it is estimated that Port Fourchon services approximately \n16 percent of the U.S. domestic crude oil; natural gas production and \nimported crude oil; the Gulf of Mexico has 20,000 miles of pipelines, \nwhich is the most extensive network of offshore oil and gas pipelines \nin the world; Louisiana 1 is the only road servicing Port Fourchon, and \nit spends heavy rain days underwater; Louisiana 1 is the only means of \nland access to the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, (LOOP); LOOP is the \nonly offshore oil terminal in the United States and alone is \nresponsible for 13 percent of the United States' imported crude oil. \nLOOP transports approximately one million barrels of foreign oil a day \nand approximately 300,000 barrels of domestic crude from the Gulf of \nMexico Outer Continental Shelf. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \nestimates that 60 percent of all the Louisiana offshore drilling over \nthe next 30 years will be in the service area of Port Fourchon. -In the \nevent of a hurricane, this lonely little road is the way out for tens \nof thousands of my constituents.\n  Last year, after giving a similar speech on this floor about the \ncritical importance of Louisiana 1, it was finally designated as a \nfederal ``high priority corridor.'' But Louisiana 1, like much of south \nLouisiana, is washing away, and we must act now to preserve it. You can \nsee from this picture that even without a severe hurricane, this \nhighway is in a precarious situation. Can you imagine what would happen \nif a hurricane hit us head on? It would be gone, and there would be \ngreat difficulty in servicing one-fifth of our nation's energy supply. \nI urge the administration and my Congressional colleagues to think \nabout these facts and to invest more resources in critical improvements \nto this and other highway systems in south Louisiana.\n  Year after year, revenues from the oil and gas production off the \ncoast of my State provides most of the funds for the Land and Water \nConservation Fund but receives precious little in return. Since 1968, \nand for most of the life of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, OCS \nrevenues have served as the primary source of funding. In fact, since \n1990, OCS funds have accounted for more than 90 percent of the deposits \nin the Land and Water Conservation Fund each year.\n  While approximately 80 percent of the OCS revenues collected during \nthis period came from offshore Louisiana, only 1.1 percent, $27 \nmillion, of the total Federal side Land and Water Conservation Fund \nallocated during this period actually went toward Louisiana. On the \nother hand, 23 percent, $650 million, of the funding allocated during \nthis period from the Federal side of the fund went to California, but \nonly 4 percent of the total OCS funds during this period came from \noffshore California. In addition, 11 percent, $327 million, of the \nfunding allocated during this period went toward Florida but no OCS \nrevenues come from offshore Florida. The Nation must beware. Louisiana \ncannot continue to serve as the Nation's energy and conservation \nplatform for much longer without adequate revenue sharing and \ninvestment. If we do make these investments, there could be severe \nconsequences to both the State and the Nation.\n  So, what is at stake? The wetlands in Louisiana that have vanished so \nfar represent an area the size of Rhode Island. Every 30 minutes, a \nparcel of low lying land the size of a football field disappears. If \ncurrent trends continue, this will result in the loss of nearly 40 \npercent of our Nation's coastal wetlands. Not only do these wetlands \nand barrier islands offer invaluable protection from hurricanes and \nstorms such as Isidore for more than 2 million people living in the \ncoastal zone, including the City of New Orleans, they also protect our \nNation's energy infrastructure so much of which is found in Louisiana's \ncoastal zone. Here one will find not only LOOP but also two storage \nsites for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) and Henry Hub, one of \nthe Nation's major natural gas distribution centers.\n\n  From Wednesday to Friday of last week, MMS estimated that 4.5 million \nbarrels of oil and 25 billion cubic feet of natural gas were \nunavailable for U.S. consumption because of Isidore. With over 4,000 \noil and gas platforms in the Gulf, storm events such as Isidore\n\n[[Page S9563]]\n\nthreaten 95 percent of crude oil and 60 percent of natural gas \nproduction from offshore federal lands. Louisiana's rapidly eroding \nwetlands are invaluable in absorbing the surge of storm events like \nIsidore. Without them, one can only imagine the damage a hurricane \ncould wreak on South Louisiana and the nation's energy infrastructure.\n  One-third of the commercial fish harvested in the lower 48 States \ncomes from Louisiana's coastal zone. As Louisiana's coastal wetlands \ndisappear, so will these fisheries.\n  Louisiana's wetlands are home to the Nation's largest flyway, serving \nas habitat for more than five-million birds and many endangered \nspecies. As the wetlands wash away this habitat is lost. Also, they act \nas a buffer for the number one port system in the United States that \nmoves the Nation's goods from middle America to world markets.\n  Louisiana takes pride in its role as the country's most crucial \nenergy provider. Ours is a state rich in natural resources. However, \ngiven the contribution my State makes to the Nation, it is time for the \nNation to carefully consider its deficient investment in South \nLouisiana and the Gulf Coast Region and to consider what would happen \nif, God forbid, a major hurricane travels the same path as Tropical \nStorm Isidore. The Land and Water Conservation Fund is just one example \nof a Federal revenue stream that will suffer. It is long past time for \nthe Federal Government to adequately and fairly invest in a State that \ngives so much to the rest of the country.\n  As I said a few moments ago, Tropical Storm Isidore should serve as \nour wake-up call. The examples I mentioned today, the SELA flood \ncontrol project, Louisiana Highway 1 and other highways such as \nInterstate 49, and our Nation's wetlands, are too important to ignore.\n  It is too early to tell what the final damage will be from Tropical \nStorm Isidore. However, one thing is guaranteed: it will not be the \nlast. Let us act now to invest in the infrastructure necessary to \nprotect the life and property of our citizens.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/30/senate-section/article/S9563-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9563-S9564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE SENATE AGENDA\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise to talk a little bit about what I \nthink is the future of some of the things that are being talked about \nin terms of this Senate session which probably will expire in 2 weeks, \nand the many things that we have to do prior to that time.\n  Some of the things that are being talked about seem to me to be a \nlittle contradictory from time to time. I guess my hope is that we can \ntogether, of course, based on the leadership in the Senate, set some \npriorities, make some decisions, and accomplish some of the things that \nare necessary for us to accomplish prior to the recess.\n  Clearly, we have to do something about homeland defense. I can't \nimagine anything that is more important to us than to complete this \ndiscussion and allow the President to establish what is necessary for \nhomeland defense. It is interesting. It reminds us. This morning, for \nexample, over in the Hart Senate Office Building, we were told we \ncouldn't leave our offices and no one could come in because there was a \nsuspicious package over there on the floor. It reminds us that there is \nindeed a continuing threat of terrorism which we need to do something \nabout.\n  Clearly, we have to make some decisions with regard to our position \non Iraq. Whatever that decision is, it seems to me it is terribly \nimportant that Congress join with the President, and that we make some \ndecisions which cause something to happen there. Hopefully, it will be \nsome kind of a peaceful settlement. But that isn't going to happen--and \nit hasn't happened for years--until we do something that is very \ndefinitive. We can do that.\n  We clearly have to do something about defense appropriations. I \nsuspect that we will end up--and I have no problem with that--with a \ncontinuing resolution for the rest of the appropriations, none of which \nwe have passed at this time, so they can continue at last year's level \nuntil whenever--November or February. Defense appropriations and \nmilitary construction have to be changed because the demands are higher \nfor more money, and we can't go on last year's numbers.\n  These certainly are some of the things we must do. Then we have to \nhave this continuing resolution.\n  I hope we will get back to this matter of homeland defense. The \nPresident made a recommendation, and the House passed a bill. It is \nsomething that is unusual, it is something that is different, and it is \nsomething patterned after the threats up to now. I think it has to have \nmanagement flexibility.\n  That has been one of the controversial points--organizational \nflexibility, putting together a Department made up of a number of \ndifferent departments that have had these specific responsibilities and \nbring it together so it will be coordinated.\n  Some of the things we are finding that might have been done better \nprior to September 11 will be done better in the future. We can do \nthat. We have to assign personnel responsibilities, do budget \ntransfers, and do many of these things that pretty clearly need to be \ndone.\n  I think one of the interesting things that has happened in recent \ntimes because of Iraq and terrorism discussions and home defense \ndiscussions is that on homeland defense we see an effort being made \nincreasingly to shift the division from the economy to these issues. I \nthink both of these issues are very important. But when you have \nthreats and you have terrorism, you aren't able to choose the time. \nWhen it is there, you have to do something about it.\n\n  Some of the talk, particularly in the media, I suppose comes \nbasically from here. It has been interesting. One of the columnists in \nmy home State of Wyoming--one of the few liberal columnists--has \nwritten one that I think is interesting. The first point he makes is \nthat President Bush, in his campaign, was for bringing troops home. At \nthat time, that was a reasonable thing to do. We were deployed over the \nworld and beyond where we needed to be.\n  Now he said the contradiction is that he is willing to commit \nthousands of young people overseas. Times have changed. September 11 \nchanged things. September 11 indicated to us that there is a different \nkind of threat from terrorism, and indeed a different kind of war in \nthis world than there was before. Should our position change? It seems \nto me that it should.\n  Then he goes on to talk a little bit about the fact that the \nadministration hasn't even shown the need to do this. It seems to me, \nif you go back and examine what happened in the last 10 years in Iraq, \nit is pretty clear that the agreements that were made after the 1991 \nwar have not been lived up to. And that is the basis for the kind of \nthreat we have now. It is pretty clear.\n  It is very interesting. He goes on to say we should never attack \nanyone unless we have been attacked. I wonder if he has forgotten the \n3,000 people who died in New York City. It shows the different changes \nthat have taken place. Years ago, an attack was by 17 divisions with \ntanks and landing barges. That is what you defended yourself against. \nThat is not the case now. The case is you can bring some kind of a \nsecret thing into a building in New York City and kill 3,000 people.\n  We are having some strange conversations--all of them valid. We need \nto go through it. We also hear from some of our friends on the other \nside of the aisle that we are no longer paying any attention to the \neconomy.\n  I simply say that I believe we ought to review where we have been and \nwhere we could have been--and the number of things talked about here \nthat have an impact on the economy that the leadership has not brought \nup, and has not been willing to go forward on. One of them is the \nbudget. It is the first year in 20-some years that we haven't had a \nbudget; that has something to do with an economy, of course.\n  Policy for energy: We have been moving along, but we still haven't \ngotten an energy policy. It is one of the things that most impacts both \nour economy and our safety against terrorism. We are hoping to get \nthat. There is still no movement there.\n  Terrorism insurance on buildings, for example: We have reduced the \nability of people to invest their money to help\n\n[[Page S9564]]\n\nthe economy. We haven't done anything with that.\n  Tax permanency and doing something about the estate tax so people \nwill be more willing to invest their money--they don't want to do that, \nand they haven't brought it up. We need to be sure to take those items \nout of the committees.\n\n  Limits on liability, tort reform--that has something to do with the \neconomy--we could do that. The leadership has chosen not to bring that \nup. So there are many things where there seems to be a contradiction.\n  All of us want to pass homeland security legislation. No one in this \nChamber does not want to accomplish that. And we want to make it work. \nTo do that, we need to move forward. There is no one in this body who \ndoes not want to see our economy strengthened, making life better for \neveryone in this country.\n  We have to make some decisions. We have to have some movement instead \nof being 4 weeks on the same thing and having not accomplished it.\n  Mr. President, I certainly hope we can move forward. I think all of \nus want to do that.

Mr. President, we have had a lot of discussion on this \nfloor about the economy recently. Since we are in an election period, \nwe have a lot of discussion on the campaign trail about the economy, \nwith a number of questions being raised--in raised voices--as often \nhappens during a campaign.\n  One of the questions we have heard thunder forth on this floor is: \nWho lost the surplus? Where did the Government surplus go? Those who \nask the question almost always answer it by saying: It was the Bush tax \ncut that destroyed the surplus. And it is the Bush tax cut that causes \nus now to be in deficit.\n  As I have contemplated responding to this, my mind has gone back to \nan old Peanuts cartoon. Charlie Brown and Lucy are having a \nconversation. In the first panel, Lucy is complaining about various \nproblems in her life. In the second panel, Charlie Brown says: Yes, \nLucy, life does have its ups and downs. In the third panel, Lucy makes \nher position very clear. She says: I don't want any downs. I only want \nups. And in the fourth panel, she is marching off saying: Nothing but \nups, ups, ups. And Charlie Brown responds with the time-honored \ncomment: Good grief.\n\n  There are many people who view our economy the same way Lucy does. \nThey do not want ups and downs; they just want ups: a continuum, as far \nas the eye can see, of years that are better economically than the \nyears before.\n  There was a period of time, in the 1990s, when we were in the longest \nsustained expansion of our history, where people were saying: Lucy has \nfinally got her wish. We have nothing but ups.\n  During that period, I had the opportunity to talk with Alan Greenspan \nwhen he appeared before the Banking Committee. I asked him the \nquestion--not necessarily in Lucy Van Pelt terms--but I said to him: \nHave we repealed the business cycle? As we look at the strength of the \neconomy, and all of the years that are ups, have we now reached the \npoint when the business cycle will not kick in and we will not see a \ndownturn?\n  Well, Mr. President, as you know, Alan Greenspan is one who spoke of \nthe new economy, who spoke of structural changes in the economy as a \nresult of the information age and the application of technology to our \ndecision making. But when I asked him the question with respect to the \nbusiness cycle, he smiled that wry smile of his and said: No, Senator, \nwe have not repealed the business cycle; it will still manifest itself \nin the years ahead. And it has.\n  I brought this chart to the Chamber to demonstrate when the business \ncycle started to give us a ``down.'' You can see, in the third quarter \nof 1999, we were still in a strong ``up'' mode. In the fourth quarter, \nChristmastime, it was strong. While we did not do so well in the first \nquarter of 2000, we were still in the very strong ``up'' territory.\n  But by the third quarter of 2000, all of a sudden we were down \ndramatically. We were still not in a recession, because a recession \ntechnically is when the economy is shrinking rather than growing, but \nthere was very anemic growth, indeed, of 0.6 percent in that quarter.\n  You get to the fourth quarter, Christmastime, where before you were \nup with a growth of 7.1 percent, and now you have a growth of 1.1 \npercent. It was not a recession technically, but it certainly felt like \none.\n  Before, we had been in strong territory, through the 1990s and on \ninto the first half of 2000, and suddenly we were down in this weak \nterritory in the last half of 2000.\n  In the first quarter of 2001, we slipped into red territory and \nnegative growth, minus 0.6 percent growth in the first quarter; minus \n1.6 percent growth in the second quarter; coming back out of the \nbusiness cycle, minus 0.4 percent growth in the third quarter; and \nthen, in the fourth quarter of 2001, back into positive territory \nagain.\n  In the first quarter of 2002, we have strong growth again. Then we \nare back to 1.3 percent growth. But these cross-hatched areas show what \nthe economists are predicting for the remainder of the year.\n  So we go from the stronger period of the ups that Lucy Van Pelt \nloves, then the business cycle comes again, we have a recession, and \nthen we start to come out of it again.\n  To those who say: Where did the surplus go? and, Wasn't it eaten by \nthe tax cut? I say the answer is very clear: It was eaten by the \nbusiness cycle.\n  What causes the business cycle? What causes things that have been \ngoing well for so long to suddenly go wrong? There are several reasons. \nLet me try to discuss each one of them.\n\n  The first thing that causes the business cycle is, quite frankly, bad \ndecisions--bad decisions on the part of policymakers in Government, bad \ndecisions on the part of business men and women, bad decisions on the \npart of managers.\n  One of the reasons we have seen the severity of the business cycle \ntamp down a little, so that the swings are not nearly as wide as they \nused to be in my father's business days or my grandfather's business \ndays, where we do not have anything like the panic of 1873, we do not \nhave anything like the Great Depression of the 1930s anymore, is that \nbusiness men and women have better access to information and, \ntherefore, they make fewer mistakes.\n  The classic business cycle in the manufacturing world would run like \nthis--this is oversimplified, but it illustrates the point. You open a \nfactory, and you start to produce widgets. You can see I went to \nbusiness school because in business school they always talk about \nwidgets as the generic product.\n  All right. You open a factory. You start to make widgets. Let's say \nyour widgets sell pretty well. As the sales reports come in, you, as \nthe manager of the factory, the manager of that business, say: We need \nto build more capacity. We need to make more widgets because there is \ndemand for widgets out there.\n  So you double your shift. You put on two shifts, and you are having \ntwice as many widgets come out of your factory. Pretty soon, people say \nto you: The wear and tear on our machinery is such that we need to \nbuild a new factory to meet this demand for widgets. So you invest in a \nnew factory, and you are back to one shift, but now you are producing \nsomething like three times as many widgets as you were before. And you \nare now in the ``up'' period because people who make the raw materials \nthat go into widgets are selling them to you, they are paying their \nemployees, they are buying raw materials\n\n[[Page S9565]]\n\nfrom their suppliers, and it is all running through the economy. There \nis prosperity.\n  While there is prosperity in the economy, there is prosperity in the \nGovernment, because all of the employees of all of these companies \nbeing hired to help you make more and more widgets are paying taxes on \ntheir income. They are paying taxes on the profits they make in selling \nsupplies and other material to the widget maker.\n  Then one day, someone walks into your office as the head of that \nwidget company and says: Have you noticed how many widgets we have in \nthe storeroom? Have you noticed how big our inventory of widgets has \ngotten? We have so many extra widgets that we have not shipped that we \nneed to shut the factory down until we work off the excess inventory. \nWe need to shut down at least half of our capacity until all the \nwidgets in the storeroom have been cleared out and sold.\n  You made a wrong decision to keep manufacturing widgets when the \ndemand started to fall off or level off. You didn't realize it was the \nwrong decision. It didn't feel like the wrong decision, as you expanded \ncapacity, but now the proof is in the inventory. It is piling up on the \nback lot, and it is overrunning your storehouses.\n  You have so many extra widgets, you have to say: Shut the factory \ndown; mothball the extra factory we built because we are not going to \nbe returning to that for quite a while; lay people off until we can get \nrid of all of the excess widgets we have.\n  So you go into the downside of the business cycle. You go into a \nrecession. And as you stop manufacturing widgets, you stop ordering raw \nmaterials from all your suppliers, and they stop ordering goods and \nservices from the people who supply them. And those people get laid \noff, and the Government doesn't get any taxes because none of those \nemployees is taking home a paycheck. Indeed, they are now drawing \nunemployment compensation so the Government is seeing more money go out \nat the very time less money is coming in, and the Government starts to \nrun deficits. We are in a recession and everybody gets concerned. Gloom \nand doom overhang the economy.\n  Then one day the same person who walked into your office and said, do \nyou know how many widgets we have in the storeroom, walks into your \noffice and says: Do you know how bare the storeroom is? We have sold \nall of those widgets. We have sold all the widgets that were in the \nback lot. We have sold all the widgets that were in the warehouse. We \ndon't have any widgets. There is still a demand for them out there. You \nbetter gear up the factory.\n  So you get on the phone and you call your workers back and you say: \nWe have to gear up the factory.\n  Once again, you should have done it earlier, but you made a mistake. \nYou had bad information. In the 1950s, in the 1960s, in the 1970s, you \nwere dependent on hand counts of inventory, sales figures that were \nsometimes weeks, if not months, after the fact, and it was inevitable \nthat even the best manager would make the wrong decision on the upside \nand make the wrong decision on the downside, which meant that the \nbusiness cycle was more and more extreme by virtue of bad information.\n  The main contribution of the information revolution to the business \nworld has been good information with which a manager can now say: Wait \na minute. There is a softening in widget demand. We will eliminate the \nsecond shift, but we will continue to operate both factories.\n  Instead of the wild swings that we used to have in the business \ncycle, today's swings are narrower and softer, but they are still there \nbecause, inevitably, at some point, someone will overestimate sales and \nthereby build too much capacity and then, on the other end, \nunderestimate sales and have to turn around, and you will get a \nbusiness cycle.\n\n  In historic terms, this recession, outlined on this chart, is milder \nthan any we have had. Those with memories go back to the recession that \nstarted in the early 1990s. That recession was much sharper and more \ndifficult and more painful than this one has been. If you have an even \nlonger memory, go back to the recession of the double dip in the early \n1980s when we had economic devastation that would make these kinds of \nnumbers look like paradise.\n  I remember being taught in school that 6 percent unemployment was \nfull employment, that the economy could not absorb any more than 94 \npercent of the available workers and when you got to 6 percent \nunemployment, you were at full employment. In the 1990s, we got down in \nsome parts of the country to 2 and 3 percent unemployment. There were \ntimes in my State where employers could not hang on to workers because \nthere were so many jobs. They said: Our biggest problem is trying to \nget labor.\n  Interestingly, at the height of the latest recession, at the time of \ngreatest difficulty in the job market, there was wringing of hands, \nweeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth because we hit 6 percent \nunemployment. The unemployment rate has started to go down now from 6 \npercent, after hitting that peak.\n  So in historic terms, this is a mild recession, but what comfort is \nthat to people who have lost their jobs and, more importantly, to the \nissue I started out to discuss: How about the surplus and what has \nhappened to the surplus and who lost the surplus?\n  You can anticipate my answer to that. The surplus was lost to the \nbusiness cycle. I said there were several things that cause a business \ncycle. I have given you the one that happens within the business cycle \nitself.\n  The other is that outside things come along. The oil shock that hit \nus in the 1970s helped trigger difficult times. September 11 hit us \njust as we were struggling with the economic downturn and made it \ndeeper and longer than it would otherwise have been. Outside shocks and \noutside circumstances can also trigger a business cycle.\n  So it is not just bad decisions on the part of business leaders; it \nis also outside problems. We had both of those hit at the same time. \nThe business cycle turned us down, and then September 11 hit us. We \nhave still not recovered from September 11.\n  I was speaking to a good friend in the hospitality industry. He said: \nAfter September 11, we were off 20 percent from the norm. This is an \nindustry that is bigger than the automobile industry in its total \nimpact on the economy.\n  I spoke to this leader over the weekend and said: Have you recovered \nyet?\n  He said: No, we have come back in relative terms. We are now only 10 \npercent down from the norm.\n  But in that industry, 10 percent is huge. We have seen airlines that \nare faced with bankruptcy because people are afraid to fly. They are \nfilling their planes, but they are filling their planes with cut rates \nthat can't possibly give them an adequate rate of return.\n  What happened to the surplus? What happened to the surplus is that \nthe economy got hit with business cycle problems and with outside \nshocks simultaneously and, as I was describing in the widget business, \nwhen the economy gets hit, the Government gets hit. Tax revenues go \ndown as business activities go down.\n  As these numbers remain strongly blue and go strongly blue into the \nfuture, the tax revenues will come back. They will come back by virtue \nof the strength of the economy.\n  The fundamental rule I want everyone to understand is this: Money \ndoes not come from the budget.\n  Money comes from the economy. We can pass any kind of budget we want. \nWe can make any kind of projections we want. But we will be humbled by \nthe realities of the marketplace every single time. Sometimes the \nmarketplace will produce more revenue than we budgeted for. That is \nwhat happened in the 1990s. We budgeted, hopefully, to get to a balance \nby 2002, and the economy surprised us and took us not only to balance, \nbut surplus, in 1999. We were then budgeting surpluses for as long as \nthe eye could see. The economy said: No, you are forgetting the \nbusiness cycle. That, plus the attack of the terrorists, threw us into \nthis situation, and Government revenues went down, regardless of what \nwe budgeted.\n  Let us understand, when we talk about what happened to the surplus, \nthat it was not the passage of the tax cut that caused the surplus to \ndisappear, it was not really much of anything we did here on the \nfloor--except as we reacted to the two realities that hit us \nunexpectedly. The business cycle came along and said I have not been \nrepealed, and the economy slowed down,\n\n[[Page S9566]]\n\nand then outside shocks hit us in the form of a terrorist attack that \ndevastated large segments of the economy that have still not recovered.\n  Those of us who are so sure that we control this economy, and what it \ndoes by virtue of what we pass here, need to have a little more \nhumility and a little more understanding and realize once again that \nthe most important thing the Government can do in order to maximize \nGovernment revenues is to create an economic climate in which market \nforces can produce the greatest beneficial result. But even at those \ntimes, when the atmosphere is most conducive, the business cycle is \nstill with us and will humble us if we keep thinking that, like Lucy \nVan Pelt, we can go through life with nothing but ups, ups, and ups, \nand never face the reality of the occasional down.\n  I appreciate the indulgence of my fellow Senators. I will have more \nto say on this at another time when we have a sufficient amount of \nmorning business. I recognize the time has come to return to the debate \nof the bill on the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/30/senate-section/article/S9566-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Lincoln).

Under the previous order, the hour of 2 p.m. \nhaving arrived, the Senate will now resume consideration of H.R. 5005, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5005) to establish the Department of Homeland \n     Security, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Lieberman amendment No. 4471, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n       Gramm/Miller amendment No. 4738 (to amendment No. 4471), of \n     a perfecting nature, to prevent terrorist attacks within the \n     United States.\n       Nelson (NE) amendment No. 4740 (to amendment No. 4738), to \n     modify certain personnel provisions.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There may be others on \nhis side wishing to make statements on the bill. He indicated that \nthere will be no unanimous consent requests related to this bill.\n  The leaders have announced there will be no votes today. My friend \nfrom Tennessee, I am sure, is aware of that. I look forward to his \nstatement and whoever else wants to speak on this most important \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I thank my friend from Nevada. I \nconcur in his analysis. There will be no unanimous consent request or \nadditional amendments brought up, or anything of that nature. I also \nagree with him that we should have our colleagues down here discussing \nthis bill, if they desire to do so. I encourage anyone who may be \nlistening, if they have comments on this bill, come to the floor. There \nwill be plenty of time this afternoon for us to continue to engage in \nthis discussion. It is a very important discussion.\n  I think with regard to the several points of disagreement that we \nhave, we should keep in mind the points of agreement we do have. I \nthink, for example, all concerned agree that we need to bring many of \nthese agencies that have to do with homeland security under one \numbrella and that we must do it in a much better and more efficient way \nthan we have carried out the operations of Government in many other \nrespects. So let's build on that.\n  I hope we can build on that and address the points of disagreement \nand see if we cannot come together. I am still hopeful that in the \nwaning days in which we have to address this issue, we will be able to \ncome together and agree on not only the principle I just enunciated \nwith regard to the merger, but also with regard to issues concerning \nthe President's proper authority and appropriate flexibility that is \ngoing to be needed to manage this gargantuan enterprise we are setting \nout on. It is really a major endeavor. Nothing has been done like this \nin several decades in this country, and we are going to need all hands \non deck, all the tools, all the resources, and all of the attention \nthat we can bring to bear on this problem in order to make this country \nsafer.\n\n  I think most of us realize now that we will probably never again be \nable to believe we are totally safe and that we can cover every border \nand every bolt and every automobile and every airplane, all to the \nextent that we will have a failsafe situation and that we will not need \nto constantly keep our guard up.\n  There is a lot we can do. A lot has already been done. The President \nhas taken charge and Tom Ridge in the Office of Homeland Security has \ntaken charge. They have issued Executive orders that have addressed \nmany of the burning issues that we face. I think our border situation \nis already better. Our transportation situation is better. But there is \nan awful lot to be done before we get to the point where we can say \nthat we have done all that we can do.\n  It is a very difficult proposition. I said last week that one of the \nthings that impresses me most about this body, about the Government in \ngeneral, is how difficult it is to make any really substantive change \nto anything. If there is any difficulty connected with it at all, if it \ncomes to spending money, or something like that, we can usually come \ntogether because it benefits those of us who are spending the money, \nbenefits our constituents, and we get some short-term benefit from that \nall the way around. We sometimes pay long-term consequences for it, but \nspending money seems to be an easy thing to do.\n  Here, we are actually stepping on some people's toes and we are \nacknowledging some dysfunctional aspects of our Government and we are \nsaying, let's change that. But there are a lot of vested interests out \nthere who don't want to change. They want the status quo. In the \nabstract, they want the same end result we do--we want a better \nsystem--but they don't want to change things in order to achieve a \nbetter system.\n  We have been looking, listening, watching, and absorbing for many \nyears in this Congress and in this Senate the various negative aspects \nof many of the agencies of our Government and how they are not working, \nhow they are not doing what they are supposed to be doing, how they are \nrife with waste, fraud, and abuse, and billions of dollars are being \nsent out for things--like people who are deceased, for example. We find \nthat we cannot incorporate high-tech information systems that have been \nincorporated in the private sector for years and years, to good effect. \nWe cannot seem to bring that into the Government. The IRS has wasted \nbillions and billions of dollars trying to get their computers to talk \nto each other. They are making real progress now, but for a long time \nthey did not. And there are human resources problems, human capital \nproblems.\n  We are losing people we ought to be keeping in Government, and too \noften keeping the people we ought to be losing because of old rules and \nregulations that were set up decades ago. We have seen all of this \nhappen, all of this evolve as Government got bigger and bigger and more \ncomplex, with levels and upper levels--every Deputy Assistant Secretary \nhas an assistant to the Deputy Assistant Secretary, and they have two, \nthree, and four, and it keeps growing. It makes us less efficient and \nless responsive to the people we are supposed to be serving.\n  Now, we understand it is not just money and inefficiency and lack of \nservice we have to be concerned about. We have to be concerned about \nour very safety--the No. 1 job of Government, self-protection.\n  Yet there are those who want to incorporate that system, this \nbureaucratic mess that has evolved into the new Homeland Security \nDepartment because they do not want to make any changes.\n  Unfortunately, a part of what has to be addressed. Governmentwide is \nour civil service system. No one wants to deal with that because it is \npolitically difficult, politically volatile, and you are going to be \nstepping on some people's toes. Yet there is unanimity\n\n[[Page S9567]]\n\namong Democratic and Republican experts who have looked at this problem \nand have experienced this problem.\n  In the homeland security bill, we are trying to solve a \nGovernmentwide problem. It is much too big. It is much too politically \ndifficult. There are too many entrenched interests to successfully \naddress that situation. We are trying to say, with regard to homeland \nsecurity, with the issue most important to our country: Let's have a \nlittle flexibility in these civil service rules that we have not had in \ntimes past.\n  When President Carter asked for civil service reforms in the spring \nof 1978, he said the system ``had become a bureaucratic maze which \nneglects merit, tolerates poor performance, permits abuse of legitimate \nemployee rights, and mires every personnel action in redtape, delay, \nand confusion.''\n  That was President Carter. Accordingly, Congress delivered the \nrequested reforms in the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. But a lot \nhas happened since 1978 to prove that we still have a long ways to go.\n  The Brookings Institution report of 2002 quoted earlier now says:\n\n       The civil service personnel system underwhelms at virtually \n     every task it is asked to do. It is slow at hiring, \n     interminable at firing, permissive at promoting, useless at \n     disciplining, and penurious at rewarding.\n\n  That is the Brookings Institution's analysis of our civil service \nsystem.\n  This is not news to anybody. President Carter knew about it, spoke on \nit, and the Brookings Institution and others have spoken about it. We \nheard testimony in the Governmental Affairs Committee over the years \nabout this issue. Something has to be done about it, and everybody \nwrings their hands and acknowledges it is not right that it takes 5 or \n6 months to hire somebody. It is not right that it takes 18 months to \nfire a poor performer. But that is the way it is, and that is the way \nwe have been doing business. We rock along tolerating that kind of a \nsystem because it is only Government and we really do not expect much \nout of Government anyway, do we?\n  Now we are in a different world, and we understand that what is at \nstake is not just aggravation or waiting in a longer line or putting \nsome civil service employees out who are trying to get a job or trying \nto get promotion inside a system that only let's them move lockstep or \nwaste a few billion dollars--it is not just that anymore. It is our \nvery safety and survival as a nation because, if we adopt this kind of \nsystem into the Department of Homeland Security, we will get the same \nresults as other agencies.\n  We will see not only waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement, overlap \nand duplication, but we will see the border not protected the way it \nshould be, airline safety not being what it should be, cargoes will not \nbe examined the way they should be, the information technology we need \nto tie all this together so we can keep up with the bad guys will not \nbe what it should be because we have seen it has not worked in \nany other aspect of Government.\n\n  What makes us think that just by creating this new Department under \nthe same old rules it will work any better in this new Department of \nGovernment? If anything, there will be new problems that will be \ncreated from this new Department of Government because we are talking \nabout bringing together over 170,000 Federal employees. It will require \nthe coordination of 17 different unions, 77 existing collective \nbargaining agreements, 7 different payroll systems, 80 different \npersonnel management systems--80--an overwhelming task by any stretch \nof the imagination.\n  Again, with this more complex, more difficult, and more-important-\nthan-ever task that we have on our plate now, do we really want to \nbring the old way of doing business into our Government that has \nproduced these bad results? The answer is no.\n  We have to do business a little differently. We have to give the \nPresident authority that other Presidents have had--not take away his \nauthority as the opposition to this bill would do, or diminish his \nauthority, or set up new requirements for the President to prove. It \nmeans that we have to give the people who are going to be running this \nnew Department some flexibility with regard to hiring, firing, \npromoting, rewarding, holding employees accountable--all those issues \nwe should have done Governmentwide years ago and we do not have the \npolitical will to do.\n  At long last, with regard to the Department of Homeland Security, at \nleast we ought to acknowledge that we have to look at these issues \ndifferently. We have done so with regard to several Departments. That \nis the irony. When the Transportation Security Administration came to \nus and said, We need a little additional flexibility in hiring, firing, \npromoting, rewarding, and disciplining, we gave it to them. When the \nGAO came to us and asked for the same flexibility, we gave it to them. \nWhen the IRS came to us and asked for the same flexibility, we gave it \nto them. When the FAA came to us and asked the same flexibility, we \ngave it to them. When the President comes today and asks for the same \nflexibility, we say no. At a time when it is needed the most and is \nbeing asked for by the person who needs it the most on behalf of his \nnew Department, we say no. I think it defies logic.\n  It is not as if we are taking a step back from merit system \nprinciples or that we want to engage in prohibited personnel practices \nand we are going to abrogate civil service for Federal employees. That \nis not it at all.\n  The President has made it clear that the merit system principles that \nhave been there for years will still be there. I am talking about \nprinciples such as veterans' preference; the requirement to recruit \nqualified individuals from all segments of society; select in advance \nemployees on the basis of merit after fair and open competition. We \nkeep that, of course. I am talking about treating employees and \napplicants fairly and equitably without regard to political \naffiliation, race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital \nstatus, age, or handicapping conditions; we keep those principles.\n  Provide equal pay for equal work and reward excellent performance--of \ncourse, we keep those principles; maintain the high standards of \nintegrity, conduct, concern, public interest, we keep that; manage the \nemployees efficiently and effectively, we keep that. The requirement \nthat we retain and separate employees on the basis of their performance \nand their performance alone, we keep that. Educate and train employees \nwhen it will result in individual performance, we keep that; protect \nemployees from improper political influence, we keep that; protect \nemployees against reprisal for lawful disclosure of information in \nwhistleblower situations, that is, protect people who report things \nsuch as illegal or wasteful activities, we most certainly keep that. We \nwant that. We value that as much as anyone.\n\n  All of those merit system principles we retain. We do nothing with \nregard to keeping those. Those are principles on which we all agree, \nand those who imply we are somehow, in the name of national security, \neviscerating the rights of employees, is simply not true.\n  We can maintain the rights of employees but we are not wedded to 50-\nyear-old operating principles. We can make some changes that make some \nsense in the light of current circumstances.\n  Well, they ask, what about prohibited personnel practices? In title V \nof the United States Code, as we all know, there are several prohibited \npersonnel practices in which the managers of these agencies and the \nheads of these Departments cannot engage. They say employees who have \nthe authority to take, direct others to take or approve personnel \nactions shall not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, \nnational origin, age, handicap condition, marital status, and political \naffiliation. We retain that prohibition, for sure. May not solicit or \nconsider employment recommendations based on factors other than \npersonal knowledge or jobs or related activities or characteristics, we \nkeep that; may not coerce an employee's political activity, we keep \nthat; shall not deceive or willfully obstruct a person's right to \ncompete for employment; shall not influence any person to withdraw from \ncompetition for any position or improve or injure the employment \nprospects of any other person; shall not give unauthorized preference \nor advantage to any person or improve or injure the employment \nprospects of any particular employee or applicant; shall not engage in \nnepotism; shall not retaliate against a whistleblower; shall\n\n[[Page S9568]]\n\nnot retaliate against employees or applicants who exercise their appeal \nrights; shall not discriminate based on personal conduct which is not \nadverse to on-the-job performance; shall not violate any law, rule, or \nregulation which implements or directly concerns the merit principles; \nshall not knowingly take or fail to take a personnel action if that \naction or failure to act would violate a statutory or regulatory \nveterans preference requirement.\n  All of those prohibitions stay. We retain every one of them. They are \nprinciples on which we all agree, and they are meaningful. They are \nprotections that employees should have. They are protections we insist \nthese employees retain.\n  Again, does that mean one cannot make any changes from a system that \nwas created 50 years ago, in light of current circumstances? It does \nnot. When you find somebody not doing their job, does that mean it \nshould take years to do anything about it? Does that mean it should \ntake months in order to hire someone because of rigorous steps and \ncertain pools from which you have to draw and all of that kind of \nfoolishness at a time when we are really in need of people with \ntechnology capability that we have not necessarily needed in times \npast? Of course not.\n\n  Does it mean we should not have a system whereby good performers can \njump ahead and get paid more and not have to go in a one-step process \nall the way up where people who are doing their job, people who are \ndoing an excellent job, people who are doing a mediocre job, and people \nwho are doing a terrible job are all lockstep, just same old thing?\n  That system was created 50 years ago, with 15 different pay grades, \n10 steps within each pay grade, when people would go in as a young \nperson and lockstep their way all the way up through the process and \nretire after 20 years. That is not the world we live in anymore. Young \npeople can do a lot better than that. We need to be able to pay them \nmore. We need to be able to reward them more. We need for them to be \nable to jump grades, for example. Under less than very exceptional \ncircumstances, it ought to be the rule for extraordinary performance.\n  By the same token, there needs to be accountability. These are not \ninconsistent with the merit principles I have enunciated. There is just \na little bit of common sense. It does not mean we have to have \ncollective bargaining agreements that go on for months and sometimes \nyears over such issues as whether or not the annual picnic was \nrightfully called off.\n  There is a case at an Army base in St. Louis which lasted 6 years \nover that momentous issue.\n  The administrative process is rife with cases such as disputes over \nwhether or not the smoking area should be lit. Sometimes it takes years \nin order to resolve issues that way. At a time of war, can't we bring a \nlittle common sense with regard to the Department of Homeland Security \nwhen there are such high stakes? Surely, we can. That is what the \nissues before us today on this homeland security have to do with. They \nare in regard to maintaining a rigorous status quo regime or giving the \npeople in this new Department--we will have this Department for the \nrest of our lives and probably for generations to come. There will be \nDemocrat Presidents and Republican Presidents. There will be Democrat \nand Republican Secretaries of the Department of Homeland Security. This \nis not a partisan Democratic or Republican issue; it is a commonsense \nissue.\n  Doesn't the new Secretary need to be able to break through some of \nthese old rules and procedures that have gotten us down into waste, \nfraud, abuse, inefficiency, overlap, duplication, and inability to \nfunction and have at least a shot at managing people under the 21st \ncentury rules in which we live, instead of rules of another time and \nanother era? I think so. That is what this is all about. That is all we \nare asking.\n  I mentioned the various aspects with which the manager of this new \nDepartment--whoever that unfortunate soul turns out to be--will need \nsome tools with which to manage. A good employee will welcome that with \nopen arms. In fact, I think all of this would be welcome by employees, \nthe overwhelming majority of whom are doing their job on a day-to-day \nbasis. They are the unsung heroes throughout our Government. If those \nfolks are offered an opportunity to say, look, we are going to make it \neasier for you to get hired, you are not going to have to be flailing \naround for 5 months and going through all these various steps, we are \ngoing to try to pay you more, once you get in and you do a good job, we \nare going to make it so you are rewarded commensurate with that, if you \ndo not like what is happening and you file an appeal, or your union \ndoes on behalf of you, you are going to have, let's say, two steps \ninstead of four in the appellate process, I think most employees would \noverwhelmingly embrace that tradeoff.\n  Ninety-nine percent of the employees are not afraid of bringing a \nlittle common sense to the appeals process or the ability to respond to \npoor performance. If one looks at surveys, they will quickly see the \noverwhelming number of good Government employees realize there are some \npoor performers, and nothing can be done with them. They have to be \ntransferred from Department to Department. The political appointees are \nin there for a short period of time. They are not going to spend all of \ntheir time bogged down in administrative hearings and worried about \ntrying to get rid of somebody who has been there--you know the old \nsaying, we will be there when you come and we will be there when you \ngo, and it is true. They are and they will be there. They transfer them \naround and these other employees see that. They are making the same pay \nsometimes that the good employees are making, and that is not right.\n  We do not need to put up with a situation such as that in our \nGovernment.\n  (Disturbance in the galleries.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sergeant at Arms will restore order to the \nSenate proceedings.\n  The Senator will continue.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, chapter 43 goes beyond the intent of \nmerit principles which provides employees who cannot or will not \nimprove their performance to meet required standards should be \nseparated. As a result, managers must give employees multiple \nopportunities to demonstrate their ability to perform the essential \naspects of their position at an acceptable level. Such a requirement \nundermines the managers' willingness and ability to discipline poor \nperformance and results in poor-performing employees remaining on the \njob for many months and sometimes years.\n  Section 4302(b)6 authorizes agencies to remove employees whose \nperformance is unacceptable, but only after giving that employee an \nopportunity to improve performance. It defines unacceptable performance \nas failure in any single element of an employee's standards. Another \nsection requires any such opportunity to improve must be provided \nwithin one year preceding the removal of the employee.\n  The combined impact of these provisions is poor performers are \nentitled to fail at each different element of their performance once \neach year without being subject to removal. If they are deficient in \nmore than one, they have a year to see if they can improve on that, and \nif they prove to be deficient on another, they have another year on \nthat. So the worse performing you are, the more time you have before \nanything can be done. What manager is going to spend his time going \nthrough that?\n  An OPM study conducted in the last administration estimated 3.7 \npercent of Federal civilian employees were poor performers. When \napplied to the total Federal workforce, that percentage works out to be \n64,340 employees.\n  Last year, 434 individuals were removed for poor performance, so only \n.67 percent remained removed from service last year. In other words, of \n1,000 Federal employees who did not do their job, 7 of them were let \ngo. Let's hope that of that 1,000, they are not checking the bags or \nchecking the cargos or checking the borders when you or I are there and \nour safety and our loved ones' safety is at stake. Perhaps we can \nafford that in some departments, but not in the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. That is all we are talking about.\n  The overwhelming number of good Federal employees and Federal \nperformers see this and know who they are and know they are probably \ngoing to be making the same thing, and there is nothing that can be \ndone about it.\n\n[[Page S9569]]\n\nWhat does that do to morale? What does that do to workforce morale?\n  In 1993, a police sergeant with the Department of the Treasury was \nfired for providing false statements during an investigation. This \naction was not finally sustained until 5 years later when it was \nfinally decided by the Supreme Court of the United States. During the \nintervening 5 years, there was a hearing before the MSPB, the \nadministrative judge, a decision by the MSPB, an appeal to the Federal \ncourt, and a discussion by the U.S. Supreme Court. This was all \nregarding a police sergeant who lied during the investigation.\n  An employee of the Civil Service Administration removed for \nfalsification of travel voucher claims contends the action was \nunjustified. Under chapter 707, that employee would be entitled to seek \ninvestigation and review by the Office of Special Counsel, an average \nof 4 months; hearing and decision by the regional Office of the Merit \nSystem Protection Board, average 4 months; review by the headquarters \nof the Merit Systems Protection Board, 4 months; review by the Equal \nOpportunity Commission, 36 months estimated; and review at all 3 levels \nof the Federal court system--district court, appeals court and Supreme \nCourt--6 months to several years.\n  It is not that it would be a good idea to deprive people of their \nadministrative rights. It is just a question of how many levels and how \nmany avenues and how many claims and how long should all this take with \nregard to the Department of Homeland Security.\n  Are we doing the best we can do? Clearly, we are not. It is showing \nup Governmentwide. It has to do with much more than just the rather \nnarrow issues we have been talking about in terms of the homeland \nsecurity. In June of last year, before September 11, we put out a \ndocument called Government at the Brink. This was a document I put out \nas chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee. It was subtitled \nUrgent Federal Government Management Problems Facing the Bush \nAdministration. This was as the Bush administration was coming in. We \nwere trying to inform the new administration of the situation they were \ngoing to be confronted with, as other presidents have been informed. We \ntried to summarize the problems the Federal Government was having. This \nwas not an attempt just to bash the Federal Government. It was an \nattempt to try to make it work better.\n  We would have hearing after hearing after hearing. We would bring the \nGAO in. They would give us every year the high-risk list of agencies \nthat were most subject to waste, fraud, abuse and mismanagement, \noverlap and duplication. The same agencies every year. No one ever got \noff of it. New ones kept coming on to it. We passed the RESULTS Act, \nwhich said every year: Now, you have not done very well at all. Some of \nyou have done awful. You will have to start showing your results. We \nwill have to start measuring your results.\n  We have spent years now and we are still in the middle of trying to \nmake that work, and the reports we are getting in many cases from the \nRESULTS Act show they were producing the right kind of results, but \nthey are incomprehensible themselves. So we are having trouble getting \nthrough some of the reports in order to decide whether we are getting \nany results.\n  Is Congress just laying on another requirement that will be \nunfulfilled? It is a very discouraging, long-term problem that has been \ndeveloping for many years in our Government. It is getting worse and \nnot better. My own view is that until we attach the appropriations \nprocess to these problem areas, we will probably never make any \nprogress.\n\n  In other words, if these agencies keep coming up with bad \nperformances, not only should people be held accountable, the agencies \nshould be held accountable, and it should be reflected in their funding \nfor the next year. How can you justify continuing to fund failure year \nafter year after year? That would not happen in any other aspect of \nAmerican society except the Government. Yet what happens if they get \nbad enough? Usually, we give them more money.\n  That is the situation. That is the backdrop. That is what we tried to \nsummarize in this little booklet we put out.\n  We mentioned some of the examples that the new administration was \ngoing to have to deal with in term of Government management or \nmismanagement.\n  We mentioned the big dig, Boston Central Artery, the most expensive \nFederal infrastructure project in the Nation's history. Its cost \ncontinues to rise and is now estimated at $13.6 billion, an almost 525-\npercent increase from the original $2.6 billion in cost.\n  We mentioned abusing the trust of the American Indians. The \nDepartment of the Interior does not know what happened to more than $3 \nbillion it holds in trust for American Indians. A judge overseeing this \ncase called it fiscal and governmental irresponsibility in its purest \nform.\n  We mentioned the Department of Defense financial management. There is \nwidespread agreement that the Department of Defense finances are a \nshambles. I hope they are better than when this report was written. It \nwastes billions of dollars each year, and it cannot account for much of \nwhat it spends.\n  We mentioned NASA, NASA mismanagement; the fact that it causes \nmission failures. In spectacular example after example, NASA lost \nbillions because of mismanagement at some of its biggest programs. The \ncause of the Mars Polar Lander failure, for example, was that one team \nused English measurements--feet, inches, pounds--to design and program \nthe vehicle while another used metric measurements.\n  We mentioned Medicare waste, fraud, and abuse. Medicare wastes almost \n$12 billion every year on improper payments. It misspent that $12 \nbillion last year from the fee-for-service part of Medicare alone, \nwhich was about 7 percent of the total fee-for-service budget. The \namounts wasted on improper Medicare payments would go a long way toward \nfunding a prescription drug benefit or other program enhancement.\n  We mentioned security violations at the Department of Energy. The \nDepartment of Energy does not adequately safeguard America's nuclear \nsecrets. In just one case, a party was dead for 11 months before \nDepartmental officials noticed that he still had four secret documents \nsigned out.\n  We talked about the IRS fiscal mismanagement. The IRS manages its \nfinances worse than most Americans. The agency does not even know how \nmuch it collects in Social Security and Medicare taxes. GAO found \nsignificant delays, sometimes up to 12 years, in recording payments \nmade by taxpayers.\n  We mentioned the Veterans Affairs and how they put patients' health \nat risk. The Department of Veterans Affairs IG found that the hospital \nfood services shares the loading dock with the environmental management \nservices hazardous waste containers. Dirty environmental management \nservices and red biohazard carts were located next to the area where \nfood is transported to the kitchen.\n\n  We mentioned the student financial aid program bilking taxpayers in \nthat program. Federal student aid programs are rife with fraud and \nabuse. A cottage industry of criminals advises people on how to cheat \nto get Federal Government loans and grants. In one case, scam artists \npassed off senior citizens taking crafts classes as college students \nwho qualified for Federal Pell grants.\n  Then we mentioned unemployment insurance fraud. A Las Vegas, NV, man \nillegally collected at least $230,000 in fraudulent unemployment \ninsurance benefits from four different States between September of 1996 \nand November of 1999. He set up 13 fake companies and submitted bogus \nclaims based on falsely reported wages for 36 nonexistent claimants \nusing names and Social Security numbers of dead people, then collected \nclaims by mail from California, Massachusetts, Texas, and Nevada.\n  These are just 10 examples of things we pointed out last year that \nwere going on in our Government. For the most part, from the \nGovernment's standpoint, not counting the people who are out there \nalways willing to take advantage of the Government, stealing from the \nGovernment, but for the most part this was not deliberate activity on \nbehalf of people who work for the Government. These were just things \nthat we let happen.\n  A lot of it had to do with our lack of managing these Departments, \nthe turnover that we had, the inability to keep\n\n[[Page S9570]]\n\ngood people in developing these information technology programs. That \nis part of the IRS problem. Who wants to spend their time doing that, \nat that kind of pay? So we gave them flexibility. They are using it, \nand they are making some progress now. But this is the tip of the \niceberg, and nobody pays any attention to it. We just kind of shake our \nheads, there is a newspaper story that comes out, and we go on and \nwaste billions of dollars every year in the most egregious \ncircumstances.\n  Again, I ask: Now we have been attacked. We have lost almost 3,000 \npeople in one attack. We are going to bring some of these agencies \ntogether. If we just bring some of these agencies together, what have \nwe accomplished except a bigger mess? We must do so, but we must do so \nwith some ability to reward, punish, promote, demote, and get the right \npeople in, raise some salaries, give some incentives, have some esprit \nde corps in some of these Departments, and be able to get rid of a poor \nperformer with something less than 6 years in a case before the Supreme \nCourt of the United States.\n  I mentioned earlier we have already given this kind of ability to \nmanage to several of our Departments: The FAA, GAO, GSA, IRS, several \nof our agencies. Yet when it comes to the most sensitive area of all, \nhomeland security, we are not willing to give the new Secretary that \nkind of flexibility and that kind of ability.\n  Someone might ask us: What about just giving the new Secretary for \nthe Department of Homeland Security the kind of flexibility with regard \nto its employees that Members of Congress have? What about the same \nkind of flexibility to hire, fire, promote, set salaries that Members \nof Congress have?\n  I can assure anyone listening that Members of Congress have much more \nflexibility than what is being proposed for this new Department. But \nmore on point, in keeping within the executive branch of Government, \nwhat about the flexibilities we have given these other Departments?\n  With regard to the IRS, there was a provision in there that basically \nsaid you must negotiate with the union, and if you do not, you must go \nto an impasses panel. That is what our friends, who would deny the \nSecretary this flexibility, suggest we should adopt for the Secretary. \nSo one agency, and one agency alone, is all I can tell. We required \nthem, when we gave them their flexibility--we required them to go \nthrough the administrative process that would wind up with some panel \nmaking the ultimate decision as to whether or not their actions were \njustified. We didn't do that with regard to the FAA, we didn't do it \nwith regard to the GAO, we didn't do it with regard to the \nTransportation Security Agency. I submit that what we are about now, \nwith 170,000 employees and 77 collective bargaining agreements and 80 \ndifferent personnel management systems--that flexibility is needed more \nwith regard to homeland security than any of these other agencies.\n  So we are not just comparing apples to oranges. We are comparing \npeanuts to elephants. We give these agencies this additional \nflexibility to manage with these relatively contained problems they \nhave. But when we magnify the potential problems we know are going to \ncome about with regard to the Department of Homeland Security, we don't \nwant to give that to the new Secretary. I think we must if we want it \nto work, and if we want it to work differently, and we don't want to \nincorporate and adopt and inherit so many of the problems we have seen \nthroughout Government--some of them relating to safety, some of them \nnot--and expect we can keep doing the same old things the same old way \nafter switching the boxes around and expect different results.\n  What do all these billions of dollars of waste, inefficiency, lost \nitems, and inability to balance the books that the Government cannot \ndo--in small part or as a whole cannot balance its own books--translate \nover into when you are talking about safety issues? I hope we don't \nhave to find out.\n  We are suggesting the new Secretary have some of the same things \nthese departments have--that we have already given flexibilities to \nhave--in consultation with the Office of Personnel Management. This is \na department headed by a Senate-confirmed person who is an expert in \npersonnel rules, title V, and what the Government can and cannot do--\nthe prohibitions I just read earlier, the principles I read earlier \nthat we must adhere to--in consultation with that person to come up \nwith some rules.\n  I should point out there is nothing in the Gramm-Miller substitute \nthat mandates any changes. It is simply a law that allows those whose \njob it is and whose responsibility it is to make this a safer country \nto make those changes, and then come before Congress for appropriations \nand oversight--and all of the attention and sometimes aggravation and \nall of that--it will get as it justifies the changes it has made.\n  The House of Representatives recognized this need and necessity in \npassing their homeland security bill. There were basically six areas \nwhere this bill gives the new Secretary some flexibility.\n  There are many areas where no flexibility is sought at all. In fact, \nwith regard to most of the personnel areas and flexibilities that are \ndealt with in title V, only a small percentage of them are being \nrequested by the administration as being ones they need some \nflexibility in.\n  Let us talk about what is not being suggested that there be any \nflexibility in by the administration.\n  Chapter 21, general provisions; chapter 23, merit system principles; \nchapter 29, commission reports; chapter 41, authority for employment; \nchapter 33, examination and placement; chapter 34, part-time career \nemployment opportunities; chapter 35, retention preference, restoration \nand reemployment; chapter 41, training; chapter 45, incentive awards; \nand chapter 47, personnel research programs and demonstration projects.\n  Again, I am just about halfway through here. But these are areas in \nwhich the administration says OK, we are not asking for any changes or \nfor the ability to change anything in these areas.\n  Chapter 55, pay administration; chapter 57, travel, transportation \nand subsistence; chapter 59, allowances; chapter 61, hours of work; \nchapter 63, leave; chapter 72, antidiscrimination and right to petition \nCongress; chapter 73, suitability, security and conduct; chapter 79, \nservices to employees; chapter 81, compensation for work injuries; \nchapter 83, retirement; chapter 84, Federal Employee Retirement System; \nchapter 85, unemployment compensation; chapter 87, life insurance; \nchapter 89, health insurance; chapter 90, long-term care insurance; and \nchapter 91, access to criminal history records for national security.\n\n  There are close to 30 areas here in title V where no flexibility is \nbeing asked for at all.\n  There are six areas where flexibility is being asked for: Chapter 43, \nperformance appraisal; chapter 51, classification; chapter 53, pay \nrates; chapter 71, labor-management relations; chapter 75, adverse \nactions; and chapter 77, appeals.\n  With regard to those six areas, the House says OK, we will give the \nnew Secretary some flexibility in those areas.\n  The Gramm-Miller amendment adopts those six areas.\n  The ``compromise,'' so-called, before us--the Nelson-Chafee-Breaux \namendment--would say we will give you four of those six areas. In other \nwords, you have to add two more to the 30 or so you don't touch--labor-\nmanagement and appeals. The new Secretary can do nothing with regard to \nthe entire area of labor-management or appeals.\n  Unfortunately, labor-management and appeals has to do with the \nframework system by which you resolve disputes. If you control that \nprocess, you control everything else. Everything else has to go through \nit. So this is our difficulty.\n  When the Breaux-Chafee-Nelson amendment says we may not give the \nSecretary the authority to make any changes to labor-management \nrelations or to appeals, it is simply a step too far or a step not far \nenough.\n  The President has said without this authority, the new Secretary \nwould come in with his hands tied behind his back; he could not do all \nof the momentous things that are going to have to be done in terms of \norganizing and consolidating all these personnel systems without some \nflexibility in those areas as well.\n\n[[Page S9571]]\n\n  The Nelson-Chafee-Breaux amendment also says--we were talking about \nsix--we will give you four. But with regard to those four, you have to \nenter into negotiating agreements with the union. If the union refuses \nto enter into a negotiated agreement with you, you have to go to the \nFederal Services Impasses Panel.\n  I don't think it is as much a fact that we think the Federal Services \nImpasses Panel--whatever that is--is going to come up with terrible \ndecisions; it is, again, do we really need to go through this kind of \nprocess with these kinds of decisions which other departments have the \nflexibility to go ahead and handle and take action on when we are \ndealing with homeland security, and we are dealing with the people who \nare going to be in charge of homeland security?\n\n  One of these areas has to do with classifications and pay rates and \nsystems. I would like to think we could pay people better. I would like \nto think we could promote people more easily. I would like to think we \ncould retain good people.\n  What if a union decides we are discriminating, we are taking this \ngroup of people and we want to give them more money, and we are taking \nanother group of people and we don't want to give them any more money, \nand they represent all of them? So then we go through the Federal \nServices Impasses Panel. I cannot stand here and tell you how long it \nwould take to go through this Federal Services Impasses Panel, but I \ncan assure you it would be longer than it should.\n  So basically 17 unions are representing about one-fourth of the \nworkforce of these 170,000 employees. Only 20,000 of them are in a \nunion. Forty thousand of them are represented by unions, but 20,000 of \nthem are in a union. About 25 percent of the workforce becomes the tail \nthat wags the dog.\n  That is unnecessary. That is unwise. It, again, is placing restraints \non this new Department that we have not placed on other Departments \nwith much less serious mandates than we are giving this new Department.\n  There was one case where the union objected to a number of issues \nrelating to the deployment of the National Guard to help in Customs' \nantiterrorism responsibilities. The union even demanded to bargain over \narming the National Guardsmen. And they objected to Customs employees \nhaving any responsibility for storing National Guard weapons needed to \nfight terrorism.\n  In another example, the union has challenged Customs decisions to \ntemporarily reassign inspectors to the northern border as the current \nunion contract allows. Despite the continued terrorist threat after 9/\n11, the union has insisted on a new and time-consuming process that \nwould require Customs to canvas thousands of employees nationwide for \nvolunteers.\n  I guess most of us know by now that Customs has been sued because \nthey put out a directive, pursuant to the President's direction, with \nregard to the color-coded warning system we have now: red, yellow, \norange, whatever. So Customs was implementing that, and the labor union \nsued them because they said they should have negotiated that color \nsystem before it was put out.\n  So these are the kinds of things about which we are talking. None of \nthem, in and of themselves, are the end of the world, but in case after \ncase we have become consumed with procedure and process.\n  We can have due process. We can keep people from getting run over. I \nhave spent most of my professional career trying to make sure that \npeople didn't get run over. But you can do that without tying up the \nGovernment when it is trying to protect our borders. You can do it in \nless than a lifetime.\n  The Congress cannot do it. We cannot sit here and decide the details \nof a massive personnel system, and especially all the different \npersonnel systems we are having to bring together. That is an \nadministration job. They got elected. Let them come with a system that \nhas a chance of getting the job done and working out the detail.\n  We will have oversight in this body. But I submit, we do not have the \nability to micromanage a system such as that--which brings us to the \nPresident's national security authority. We have had a lot of \ndiscussion about that because a lot of people do not understand why, \nagain, when we are creating a new Department that is going to be in \ncharge of homeland security, we would give the President less authority \nwith regard to this new Department not only than what other Presidents \nhave had but than what other Departments have had and will have. So we \nwill be taking the new Department, which needs the President's firm \nhand the most, and be providing him with less authority than other \nDepartments have.\n\n  I think that perhaps it would be good if we considered the history of \nthe President's authority in this regard. As we have been talking about \nnow for several days on the floor, the law basically is that if a \nprimary purpose of a particular agency or subdivision has to do with \ncertain categories of work, such as intelligence, counterintelligence, \ninvestigative or national security, then the President can set aside \ncollective bargaining agreements because national security is at stake \nand we simply do not have the time to go through some of this rigmarole \nI have been describing on the floor with regard to this limited number \nof areas.\n  The Nelson-Chafee-Breaux amendment would amend that and say that, No. \n1, the President has to prove this work has to do with terrorism and \nnot the broader definition of national security or he has to determine \nthat; and, No. 2, the President has to also determine that the new \npeople who are coming into the Department with regard to whom he is \nexercising this authority have had their jobs changed. In other words, \nadditional requirements are being made upon the President to make \nadditional determinations which could be challenged in court.\n  The President will have a presumption in his favor, for sure, with \nregard to the courts, but it will be a rebuttal presumption and it will \nbe a situation where the President's representative has to decide to \nwhat extent, in a litigation situation, he wants to lay out these \nsensitive matters.\n  But any way you look at it, it is not the same authority that other \nPresidents have had. We are putting up additional hurdles for this \nPresident to overcome, for some reason. We are making additional \nrequirements, additional determinations for this President to make, for \nsome reason. We are not making it easier for him to exercise his \nnational security authority because of September 11, we are making it \nmore difficult.\n  There was an Executive order that President Kennedy signed, and it \ncontained an exception for agencies and offices engaged in national \nsecurity. But the exception did not even need to be invoked by the \nPresident. It could be invoked by a head of an agency.\n  Executive Order 109-88 said:\n\n       This order shall not apply to the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, or any other \n     agency or other office, bureau, or entity within an agency \n     primarily performing intelligence, investigative, or security \n     functions if the head of the agency determines that the \n     provisions of this order cannot be applied in a manner \n     consistent with national security requirements and \n     considerations when he deems it necessary in the national \n     interest. And subject to such conditions as he may prescribe, \n     the head of any agency may suspend any provision of this \n     order with respect to any agency, installation, or activity \n     which is located outside the United States.\n\n  President Kennedy's Executive order was based on the recommendations \nof a distinguished six-member task force chaired by then-Secretary of \nLabor Arthur Goldberg. It was known as the Goldberg Commission. The \nstatement from the Goldberg Commission is the best rationale for the \nnational security exception we have found. The felt need for such an \nexemption seems to have been so widely acknowledged that no extended \nargument was even necessary. The general point has been made by many \nothers, however.\n  For example, President Franklin D Roosevelt said:\n\n       All government employees should realize that the process of \n     collective bargaining has its distinct and insurmountable \n     limitations when applied to public personnel management \n     because the obligation to serve the whole people is \n     paramount.\n\n  President Kennedy, President Roosevelt. In 1969, President Nixon \nrepealed the Kennedy order but recodified and expanded the rules of \nprocedure for labor-management relations in\n\n[[Page S9572]]\n\nFederal service. That order also contained an exemption for agencies \nand offices doing national security work and allowed the head of the \nagency to invoke the exception. Not the President, but the head of an \nagency could do it.\n  The current statute then was signed by President Carter. He concurred \nwith the language the House and Senate presented to him. But his own \nbill which he sent to Congress earlier in 1978 also contained an \nexemption for the work of national security.\n  This is a well-established need that all Presidents have seen fit to \nexercise; to the extent, evidently, that extended debate back then was \nhardly even necessary. I don't know that there has ever been extended \ndebate on the authority the President should have with regard to \nsetting aside collective bargaining agreements in situations pertaining \nto national security and these other categories until now.\n  Ironically, while the opponents of the Gramm-Miller substitute and \nthe President's preferred course of action want the status quo with \nregard to all other aspects of this bill except the organizational \npart, but the status quo with regard to the managerial part, they do \nnot want the status quo when it comes to giving the President the \nauthorities that Presidents have traditionally received.\n  The President can't accept that. He has said so. I hope it is not \npresented to him like that because we know what the fate of this bill \nwould be. That would not be good for the country. We all know that.\n  I am hopeful that in these waning days we will be able to, with \nregard to these two issues, which opponents of Gramm-Miller say are not \nvery significant but which the President says are extremely \nsignificant, which you would think would cause a basis for some \ncompromise right there, but I would hope we would be able to address \nthis issue of some flexibility that we have given other departments \nthat we must give the new Secretary on the one hand and, secondly, \nmaintaining the President's traditional position with regard to his \nnational security responsibilities having to do with collective \nbargaining agreements.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Wyden).

Mr. President, the Senator from Pennsylvania is here and he \nwishes to speak on the bill. I ask unanimous consent we return to the \nhomeland security bill and that there would be a period for debate \nonly, and the Senator be recognized for whatever period of time he \nwishes to speak, and that when the Senator from Pennsylvania finishes \nhis statement, we go back into morning business under the previous \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it is my hope that the Senate will \ncomplete action on the pending homeland security legislation, that we \nwill go to conference with the House of Representatives, and that this \nbill will be passed, signed into law by the President, before we \nadjourn because, in my judgment, the most important business the \nCongress has is to legislate is on homeland security and to do our \nutmost to prevent a recurrence of 9/11.\n  The intelligence communities have advised that there will be another \nterrorist attack. It is not a matter of whether or if, but it is a \nmatter of when. I am not prepared to accept that. I believe another \nterrorist attack can be prevented. I believe had all of the so-called \ndots been put together before September 11, 2001, that there was a good \nchance that terrorist attack could have been prevented.\n  I say that because there were very important leads which were never \ncoalesced, analyzed, or brought together. I refer to the FBI report out \nof Phoenix, in July of 2000, about a man taking flight training, had a \nbig picture of Osama bin Laden, very suspicious. That report never got \nto the upper echelons of the FBI. We had the CIA tracking two members \nof al-Qaida in Kuala Lumpur. They turned out to be hijackers, two of \nthe pilots involved in September 11. But the CIA never told the FBI or \nnever told INS, and they gained admittance to the country and were part \nof the suicide bombers.\n  Then there is the famous, or perhaps infamous, national security \nagency report on September 10 that something dire was about to happen \nthe very next day. It wasn't translated until September 12. Further, \nthe very important effort by the Minneapolis branch of the FBI to get a \nwarrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act for Zacarias \nMoussaoui, who was supposed to have been the 20th member of the \nhijackers and suicide bombers, was never pursued properly because the \nFBI used the wrong standard.\n\n  We know from the 13-page single-spaced letter written by Special \nAgent Colleen Rowley that the U.S. Attorney's office in Minneapolis was \napplying the wrong standard--a 75 to 80 percent probability--and that \nAgent Colleen Rowley thought it was a standard of more probable than \nnot, which would have been 51 percent. The appropriate legal standard, \nas defined by the Supreme Court of the United States in Gates v. \nIllinois, in an opinion by then Justice Rehnquist, was that probable \ncause is established on the totality of the circumstances based on \nsuspicion. Had the Zacarias Moussaoui matter been integrated, there was \na great deal of information available in Moussaoui's computer which was \nnot acquired. The Intelligence Committee hearings have disclosed that \nin the past two weeks. All of these dots were on the screen, and even \nmore. Had they been brought together, then there is a possibility that \n9-11 may have been prevented. At least they would have been on inquiry.\n  I believe this was a veritable blueprint. I believe we have a very \nheavy duty to see that this legislation is enacted and all of the \nintelligence agencies are brought under one umbrella. I tried to do \nthat in 1996 when I chaired the Senate Intelligence Committee. I wanted \nto bring them all under the CIA. I think it is not really critical \nunder which umbrella, but under one umbrella. Now we have the chance to \naccomplish that with homeland security.\n  We have two provisions under the Labor-Management Act that are, so \nfar, providing a controversy that has held the measure from going \nfurther. It is my suggestion these two provisions are not too far \napart. The law, as set forth in 5 United States Code 7103 says:\n\n       The President may issue an order excluding any agency or \n     subdivision thereof from coverage under this chapter [which \n     is collective bargaining] if the President determines that \n     (a) the agency or subdivision has a primary function, \n     intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or national \n     security work, and the provisions of this chapter cannot be \n     applied to that agency or subdivision in a manner consistent \n     with national security requirements and considerations.\n\n  That is the existing law which the President does not want changed, \nand there has been an effort by labor to what is called ``shore up'' \nthose provisions of collective bargaining by this language in the \nNelson-Chafee-Breaux amendment:\n\n       The President could not use his authority without showing \n     that (1) the mission and responsibilities of the agency or \n     subdivision materially change, and (2) a majority of such \n     employees within such agency or subdivision have as their \n     primary duty, intelligence, counterintelligence, or \n     investigative work directly related to terrorism \n     investigation.\n\n  Now, there was a question on my mind as to whether the language of \nthe Nelson amendment was in addition to or in substitution for the \nexisting language on collective bargaining. We had an extensive \ndiscussion among Senator Lieberman, Senator Thompson, Senator Breaux, \nmyself, and Senator Nelson was on the floor. At that time, the drafters \nof the amendment said it was not in substitution for, but in addition \nto.\n  Well, the main concern the President has expressed is he is concerned \nhis authority under the provisions relating\n\n[[Page S9573]]\n\nto national security would be taken away. But the drafters of the \namendment tell us that is not what is intended because the language is \n``in addition to'' and not ``in place of.''\n\n  If you look at the specifics of the existing language about \nintelligence, counterintelligence, investigation, and the language of \nthe amendment, the duties, primary duty, intelligence, \ncounterintelligence, or investigative work, they are not too far apart. \nI think we can reach an accommodation there.\n  The other provision that has provided the controversy is the issue of \nthe President wanting flexibility, and the provisions of the Gramm-\nMiller amendment have picked up the language of the House bill, which \nwould give the President flexibility on these six categories: \nPerformance appraisal, classification, pay rates and systems, labor-\nmanagement relations, adverse actions, and appeals. The amendment \nprovided by Senator Nelson and Senator Breaux would give the President \nfour of those six. It would give the President, No. 1, performance \nappraisal; No. 2, classification; 3, pay rates and systems; 4, adverse \nactions. But that would be subject to review by the Federal Services \nImpasses Panel, a seven-appointee panel, all of whose appointees are \nthe President's.\n  It seems to me we are very close here. I voted against cloture on the \nLieberman bill because we do not have in the bill, as it is presently \ndrafted, an adequate provision as to the directorate to have all of the \nintelligence agencies under one umbrella, and an adequate provision \ngiving the Secretary of Homeland Defense direction to coordinate all of \nthose agencies, to put all those dots on one screen, to have the best \nlikelihood of preventing another 9-11.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the amendment I have \nalready filed and have ready to propose be printed at the conclusion of \nmy statement today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am opposed to cloture of the Lieberman \nbill until I have a chance to offer that amendment. I have also voted \nagainst cloture on the Gramm-Miller bill because, again, although I \nhave had discussions with Senator Gramm, as I have had discussions with \nSenator Lieberman, we have not reached fruition. I want an opportunity \nto include this language about the intelligence directorate on the \nGramm-Miller amendment.\n  While I have not taken a position, as I said on Thursday, on whether \nI will ultimately support the Nelson-Chafee-Breaux amendment, which is \nbacked by labor, or whether I will support the Gramm-Miller amendment, \nwhich is the President's preference, it is my hope we can yet work out \nan accommodation. But I think it is much more important the Senate pass \na bill and we go to conference with the House, whichever provisions are \nincluded. I grant the provisions labor wants included are important to \nlabor, and I grant the provisions the President wants included are \nimportant to the President. But as important as all of those provisions \nare, they are not as important as getting a bill that can be \nconferenced with the House, which can be signed by the President, so we \ncan set up this Department of Homeland Security and we can have, under \none umbrella, all of the intelligence agencies. It is not that the \nSecretary is going to tell the CIA agents around the globe where to go, \nor the FBI agents where to go, or the National Security Agency what to \ndo, or the Defense Intelligence Agency, but as to the analysis, they \nshould all come under one umbrella. That really is the critical factor. \nThat is why I believe the conclusion of this bill on that issue is of \ngreater importance than any other matter in the bill and of greater \nimportance than any other matter which the Congress will consider \nduring this session. So I am prepared to vote for cloture on the Gramm-\nMiller amendment should I get the chance to offer my amendment.\n\n  I do not think, as the Senator from Texas said, that he is absolutely \nentitled to a vote on his proposal without amendment. The rules of the \nSenate provide that there can be amendments to the Gramm-Miller \nproposal, just as there can be amendments to the Lieberman bill, just \nas there can be amendments to any bill. To repeat, I have not yet taken \na position as to whether I will favor what labor seeks through the \nNelson-Chafee-Breaux proposal or what the President seeks through the \nGramm-Miller proposal, but it is of greatest importance that this \nprovision on the Directorate of Intelligence Analysis be adopted and \neverything be placed under one roof.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n   (Purpose: To give the Directorate of Intelligence the authority, \n  subject to disapproval by the President, to direct the intelligence \n    community to provide necessary intelligence-related information)\n\n       In section 132(b), add at the end the following:\n       (14) On behalf of the Secretary, subject to disapproval by \n     the President, directing the agencies described under \n     subsection (a)(1)(B) to provide intelligence information, \n     analyses of intelligence information, and such other \n     intelligence-related information as the Under Secretary for \n     Intelligence determines necessary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may \nproceed for 5 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/30/senate-section/article/S9573-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9573-S9579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REPORT ON TRIP TO AFRICA\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, during the month of August, Senator \nShelby and I made an extensive trip to Africa. In Africa, we visited \nmany countries and noted some very material changes. For example, the \nGovernment of the Sudan finally wants to have good relations with the \nUnited States and is willing to make significant concessions to the \nrebels in the south Sudan. Through the good offices of the President's \nemissary, former Senator Danforth, a treaty has been worked out which \nhas great promise if implemented and if enforced.\n  The Muslim-Islamic military has come down from the northern part of \nSudan, invaded Christian cities, killed all the men and taken the women \nand children and sold them into slavery, a practice which is really \nhard to believe in the 21st century. The peace treaty brokered by \nSenator Danforth has the promise of ending that. But as we talked to \nclerics in both Khartoum, Sudan, and in Eritrea, it will have to be \nenforced by the United States.\n  We saw in South Africa great advances since my last trip there in \n1993 when there was so much contention between the blacks and the \nwhites on apartheid. A government was formed in the 1994 elections. \nPresident Mandela has become the national hero and a great many of \nthose problems are on their way to resolution. Great progress has been \nmade.\n  We saw in Mauritius, an island off the east coast of Africa, \ntremendous progress being made on trade with a sweater factory yielding \ncompensation up to $300 a week, whereas in some countries in Africa \nthey do not earn more than $250 a year.\n  To reiterate, in accordance with my custom of reporting on my foreign \ntravel, this is a brief summary of a trip with Senator Richard Shelby, \nR-Alabama, from August 6-22 to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, South Africa, \nMauritius, Tanzania, Kenya, Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Sicily, Italy. \nWe explored the emerging trade relationship with Africa during \nimplementation of the 2000 African Growth and Opportunity Act, AGOA, \nand the 2002 Trade Promotion Authority, TPA, legislation. We also \nlooked at health issues--primarily the African HIV/AIDS crisis and \npoverty and famine that impact upon the U.S. foreign aid posture and \nthe issue of ``trade versus aid.''\n  The delegation travel began on Tuesday, August 6, 2002, stopping \novernightin Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, en route to South Africa. Brazil's \neconomy outweighs that of all other South American countries and will \nbe aided in this respect by the new TPA and a $30 billion loan \nguarantee by the World Bank. I spoke about this with U.S. Consul \nGeneral Mark Boulware. He is optimistic that the TPA will help further \nexpand the economy of Brazil now that the Brazilian currency, the real, \nis no longer pegged to the U.S. dollar. Despite open anti-American \nprotests following comments by U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill \nsuggesting widescale corruption in the Brazilian\n\n[[Page S9574]]\n\nmonetary system, our delegation was treated well and found the brief \nvisit to Brazil informative.\n  The delegation proceeded to Cape Town, South Africa, where we were \ninformed by U.S. Ambassador Cameron Hume that South Africa is a middle-\nincome, developing country with an abundant supply of resources, well-\ndeveloped financial, legal, communications, energy, and transport \nsectors, and a modern infrastructure supporting an efficient \ndistribution of goods to major urban centers throughout the region. \nPresident Thabo Mbeki has vowed to promote economic growth and foreign \ninvestment, and to reduce poverty by relaxing restrictive labor laws, \nstepping up the pace of privatization, and cutting unneeded \ngovernmental spending.\n  However, President Mbeki has been disappointing in the battle against \nHIV/AIDS. Despite estimates that one in four South Africans is HIV-\npositive, Mbeki has refused to accept the premise that HIV causes AIDS, \nand did not attend this year's World HIV/AIDS Conference in New York \nCity. Mbeki's inaction in the face of this crisis has recently been \ncriticized by former South African President Nelson Mandela.\n  The United States continues to provide large sums of money and \nresources to confront this growing epidemic. In this year's \nsupplemental appropriations bill, Senator Richard Durbin, D-Illinois, \nand I proposed that $700 billion be allocated to confront AIDS in \ncountries such as South Africa where it threatens large segments of the \npopulation. President Bush has proposed a compromised figure of $500 \nbillion. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control, CDC, has assigned five \nemployees to South Africa to work on the AIDS epidemic, and the \nNational Institutes of Health has recently contributed $11 million. \nAmbassador Hume believes that we are essentially ``force feeding'' \nSouth Africa with assistance on this issue, suggesting that South \nAfrica is still dragging its feet.\n\n  I questioned Ambassador Hume on the future of race relations in South \nAfrica. Despite the existing divide, for the time being race relations \nare comparatively good, but the great conciliator Nelson Mandela is \nslowing down at age 84 and the technocrat Mbeki lacks his personal \nstature. Nonetheless, South Africa has come a long way with the \nassistance of the United States since the U.S. Senate voted to override \nPresident Reagan's 1986 veto of legislation forbidding certain U.S. \ncorporate investments in South Africa's apartheid regime an important \nmoment in the relationship between our two countries.\n  Our delegation also conducted discussions of a classified nature with \nU.S. officials in South Africa and other countries we visited.\n  South Africa's fledgling post-apartheid government was the topic of \ndiscussion at a dinner hosted by Ambassador Hume with parliamentarians \nfrom South Africa's National Assembly and National Council of \nProvinces. Progress is being made in governance and oversight. I \ndiscussed with Johnny de Lange, the Chair of the National Assembly's \nJudicial Committee, the extent of permissible electronic surveillance \nand physical search undertaken under South African law.\n  Our next series of meetings occurred in Durban, South Africa. There \nwe met with Consul General Liam Humphreys and his staff to explore, \namong other things, post-September 11 security procedures. Durban is an \nimportant ``feeder port'' for U.S.-bound goods, and the crews that \naccompany them. As such, potentially lethal materials and individuals \ntraveling under false credentials may enter U.S. ports if authorities \nin Durban are not vigilant. It is therefore imperative that individual \nvisas--and not blanket crew visas--be issued to individuals only after \ncross-referencing U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation files for \npotentially derogatory information. It is important to continue our \noversight of FBI information sharing for this purpose and to ensure the \nproper coordination of visa and cargo manifest procedures--particularly \nas proposals take shape for our new Department of Homeland Security.\n  Durban is geographically located in the KwaZulu Natal province of \nSouth Africa, the only province in which the ANC is not in power. At a \ndinner hosted by Consul General Humphreys, Senator Shelby and I \nexchanged views with two leaders of the provincial majority Inkatha \nFreedom Party, IFP: Provincial Minister of Agriculture and \nEnvironmental Affairs and delegate to the National Council of Provinces \nNarend Singh, and Reverend Musa Zondi, a member of the National \nAssembly and the Deputy Minister of Public Works.\n  Minister Singh noted the tremendous progress of South Africa and the \nKwaZulu Natal region when compared to the rest of sub-Saharan Africa, \nwhere land reform--or more appropriately, the lack thereof--has been an \nunyielding challenge.\n  I questioned Deputy Minister Zondi about the nature of race relations \nin South Africa. Minister Zondi is optimistic about race relations, and \nnoted that relations in South Africa are far better than Saudi Arabia \nor Egypt where radical Islamic tensions place these societies on the \ncusp of ``a full-scale race war.'' Minister Zondi also noted with \naffection his friendship with the late Reverend Leon Sullivan of \nPhiladelphia, a spiritual leader who promoted employment practice \nstandards for U.S. companies doing business in South Africa. Zondi said \nthat Reverend Sullivan did a great deal to make U.S. corporations more \nsocially conscious. Minister Zondi visited Reverend Sullivan \nin Philadelphia in 1985 and believes strongly in the so-called \n``Sullivan Principles,'' the labor code promoted by Reverend Sullivan.\n\n  From Durban the delegation traveled to Mauritius to explore trade and \nother issues in advance of the Presidential visit for the AGOA \nConference in January 2003. Since independence in 1968, Mauritius has \ndeveloped from a low-income, agriculturally based economy to a middle-\nincome diversified economy with growing industrial, financial, and \ntourist sectors. Mauritius has the highest median income in sub-Saharan \nAfrica and an unusually high literacy rate. Investment in the banking \nsector alone has reached over $1 billion. Employment in Mauritius is at \nor above 95 percent, according to our dinner guest Raouf Bundhun, the \nVice President of Mauritius.\n  I asked the U.S. Ambassador to Mauritius, the Seychelles, and the \nComoros, John Price, about the need for expanded commercial \nopportunities and enhanced security in the Indian Ocean region. I heard \nconcern about the recent developments of official Seychelles passports \nreportedly being sold for $65,000 to those who wish to move freely in \nthe Indian Ocean region. I also heard concern about aggressive \nrecruitment in the Comoros by Islamic fundamentalists of young, \nimpressionable individuals for schooling in radical theology and \nmilitary training under the guise of Islamic education.\n  I also inquired about how the new TPA law and AGOA will help \nMauritius further progress economically. Ambassador Price informed us \nthat the new TPA will help entrepreneurs such as Sunil Hassamal, who \nshowed us the sweater factory that he has built from the ground up and \nwho now employs 2500 workers. On the labor front, we were assured by \nAmbassador Price that despite some recent unfavorable press coverage of \nthe treatment of Chinese laborers at one problem factory, in Mauritius \nno child labor is being employed, that overtime is being paid, that \nworking conditions are tolerable, and that a viable minimum wage is \nbeing paid along with appropriate benefits, and that a 60-hour work \nweek is respected--as required by AGOA.\n  We met with Mauritian Prime Minister Sir Anerood Jugnauth and Deputy \nPrime Minister Paul Berenger to explore trade and security issues. \nPrime Minister Jugnauth is nearing the end of his term as Prime \nMinister, and will next year pass the reins to Deputy Prime Minister \nBerenger and assume the ceremonial role of President of Mauritius.\n  I questioned Prime Minister Jugnauth and Deputy Prime Minister \nBerenger about what the U.S. should do if Saddam Hussein does not \nrespond to demands for inspections. Prime Minister Jugnauth responded \nthat the U.S. should not attack Iraq without clear provocation, for \nthis act would ``lose the respect of the world.'' Jugnauth said that \nthe U.S. must be careful that it is the U.S., and not Saddam, who will \nbe perceived as ``sympathetic.'' Berenger said that we should await a \nresolution to the Israeli-Palestinian crisis before addressing Iraq.\n\n[[Page S9575]]\n\n  I asked Minister Berenger about U.S. security interests in the \nregion. He seemed to qualify what we understood to be the official \nMauritian position on the Chagossian island of Diego Garcia by stating \nthat, in return for full sovereignty over all the other Chagossian \nislands, Mauritius would be willing to defer the issue of Diego \nGarcia--``agreeing to disagree'' over its final status while seeking to \nbuild U.S. confidence in the prospect of eventual Mauritian succession.\n  On the situation in the Mid-East, Berenger favored a new arrangement \nwithin the Palestinian Authority, PA--involving the establishment of a \npurely symbolic President of the PA such as Yasser Arafat but with all \nreal power going to a new PA Prime Minister.\n  Our delegation next traveled to Tanzania, beginning our oversight of \nregional and broader security and trade issues in the lesser-developed \ncountries of sub-Saharan Africa. At a luncheon meeting with U.S. \nAmbassador Robert Royall and the Tanzania country team, we learned that \nTanzania is one of the poorest countries in the world, with $250 per \ncapita annual income. The economy is heavily dependent upon \nagriculture, which provides 85 percent of exports, and employs 80 \npercent of the workforce. The World Bank, the International Monetary \nFund, and bilateral donors have reportedly been awaiting meaningful \nTanzanian land reform prior to investing more heavily in the country. \nUnder the government's socialist land policy, true private ownership is \nunlawful and investors can acquire merely leaseholds forfeitable at the \ngovernment's discretion.\n  I was disappointed to hear that Tanzania is not yet fully prepared to \nexport commodities to the U.S. without further local economic reform \nand development. Tanzania has the potential to follow the example of \nMauritius, a country with an 85 percent literacy rate, 95 percent \nemployment, and an entrepreneurial spirit. I suggested that a Tanzanian \ndelegation visit Mauritius and learn from its example. I also noted \nthat with the passage of TPA, Congress expects real movement in the \ndirection of ``trade rather than aid'' and I suggested to Ambassador \nRoyall that he should provide President Bush with a list of achievable \ngoals for Tanzania.\n  We also discussed the AIDS epidemic. A team of researchers from the \nCenters for Disease Control, CDC, in Atlanta, Georgia, recently \ncompleted test kit evaluation in Tanzania, and has acquired data on \nwhich AIDS tests are the best performers in statistical pools. New CDC \noffices are also being constructed in Dar es Salaam, to assist with the \ndisbursement of $7 million in U.S. aid, including $2 million dedicated \nto blood safety.\n  We also explored the economic and political issues surrounding the \ntourism industry and the problems with refugees flowing into Tanzania \nfrom war-torn countries on its long western border. Tanzania currently \nhas approximately 550,000 recent refugees--80 percent Burundian and 20 \npercent Congolese and Rwandan--and 400,000 ``old caseload'' refugees \nfrom relocations in the 1970s.\n  Ambassador Royall is working to help return these refugees as soon as \npossible in a fair manner. Ambassador Royall is also working closely \nwith USAID, the U.S. Department of the Interior, and local U.S. non-\ngovernmental organizations to assure that the system of national parks \nthat supports Tanzania's tourism industry, accounting for approximately \n60 percent of GDP, can be sustained and expanded in conjunction with \nprivate sector support. Organizations with which we met, such as the \nAfrican Wildlife Foundation, work closely with the Tanzanian national \npark system and the U.S. government. For example, USAID is providing \nassistance to the Tanzanian Park Service in maintaining roads and \nnatural habitats in two national parks to protect this segment of the \nTanzanian economy.\n  The delegation also visited the United Nations' International \nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda, ICTR, which is hosted by Tanzania and \nlocated in Arusha. At the ICTR, we were briefed by Lovemore Munlo, the \nDeputy Registrar, and Kingsley Moghalu, who serves as Special Assistant \nto the Registrar. Our visit to the ICTR coincided with the arrest by \nAngolan authorities of Augustin Bizimungu, Rwanda's former armed forces \nchief who had been indicted by the ICTR for a major role in the 1994 \nRwanda genocide. His arrest came less than a month after the U.S. \noffered up to $5 million under the Justice Department's ``Rewards for \nJustice'' program for tips leading to the arrest of eight Rwandan \ngenocide suspects, including Bizimungu. Currently, 21 individuals \nsuspected of genocide or complicity therein are on trial in the ICTR in \neight separate trials. Former Prime Minister Jean Kambanda of Rwanda \nconfessed in 2000 to war crimes and was convicted by the ICTR. He was \nsubsequently sentenced to life imprisonment. Currently, two-thirds of \nthe top leadership of the Kambanda government are on trial for genocide \nand related war crimes. For lower-ranking participants in the genocide, \nRwandan courts have prosecuted over 6,000 individuals--many of whom \nface the death penalty, which is not available at the ICTR.\n  Later, I questioned U.S. Ambassador to Kenya Johnnie Carson as to \nwhether the U.S. was late in responding to the 1994 Rwandan genocide. \nWhile conceding that we were not swift, he assured me that we acted as \nquickly as we could and that the genocide would have continued--and \nwould have been much worse--if we had not acted when we did. He \nsuggested that the French were in a much better position to intervene \nto prevent the genocide.\n  The ICTR is expected to remain in existence until 2008 or 2009, by \nwhich point the last of the appeals should have run their course. We \nwere able to observe the proceedings of the trial of Eliezer \nNiyitegeka, former Minister of Information in the interim government of \nRwanda in 1994.\n  From Tanzania, the delegation proceeded to Nairobi, Kenya for \nadditional trade and security meetings. Ambassador Carson led a country \nteam briefing focused upon political stability after nearly a quarter \ncentury of rule by current President Daniel Moi, security arrangements \nfor the war on terrorism, HIV/AIDS, and related matters. Carson's team \nnoted that Presidents Clinton and Bush and Secretaries of State \nAlbright and Powell have all been privately assured by Moi at various \npoints that he will step down after his term ends and that free \nelections will be called, likely in the period December 1, 2002 through \nMarch 31, 2003. Moi is now backing as his successor Uhuru Kenyatta, the \n41 year-old son of Kenya's independence leader, Jomo Kenyatta, and a \nleader in the majority Kenya African National Union, KANU, party. If he \ncan hold the traditional KANU coalitions together, Kenyatta is favored \nto succeed Moi.\n  Kenya is a strong security partner of the United States. For example, \nthe United States is the only country with which Kenya has entered a \n``Military Access Agreement,'' ``MAA'' allowing for U.S. military \nassets to be deployed there. Kenya appears well positioned to \nfacilitate regional and other international security issues such as our \nglobal war against international terrorism.\n  I also asked whether we are doing enough to combat the AIDS epidemic \nin Kenya. According to Carson, the hard data shows that the rate of \ninfection among adults appears to be decreasing in Kenya. The CDC is \nengaged in programs in West Kenya to find new vaccines, to provide \neducation and awareness programs, and to support 40 counseling/testing \ncenters. USAID is also active in AIDS education, prevention, and \nbehavior change. The Peace Corps also plays a role in Kenyan public \nhealth projects relating to HIV/AIDS.\n  We next met with Kenya's Foreign Minister Marsden Madoka. Minister \nMadoka said that Kenya's cabinet had yet to discuss the Kenyan reaction \nif the U.S. were to move against Saddam Hussein for regime change. \nWhile noting that the cabinet would naturally have the final say, he \ndid say, importantly, that ``chances are that Kenya would support the \nU.S. under these circumstances.'' On the issue of HIV/AIDS, I asked \nMinister Madoka how serious the problem is and what the United States \ncan do to help. Minister Madoka said that Kenya has lowered \nthe prevalence rate from 14 percent to 13 percent nationwide. There is, \nhowever, a long way to go in addressing this crisis and its collateral \neffects.\n\n  We then traveled to Sudan. Sudan has been ravaged by civil war since \n1956\n\n[[Page S9576]]\n\nwith intermittent breaks. The Sudan country team, led by Charge de \nAffairs Jeffrey Millington, contrasted the Bush policy of engaging \nSudan in light of recent reform efforts contrasted with the Clinton \nAdministration's approach to maintain sanctions because of human rights \nviolations and religious suppression. With the Bush engagement policy, \npeace talks between the government of Sudanese President Omar el-\nBashier and Sudanese Peoples Liberation Movement, SPLM, leader John \nGarange are moving forward in talks in Machakos, Kenya. Sudan is not \nonly attempting to remedy its own civil strife with the Machakos \nnegotiations, but its leadership is at least speaking in terms of \nengaging the United States in its views toward democracy, human rights, \nreligious freedom, and suppressing international terrorism.\n  On the domestic side, the government of President Bashier is \nconducting ongoing peace talks with the SPLM, which controls much of \nthe southern regions of the Sudan. Former Senator John Danforth, with \nwhom we met in Nairobi on August 18 after returning from Khartoum, \naccepted his role as Special Envoy to negotiate this conflict on \nSeptember 6, 2001, and first visited the region on November 6, 2001. \nSenator Danforth is working with a small team made up of veteran \ndiplomats including Michael Miller from the National Security Council \nEast Africa staff, Charge Millington and Deputy Assistant Secretary of \nState Charles Snyder.\n  Senator Danforth has been successful to date. On July 20, 2002, \nbreakthrough agreements were reached leading to the ``famous \nhandshake'' between Sudanese President Omar el Bashier and SPLM leader \nJohn Garange on July 27, 2002 in Kampala. The July 20 Machakos round \nproduced an agreement in principle not to apply Sharia (Islamic law) in \nthe post-reconciliation South, and would provide the people of the \nSouth the right to self-determination after 6\\1/2\\ years (including a \nreferendum on secession). Still to be determined in further Machakos \nrounds will be the precise form of government in the South for the 6\\1/\n2\\ year trial period such as judiciary, infrastructure, security, and \nthe ultimate status of the SPLM, including whether John Garange can \nkeep a standing army. Senator Danforth, in preparation for upcoming \nrounds, has skillfully tested the two sides' willingness to come \ntogether on four vital humanitarian issues: (1) continuation of a \nceasefire in the Nuba Mountain region between North and South, where \nEvangelicals working with Christian populations have been the target of \nreligious persecution; (2) a polio vaccination program; (3) prevention \nof attacks against civilians; and (4) prevention of ``raiders,'' who \nwith the encouragement of the government in Khartoum, have killed male \npopulations and enslaved their women and children. Satisfaction of the \nfour Danforth preconditions would lay the groundwork for final \nagreements in Machakos on a more permanent peace in the Sudan.\n  A key aspect of our trip involved gathering information on religious \npersecution. Persecution of religious minorities, focused particularly \non Christians in Muslim countries such as Sudan, led in 1998 to the \npassage of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, ``IRFA'', \nwhich I introduced with Representative Frank Wolf. The IRFA established \nthe Office of International Religious Freedom and the U.S. Commission \non International Religious Freedom with the mission of reviewing and \nmaking policy recommendations on religious freedom.\n  We met with Reverend Ezekiel Kondo, the Provincial Secretary of the \nProvince of the Episcopal Church of the Sudan. Reverend Kondo raised \nthe following issues: (1) the persecution of those who convert from \nIslam to Christianity, which is apparently continuing and is not \ncovered by Machakos; (2) the withholding of permits to build new \nchurches and to license existing churches, which remains a problem with \nnon-Muslim clerics; (3) the refusal to grant visas for religious \nleaders to leave the country for professional conferences and for \nreligious leaders from abroad to visit Sudan; and (4) the need for more \nprecise coverage of the Nuba Mountain region dispute within the context \nof the Machakos agreements. Reverend Kondo is skeptical that Muslim \nattempts to reach out to non-Muslims will work if the basic rights for \nnon-Muslims are not committed to in writing, implemented, monitored and \nenforced.\n\n  When I referenced this religious persecution with President Bashier's \nPeace Advisor, Dr. Ghazi Sulahaddin, and his Foreign Minister, Mustafa \nIsmail, I was told that the current Sudanese government should be given \na chance to show the international community that the acts underlying \nthe persecution have occurred during many years of civil war, and a \nprocess toward reconciliation only began in 1997. Both men assured us \nthat Sudan is on the path to religious freedom and respect for human \nrights in general. President Bashier pledged that it is ``the \nobligation of Muslims to provide religious freedom,'' and that he has \nmade this issue a priority and has commanded local officials to ``study \nthis issue closely.''\n  Dr. Sulahaddin, and Foreign Minister Ismail highlighted for us their \nviews on U.S.-Sudan relations. Sulahaddin said there is a ``huge'' \npotential for normalization and improvement of relations between our \ncountries and Sudan does not engage in terrorism because the taking of \ninnocent life is contrary to Islamic beliefs. He argued that the U.S. \nhad no basis for concluding that the Sudanese plant that was targeted \nfor missile strikes by the U.S. in 1998 actually produced nerve gas. He \nemphasized the positive aspects of the new interaction between U.S. and \nSudanese intelligence agencies, and the resulting shift toward more \nengagement and intensification of dialogue with the Bush \nadministration.\n  Foreign Minister Ismail stressed that the international community, \nparticularly the United States, should be patient with Sudan since the \nreal beginning of movement toward democracy, human rights, religious \nfreedom and other elements of a free society only began in 1997-1998 \nwith the drafting of the new Sudanese Constitution. This in combination \nwith the debilitating effects of the North-South war has caused \n``growing pains,'' according to Minister Ismail. Minister Ismail handed \nto Senator Shelby a report that provides details that Sudan has done \neverything that it can to fight terrorism.\n  President Bashier stated his appreciation for the existing \ncooperation between the U.S. and Sudan, including the special role of \nour country and Senator Danforth in brokering the Machakos talks. In \nstressing the need for the ultimate unification of Sudan following the \n6\\1/2\\ year trial period envisioned by Machakos, President Bashier drew \nan analogy between the Sudanese civil war and the U.S. Civil War. \nBashier said that if the U.S. had not remained unified the Union could \nhave ended up ``more like Canada or Mexico.''\n  On regime change in Iraq, Dr. Sulahaddin said, any attack on Iraq \nwould fragment the Arab world, and urged the U.S. to seek a unified \nstance in the United Nations among various Arab countries. President \nBashier said that he hopes that the U.S. will seek alternatives to \nmilitary action because the Iraqi people have suffered enough.\n  Our delegation next moved to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to further \nexplore trade, security and health issues. We met with the U.S. country \nteam led by Charges de Affairs Thomas Hull. Hull briefed us about the \nstate of Ethiopia in the wake of its two-year border war with Eritrea. \nThe U.S. intelligence relationship with Ethiopia has grown even \nstronger after September 11. The Ethiopians believe that the war on \nterrorism serves their own domestic security interests, as Ethiopia \nmust also contend with radical Islam as a constant threat. Other issues \nthat were discussed included potential U.S. basing in Eritrea in \npreparation to act militarily against Saddam Hussein and the impact \nsuch basing might have on Ethiopian security concerns vis-a-vis \nEritrea. Ethiopia is also concerned about cross border terrorist \nincursions into its country from Somalia.\n  We then met with Ethiopia's Prime Minister Meles Zanawi, who was \nquite articulate and spoke in depth about many subjects. He said that \nEthiopia is a close ally in the war against terrorism, but for \nEthiopian reasons. The\n\n[[Page S9577]]\n\nreasons to which he refers is the constant threat of radical Islam to \nEthiopia and its African neighbors. He referred to the war on terrorism \nas something of a godsend for Ethiopia, because it has focused the \nworld on the practices of radical Islam. Ethiopia, according to the \nPrime Minister, is at the epicenter of terrorism and a secular island \nin the sea of Islam.\n  We questioned Prime Minister Meles about the U.S. policy of regime \nchange in Iraq. He responded that Saddam should be removed in order to \nforce countries like Saudi Arabia with large Islamic populations to \nchoose whether to allow radical Islam to take hold or to fight against \nthat very radicalism. He calls this a fight for their very survival.\n  Regarding trade, Ethiopia stands to gain by the combination of the \nAGOA and the TPA, and Meles appreciates the role of the United States \nin engaging sub-Saharan Africa on trade. He said Ethiopia wants access \nto the U.S.'s trillion-dollar economy.\n  We also sought the Prime Minister's views on the Sudanese peace \nprocess and its effect upon Ethiopia. According to Meles, the Sudanese \nMuslim government has already taken anti-Islamic actions by agreeing in \nprinciple to non-application of Sharia in the South. This, according to \nMeles, will make it easier to achieve breakthroughs on other issues. \nThe Prime Minister also sees the exploitation of oil and gas reserves \nin a stable Sudan, and the willingness of the United States to engage \nthe peace process, as positive incentives for the Sudanese to move the \npeace process forward.\n  With regard to Somalia, Prime Minister Meles compared Somalia to \nAfghanistan and Yemen as a potential haven for terrorists. When I asked \nwhat the U.S. should do to address the situation, Meles noted that the \nUnited States must devote nonmilitary resources rather than attempting \nto broker a Machakos-type agreement. Somalia is not ready for a \nnegotiated agreement because there are too many actors on that stage.\n  We also discussed the HIV/AIDS crisis and human suffering in \nEthiopia. The Prime Minister linked solutions to both crises to United \nStates assistance in bolstering Ethiopian infrastructure and \ninstitutions, providing access to U.S. markets through expansion of \ntrade, and removal of Ethiopia from the cycle of reliance on foreign \naid.\n  U.S. appropriations for HIV/AIDS projects in Ethiopia have increased \nfrom $4 million to $18 million in the past two years. At this time, \nboth USAID and the CDC are active in Ethiopia. USAID focuses both on \nfamine relief, drought issues and along with the CDC, HIV/AIDS \nprevention and education efforts. CDC has also opened HIV/AIDS \ndiagnostic clinics in Addis Ababa. While the HIV/AIDS rate is 13 \npercent, consistent with Kenya prevalence percentages, actual numbers \nof those with HIV/AIDS is higher in Ethiopia as the population is \nhigher.\n  From Ethiopia we moved to neighboring Eritrea. Ethiopia's annexation \nof Eritrea as a province in 1962 started a 30-year struggle for \nindependence that ended in 1991 with Eritrean rebels defeating \ngovernmental forces. A two and a half year border war with Ethiopia \nthat erupted in 1998 ended under UN auspices on December 12, 2000. \nFinal lines of demarcation are being arbitrated.\n  According to U.S. Ambassador to Eritrea Donald McConnell, the \nrelationship between the United States and Eritrea is sweet and sour. \nAmbassador McConnell gives Eritrea an ``A+'' grade in joining with the \nUnited States in the war against terrorism. Eritrea may soon be \nassisting the United States to change the regime in Iraq by allowing \nour troops to use bases in Eritrea. Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki \nsaid in our meeting with him that there must be a change altogether in \nthe Iraqi regime if Iraqi behavior is to change.\n  In terms of promoting stability in the region, Ambassador McConnell \ntold us that Eritrea might face greater challenges from radical \nfundamentalism. President Isaias is skeptical of Sudanese intentions \nand believes that the Bashier government will continue to quietly \nencourage radical fundamentalists to further destabilize the region. \nPresident Isaias said that the Sudanese leadership is committed to \nradical Islam and are worse than bin Laden, and that they preach hatred \nunder the guise of Islam. He believes that the United States must \nremain constructively engaged in the region to prevent radical Islamic \nviews from overtaking neighboring countries or threatening their \nsecurity.\n  While in Eritrea, we continued to hear of religious persecution in \nSudan and the importance of the United States in stopping it. In \nseparate discussions with Abune Philipos Woldetensae, the Patriarch of \nthe Eritrean Orthodox Church, and Abba Menghisteab Tesfamariam, the \nBishop of the Catholic Church of Eritrea, we were told that the \nSudanese are oppressing Christians in southern Sudan. Abune Philipos \nwent so far as to say, Christian believers in Sudan will not exist if \nthe U.S. Government does not bring pressure to resolve their \npersecution by Islam. Bishop Menghisteab recounted how five of his \nfellow Catholic Bishops from Sudan have told him as recently as July \n28, 2002 of Christian women and children being sold into slavery.\n  The Sudanese Bishops also told him that President Bashier is \nattempting to Islamize the entire country by using Sharia law to \nsuppress Christians. According to both clerics, some new Eritrean \nchurches may be facing problems obtaining permits to worship. These two \nmen stay in close contact with the head of the Eritrean Muslim \ncommunity, as well as leading Protestants, which make up the \ntraditional four churches in Eritrea. The new churches not belonging to \nthis traditional group of four have been told in recent weeks that they \nmust register with the government and provide information on their \nactivities and source of funding, according to Ambassador McConnell.\n  We discussed other human rights issues such as the detention without \ncharge of two Eritrean employees of the U.S. embassy due to national \nsecurity concerns. There is just so much the U.S. can do as it relates \nto the internal affairs of a country like Eritea, and we remain hopeful \nof an acceptable resolution of the detention of the two employees.\n  The United States can help Eritrea by remaining engaged in the \nregion. Among other things, we can assist Eritrea in becoming an \nexporter of valuable products by focusing foreign aid on building their \ninfrastructure. Then Eritrea can take advantage of AGOA and TPA and \nbecome a viable U.S. trade partner and thus expand our bilateral \nrelationship.\n  Our codel then traveled to Sicily for refueling the night before \nreturning to the United States.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that copies of op-ed pieces \nwhich I have written for the Morning Call and the Harrisburg Patriot \nand the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette also be printed in the Congressional \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From The Morning, Call, Sept. 16, 2002]\n\n          Prosperity and Peace in Africa Will Help Fight AIDS\n\n                           (By Arlen Specter)\n\n       PHILADELPHIA--``I want access to America's trillion-dollar \n     economy,'' Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zanawi told Sen. \n     Richard Shelby, a Republican from Alabama, and me in our mid-\n     August fact-finding travels through Africa. If the developing \n     nations of Africa can stop the spread of HIV and AIDS and end \n     their bloody wars, the continent stands at the brink of real \n     economic development with expanded foreign aid and new U.S. \n     trade laws, which will open our markets.\n       Wherever we went--South Africa, Tanzania, Sudan, Ethiopia, \n     Mauritius, and Eritrea--we heard of the debilitating effects \n     of the AIDS epidemic. In many African countries, the U.S. \n     National Institutes of Health and Center for Disease Control \n     are providing funding and personnel to combat AIDS. President \n     Bush recently announced a new $5 billion aid package to \n     Africa to spur economic development and AIDS control. This \n     year's World HIV/AIDS Conference in New York City is \n     promoting education, testing, and treatment. Follow-up action \n     by African governments and increased foreign aid offer some \n     promise, but winning the war against AIDS will be very \n     difficult.\n       Prospects for ending civil wars are brighter. On July 20, a \n     breakthrough agreement was reached between the Sudan \n     government and the Sudanese Peoples Liberation Movement \n     (SPLM) largely due to the mediation efforts of former Sen. \n     John Danforth. Sudan's President Omar el-Bashier told us of \n     his keen interest to improve relations with the U.S. and to \n     have his country taken off the terrorist list. This has led \n     Sudan to offer unlimited, surprise visits by U.S. \n     intelligence agents to its weapons factories and laboratories \n     to assure it is not developing weapons of mass destruction, \n     and Sudan has\n\n[[Page S9578]]\n\n     also agreed to grant religious freedom to Christians who have \n     been persecuted and sold into slavery for decades by their \n     Islamic oppressors. Much more needs to be done to, but our \n     former colleague, Sen. Danforth, gave us a detailed report on \n     the reasons for his optimism.\n       In Addis Ababa and Asmara, we heard assurances from \n     Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zanawi and Eritrean President \n     Isaias Afwerki that the war over their boundary dispute had \n     been resolved. Both men, along with other regional leaders, \n     were focusing on the conference for ``Samalia \n     Reconciliation'' held in Kenya last week, sponsored by IGAD, \n     the Intergovernmental Authority for Development. Anarchy in \n     Somalia, with numerous war lords, causes regional instability \n     and breeding grounds for al Qaeda.\n       In our visit to the Rwanda War Crimes Tribunal in Arusha, \n     Tanzania, we observed a trial on charges of genocide. That \n     Tribunal established an historic precedent in 2000 by \n     convicting a head of state, former Prime Minister Jean \n     Kambanda of Rwanda.\n       Perhaps the Rwanda criminal proceedings have even been a \n     factor in ending the wars in Angola and Sierra Leone in the \n     last few years. Peace negotiations are also now promising in \n     Burundi and Congo. An optimistic note was sounded by Charles \n     B. Snyder, deputy assistant secretary of state for Africa: \n     ``I like to think peace is contagious.''\n       If answers can be found to war and AIDS, the isle of \n     Mauritius, located 1,200 miles off the east coast of South \n     Africa, is a prototype for economic prosperity. Mark Twain \n     once said upon visiting the island that ``One gets the \n     impression that God made Mauritius first, and then modeled \n     Heaven after it.'' We visited a sweater factory that was \n     started by a Mauritian in 1985 and now employs, 2,500 people \n     using the most modern equipment. Some of the piece workers \n     there earn $300 a week, a stark contrast from the $250 annual \n     earnings in Tanzania. Our Ambassador John Price and the \n     factory owner, Sunil Hassamal, expect those earnings to \n     increase as a result of the U.S. African Growth and \n     Opportunity Act passed in 2000 and the newly enacted \n     legislation on Trade Promotion Authority.\n       Perhaps the most remarkable development since my last trip \n     to South Africa in 1993 is what has happened to that country. \n     With the election victory of the African National Congress in \n     1994, apartheid has given way to a stable government where \n     blacks and whites work together and Nelson Mandela is \n     everybody's hero.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Patriot News, Sept. 1, 2002]\n\n                Christians Face Many Obstacles in Sudan\n\n                        (By Sen. Arlen Specter)\n\n       A peace agreement between the government of Sudan and the \n     Sudanese Peoples Liberation Movement offers the prospect of \n     ending slavery and the persecution of Christians in Sudan.\n       The civil war, which has raged since 1956 with only \n     intermittent lapses, has seen governmental Muslim forces \n     attack Christians in the south, kill the men and kidnap the \n     women and children who are then sold into slavery.\n       In September 2001, President Bush appointed former Sen. \n     John Danforth as his Special Envoy to broker a peace \n     agreement between the warring factions. After intense \n     negotiations, a break-through agreement was reached on July \n     20 leading to the ``famous handshake'' one week later between \n     Sudanese President Omar el Bashier and SPLM leader John \n     Garange.\n       Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., and I traveled to Sudan in \n     mid-August to discuss these issues with the parties with \n     special emphasis on what was happening on religious \n     persecution.\n       I tried to visit Sudan, but could not do so because of \n     dangers from the civil war. Instead, I visited neighboring \n     Eritrea where I met with Sudanese Christians in exile and I \n     then traveled to Addis Ababa where I discussed religious \n     persecution with Patriarch Abuna Paulos of the Ethiopian \n     Orthodox Church.\n       These meetings plus fact finding in Egypt and Saudi Arabia \n     in 1998 provided part of the bases for legislation that Rep. \n     Frank Wolf, R-Va., and I introduced that later became the \n     International Religious Freedom Act of 1998.\n       In Khartoum last month, Rev. Ezekiel Kondo, the Provincial \n     Secretary of the Episcopal Church of Sudan, advised that \n     persecution of Christians by the government of Sudan was \n     continuing, but there was hope that a peace agreement would \n     produce real change. Rev. Kondo said Christians weren't able \n     to build churches, were denied visas to attend out-of-country \n     conferences and Islam converts to Christianity faced death.\n       When we traveled to Asmara, Bishop Abba Menghisteab \n     Tesfarmariam of the Eritrean Catholic Church told us about \n     complaints of five Sudanese Catholic Bishops at a conference \n     in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania in July, that Catholics were \n     persecuted and sold into slavery by their Islam oppressors.\n       In Asmara, we also met with 97-year old Patriarch Abune \n     Philipos Woldetensae of the Orthodox Church who emphasized \n     that Christians will not be permitted to practice their \n     religion even with guarantees in the peace agreement unless \n     the U.S. makes it happen.\n       In our meetings with Sudan's top officials, Sen. Shelby and \n     I stressed the importance of carrying out the guarantees for \n     freedom of religion. President Omar el-Bashier, foreign \n     Minister Mustafa Ismail and Peace Advisor Ghazi Sulahaddin \n     all pledged to do so. When we discussed the issue with \n     Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki, he scoffed at the \n     prospects for Sudan to honor the commitment on religious \n     freedom because Islam fundamentalists are fanatic about \n     spreading their religious beliefs as part of gaining control \n     of people and countries.\n       From meeting many people in the region and especially Sen. \n     Danforth, it is my judgment that Sudan very much wants to \n     gain favor from the U.S., which is the principal reason for a \n     peace agreement with the SPLM.\n       Repeatedly, the Sudanese officials asked about being taken \n     off the terrorist list.\n       Sudan's government has made other significant concessions \n     such as giving U.S. intelligence agents unlimited access to \n     weapons factories and laboratories for surprise ``visits'' to \n     check for production of weapons of mass destruction.\n       The ``Strategic Paper on Just Peace in the Framework of \n     Comprehensive Political Settlement in Sudan'' specifies \n     ``Religious belief and cultural identity are natural \n     aspirations at the individual and group level, but cannot be \n     imposed on others by any single party.''\n       A final written agreement must spell out religious rights \n     and deal with many specific pending issues.\n       Whatever the words, only the deeds matter.\n       Ultimately, U.S. pressure will be indispensable.\n       The International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 provides \n     the mechanism to monitor and, where necessary, impose U.S. \n     sanctions to guarantee religious freedom in Sudan and \n     elsewhere.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Sept. 13, 2002]\n\n              Try the Sudan Model for Inspections in Iraq\n\n                           (By Arlen Specter)\n\n       Washington.--On a trip to Sudan in August, Sen. Richard \n     Shelby and I learned about ``visits'' to Sudan's weapons \n     factories and laboratories by U.S. intelligence agents that \n     could provide a model for U.N. inspections in Iraq.\n       Sudan's president, Omar el-Bashir, told us his country was \n     very eager to improve relations with the United States with a \n     view to ultimately getting off the terrorist list. In \n     addition to promising to stop persecuting Christians, Sudan \n     is allowing U.S. agents unlimited, unannounced visits to any \n     location--to break locks, inspect and photograph. Our agents \n     told us they are confident that Sudan is not developing \n     weapons of mass destruction at any of these installations.\n       Obviously, the situations between Iraq and Sudan are very \n     different, so many questions would have to be answered. The \n     first question is whether Saddam Hussein will ever honor his \n     commitment to the United Nations to permit such inspections.\n       Last April, Secretary General Kofi Annan told me of his \n     frustrations in dealing with Saddam's ``cat and mouse'' game. \n     First, Saddam stalls, then his people say yes with \n     qualifications, then another Iraqi official says no and \n     meanwhile Saddam is free to do what he pleases. Since the \n     United States downplays such inspections, there isn't much \n     push to get them done. While it is true that no inspection \n     regime can guard against factories or laboratories we don't \n     know about, visits on the Sudan model would go a long way.\n       Then there is the doubt about whether the Bush \n     administration really wants inspections. Inspections might \n     delay a planned attack. In any event, Bush's team doubts \n     their value. The President addressed the United Nations \n     yesterday and stated that the U.N. Security Council \n     resolutions must be adhered to by Iraq. Inspections are an \n     integral part of those resolutions, and could be patterned \n     after the inspections currently being used in Sudan. A very \n     high-level expert in the U.S. intelligence community told me \n     unrestricted, surprise inspections could provide adequate \n     information on what Iraq is doing on WMD at those locations.\n       As President Bush has escalated the rhetoric for regime \n     change, even his customary Republican allies have joined the \n     international chorus in raising questions and insisting that \n     he receive congressional authority to go to war against Iraq. \n     Former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, Republican \n     Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, Jack Kemp and even columnist \n     Robert Novak represent a strong conservative base in urging \n     caution, restraint and even no action.\n       Former Secretary of State James Baker has proposed a U.N. \n     resolution calling for the use of force to compel Saddam to \n     honor his 1991 commitments to permit inspections. That could \n     provide the basis for an international military coalition if \n     the Security Council agrees and Iraq continues to resist. If \n     the United Nations does not adopt the Baker idea, it gives \n     the United States a strong reason to unilaterally enforce \n     Iraq's inspection commitments if the United Nations won't.\n       In order to make the case for military action, President \n     Bush will have to deal with other tough issues: the cost in \n     casualties, who will replace Saddam and what will be the \n     repercussions in the region and beyond. But if Saddam \n     continues to turn away inspectors, this will raise the \n     common-sense\n\n[[Page S9579]]\n\n     conclusion that he has something to hide, like weapons of \n     mass destruction. And as the risk looms large that Saddam is \n     continuing to develop such weapons, those issues will be \n     subordinated to avoiding another Sept. 11 or worse.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

MINK\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to offer a few words in tribute to a \ndistinguished colleague and dear friend, Congresswoman Patsy Takemoto \nMink, who passed away Saturday afternoon in Honolulu, HI. I am deeply \nsaddened by the passing of my friend and colleague, Patsy Mink, and I \njoin our Congressional delegation, and the people of Hawaii and the \nNation in extending heartfelt sympathy to John and Wendy Mink, her \nhusband and daughter, Eugene Takemoto, her brother, and all of Patsy's \nextended family and her loyal staff in Washington and Hawaii.\n  I feel a tremendous sense of loss at the untimely death of \nCongresswoman Patsy Takemoto Mink. Her passing leaves a void in the \nHouse of Representatives, the Hawaii congressional delegation, and the \npolitical life of our Nation. It is difficult to put her spirit into \nwords, but those that come immediately to mind as fitting \ncharacterizations of the woman we honor today include courageous, \nforthright, tenacious, gutsy, outspoken, bold, meticulous, and \ndetermined. She was my friend, a dedicated public servant for Hawaii, a \nstrong pillar in our state's delegation, and an advocate for those in \nAmerica who feel scared, small, alone, mistreated, neglected or \nforgotten.\n  Patsy was a petite woman with a powerful voice and a peerless \nreputation as a champion for equal opportunity, civil rights, and \neducation. She was a courageous and tenacious leader whose lifetime of \npublic service made Hawaii a better place. Her leadership in health, \neducation, child welfare, and social services will endure and continue \nto benefit Hawaii's people and all Americans.\n  In the course of her life, Patsy was a pioneer, a trailblazer for \nwomen, workers, minorities, the poor, and the powerless. In the history \nof Hawaii and our Nation in the 20th century, Patsy Mink is one of the \ngiants whose vision of hope and passion for justice led Hawaii to \nstatehood and whose efforts broke down barriers and opened doors to \nopportunity for everyone, regardless of race, gender, or religion. Her \npassing silences a dynamic voice, but her many accomplishments, her \nunimpeachable integrity, and passion for justice stand as an incredible \nlegacy to a magnificent woman.\n  I commend to my colleagues and all those interested in Patsy's \nremarkable life, a biography by Esther Arinaga and Rene Ojiri included \nin a book titled Called from Within: Early Women Lawyers of Hawaii, \nedited by Mari Matsuda. I wish to recap some of her brilliant life and \ncareer for the Record.\n  Born on December 6, 1927, in Paia, Maui, Patsy was independent and \nambitious from the start. As an illustration, one family story recalls \nthat she insisted at age four on beginning school a year early. She was \ndriven throughout her young life, and was elected student body \npresident at Maui High School. She graduated as valedictorian in 1944, \na year marked by global strife and war.\n  Patsy's childhood curiosity about medicine led her to study zoology \nand chemistry at the University of Hawaii. After graduating in 1948, \nshe applied to medical school, only to be rejected along with other \nbright young women aspiring to be doctors, in a time when women made up \nonly 2 to 3 percent of an entering class. Another factor daunting her \nefforts was the return of our war veterans and a resulting boom in \napplications for graduate and postgraduate programs. Although \ndiscouraged, Patsy took wise counsel from a mentor and applied to law \nschools. She gained admission to the University of Chicago. It was \nduring her years of law studies that she would meet and marry John \nMink, a respected hydrologist and geologist, her loyal campaign \nadvisor, and her lifelong companion. It was in Chicago that they would \nhave their daughter, Wendy, a professor at Smith College.\n  Returning to Hawaii, Patsy gained admission to the Hawaii bar in \n1953, but only after a successful challenge of a statute that required \na woman to take the residency status of her husband, who was a native \nPennsylvanian. Such an action represented only one of several \nchallenges to sexism that she would undertake during her professional \ncareer. In being admitted to the bar, she also logged one of many \nfirsts by becoming the first Japanese American woman to do so in \nHawaii.\n  In the 1950s, Patsy began to take a serious interest in politics and \nmake her mark on the Democratic Party by helping to build the party and \ndraw many young people into its ranks. Patsy's first step into public \nelected office in the territorial legislature in 1956 awoke for Hawaii \nand the world a powerful voice that would only gain strength in its \nimpact and not be silenced until the new millennium. From that moment \nforward, Patsy's professional and political record would run as if by \nperpetual motion.\n  The momentous year of 1959 brought Statehood for Hawaii, and by then, \nPatsy had easily won election to the territorial Senate. Leading up to \nStatehood, while the legislature worked on landmark issues that would \nlend shape to Hawaii's new society, Patsy authored an ``equal pay for \nequal work'' law and scrutinized the Department of Education toward \nimproving education for Hawaii's children--a cause close to my heart, \nas one who previously served as a teacher and principal in Hawaii's \nschools.\n  In 1965, Patsy brought her views to the national stage when she \nbecame the first woman of color elected to the United States House of \nRepresentatives to represent Hawaii's 2nd Congressional District--a \nseat I was proud to hold for almost 14 years, before I entered the \nSenate. Patsy was articulate about the causes she tenaciously \nshepherded. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's fireside chats, heard \nyears ago on Maui by a young Patsy, had provided her with a foundation \nof ideals and rhetoric from which she would draw upon for many years in \nher political career.\n  During her first tenure in Congress, Patsy served her various \nconstituencies, both in Hawaii and around this Nation, with a strong \ncommitment to wide-ranging domestic issues, including education, the \nenvironment, child care, open Government, workers' rights, and equal \nopportunity. She introduced the first Early Childhood Education Act, \nauthored the Women's Education Equity Act, supported strip mining \nregulation, and became an early critic of the Vietnam War. In 1971, she \nentered the Oregon Democratic Presidential primary. Her candidacy \nreflected her determined independence and frustration with Government \ncutbacks in social services spending and the ongoing war.\n  In 1971, in connection with planned underground nuclear tests at \nAmchitka Island in the Aleutian chain, she filed suit with 32 other \nMembers of Congress to compel disclosure of reports under the Freedom \nof Information Act, FOIA. She took issue with alleged Presidential \nauthority to exempt certain information from FOIA and withhold it from \njudicial or legislative review. In the final outcome, in what had been \ndescribed by Patsy as a sort of Waterloo of the Freedom of Information \nAct, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that Congress could legislate new \ndisclosure guidelines to permit judicial review of the President's \nactions. In the end, the case gained tremendous historical significance \nwhen the U.S. Supreme Court cited it as precedent for the release of \nthe Watergate tapes.\n  In perhaps her farthest-reaching accomplishment, Patsy co-authored \ntitle IX of the Higher Education Act Amendments, which prohibits gender \ndiscrimination by educational institutions receiving Federal funds. The \nlandmark provision was enacted in 1972 and has since, in its 30 years \nof existence, introduced equality in college sports and contributed \ngreatly to the rise in women's athletics.\n  An unsuccessful Senate bid ended her first set of years in Federal \noffice in 1977, but it did not quiet her political\n\n[[Page S9580]]\n\ninvolvement or public service. Indeed, in 1990 she returned to the \nHouse. In the interim, she assumed the position of Assistant Secretary \nof State for Ocean and International, Environmental, and Scientific \nAffairs, where she helped to strengthen environmental policies, \nparticularly with regard to protection of whales, toxic chemical \ndisposal and ocean mining. In 1980, she took the helm as the first \nwoman president of the Americans for Democratic Action. Two years \nlater, she returned to elected office in Hawaii by taking the gavel as \nchairperson of the Honolulu City Council. She twice ran unsuccessfully \nfor other office, this time for Governor and mayor of Honolulu, then \ntriumphed in 1990 in a special election for the remainder of my term in \nthe other body, at the passing of our beloved colleague, Spark \nMatsunaga.\n  Since 1990, she continued in characteristic style, advocating and \narticulating the ideals that she had espoused during her first terms in \nthe other body. I remember Patsy marching up the Capitol steps with \nvigor, alongside her other female colleagues, to show her support for \nAnita Hill in 1991. I was pleased to work with Patsy, the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Hawaii, Senator Dan Inouye, the honorable Secretary \nof Transportation, Norm Mineta, and my other colleagues in the \nestablishment of a Congressional caucus to address the needs of Asian \nAmericans and Pacific Islanders in 1994.\n  I recall her leadership in 1996 on a successful boycott of a joint \nsession speech by French President Jacques Chirac, in protest of French \nnuclear testing in the Pacific, much in line with our shared commitment \nto championing the disenfranchised peoples of the Pacific in our \nrespective bodies. As we hope to complete action on a welfare \nreauthorization bill in this session, I remember Patsy's steadfast \nefforts before the passage of the 1996 welfare reform law in keeping us \nmindful about the possible effects of social policy changes on \nchildren. She had continued the battle cry with the current welfare \nreauthorization and ensured that the voices of the smallest and most \nvulnerable were heard.\n  Patsy was one of the last Members of the 107th Congress who served in \nthe historic 89th Congress that passed much of the landmark Great \nSociety legislation. Patsy's lifelong efforts to open educational \naccess to countless Americans and ensure them the best educational \nopportunities were the achievements that brought her the greatest \nsatisfaction. ``Anything for the children,'' was Patsy's guiding \nconviction. I believe we shared the same view about education that this \ncrucial area is where we can do the most good for the most people.\n  A great spirit has come and gone before us. Patsy's vigor and courage \nto tackle difficult issues in the wide realm of social policy will be \nsorely missed. There are fewer trails for women and minorities to \nblaze, thanks to Patsy's determination and spirit. Indeed, her \ntrailblazing efforts will not end with her death, for the things she \nput into place will continue to benefit the lives of countless \nindividuals, in our lifetime and for generations to come, in ways that \nmay not ever be truly appreciated.\n  We are enjoined to carry forth the mission that my dear colleague \npursued during her remarkable career. With great sadness, we bid a \nfinal farewell and aloha pumehana to a fearless and remarkable lady, \nthe most honorable Patsy Takemoto Mink.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have been hearing in recent days that, \nonce again, the President is on the campaign trail across the country. \nSometimes he does two, three, four, and five fundraisers a day. At most \nof these fundraisers, the President criticizes the Senate for not \npassing the homeland security bill exactly the way he would like it. I \nthought I might make a couple of comments about that.\n  First, we in the Senate are in the process of debating the homeland \nsecurity bill. I hope the President will ultimately be willing to \ncompromise with us on some key issues. I believe we will pass a \nhomeland security bill, and I believe it will be soon if we get some \nwillingness to compromise on the part of the White House. We will also, \nat the President's request, take up a resolution dealing with the \nquestion of Iraq and the use of force and the United Nations.\n  It is our intention on the majority side to have a good, aggressive \ndebate on these issues, but at the same time work with the President \nand accommodate the President as much as possible.\n  But I want to make a few points that I think are important. Foremost \namong these is that I don't think it is appropriate for the President \nto be going around the country, doing multiple fundraisers every day \nand suggesting that the Senate or some Members of the Senate do not \nseem to care about national security. I think that is terribly \ninappropriate.\n  It is not inappropriate at all for the President to campaign. He \ncertainly will and should do that, but I don't think he ought to use \nthese campaign opportunities to do what he has been doing. I understand \nhe has raised something like $130 million. He is a prodigious \nfundraiser, and he has every right to do that. But it is unfortunate \nthat a President who has spoken of a desire to change the tone of \npolitical discourse in Washington, DC, is rushing around the country \ndoing fundraisers and pointing the finger at the Democrats in the \nSenate, saying they don't care about the security of this country.\n  The fact of the matter is that Democrats proposed the creation of a \nDepartment of Homeland Security just one month after the terrorist \nattacks on September 11 of last year. Lest we forget, Senator \nLieberman--the prime sponsor--introduced in the Senate a bill to create \na homeland security Cabinet agency exactly 30 days after the September \n11 attacks.\n  The President opposed it. The White House opposed it. They said they \ndidn't want it. They objected. Month after month after month, the White \nHouse opposed the creation of a Cabinet level agency dealing with \nHomeland Security.\n  In fact, when the legislation was marked up in the full committee \nchaired by Senator Lieberman, the Republicans largely voted against it \nin the full committee because the White House opposed it, the President \nopposed it, the President didn't want it.\n  And then on June 6, a full 9 months after the September 11 attacks, \nthe President did a 180 degree reversal and said: Now we want a new \nDepartment. And, by the way, we not only want this new Department, but \nwe want the following provisions to apply to the 170,000 workers of the \nnew Department, and we are not willing to compromise. We demand that it \nbe done the way we intend it to be done. That was the message from the \nWhite House.\n  First, for 9 months they didn't want an agency. Now they not only \nwant an agency, but they say we must have it their way and will not \ncompromise. And then, in the middle of the Senate debate, the President \ngoes on the campaign trail, and suggests that Democrats don't care \nabout national security. That is nonsense.\n\n  The President said he wants to come to town to change the tone. There \nis precious little evidence of that in recent weeks, I would say. But I \ndo think it is time to change the tone.\n  The right thing for the President and the Congress to do is to work \ntogether to reach a fair compromise and to find a way to do this in a \nthoughtful way. Changing the tone means you sit down together and try \nto get the best of what both sides have to offer. That is all we ask at \nthis point.\n  We have been on this legislation for some 4 weeks. There is no reason \nwe\n\n[[Page S9581]]\n\ncannot have thoughtful and satisfactory compromises so we can pass a \nDepartment, a Cabinet level agency on homeland security, through this \nSenate, go to conference, and get a bill to the Senate he can sign. \nThere is no reason we cannot do that and do that soon.\n  I believe that is the goal of Senator Lieberman. I know it is the \ngoal of Senator Daschle. I just visited with him. We want this to \nhappen.\n  I said the other day that I would never, ever, under any set of \ncircumstances, question whether anyone in this Chamber supports this \ncountry's national security. Everyone does--liberal, conservative, \nRepublican, Democrat; we all strongly support the security of the \nUnited States. We may come at it from different angles or different \napproaches and have different ideas, but I believe everyone really has \nthe best interests of this country at heart. I believe that of the \nPresident as well.\n  I think it is now time for the President to sit down with us and \nreach agreements and reach some compromises and get this piece of \nlegislation moving. And I think it is time, long past the time, for the \nPresident to stop going out on the fundraising trail and using this \nissue in a divisive and inappropriate way.\n  We need to get this right. This debate isn't about politics. This is \nabout effectively protecting the interests of this country. And we are \nall in this together.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I thank my friend from North Dakota for what he said. It has gotten \nfrustrating in the last couple of weeks, and all the more so because we \nagree on 90 to 95 percent of what ought to be in legislation creating a \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  The senior Senator from Texas, who is the lead advocate for the \nadministration, for the White House, for the President, and for \nhimself, has said the substitute he offered to the bipartisan bill that \ncame out of our Governmental Affairs Committee is 95 percent the same \nas the Governmental Affairs Committee bill. We have a 5 to 10 percent \ndifference, mostly focused on this question of how you protect and \nreassure Federal workers who are moved from other Departments to this \nnew Department while not undercutting the President's authority over \nnational security. Surely we can find a way to bridge that gap on a \nbipartisan basis. As my friend from North Dakota knows, Senator Chafee \nis taking a lead role in creating a bipartisan alternative to the parts \nof our committee bill that dealt with this question. And I accepted \nthat compromise even though it wasn't the one our committee first \nadopted and I proposed, because I thought it was a way to break the \nlogjam and allow us to create and enact into law that 95 percent which \nwe all agree on. But the White House has remained unyielding.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a question, \nis it not the case last week after several weeks where we had this \nimpasse with the White House on this issue--the bipartisan proposal \nthat tries to be the centrist proposal--it was once again blocked? The \nWhite House said, No, we are not interested in doing that either. It is \neither our way or no way. If it is not our way, we intend to go to \nfundraiser after fundraiser and criticize.\n\n  I have great respect for the President. I have supported him on many \nthings. Especially in a political season with all of this discussion \nexisting in this country about changing the tone, I am just not very \nhappy seeing three to five fundraisers a day and using the opportunity \nto say, By the way, the Senate can't get this bill done. What is the \nbill? The bill is to create a Cabinet-level Department of Homeland \nSecurity proposition which the White House opposed for 9 straight \nmonths.\n  In fact, the ranking Member--I say to the Senator from Connecticut--\nvoted against the proposal, and then, 2 weeks later, found out he was \nin favor of the proposal. He used a whimsical quote about being in \nfavor of something which he voted against because the White House \npivoted and said, No, we support it, but based on the notion of what we \nbelieve must happen. And, if that is not satisfactory to the Congress, \nwe are going to go criticize the Congress rather than reach a \ncompromise.\n  Once again, I would like to see a change in tone, but I haven't seen \nit, at least in recent weeks.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. In response to my friend from North Dakota, he is \nabsolutely right on a few of the points involved. Words have \nconsequences, both in our personal lives and in our public lives. When \nyou take the good-faith dispute we have had here about this single \nquestion of Federal employees' rights to be transferred to the new \nDepartment and suggest people in the Senate are putting those concerns \nahead of national security by which you are questioning their motives, \nand even their patriotism, to some extent, it has consequences. It has \nconsequences because we naturally feel we have been treated unfairly. \nIt is unfortunate; it has consequences beyond this bill. It began to \nhave consequences last week on questions related to a resolution that \nwould authorize the President to take military action in Iraq, if \nnecessary.\n  I think what my friend from North Dakota has said is very important \nto remember here. We have tried and have not always succeeded. But when \nwe come to questions of national security, foreign and defense policy, \nas we always say, partisanship ends at the Nation's borders. We are in \na new world post-September 11, 2001, where national security is within \nour borders. The questions of national security are within our borders. \nWe should strive for the same absence of partisanship and debate this \nas we do internationally. That is why we have all got to lower our \nvoices a bit and try to focus on the very narrow area of difference we \nhave so we can get this job done to protect the security of the \nAmerican people.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is right. The truth is, Senator Arlen \nSpecter, our Republican colleague from Pennsylvania, and I and others \nintroduced a bill to create a Department of Homeland Security in \nOctober of last year. The administration had what I always respected as \na good-faith difference of opinion. They didn't feel it was necessary. \nThey felt the Office of Homeland Security the President created by \nExecutive Order could do the job. I always felt, and Senator Specter \nfelt, we needed a Department with a strong Secretary with budgetary \nauthority and line authority over people serving under them. That \ndispute went on for 8 months until the President endorsed the idea on \nJune 6. I never would have thought to say or allege, because the \nPresident and we had this dispute about how best to protect homeland \nsecurity, somehow the President was putting that bureaucratic or \nideological vision--whatever you call it--ahead of his commitment to \nnational security. Obviously, that would have been unfair, just as \nI think some of the statements the President has made in the last week \nare unfair.\n\n  It is Monday, and it is a new week. Hope springs eternal. I hope we \ncan sit and reason together with the biblical ideal--the prophet's \nvision--in our minds.\n  There is a danger lurking out there. The terrorists are still out \nthere. They hide in the shadows. But they are at work planning to \nstrike us again. Shame on us if we don't get together and create a \nDepartment that can prevent them from doing that. Let us do it this \nweek. We can break this logjam. It is that simple.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I listened with interest while my two \nfriends discussed this issue. I may as a footnote point out they really \nare my two friends. My mother used to say you could always tell how \nmuch a Senator hated another one by how many ``distinguished'' and \n``great friend'' adjectives he used. But, in this case, it is genuine.\n  I think the Senator from North Dakota has raised a legitimate issue \nabout the tone. I would like to do what I can to change the tone of \nthis debate.\n  As I see it, speaking solely for myself as maybe the last Member of \nthe committee, the fight here is about the President's ability--or, \nmore appropriately, the new Secretary's ability--to manage the \nDepartment efficiently and effectively.\n  I do not see the history quite the same way in terms of the dispute,\n\n[[Page S9582]]\n\nShould we have a Department or should we not have a Department in the \nmonths leading up to the President's request.\n  I believe that within the administration there was always an \nassumption that a Department, at some point, made sense, but the \nadministration was not willing to identify a specific set of \nrecommendations as to how that Department would be formed until the \nPresident made his statement.\n  So I do not think it was a matter of resisting, resisting, resisting, \nand suddenly changing his mind. I think it was: We are going to keep \nour options open. We will not endorse anything. Therefore, we will not \nendorse the Lieberman bill until we have decided what it is we want.\n  I think the Senator from Connecticut has been more than generous in \nhis willingness to grant good faith to the administration on that \nissue. I think that is correct on both sides.\n  Now, as I understand the issue, listening to members of the \nadministration, as we meet in our meetings, and listening to the debate \nboth in committee and on the floor, there is no desire, at least \nsubstantively within the true policymakers of the administration, to \nturn this into a partisan fight. I will grant there are those who are \nwilling to grab for any partisan advantage they can find. I would \nsuggest that people who have that inclination exist on both sides of \nthe aisle, populate both parties, and, indeed, may even be found in the \nGreen Party or some other party that likes to pose as being above \nsearching for a partisan advantage.\n  But I believe the problem in this circumstance stems from the high \nstakes that are involved in making sure the Department is done right. I \nhave addressed this on the floor before, and the Senator from \nConnecticut has heard me address it in committee. The challenge of \nputting together a Department such as this is so overwhelming, and the \npossibilities that it will go wrong if it is not properly constructed \nin the first instance are so great, that things that might have been \nresolved on a more normal legislative question become sticking points \non this one.\n  I have said on the Senate floor before that I was involved in the \ncreation of the Department of Transportation, which has some \nsimilarities to this. Because we took the Coast Guard out of the \nTreasury Department--I say ``we''; it was done in the Johnson \nadministration. I was in the Nixon administration that inherited this \nshortly after it was created but while the problems still existed.\n  They took the Coast Guard out of the Treasury Department. They took \nthe Highway Administration out of the Commerce Department. They took \nthe FAA from its status as an independent agency. They took the Urban \nMass Transit Administration out of the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment. And they took several other agencies of smaller stature, \npasted them together into a single Department, and discovered major \nmanagement challenges.\n  Whenever I address this issue in front of a group of business \nexecutives who say, Why can't we put this together very quickly, I \nalways ask them the question, Have any of you ever been engaged in a \nmajor corporate merger? And when they nod their heads, I say, Do any of \nyou have any thoughts that this will be easy?\n  It is at least twice as large as the challenge creating the \nDepartment of Transportation. This is not the same thing as creating \nthe Department of Education, which simply took the Office of Education \nand slapped the ``Department'' label on it. It still had the same \nculture, the same work rules, the same procedures.\n\n  It is not the same thing as taking the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, which was simply taking an existing office, slapping a new \nlabel on it, and saying, OK, we are now going to take veterans and \nelevate them to Cabinet status. In this case, it is putting together so \nmany disparate agencies, many of which have been functioning in an \natmosphere where homeland security is a part, but almost an unimportant \npart, of their main mission, but because of where they are, they need \nto be pasted together in this new Department and have a major change.\n  As I listen to the White House individuals talk to us on the \nRepublican side--as we talk about this, they say: This is not really a \nmatter of union versus nonunion; this is a matter of the power of the \nPresident and, through the President, his delegate, the Secretary, to \norganize the Department in the most efficient way. And we are afraid--I \nam speaking now for the administration, which is maybe presumptuous on \nmy part, but as I hear what they say, it is: We are afraid that if it \ncomes in the form we are talking about here, we will end up with a \nDepartment that is unmanageable, and the President will have to go \nthrough so many hoops, laid out in departments that are not focused on \nhomeland security, that it will be impossible for the new Secretary to \nfunction.\n  I ask all of my colleagues this rhetorical question--I have asked the \nSenator from Connecticut this question, and he has answered yes--but I \nask all of the Senators this rhetorical question: Would you be willing \nto accept appointment as the new Secretary of this Department in the \nform in which it is being proposed to us under the Breaux-Chafee-Nelson \namendment?\n  I have some management experience. I have been in the executive \nbranch in a Cabinet-level Department. I could not honestly answer that \nquestion yes for myself because I watched as the first Republican \nSecretary of Transportation, John Volpe, wrestled with all of the \nproblems of moving people around the Department. The Congress gave him, \na high degree of management flexibility. He could move people around \nwithout asking congressional approval for a certain period of time. I \nshould probably research the exact period. My memory is that it was 3 \nyears after the creation of the Department. He could move people, \nalmost capriciously, for 3 years.\n  Secretary Boyd, who was the first Secretary of Transportation, did it \nfor 18 months. I know Secretary Volpe did it until the time came. It \nwas absolutely essential for me, in the office I organized for the \nSecretary, to have that kind of flexibility. I was moving people \naround, violating what had been their traditional kinds of protections, \nsimply because the whole thing would not function if we did not have \nthat kind of flexibility.\n  The Congress put a time limit on it because they wanted to make sure \nthat the Secretary would not abuse that power. I remember how concerned \nSecretary Volpe was that the clock was running, and he had to get the \nreorganization done before midnight struck and suddenly everything \nwould be frozen again.\n  We were talking about a Department dealing with entirely domestic \nissues, having no national security implications, in a situation where \nthere was no external pressure, such as a potential attack. And it took \n3 years or more before that Department came together and functioned.\n  As I have reminded Senators before, an even larger example of this \nkind of organization, which is the closest parallel we have to creating \nthe Department of Homeland Security, was the reorganization of the \nDepartment of Defense that came after the Second World War. That was in \n1947.\n  The Department of Defense probably did not fully function until the \nGoldwater-Nichols Act of Congress stepped in, what, 15 years later? \nCertainly more than a decade later. And it is instructive to remember \nthat the first Secretary of Defense, faced with all of these \nchallenges, committed suicide.\n  There are those who say, well, there were other problems in his life. \nAnd I am sure that is true. I will not attribute his ultimate \ndepression and decision to end his life to the difficulties of managing \nthe Department of Defense, but it certainly can be said that those \ndifficulties did not help.\n  So if the President were to call me and say: Bob, you have had \nexperience at Transportation; you have been in the executive branch; \nyou have been an appropriator; you have a unique background; I want you \nto be the Secretary of Homeland Security and serve the country; I would \nhave to say to him: Mr. President, not under the terms of this bill. My \nability as the CEO would be hamstrung.\n\n  The Senator from Connecticut is exactly right. Through his good \nefforts and his willingness to be open, which is his hallmark and his \ntrademark as a Member of this body, he has worked with the White House \nin crafting something that is agreeable to both sides 95\n\n[[Page S9583]]\n\npercent, maybe even more than 95 percent. There is no point in putting \na firm number on it because the two are now tremendously close.\n  The remaining issue is the kind of issue that would cause me to turn \ndown service in this position. May I hasten to say, I am not running \nfor the position, lest anybody have any mistakes about this. I enjoy \nthe Senate too much.\n  As I have tried to look at it as objectively as possible, I have \ndecided that the President's statement that he would veto this bill is \na correct one. It is not rooted in a desire to embarrass the Senate or \nimpugn the integrity or the ability of the Senator from Connecticut or \nhis committee on which I serve. It is rooted in a firm belief that the \nmanagement procedures of this Department, as structured in this bill \nand as they would remain structured under the proposed amendment, would \nprevent the next Secretary, whomever he or she may be, from having \nabsolutely essential authority to organize the Department.\n  I have said this before--I will say it again; no one has taken me up \non it--I would be willing to put a time limit on the kind of \nflexibility I think we need. If indeed there are those who are nervous \nthat some future President, even if they give this one every benefit of \nthe doubt, those who are nervous that some future President might abuse \nthis power, I would say: Let's give the President the power he wants on \nmanagement flexibility and put a time limit on it and say his ability \nto move people around would expire after 5 years, I would think would \nbe more logical, if he had the experience of something like 3 at the \nDepartment of Transportation.\n  On the issue of his ability to designate people for national \nsecurity, the President probably does not want a time limit on that. He \nprobably believes that every President should be preserved in the \nrights they have had. That one might be negotiated as well.\n  But as I understand it, these are the two challenges: First, the \nflexibility factor which, frankly, we have not been talking about on \nthe Senate floor because we have been so hung up on other ones. That \nwould be the one that would give me the most pause if I were the \npotential Secretary. I would be willing to see if we couldn't work that \none out with a time limit. And then the second issue, the right of the \nPresident to make a national security decision, maybe we could find a \nway around that one, too, in terms of some sort of time circumstance. I \ndon't think just because it was done with Jimmy Carter means that it \nhas to remain sacrosanct forever. We can look at it in view of the \nthreat, get some experience under our belt as to how the new Department \nworks, and say that Congress will relook at this at X particular point.\n  My bottom line, speaking solely for myself and not for the \nadministration--because I am not authorized to do that--is that I hope \nwe can, in fact, reach out in the spirit the Senator from Connecticut \nhas always shown, find some solution, but recognize that it is not a \npolitical fight to determine who is protecting unions and who is the \nmost patriotic. It is a serious, legitimate, important management \nchallenge as to how much power this President and future Presidents, \nthe newly appointed Secretary and future Secretaries, are going to have \nto manage the Department in the most efficient possible way to preserve \nour homeland against attacks.\n\n  The reality is that the attacks will come. The reality is that some \nof them will get through. No matter how well the Department is manned, \nno matter how well the Department is structured, no matter how vigilant \nthe employees of the Department will be--and I will stipulate, I expect \nthat all of them will be vigilant, whether they are union members or \nnonunion members or don't care--an attack will make it through somehow, \nsomewhere.\n  And then we want to look back on it and say: We did the very best we \ncould to see to it that the Secretary had all of the tools he or she \nmight need. And, yes, this attack got through, but these didn't because \nwe put the Department together intelligently in the first place.\n  I will be happy to enter into whatever discussion the Senator from \nConnecticut may want to have, knowing that I don't speak for the \nadministration, but I speak as a member of his committee from the other \nside of the aisle who has always had the highest respect for his \nwillingness to listen, his willingness to cooperate, acknowledge that \nhe has helped me on some of the issues I believe strongly about to his \nown political peril because there are some Members on his side who did \nnot want to do some of the things I wanted to do. I would hope in the \nsame spirit that he has mentioned here that something can be worked \nout.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Utah. I return \nhis respect and trust quite directly. I appreciate what he said. I \nappreciate the tone in which the Senator from Utah spoke, and just to \nget the nonsense of last week behind us, that we can obviously disagree \non issues related to this bill or other bills without questioning, \nwithout impugning each other's motives or, Lord knows, questioning each \nother's patriotism.\n  I agree, when we create this Department of Homeland Security--and we \nwill create a Department of Homeland Security; we are going to find a \nway to do it before long, I hope--it is going to be a massive \nundertaking: 170,000 employees, clearly the largest reorganization of \nthe Federal Government since the end of the 1940s, the post-Second \nWorld War reorganization of our national security and foreign policy \napparatus.\n  As the Senator from Utah said, this is not just putting a new name on \nthe door, ``Department.'' This is taking a lot of different people from \na lot of different places in our Government and bringing them together \nunder a strong Secretary in focused divisions within that Department. \nThose are exactly the parts that are in common between the proposal \nfrom our committee and the White House proposal.\n  Why are we doing it? Simply because the current state of \ndisorganization is dangerous. When you have three, four, or five \ndifferent Federal Government agencies at a point of entry into the \ncountry at the border and they are each in separate offices--they may \nbump into each other, but they are not really working together in a \ncoordinated way; they usually don't even have telecommunications \nequipment that speaks easily in a crisis to one another--that is \ndangerous disorganization.\n  If you have, as we know from the investigation of the Joint \nIntelligence Committees, a situation where there are bureaucratic \nbarriers between the intelligence community, the law enforcement \ncommunity, and information is not shared in a way that can put all the \ndots, as we keep saying, on a board so you can see the outlines of a \npotential terrorist attack so you can stop it, that is disorganization \nthat is dangerous.\n  I could go on and on, to each of the five or six divisions of the new \nDepartment.\n  So that is why we are all proposing this step. It is going to be a \nbig job. I want to make it clear. I know the Senator from Utah didn't \nmean to suggest this in reporting our conversation. I am not now, nor \nwill I be a candidate for Secretary of the new Department of Homeland \nSecurity. When he asked me whether I would advise who was taking it to \ntake it under the Nelson-Chafee-Breaux language--if they should \naccept--my answer was yes. I want to explain why, in the calm of a \nMonday afternoon. In this particular colloquy, we may have an \nopportunity to set more on the record as I see it than has gotten in to \nthis point.\n  We have 170,000 employees to be moved to the new Department. The \nnumber I hear about union-represented employees is approximately 43,000 \nwho will be moved to the new Department. There are two factors at work \nhere. One is an anxiety among a lot of Federal workers that this \nexisting statute, which has been referred to, that was adopted in the \nCarter administration, that gives the President of the United States \nextraordinary authority to declare that a particular category of \nFederal employees should not be allowed to belong to a union, an \nemployee association, because that union membership would be \ninconsistent with national security--the existence of that statute \napplied 10 or 11 times since adoption in the late 1970s in the Carter \nadministration, and usually in quite\n\n[[Page S9584]]\n\nnarrow areas--the Defense Intelligence Agency and in similar groups--\nthe existence of that statute used for the first time by the current \nadministration in January to deprive several hundred employees of the \nU.S. attorneys' offices around the country of the right to collectively \nbargain, to join unions, created widespread anxiety among Federal \nemployees.\n  Senator Thompson and I had some discussion on this last week. I don't \nneed to get into the details of what the administration intended to do \nand what the employees thought. From the employees' point of view, they \nwere worried that this statute would be used in a broader way than ever \nbefore to deny them the right to collectively bargain. I must say, \nagain, that the right to collectively bargain among Federal employees \nis quite limited; most notably and, of course appropriately, Federal \nemployees belonging to a union do not have the right to strike. That is \na law. There are various other items that are normally negotiated \nbetween management and unions that are not negotiated in the Federal \nemployee case--most notably salary. We are the managers, in that sense, \nwho set salary levels--we in the Congress.\n  So now we come to a recommendation that the Department of Homeland \nSecurity be created. There is great anxiety--and it remains so--among \nthe 43,000 employees currently represented by unions who, when they are \nmoved to this Department, because the name of the Department is \nHomeland Security, they might well be deprived of their collective \nbargaining rights. Our committee considered that and we came up with a \nproposal which, to state it in summary, would have allowed employees to \nappeal such a decision, such an order denying them collective \nbargaining rights to the Federal Labor Relations Authority--two-thirds \nof whose members, incidentally, are appointed by the sitting President. \nSo, presumably, it would not have been a hostile board. When we came to \nthe floor, and after that measure was in our proposal, the White House \nwas quite adamant on the point that it would represent a lessening of \nthe President's national security authority. Though the lessening would \nhave been small, literally that was true. That would have been true \nbecause we would have subjected the Presidential decision on national \nsecurity grounds to review by this administrative body and appeal to \nthe administrative body. That is why, when I saw the gridlock here, and \nunderstanding that we agree on more than 90 percent of the two \nproposals--one White House and one committee--before the Senate now, I \nencouraged our colleagues, Senators Nelson and Breaux, to pursue a \ncompromise. They engaged Senator Chafee in these discussions and they \ncame up on this one with a proposal that the President would retain the \nauthority he has, but would have to more clearly enumerate the reasons \nwhy he was invoking this authority; and, particularly, he would have to \nmake clear, or give a statement, that the agency whose employees he was \ndenying the right to collectively bargain had had its mission changed \nfrom the many years since the Carter administration, when no previous \nPresident had said that doing the work of that agency was inconsistent \nwith the union membership to national security, with no right of appeal \nto an administrative agency. To me, that creates what I might call a \nkind of minimal due process for Federal employees, just to require the \nPresident who, by the one court case in this statute that had been \ndecided, the President's authority here in that court case was held to \nbe substantial. I mean, this is a case where President Reagan removed \ncollective bargaining rights from a group of Federal employees for \nnational security reasons and did not recite a determination as to why \nhe did it. I believe the district court sided with the employees. It \nwas appealed to a circuit court, and the district court said the \nPresident has to at least recite a determination rather than just issue \nan order.\n\n  The circuit court actually said--I am paraphrasing and probably \nmaking something more complicated, a little more direct--the circuit \ncourt said they accept a presumption that though the President did not \nrecite a determination, when it came to national security, his judgment \nwas determinative. It set a very high standard for anyone questioning \nhow a President would exercise this power the statute gives him.\n  So my own feeling is that in the Nelson-Chafee-Breaux compromise, we \nhave now put in a little language to require a statement of why the \nPresident did it, and the work of this Department, or agency, or office \nthat changed since they moved to the new Department, but effectively no \nappeal from that. So I think we achieved a little measure of due \nprocess for the employees, without at all diminishing the national \nsecurity authority of the President.\n  On the question of civil service reforms, or changes, and so-called \nmanagement flexibility, when the President first introduced his \nproposal and embraced the idea of a Department of Homeland Security, I \nremember speaking to Governor Ridge. He is a good man, and he was good \nenough to bring this up himself in a conversation we had a couple weeks \nago. He said to me: I remember, Senator, that, as soon as the bill came \nout and you saw some of the changes we wanted on civil service, you \nappealed to me, why can't we put this aside for 6 months? This \nDepartment is going to take months to get up and functioning. I \nremember saying this to Tom Ridge--that this is a trap, a web, and we \nare going to get so entangled in it that it is going to run the risk of \nmaking it hard for us to adopt legislation creating a Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  This is one of those rare cases where my prediction was correct. I \nsay that with some understandable humility. I fear that is where we \nhave ourselves now. In the committee bill, we adopted some bipartisan \ncivil service reforms, worked on with great diligence by Senators Akaka \nand Voinovich over many months. Other than that, we didn't change the \nexisting civil service law, except that we said we required the new \nSecretary of the new Department, 6 months after the effective date of \nthe legislation, to come back to Congress and tell us whether he or she \nthought we needed to do anything more about management flexibility as \nthe Department was taking place, based on the experience they had.\n  So that is where our committee bill was. The President came in with a \nseries of reductions in civil service protections for employees who are \nlongstanding and that deepened the anxiety of the Federal employees \nthat this Department was going to be used as a way to cut back on their \nprotections, on the accountability, on the kinds of protections that, \nat their best, don't create rigid bureaucracy, but help to create the \nclimate in which the best people are attracted to Federal service. The \nPresident's bill gutted that.\n\n  Now comes the Nelson-Chafee-Breaux compromise, and here, too, I think \nthey did something quite reasonable and progressive, which is they \nitemized four different areas where the President can exercise broad \nmanagement flexibility, but they did something that builds on the best \nlabor-management relations in the private sector and some very hopeful \nexperiences with similar labor-management relations in Federal \nDepartments, particularly the Internal Revenue Service. They said in \nthe Nelson-Chafee-Breaux compromise: Mr. Secretary, we are giving you \nthis flexibility in these areas of current civil service protections, \nbut we require, before you implement them, to attempt to negotiate them \nwith your workers. That is why I say in the best of modern private-\nsector labor-management relations, the old hostility is not there. It \nis: Let's sit down around the table and figure out what works best for \nthe company; you want jobs, we want to make a profit; let's figure out \nhow we can best do this together. Let me mention, this is exactly the \nauthority Congress gave the Internal Revenue Service a few years ago. \nIt has worked quite well. In other words, in that legislation we said: \nDirector of Internal Revenue, you have the authority to negotiate \nchanges in the civil service, but you have to do it with your \nemployees. In fact, they have negotiated some very progressive \nagreements with both sides agreeing once they sat down around the \ntable.\n  In that legislation and in this Nelson-Chafee-Breaux proposal, so \nagain we protect the authority of the President, we say if the \nSecretary of Homeland Security and the workers in the\n\n[[Page S9585]]\n\nDepartment cannot reach an agreement, then they have to take it to \narbitration to the Federal Service Impasses Panel. This is a board, \nagain, all of whose members are appointed by the current President, so \nit is not a hostile board, and that board makes the final decision.\n  I do believe that our colleagues, Senators Ben Nelson, Lincoln \nChafee, and John Breaux, have worked out a proposal, a genuine \ncompromise that is different from what our committee reported out but \nprovides a door opener both to management flexibility, to some progress \nin management, and does not diminish ultimately the authority of the \nPresident of the United States, certainly not with regard to his \nability and capacity now to invoke national security with regard to \nunion membership rights of Federal employees.\n  I am puzzled as to why the administration has not accepted this \ncompromise proposal and the Senator from Texas is effectively involved \nin a filibuster of the overall bill. I remain open to discussion about \nparts of this. I appreciate what the Senator from Utah said about a \ntime limit. Five years seems like a long time to me.\n  One of the issues we considered in the committee, and I know was \nconsidered in the negotiations, was the possibility, with regard to the \ncivil service management flexibility, of giving--we call it \ndemonstration authority, but the idea was for a limited period of time \nto give the President some of the authority he wanted, and then come \nback and see how it worked and consider whether we wanted to extend it.\n  I am grateful for the words of the Senator from Utah, and as we begin \nour new week, after some of the heat that was exchanged on the floor of \nthe Senate, I am grateful for the coolness of his--in the best sense of \nthat word--that is, the thoughtfulness of his remarks today. I will be \nglad to continue to talk with him to see if we can find common \nground. We ought not to be in this gridlock on what I still consider to \nbe a side issue from the main business of this Department: protecting \nthe security of the American people.\n\n  As the Senator from Utah said, we never want to give the impression \nwe do not think the employees who will move to this Department are as \nconcerned about homeland security as we and the rest of the American \npeople are. In fact, the evidence before us is quite ample that Federal \nemployees are concerned.\n  The stories are legion and numerous of Federal employees--I think of \nFEMA employees--they were somewhere else and they rushed to the \nPentagon to be of help; they flew to New York; they worked hours and \nhours of overtime. Of course, the most vivid demonstration of the way \nin which union membership is not inconsistent with national service or \nsacrifice is the firefighters in New York, several hundred of whom were \noff duty on September 11. When they heard what had happened, they just \nrushed to the scene. Nobody was thinking about whether this was \nsupposed to be a day off under the collective bargaining agreement, \nwhat risks they were assuming, or they were going to be asked to do \nthings that were not quite in their job description. Needless to say, a \nlot of them not only rushed into the building, but they never came out.\n  I hope we can find common ground. I offer anything I can do to \nsupplement the extraordinary positive work of the previous triumvirate \nI mentioned, Senators Nelson, Chafee, and Breaux, to get over this last \nbig hurdle and get this bill adopted in the Senate, get it to a \nconference with the House, and then get it to the President's desk for \nsigning.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I do not want to interrupt.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. The Senator's timing is good. That was the windup \nsentence.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I wonder if the Senator will yield to me? I wish to \ndiscuss another aspect of the war on terrorism, and that is what we can \ndo through the Justice Department. I wonder if the President will allow \nme to speak about that.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will be happy to do so. I thank the Senator for \ncoming to the floor and look forward to his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The Senator from Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/30/senate-section/article/S9585-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9585-S9587]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I know we are getting down toward the end \nof the session and sometimes legislation falls by the wayside, but I \nhave seen something in the last couple of days different from anything \nI have seen in 28 years in the Senate.\n  Last Thursday the other body passed the Department of Justice \nAppropriations Authorization Act and we filed a bipartisan conference \nreport. I mention this because it has been 20 years since there has \nbeen such an authorization act for the Department of Justice because it \nhas been so hard to bring people from across the political spectrum \ntogether. The House passed this conference report--by a vote of 400 to \n4. I am not sure the way things are these days that we could get a vote \nof 400 to 4 to agree the Sun rises in the east and sets in the west.\n  The very same day I checked with every single member on this side of \nthe aisle, every Democrat, and asked if they were willing to have it \npass the Senate by voice vote, if need be, or a rollcall vote--it does \nnot make any difference, but to pass it.\n  Every single Democrat--the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, \nmyself, everybody else--agreed, yes, sure, go ahead and pass it. We \nwere told there is an anonymous hold on the Republican side. This \nbipartisan legislation to authorize the Department of Justice is \nblocked--legislation to strengthen our Justice Department and the FBI \nthat by agreement of all Members across the political spectrum will \nincrease our preparedness against terrorist attacks, but also prevent \ncrime and drug abuse in our cities and in our rural areas. It improves \nour intellectual property and antitrust laws. It would strengthen and \nprotect our judiciary. It would give our children a safe place to go \nafter school.\n\n  This legislation is as motherhood as one could imagine and yet the \nRepublicans have said, no, even though the Republican-controlled House \npassed it 400 to 4. And even though every single Democrat in the Senate \nis ready to vote for it, the Republicans have said, no, we want to put \nan anonymous Republican hold on it and not allow it to go forward, \nyears of work by both the Republicans and Democrats. This bill not only \nhas my support in the Judiciary Committee, it has Senator Hatch's \nsupport. It has the support of Chairman Sensenbrenner in the other \nbody, as well as Representative Hyde. Every one of the House and Senate \nconferees, Republican and Democrat, signed the conference report. That \nconference report includes significant portions of at least 25 \nlegislative initiatives, all to be flushed down the drain by a \nRepublican hold.\n  When people go home this year to campaign about why they want to stop \ndrugs in their schools, why they want to fight terrorism, why they want \ntheir courts strengthened, why they want the Attorney General of the \nDepartment of Justice to be able to be strengthened in their fight, let \nthem point out that the reason it was not done was a Republican Senator \nwho wants to do it anonymously. They do not even want to step forward \nand say who he may be.\n  For too many years, Republican and Democrat administrations have \nallowed the Department of Justice to escape its accountability to the \nSenate and the House of Representatives and, through them, to the \nAmerican people. Congress, the people's representatives, have a strong \nconstitutional interest in restoring that accountability. The House has \nrecognized this. It has done its job. We need to do ours. Senate \nDemocrats are prepared to proceed. Senate Republicans apparently are \nnot. So let me tell you some of the things that are in this bipartisan \nconference report.\n  First, the conference report provides Federal, State, and local \ngovernments with additional tools to battle terrorism. It fortifies our \nborder security by authorizing over $20 billion for the administration \nand enforcement of the laws relating to immigration, naturalization, \nand alien registration. It authorizes funding for the Centers for \nDomestic Preparedness in Alabama, Texas, New Mexico, Louisiana, Nevada, \nVermont, and Pennsylvania. It adds additional uses for grants from the \nOffice\n\n[[Page S9586]]\n\nof Domestic Preparedness to support State and local law enforcement \nagencies.\n  Why would anybody on the Republican side oppose that? Another measure \nin the bill would correct a glitch in a law that helps prosecutors \ncombat the international financing of terrorism. I worked closely with \nthe Bush White House to pass this provision in order to bring the \nUnited States into compliance with a treaty that bans terrorist \nfinancing--and this is something the Bush administration wants--but \nwithout this technical, noncontroversial change, the provision may not \nbe usable. As the President has pointed out, this law is vital in \nstopping the flow of money to those who would harm Americans. Every \nDemocrat is ready to pass that. It is something President Bush has \nasked for in his fight against terrorism. Every single Democrat in this \nbody is ready to vote for it, but the Republicans are blocking it from \ngoing forward.\n  Worse yet, at a time when the President is going before the U.N. \nemphasizing our enemies are not complying with international law, by \nblocking this minor fix--something the President has asked for, \nsomething every Democrat is ready to vote for, only the Republicans are \nblocking--we are leaving ourselves open to a charge that we also are \nnot in compliance with an important antiterrorism treaty.\n\n  Secondly, this conference report improves our law enforcement \nefforts. Among other things, it pushes the FBI to reform its outdated \ncomputer system. Right now it is something that kids in school 10 years \nago had better computer systems. It provides danger pay for FBI agents \nperforming hazardous duty abroad. It provides for increased sentencing \nenhancements when criminals use body armor in crimes of violence or \ndrug trafficking crimes, something for which every single police agency \nI have talked with from New York to Texas has asked.\n  I am told the administration supports this and every single \nDemocratic Senator supports this, but it is blocked by the Republicans.\n  It includes Senator Carnahan's Law Enforcement Tribute Act, which \nauthorized grants to States, local governments, and Indian tribes for \nmemorials to honor those who were killed or disabled while serving as \nlaw enforcement safety officers. It has the Feinstein-Sessions James \nGuelff and Chris McCurley Body Armor Act. That is blocked. These are \nthings that had overwhelming Republican and Democratic support, still \nhas unanimous Democratic support but is blocked by the Republicans. I \nbelieve the conference report the Senate Republicans are blocking could \nhelp prevent crime from occurring in the first place. We reached a \nbipartisan agreement to give the Boys and Girls Clubs the funds they \nneed to establish 1,200 additional clubs across the Nation. As a former \nprosecutor, I know how valuable these are to prevent crime from \nhappening in the first place, to give teenagers and youngsters a place \nto go.\n  Just last week, I joined with Senator Hatch at the Boys and Girls \nClub congressional breakfast honoring regional youth of the year and \nalso honoring Senator Strom Thurmond. Republican Senator after \nRepublican Senator praised the work of the Boys and Girls Club, as did \nI, but now some Republican Senators are anonymously holding up the \nauthorization for the money for the Boys and Girls Club.\n  Senate Republicans are also blocking funding that will put an \nadditional Assistant U.S. attorney in every district in the Nation to \nimplement the President's Project Safe Neighborhoods Initiative aimed \nat preventing school violence. The President goes out and speaks in \nfavor of this. I happen to agree with the President on this. Everybody \nagrees with him, and now, when doing what the administration has asked \nfor, we put these assistant U.S. attorneys in there, but that is not \ngoing anywhere. Every single Democratic Senator supports it. An \nanonymous Republican hold blocks it.\n  The conference report strengthens our efforts to prevent domestic \nviolence and protect its victims. By creating a new Violence Against \nWomen Office in the Justice Department, we ensure an increased Federal \nfocus on this tragic and recurring problem. I do not know why \npreventing domestic violence should be a partisan issue.\n  In my experience as a prosecutor, the police never said we have to \ndetermine whether this person who is beaten up in domestic violence is \na Democrat or a Republican. You try to save the life of the person who \nis being beaten and to protect them.\n  This legislation also authorizes programs to reduce drug abuse and \nrecidivism, from adult and juvenile courts, to increased funding for \ndrug treatment in prisons, to funding for police training in South and \nCentral Asia to reduce the flow of drugs into our Nation. All of these \nproposals are bipartisan. Actually, most of them were in the Hatch-\nLeahy Drug Abuse Education, Prevention and Treatment Act. Every \nDemocrat is ready to vote for them, but we cannot because the \nRepublicans have an anonymous hold.\n  The conference report contains a number of important intellectual \nproperty provisions that will help American innovators and businesses, \nboth big and small. There is a probusiness provision, which includes \nthe Leahy-Hatch Madrid Protocol Implementation Act that has been held \nup for over 1 year. Every single business organization in the country, \nbig or small, has asked us to pass it. Every single Democrat has said \nthey will vote for it. It is being held by an anonymous Republican \nhold.\n  This legislation would implement a treaty and allow American \nbusinesses to obtain ``one stop'' international trademark registration, \na process available only to countries signatory to the Protocol. This \nwould benefit American businesses and companies who need to protect \ntheir trademarks when they sell their goods and services in \ninternational markets, particularly over the Internet.\n  I hear from companies as large as IBM and Intel. They want this \nlegislation, down to the little mom-and-pop manufacturers in my own \nState. I tell them all, every single Democrat will vote for that. It is \nin this bill, as 400 House Members of both parties voted for it. But I \nalso tell everyone in the businesses that ask, it is being held up by \nan anonymous Republican hold.\n  Another important intellectual property provision is the Hatch-Leahy \nTEACH Act, to clarify the educational-use exemption in the copyright \nlaw and all educators to use the same rich material for distance \nmaterial over the Internet as they use in face-to-face classroom \ninstructions. The Presiding Officer represents one of the most \nbeautiful areas in upstate New York, where I visit often. I think of my \nrural Vermont or rural Utah. This allows people in these small schools \nto be able to have access to what is available in the large \nmetropolitan areas. Every Democrat will vote for it. It is being held \nup by an anonymous Republican hold.\n  The conference report has a provision modernizing Patent and \nTrademark Office specifically authorizing friends to augment the \ninvestigation and prosecution of intellectual property crimes of \nprivacy online. There is no member of the business community that does \nnot support it, from the largest to the smallest. Every Democratic \nSenator is ready to vote for it tonight. It is being held up by an \nanonymous Republican hold.\n  This conference report creates or extends 20 Federal judgeships. \nThose are more than all the judgeships created during the 6-plus years \nthe Republican party controlled the United States Senate and blocked \nboth Clinton administration judicial nominations and the creation of \nnew Federal judicial positions. We have included new Federal judges in \nArizona, Alabama, Texas, New Mexico, among others. I have heard \nrepeatedly from our Republican friends that although they have blocked \nthe creation of the judges during the previous administration, they \nwant them now. I put them in. Every single Democrat is ready to vote \nfor it and the Republicans are blocking. It is amazing. These judges we \nhave needed for years, blocked during the last administration when the \nDemocrats had the Presidency, now we put them in. I supported putting \nthem in, from northern New York to Alabama. The Republicans say they \nwant them. They will not be appointed by a Democratic president. They \nwill be appointed by a Republican president. I don't know what is going \non unless they want to make it look like we are holding this up. Every \nDemocrat will vote for the new judges. But they are being held up by an \nanonymous Republican hold.\n\n[[Page S9587]]\n\n  I do not want to hear bleeding and caterwauling from the White House \nor the political mouthpieces from the Department of Justice, asking, \nWhere are the judges. All 50 Democratic Senators will vote for them, as \n400 Republicans and Democrats in the House voted for them. It is being \nheld up by an anonymous Republican hold.\n  The conference report prohibits mandatory arbitration in a motor \nvehicle franchise contract between manufacturers and automobile \ndealers, to the same effect as the Hatch-Feingold-Leahy-Grassley Motor \nVehicle Franchise Contract Arbitration Act, S. 1140. That legislation \nhas more than 60 cosponsors, Republicans and Democrats. The automobile \ndealers lobbied strongly for it. All 50 Democrats are ready to vote for \nit. Their friends on the Republican side are holding it up.\n  The conference report includes an amendment to the Radiation Exposure \nCompensation Act to expand eligibility for compensation for injured \nuranium miners, mill workers and ore transporters. Many Senators from \nwestern States, on a bipartisan basis, such as Senators Daschle, Hatch, \nJohnson, Domenici, strongly support these changes. We are all ready to \nvote for them. Republicans are holding it up.\n\n  Finally, the conference report includes several important immigration \nprovisions to help underserved rural areas with a critical shortage of \nmedical doctors. Women die in childbirth. Teenagers in an accident die \nbecause they did not get care. Older people do not get the preventive \nmedicine they need. This allows foreign doctors who are educated in the \nUnited States to remain here if they will agree to practice in the \nunderserved areas. It extends H-1B status for certain working aliens \nand makes it possible for children whose sponsoring parent has died to \napply for citizenship, nonetheless. I don't need to tell the Presiding \nOfficer, representing the great State of New York, there were children \nwhose sponsoring parents died in this country.\n  These are all noncontroversial provisions, for all over the country. \nEvery single Democrat Senator said they will vote for it. We cannot \nbring it to a vote because the Republicans have an anonymous hold. I \nwould not feel as bad about the holds if the Senator holding it up \nwould come forward and state why. Instead, it is a stealth hold. It is \na ``during the night'' hold. It is the quiet, anonymous phone call hold \nthat stops it. It repeats an unfortunate pattern of anonymous \nRepublican holds on bipartisan legislation designed to improve our \nNation's national security law enforcement, immigration policies, and \njudicial branch of the government.\n  I am sure my colleagues are tired of hearing how much I enjoyed my \nearlier career in law enforcement. For 8\\1/2\\ years I proudly carried a \nbadge, proudly served as chief law enforcement officer of my county. We \nprosecuted a lot of people. We saw a lot of tragic situations. We \nhelped a lot of people in cases of domestic violence, stopped crimes \nfrom happening. Those we were not able to stop, we oftentimes \nsuccessfully prosecuted afterwards. I never recall anyone, either those \nin my office or any of the law enforcement agencies we talked about, \nwhether we were dealing with a Democrat or Republican, asking whether \nsomeone who was beaten or killed was Democrat or Republican. You never \nasked a police officer if they were Democrat or Republican. No one \nasked when sending officers out to protect citizens, facing the \npotential of death, their political party affiliation. In working with \nmy colleagues, both in the Senate and in the House, we did not look at \nthis as Democrat and Republican. We talked about good law enforcement. \nThat is why every single Democratic Senator has said they will vote for \nthis bill.\n  Our caucus spans the political spectrum. I suspect if we were allowed \nto bring it to a vote, almost all of my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle would vote for it, yet an anonymous hold is stopping this \nhelp to the law enforcement agencies, ranging from the smallest of our \ntowns to our statewide law enforcement agencies, to our Federal law \nenforcement agencies. Nobody has spoken of any substantive question or \nissue of any provisions in this conference report. And there are not \nany. It passed the Republican-controlled house by 400-4.\n  It has been suggested the holds are merely partisan blocking to hold \nup legislative action and then blame the Democratic Senate majority for \ninaction created by Republican holds. I repeat, as I have over and over \nagain on this bill, I have checked with every single Democrat Senator; \nwe are ready to vote. We are all ready to vote.\n  If Republicans allowed this bill to come to a vote, it would pass \nimmediately. It should have been passed last Thursday. We had an \nopportunity. Senator Daschle asked permission to pass it--Senator Hatch \nsaid we didn't each have to speak on it, we would put our speeches in \nafterward--asked to pass it by unanimous consent, but was told the \nRepublicans objected.\n  For the sake of the Justice Department, the Congress, and the \nAmerican people, we ought to pass it today. Twenty-one years fighting \nto get it, and here is what is in there: Combating terrorism, improving \nlaw enforcement, preventing crime, fighting drug abuse, enhancing \nintellectual property protection, strengthening the judiciary--adding \n20 new judgeships and improving judicial disciplinary procedures--\nimproving civil justice, and improving immigration procedures.\n  The irony is item after item was worked out with the support of the \nBush White House. I spent an awful lot of time on this bill. A lot of \nmy Republican colleagues spent a lot of time on this bill. And our \nstaffs spent 10 times more time on this bill. I think somebody down at \nthe White House, if they take time out from the fundraising and the \ncampaigning, could take a couple of minutes to pick up the phone and \ncall the party, the Members on the other side of the aisle, and say the \ncriminal justice system needs this, the fight against terrorism needs \nthis.\n  This is not just something abstract, this is real. Let's pass it. \nThat is why the Republican-controlled House passed it. I am sorry my \nfriends on the Republican side of the aisle are blocking it. I hope \nwhen they think about it, they will come to their senses and let it go \nthrough.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton).

Madam President, as we enter our 5th week of \ndebate on this Senate floor on the homeland security bill, I rise today \nto ponder exactly where we have been, and, perhaps much more \nimportantly, where we are going.\n  In recent weeks, Democrats and Republicans have made little progress \non the bill. Some have identified particular provisions they would like \nto have changed; some have not. The President offered his own proposal \nfor consideration, and, as the Record will reflect, the Senate obliged \nhim by allowing it to come to the floor for consideration.\n  My good friends, Senator Gramm of Texas and Senator Miller of \nGeorgia, are championing the President's bill. He could have no two \nmore noble or respected Senators as his gatekeepers.\n  Let me describe for you what this bill does. It will establish a new \nFederal\n\n[[Page S9588]]\n\nDepartment, the largest Government reorganization since the \nestablishment of the Department of Defense. It will affect 170,000 \nFederal employees and each and every American. It will restructure \nexisting agencies and create new ones. It will relocate and reclassify \nemployees and will establish the largest reaching intelligence-\ngathering operation in the history of civilization.\n  Is this the kind of legislation that Congress should approve blindly? \nObviously not.\n  Some would have you believe that anyone who wants to make any \nchange--no matter how slight--to this massive legislation is an \nopponent of the President.\n  I want to make a slight change to this bill, one I believe is \nsupported by a majority of the Senate, but that does not make me an \nopponent, nor does my amendment make anyone an opponent. I support the \nPresident. I want to see him achieve his goal of establishing this new \nFederal bureaucracy.\n  What I do not support is sacrificing our constitutional \nresponsibility for oversight of not just the Department, once it is \nestablished, but of the effort to create the Department in the first \nplace.\n  Passing this bill comes down to one unresolved issue: the method of \nresolving differences as they pertain to labor-management in the new \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  I have joined together with my colleagues, Senator John Breaux and \nSenator Lincoln Chafee, to put forth a compromise that has the support \nof a majority of the Senators, and should be embraced as a victory, not \ndemagoged as a special interest protectionist measure.\n  The President's bill, the Gramm-Miller bill, does not have enough \nvotes to pass, and it does not have enough votes to invoke cloture. The \nLieberman bill does not have enough votes to pass, and it has not had \nenough votes to invoke cloture.\n  Without becoming unnecessarily bogged down with Senate procedure, it \nis important to point out that cloture means to shut off debate and a \nmajority to pass a piece of legislation under these circumstances. Now, \nmy amendment has enough to pass, but it does not have enough to shut \noff cloture. If my amendment were passed and passed on the Gramm-Miller \nbill, I believe that the bill would then have enough not only to shut \noff cloture but pass. That is what we are really trying to do.\n  Our compromise would give the President the authority he needs to \nhire and fire, promote or demote employees in the new Department. \nIndeed, it gives him exactly the authority he sought when Homeland \nSecurity Director Tom Ridge wrote the chairman of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee in early September.\n  I have here for everyone to see--even those watching through the \nelectronic eye--Governor Ridge's comments to Senator Lieberman. I will \nquote in part, but I can quote before or after. There is some question \nabout the context of this particular legislation. It was in conjunction \nwith explaining what the White House was interested in in terms of the \nflexibility that management would require over labor under this new \nagency. He said:\n\n       Senator, the President seeks for this new department the \n     same management prerogatives that Congress has provided other \n     departments and agencies throughout the executive branch. For \n     example--\n\n  Then he identifies a couple of other processes that are fairly \ninnocuous. Then he says, relating to personnel flexibility:\n\n       Personnel flexibility is currently enjoyed by the Federal \n     Aviation Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, and \n     the Transportation Security Administration.\n\n  We initially tried to embody the Federal Aviation Administration in \nour amendment, but it was ruled not to be germane. So we did the next \nobvious thing; we went to the Internal Revenue Service, which lays out \nunder existing law--which made it germane--the nature of the \nflexibility, that personnel flexibility to which Governor Ridge had \nreferred. We thought that would, in fact, do it.\n  Now, much to our surprise, that apparently does not do it because \nthey have suggested that this is a nonstarter. It seemed to be starting \nback in September--the third of September--but it seems to be a \nnonstarter today. I don't know what has changed in that timeframe. My \ngood friend, Senator Gramm, said that everybody is entitled to their \nown opinion, but they are not entitled to their own set of facts. I \nthink this is a set of facts that we have before us. It is hard to \nbelieve that there would be more than one opinion about what Governor \nRidge had to say. There should be no more than one opinion about what \nhis letter purported to deal with. So I think this is one set of facts, \nwith one opinion. It is possible to mischaracterize facts, but I don't \nthink there is any way to mischaracterize the plain and simple language \nwhen he said ``the same management prerogatives.'' He didn't say \n``almost the same,'' or ``slightly different''; he said ``the same \nmanagement prerogatives.''\n  I said the other day that there are times on this floor when you find \nout you are having a disagreement and you cannot understand why it is a \ndisagreement; you are not sure what it is about, and you feel like \nLewis Carroll must have felt when he wrote Alice in Wonderland. I have \nnot seen the cheshire cat, but when winning is described as winning in \nthe media about this issue, I feel as if we are in Alice in Wonderland.\n\n  Let me also suggest that there have been some news reports that I \nmade reference to from the past few days that might shed some light on \nthis situation. On Friday, Paul Light, of the respected Brookings \nInstitution, told the Chicago Tribune that the differences between the \ntwo sides in this fight--he calls it a ``fight''--are relatively minor \nand that Democrats have already given the President almost everything \nhe requested. I think Senator Lieberman parenthetically has said he has \ngiven 95 percent. We have been looking for a way to close the gap. I \nquote from his story:\n\n       I don't think the answer's in the legislation. I think it \n     is a little bit about Iraq and a little bit about the \n     election.\n\n  Mr. Light said the President should declare victory and move on. He \nsaid:\n\n       Any President in history would celebrate the enormity of \n     consensus that exists in Congress right now. The President \n     has gotten 95 percent of what he wants.\n\n  I think it is closer to 99; obviously, it is not 100. Today's issue \nof Roll Call includes a news story and a column in which some \nRepublican leaders outline a strategy to use the homeland security \nissue in the coming elections.\n  Mark Preston, a very able reporter from this respected publication, \nwrote:\n\n       A disagreement over key labor issues in the homeland \n     legislation might force this bill to be shelved until after \n     November.\n\n  Mr. Preston quotes my good friend from Pennsylvania, the chairman of \nthe Republican conference, Senator Santorum, as saying:\n\n       There are issues not being acted upon here, and they would \n     certainly be issues of great importance to the American \n     people and therefore be of very great importance to a \n     campaign.\n\n  Madam President, they are very important to the American people, and \nno more important for us to do today and tomorrow is to deal with \nnational security as it relates to the American people, and put aside \npartisan politics, put aside this election and electioneering and \nresolve the differences and close the difference between 95 percent and \n100 percent. The differences are, in fact, I think, as Mr. Light said, \nvery small.\n  Accusations of obstructionism seem to be aimed at securing a campaign \nwedge, and what we really need to do is move away from obstructionism \nto constructionism. We can be constructive in developing this \nparticular approach. There are some other issues besides the \nflexibility issue, and we thought we had pretty much closed the gap \nthere as well.\n  The Morella amendment, as it was introduced in the House, relates to \nthe question of collective bargaining. What this particular amendment \ndoes is go back and have Morella included in the amendment as it was \nintroduced in the House. It may not be exactly what was requested, but \nwe have suggested that if there are some particular questions or some \nparticular interests in adding some language that would make this \nbetter, we are entirely interested in doing that.\n  The truth is that we have not had that opportunity to try to bring \nthat about. We met Thursday, we met Friday, and we met today. I think \nit is time for us to stop meeting and time for us to find a way to \nsolve the issue.\n\n[[Page S9589]]\n\nWe are beyond meeting, I believe, when it comes to this particular \namendment. Flexibility is important and making sure that what we do in \nterms of this legislation is that we not adversely impact job security \nfor national security, and certainly not unintentionally.\n  The White House has made it clear they have no plans to go in and \nmake major wholesale changes. I take them at their word. I think if \nthat is the case--and I take them at their word--then we ought to find, \nif not this language, some language that will permit us to close the \ngap to move this forward. If, in fact, it is everybody's plan to \nachieve a result here, then I think we can achieve one.\n  I truly believe it is important to the national interest to be able \nto deal with the personnel flexibility of the President. There is no \nquestion he needs to have the capacity to hire and fire, to promote and \ndemote, and do what is in the best interests. There is no question \nabout that. And adding that there be some requirement regarding the \nchanging of authority or the changing of position in mission of the \npersonnel is a slight adjustment. It certainly is not any kind of major \nintrusion on the Presidential authority.\n  To include the Morella language, in terms of flexibility, simply adds \nto that. I hope we will be able to move beyond meetings to closing the \ngap, bridging this debate so it brings about the best result that we \ncan, not simply for the White House but for the people of this great \ncountry. This should not be about Republicans or Democrats. It should \nnot be about the legislative branch or the executive branch. It ought \nto be about what is in the best interest, the national interest of our \npeople, and for those who share the same desire for freedom and are \nstruggling to achieve it in other parts of the world.\n\n  We have a great responsibility to the American people, but we also \nhave a responsibility that is now being questioned and challenged \naround the world. One of the best ways for us to begin to resolve these \nissues is to take care of business at home. I cannot think of a better \nway than to adopt this amendment so we can adopt the Gramm-Miller \nproposal and move forward for national defense and our own homeland \nsecurity.\n  Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/30/senate-section/article/S9589-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         A TRIBUTE TO THE LIFE OF HOLLADAY JOHNSTON RICHARDSON\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, early this morning, I lost one of my \nclosest friends and staff members, Holly Johnston Richardson, who \nsuccumbed after a difficult battle with cancer. For nearly 30 years, \nshe was a member of my extended family in every sense of the word. She \nwas my right hand. My trusted advisor. My vital link to literally \nthousands of South Carolina friends, constituents, and family members.\n  But more than anything else, Mr. President, Holly Richardson was one \nof my dearest friends, and I will miss her more than words can convey.\n  To her husband, Phil, to her two wonderful children, Anne and Emmett, \nand to Holly's mother and father, Joanne and Coy Johnston of \nSummerville, South Carolina. I extend my heartfelt sympathies. I know \nmy colleagues--so many of whom knew Holly very well--join me in \nexpressing their support and offering their prayers during this very \ndifficult time.\n  But it is Holly Richardson's life, and the courage she demonstrated \nthroughout her illness, that is most on my mind today. I know I speak \nfor everyone who knew and loved Holly as I did in saying that we deeply \nmourn her passing, and yet celebrate her wonderful life, a life \ndedicated to God, to her family, to her fellow man, and to her State \nand Nation.\n  Like all trusted staff members, Holly Richardson had my ear. What she \nprobably never knew fully is that she also had my heart. On a personal \nlevel, she was--for my entire family--an unofficial ``third daughter.'' \nOur confidant. Our friend. Our partner in so many aspects of our lives.\n  On a professional level, Holly and I were virtually inseparable. As \nanyone who has ever visited my Senate office knows, Holly's desk was \nalways next to mine. We shared an office ever since she became my \npersonal secretary in 1979. She could always be counted upon to work \nthe longest hours, to handle the toughest jobs, and to render \nevenhanded advice and counsel.\n  In fact, it was Holly who quietly bragged that she had broken in more \nthan eight chiefs of staffs, five or six office press secretaries, \neight committee chief counsels, and literally hundreds of staff \nassistants, aides and interns. She was, of course, correct. Holly was \n``the standard'' when it came to professionalism, hard work, integrity \nand public service in a United States Senate office.\n  It is not an exaggeration to say that ``everyone'' knew Holly. \nWhether you were from South Carolina, or were a Washington, D.C. \nfixture, if you were around politics, you knew, and you came to love, \nHolly Richardson. From Presidents and First Ladies, to Senators and \ntheir spouses, to everyday working men and women who would call my \noffice, Holly was beloved at every level of life.\n  Single-minded. Fiercely independent. Loyal and dedicated. She had the \npersonal qualities that define what President Theodore Roosevelt once \ncalled the ``courageous life.''\n  But it was not until she was diagnosed with breast cancer less than a \nyear ago, that people came to see just how courageous an individual \nHolly Richardson actually was.\n  Holly never wore her illness on her sleeve. She never asked you to \nfeel sorry for her, share her burden, or wallow in her pity. In fact, \nfew people outside of the office even knew Holly was sick. The reason \nwas, of course, that she didn't feel sorry for herself. Holly summoned \nthe courage of a warrior to fight her disease. And with quiet dignity \nand the help of the Almighty, she fought as bravely as any soldier I \nhave ever known.\n  Her dedication to work, and to the people of South Carolina--whom she \nconsidered her ``real bosses''--paled only to her devotion as a wife \nand a mother. Holly always made time for what was truly important in \nlife. She and her husband Phil together built a loving home and were \nblessed with two wonderful children. She was an active member of her \nparish, Saint Paul's Episcopal Church, in Virginia, and managed to make \ntime to be scout helper, soccer Mom and, above all, role model.\n  Holly's life was truly a gift, which she shared without reservation \nwith everyone she knew and loved. That gift now lives on in all of us--\nfor she inspired our lives, strengthened our spirits, and touched our \nhearts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/30/senate-section/article/S9589-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9589-S9590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  VALUE OF PUBLIC LANDS, NATIONAL PUBLIC LANDS DAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 2002\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, last Saturday was National Public Lands \nDay. It was a time for volunteers in states and communities across the \ncountry to give something back to America's public lands. National \nPublic Lands Day is the largest grassroots, volunteer effort mounted on \nbehalf of America's public parks, rivers, lakes, forest, rangelands, \nand beaches.\n  This year's National Public Lands Day theme was ``Explore America's \nBackyard,'' recognizing that many volunteers go to nearby public lands \nfor recreation and to enjoy the outdoors. These volunteers will put in \na day of real work on needed projects ranging from trail construction \nand repairs to habitat restoration to making public lands more \naccessible for disabled visitors.\n  This year's signature event was held at Anacostia Park in Washington, \nD.C. where over 400 volunteers cleared brush, removed trash and debris, \nplanted trees and grasses, and constructed benches and boardwalk \ntrails. These volunteers were joined by key dignitaries: Washington, \nD.C. Mayor Anthony Williams, the current Miss USA, Shauntay Hinton, \nNational Park Service Director Fran Mainella, Forest\n\n[[Page S9590]]\n\nService Assistant Chief Sally Collins, and Army Corps of Engineers \nBrigadier General Carl Strock.\n  The first National Public Lands Day, in 1994, was sponsored by three \nFederal agencies and attracted 700 volunteers in three sites. This year \nmarks the ninth annual event which involved approximately 70,000 \nvolunteers, who performed over eight million dollar's worth of \nimprovements to our public lands at nearly 500 locations in every \nstate. This effort involved over 19 Federal, State, local, and private \npartners on sites identified by eight Federal agencies.\n  I believe National Public Lands Day is an opportunity to build a \nsense of ownership by Americans--through personal involvement and \nconservation education.\n  In recognition of National Public Lands Day and this sense of \nownership we should all have for our public lands, I want to spend a \nfew minutes today and reflect on the value of our public lands and on \nwhat the future holds for them.\n  There are around 650 million acres of public lands in the United \nStates. This represents a major portion of our total land mass. \nHowever, most of these lands are concentrated in the West, where as \nmuch as 82 percent of a state can be composed of Federal land. In fact, \n63 percent of my own home State of Idaho is owned by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  This can be beneficial, as our public lands have a lot to offer. For \nstarters, there are numerous resources available on our public lands--\nfrom renewable forests to opportunities to raise livestock to oil and \nminerals beneath the surface--public lands hold a great deal of the \nresources we all depend on to live the lives we enjoy.\n  Having resources available on public lands affords us the opportunity \nfor a return on those resources to help fund government services, from \nschools to roads to national defense, and ease the burden on taxpayers.\n  Just as important, though, are the recreation opportunities our \npublic lands offer. Every day, people hike and pack into the solitude \nof wilderness areas, climb rocks, ski, camp, snowmobile, use off-road \nvehicles, hunt, fish, picnic, boat, swim, and the list goes on. Because \nthe lands are owned by all of us, the opportunity has existed for \neveryone to use the land within reasonable limits.\n  However, times are changing. We are in the midst of a slow and \nmethodical attack on our access to public lands. It started with the \nresources industries. It will not stop there. At the same time some \nradical groups are fighting to halt all resource management on our \npublic lands, they are working to restrict and, in some cases, \neliminate human access to our public lands for recreation.\n  Yes, we must manage our public lands responsibly, which includes \nrestrictions on some activities in some areas. What we must not do is \nunreasonably restrict or eliminate certain activities. Some people like \nto hike in backcountry areas where they can find peace and solitude \nwhile others prefer to ride ATVs into the woods. Some prefer to camp in \nmore developed facilities while others prefer primitive spots. The \npoint is that recreational opportunities on our public lands should be \nas diverse as the American public's interests.\n  On the same note, we can use the natural resources we need in an \nenvironmentally responsible manner and still have plenty of \nopportunities to recreate. In fact, recreation, resource, and \nenvironmental interests can team together to help each other out. In my \nown State of Idaho, on the Nez Perce National Forest, representatives \nof these interests and many others have come together through a \nstewardship project. These groups are working with the Forest Service \nto implement a project that works for everyone and addresses all of \ntheir needs in some fashion. In order to achieve such success, each \ngroup has had to compromise to agree on a prescription that works for \neveryone. This is just one example of differing interests working \ntogether to help each other out and improve the opportunities on our \npublic lands for everyone. We need to see more of this around the \ncountry.\n  Public land management has become embroiled in fights, appeals, and \nlitigation. The result is that the only ones who are winning are those \nwho want to ensure we don't use our public lands. This must stop. \nDiffering interests have to come together and realize that we all have \none common goal--use of the land in a responsible manner. We can not \ncontinue to make the same mistakes of the past on our public lands.\n  That being said, I would like each of my colleagues to think about \nhow public lands benefit their state and how they might work to support \nthe new generation that is working to make each day National Public \nLands Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/30/senate-section/article/S9590-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9590-S9591]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                            JOHN STALLWORTH\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nachievements of John Stallworth on the occasion of his recent induction \ninto the Pro Football Hall of Fame on August 4, 2002.\n  Mr. Stallworth was born on July 15, 1952 in Tuscaloosa, AL. At the \nage of 5 he was told by doctors that he had polio, later found to be a \nmis-diagnosis. Mr. Stallworth overcame that hurdle to excel at a number \nof sports. In high school, he served as captain of his school's \nfootball team and went on to play his college ball at Alabama A \nlocated in Normal, Alabama just outside of Huntsville. While at Alabama \nA, Mr. Stallworth was an All-Southern Intercollegiate Athletic \nConference receiver in 1972 and 1973 and became the Bulldogs' all-time \nleading receiver. He was also the first Alabama A player to be \nselected to participate in the Senior Bowl, college football's premiere \nall-star game in Mobile.\n  He was selected by the NFL Pittsburgh Steelers in the fourth round of \nthe 1974 NFL draft, the 82nd player taken that year. I think a few \nteams around the league kicked themselves later for passing him up when \nthey saw what he could do on the football field. After spending his \nfirst year as an understudy, he became a starter in his second season \nand held that job with the Steelers for the rest of his 14 year, 165-\ngame career. The 6-2, 191 pound receiver teamed first with Lynn Swann \nand later with Louis Lipps to give the Steelers unusually potent pass-\nreceiving tandems. Stallworth caught 537 passes for 8,723 yards and 63 \ntouchdowns, all Steelers team records. Stallworth won four Super Bowl \nchampionships playing in Super Bowls IX, X, XIII, and XIV. He played in \nsix AFC championship games and had 12 touchdowns and 17 consecutive \npostseason games with at least one reception. Stallworth, who scored \nthe winning touchdown on a 73-yard reception in Super Bowl XIV, holds \nSuper Bowl records for career average per catch--24.4 yards--and single \ngame average, 40.33 yards, in Super Bowl XIV. He was an All-Pro in 1979 \nand played in four Pro-Bowls. He was voted MVP by his teammates twice: \nin 1979 and 1984. Terry Bradshaw and Jack Lambert are the only other \nplayers who have received that honor two times. Stallworth was named to \nthe Steelers' All-Time Team in 1982 and the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame \nin 1989.\n  Never known for excessive celebration or as one who sought individual \nattention, Hall of Fame Coach Chuck Noll said of Stallworth:\n\n       John is a very special person. He is very much a team man \n     and you need that to be successful.\n\n  Following his Hall of Fame football career, Mr. Stallworth returned \nto Huntsville, Alabama completed his MBA from Alabama A Since then, \nhe has achieved great success in the field of business. He is \nCofounder, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Madison Research \nCorporation in Huntsville, Alabama. Under Mr. Stallworth's leadership, \nthe Madison Research Corporation has emerged as one of the premier \ntechnology companies in the State of Alabama with 2001 revenues of over \n$60 million and a current staff of over 650 people. Some of his \ncompany's clients include: the Department of Defense, all the military \nservices, the Department of Energy, NASA, the Defense Intelligence \nAgency, and a number of Fortune 500 companies. As a result of Mr. \nStallworth's leadership, Washington Technology Magazine ranked Madison \nResearch Company #11 of the nation's top 25 small, minority-owned \ntechnology companies. The company also received\n\n[[Page S9591]]\n\nthe 1998 Better Business Bureau of North Alabama's Torch Award for \nmarket ethics. This award was presented in recognition of Madison \nResearch's commitment to ethics in business. Mr. Stallworth also \nreceived the 1997 Region IV Minority Small Business Person of the Year \nAward, presented by the Small Business Administration.\n  Mr. Stallworth's dedication did not end with football or business. He \nhas given of himself to the city of Huntsville and the people of \nAlabama and they recently recognized his accomplishments with ``John \nStallworth Day in Huntsville''. At the celebration Mel Blount, himself \na Hall of Famer, spoke of Stallworth:\n\n       John Stallworth exemplifies what a true professional is all \n     about, not just in football but in the business world and in \n     life.\n\n  Mr. Stallworth has served on a number of boards including the United \nWay, the Museum of Aviation, the Madison County Chamber of Commerce, \nthe U.S. Space Camp, Harris Home for Underprivileged Children, and \nAlabama A University. He has been active with the Huntsville Boys and \nGirls Club, the United Negro College Fund, the Children's Advocacy \nCenter, the Rotary Club of Huntsville, the Alzheimer's Association of \nGreater Huntsville, and Big Brothers/Big Sisters of North Alabama to \nname a few. He is also chairman of the Board of Directors of the John \nL. Stallworth Scholarship Foundation which helps to promote the \neducation of our youth.\n  I have had the opportunity to get to know John Stallworth over the \nyears and I can say that I am proud to call him my friend. He has \nserved on my technology advisory committee and has been an asset to my \nwork here in the Senate. He has never hesitated to provide me with \nexpert counsel on important issues that have come before the Senate. It \nis very satisfying for me to see how he has overcome adversity in his \nlife to achieve greatness as a professional and as a human being. His \naccomplishments on and off the field have inspired thousands of our \nyoung people to strive for excellence and I applaud his efforts. The \nPeople of the State of Alabama are proud to call him our native son.\n  I am proud to recognize the accomplishments of a great American and \nAlabamian, John Stallworth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/30/senate-section/article/S9591-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9591-S9592]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TREATY TRIBES LOCATED IN THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am honored to represent a State \nthat has nine treaty tribes. It has become increasingly clear that \nnothing is more important to the tribes of South Dakota than the \nrecognition of the obligations this Nation has to the Indian people of \nSouth Dakota as spelled out by the treaties entered into by the United \nStates Government and the tribes of South Dakota. Especially at the \nurging of President John Steele of the Oglala Sioux Tribe and Chairman \nAndrew Grey of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe, I offer this \nstatement pertaining to this issue of critical importance to the tribes \nlocated within my home State of South Dakota. As you know, the South \nDakota tribes have a proud history of providing leadership to Indian \nissues. I thank President Steele and Chairman Grey for helping me \nunderstand this issue. It is with the utmost respect that I share with \nyou some of our tribes' perspective on what treaties mean to them, as \nfollows:\n\n       It is important to note that each of the Tribes located in \n     the State of South Dakota have entered into treaties with the \n     Federal Government. All federally recognized Indian tribes \n     and villages are often categorized into the same class. \n     However, important rights were guaranteed to the South Dakota \n     tribes by treaty, and many of these rights continue to be \n     enforceable today. From the first treaty with the Delawares \n     in 1787 until the end of treaty-making in 1871, hundreds of \n     agreements were entered between the Federal Government and \n     various bands and tribes of Indians. Provisions of the \n     treaties differ widely, but it was common to include a \n     guarantee of peace, a delineation of boundaries, often with a \n     cession of specific lands from the tribe to the Federal \n     Government, a guarantee of Indian hunting and fishing rights, \n     often applying to the ceded land, a statement that the tribe \n     recognized the authority or placed itself under the \n     protection of the United States, and an agreement regarding \n     the regulation of trade and travel of persons in the Indian \n     territory. Treaties also commonly included agreements by each \n     side to punish and compensate for acts of depredation by \n     ``bad men'' among their own number, a clause that still can \n     support a claim against the Unites States. See Tsosie v. \n     United States, 825 F.2d 393 (Fed.Cir. 1987).\n       Indian treaties stand on essentially the same footing as \n     treaties with foreign nations. Because they are made pursuant \n     to the Constitution, they take precedence over any \n     conflicting State laws by reason of the Supremacy Clause. \n     U.S. Const., Art. VI, Sec. 2; Worcester v. Georgia, 31 U.S. \n     (6 Pet.) 515 (1832). They are also the exclusive prerogative \n     of the Federal Government. The First Trade and Intercourse \n     Act, 1 Stat. 137 (1790), forbade the transfer of Indian lands \n     to individuals or States except by treaty ``under the \n     authority of the United States.'' This provision, repeated in \n     later Trade and Intercourse Acts, has become of tremendous \n     importance in recent years, for several eastern States \n     negotiated large land cessions from Indian tribes near the \n     end of the eighteenth century. In County of Oneida v. Oneida \n     Indian Nation, 470 U.S. 226, (1985), the Court held invalid a \n     treaty entered in 1795 between the Oneidas and the State of \n     New York. The treaty, which had been concluded without the \n     participation of the Federal Government, transferred \n     100,000 acres of Indian lands to the state. The Court held \n     that the tribe still had a viable claim for damages. \n     Similar claims exist in other eastern states; in Maine, \n     the likely invalidity of a 1795 state-tribal treaty \n     clouded land titles covering about sixty percent of the \n     State until legislation settled the issue. See Joint \n     Tribal Council of Passamaquoddy Tribe v. Morton, 528 F.2d \n     370, 1st Cir.1975; Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act, \n     P.L. 96-420, 94 Stat. 1785, 1980.\n       Not only is the treaty-making power exclusively federal, it \n     is almost entirely presidential. While it is true that two-\n     thirds of the Senate must concur in any treaty, the \n     initiation of the process and the terms of negotiation are \n     inevitably controlled by the executive branch. Indeed, there \n     were many instances, especially in California, where \n     executive officials negotiated treaties and acted upon them \n     despite the failure of the Senate to ratify them. In the \n     middle of the eighteenth century, Congress and particularly \n     the House of Representatives grew increasingly resentful of \n     being excluded from the direction of Indian affairs. The \n     ultimate result was the passage in 1871 of a rider to an \n     Indian appropriations act providing that ``No Indian nation \n     or tribe . . . shall be acknowledged or recognized as an \n     independent nation, tribe, or power with whom the United \n     States may contract by treaty.'' 25 U.S.C.A. Sec. 71. The \n     rider also specified that existing treaty obligations were \n     not impaired. As an attempt to limit by statute the \n     President's constitutional treaty-making power, the rider may \n     well be invalid, but it accomplished its purpose nonetheless \n     by making it clear that no further treaties would be \n     ratified. Indian treaty-making consequently ended in 1871. \n     Thereafter formal agreements made with the tribes were either \n     approved by both houses of Congress or were simply embodied \n     in statutes.\n       Congress, in declaring that Indian tribes should no longer \n     be acknowledged as independent political entities with whom \n     the Untied States might contract by treaty, did not end the \n     tribal organization of Indian communities. The solution to \n     the 1871 Act was the use of ``treaty substitutes that \n     consisted of agreements that were directed and authorized by \n     Congress. Yet, other agreements were negotiated by the Indian \n     Office to solve particular needs or resulted from Indian \n     initiative. Most concerned cessation of land or other \n     modification of boundaries whereby the need to declare peace \n     between two sovereign nations was no longer an essential \n     goal. Although such agreements were similar to treaties, \n     Tribal consent was no longer a prerequisite to establish a \n     binding agreement.\n       Many reservations were established by Executive Order \n     issued by the President of the United States. Although no \n     general law existed authorizing set asides for Indian use, \n     Congress and the public acquiesced and the Courts upheld the \n     action. Executive orders differed from treaties wherefore \n     they could be easily changed and a new one substituted as \n     occasion demanded. They were neither uniform in terminology \n     nor scope. In addition, a reservation could be established by \n     administrative action prior to the issuance of an executive \n     order and later sanctioned by the official action taken by \n     the President. A 1952 Report by the Commissioner of Indian \n     Affairs found that of the total of 42,785,935 acres of Tribal \n     trust land only 9,471,081 acres had been established by \n     Treaty\n\n[[Page S9592]]\n\n     and the remaining 23,043,439 acres of trust land were \n     established by executive order.\n       Federally-recognized Indian tribes in South Dakota signed \n     the Treaty of Fort Laramie with the desire to declare peace \n     and thereby perpetuate a Nation-to-Nation relationship with \n     the Federal Government. The common misperception that most \n     Tribes have entered into treaties with the United States \n     serves as a great injustice to Tribes who have entered into \n     such formal and solemn agreements. In 1890 there were 162 \n     established Tribes; 56 of those were established by executive \n     order, 6 by executive order under the authority of Congress, \n     28 by acts of Congress, 15 by treaty and executive order, 5 \n     by treaty or agreement and an act of Congress, 1 by \n     unratified treaty and 51 by treaty or agreement. The treaty \n     establishing the South Dakota Tribes is a contract negotiated \n     between sovereign nations, relating to peace and alliance \n     formally acknowledged by the signatories of the nations. The \n     United States entered into such agreement because they \n     desired peace and cessions of land from the Sioux Tribes, and \n     in return they made promises that must be upheld. In \n     conclusion, it is appropriate to recognize the special status \n     of the treaty tribes located in South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/30/senate-section/article/S9592-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9592]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   GUADALUPE MOUNTAINS NATIONAL PARK\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN.

Mr. President, yesterday marked the end of the \nMajor League Baseball regular season. Fans everywhere have enjoyed a \nseason with Barry Bonds leading the league in hitting, Alex Rodriguez \nhitting 57 home runs, and Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling combining as \nperhaps the greatest pitching duo ever. It has been a tremendous season \nof achievement for many teams. The Minnesota Twins, a team Commissioner \nSelig wanted to disband last off-season, won the American League \nCentral Division. The Oakland A's set an American League record with a \n20-game winning streak and won the American League's Western Division.\n  Eight teams, and fans from across the country and around the world, \nare now gearing up for an exciting playoff season. The Twins and the \nA's, as well as the Anaheim Angels, the St. Louis Cardinals and the San \nFrancisco Giants, have earned the opportunity to continue into the \nplayoffs, to compete for a pennant and even the World Series \nchampionship along with last year's champion Arizona Diamondbacks, the \nNew York Yankees and the Atlanta Braves. They are not the eight teams \nwith the highest payrolls or biggest markets. They do share a few \nthings in common: talented players having outstanding seasons, great \nteam play and exceptional management both on and off the field.\n  We are fortunate that this baseball season is being played to its \nrightful conclusion and that crisis was avoided on August 30, when \nnegotiators for team owners and the Major League Baseball Players Union \nreached a new collective bargaining agreement. Announced just two hours \nbefore another work stoppage, this agreement saved professional \nbaseball from a disastrous screeching halt to yet another baseball \nseason.\n  With this agreement baseball can now go about the business of \nassessing the future of the sport in Montreal. It is unfortunate that \nthis fine city, its team with a number of outstanding players, and its \nfans have been left in limbo for the past year over the future of the \nfranchise. For a large number of Vermonters, Montreal provides the \nclosest major league venue. This franchise is the major league \naffiliate for our own minor league Vermont Expos. There are many \ndedicated Expos fans in my State. Several local towns are doing their \nbest to show their support for keeping the Expos in Montreal. I ask \nthat a letter recently sent by the St. Albans Town Selectboard to the \nMayor of Montreal be printed in the Record.\n  The letter follows:\n                                                  August 12, 2002.\n     Mayor Gerald Tremblay,\n     Montreal, Quebec.\n       Mayor Tremblay, the St. Albans Town Selectboard wishes to \n     express our utmost hope that the city of Montreal tries \n     everything possible to help retain the Montreal Expos.\n       Montreal is a beautiful international city with much \n     diversity and many different types of cultures. We believe \n     the Expos are a large part of the city and it serves to bring \n     many people from Northern Vermont to your city every year.\n       With a downtown stadium, we believe the Expos can flourish \n     once again and help attract many more tourists to your \n     wonderful city. We hope that you and your government are \n     trying everything possible to work with new-interested \n     buyers.\n       If the Town of St. Albans can be of assistance please feel \n     free to contact us.\n       Cordially Yours,\n                                                   Tayt R. Brooks,\n                                                       Vice-Chair.\n\n  Mr. President, through repeated hearings in the Judiciary Committee, \nCongress has tried to help the major league baseball owners and players \nfind common ground. After the last work stoppage, we culminated almost \na decade of hearings examining labor strife and other problems in major \nleague baseball, when we enacted the Curt Flood Act in 1998. Senator \nHatch was the lead sponsor of that measure, and I was his principal \ncosponsor. It was a bipartisan effort to clarify the law. By that \neffort we hoped to promote labor peace in Major League Baseball.\n  The principle purpose of the law was to make clear that federal \nantitrust laws apply to the relationships\n\n[[Page S9593]]\n\nbetween major league team owners and players. Clarifying the law was \nintended to contribute to an atmosphere in which management and labor, \nowners and players would resolve their differences through collective \nbargaining rather than through work stoppages. I hope that the Curt \nFlood Act and our efforts over the last several years, including the \nhearing we held this Congress at the requests of Senators Wellstone, \nDayton, Dorgan and Johnson, contributed in some small way to creating a \nlegal framework and atmosphere in which the parties could resolve their \ndifferences through agreement.\n  Fortunately, baseball has avoided its ninth work stoppage since 1972. \nDuring the previous eight work stoppages, 1,736 games were lost--\nincluding 938 that were wiped out because of the 1994-95 labor war. \nClearly, another work stoppage would have had serious consequences for \nthe professional game. I congratulate Commissioner Selig, Bob Dupuy and \ntheir team and Don Fehr and his team on reaching an accord.\n  Earlier this year Forbes Magazine estimated that the New York Yankees \nwere worth $730 million. The New York Mets were the next-highest valued \nfranchise at $482 million, followed by the Los Angeles Dodgers ($435 \nmillion) and the Boston Red Sox ($426 million). Even, the Montreal \nExpos franchise was valued at over $100 million. The average annual \nsalary for major league players this season reportedly is $2.8 million.\n  We all hope the recent labor agreement marks a new era of cooperation \nin Major League Baseball. I remind both the owners and the players that \nthe responsibility for preserving the best of our national pastime--and \nfor restoring the faith and enthusiasm of the fans across the United \nStates--is their opportunity in the coming months and years.\n  May all of the fans of professional baseball enjoy an exciting post-\nseason, and I wish each of the playoffs teams well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/30/senate-section/article/S9593-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9593-S9594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             RONALD REAGAN\n\n Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize one of our \ngreatest American Presidents and one of the most important world \nleaders of the 20th century, the 40th President of the United States, \nRonald Reagan.\n  One year ago, Kyung Hee University in Korea awarded President Reagan \nthe Great World Peace Award for his commitment to world peace.\n  President Reagan was a steadfast and true friend of South Korea. \nFormer Secretary of State George Shultz wrote that ``To Ronald Reagan, \nSouth Korea was a stalwart ally and a valiant symbol of resistance to \ncommunism.'' The Soviet downing of the Korean Airlines flight 007 in \nSeptember 1983, and the terrorist bombing the next month that killed 16 \nSouth Koreans, including Foreign Minister Lee Bum Suk and 3 Cabinet \nministers, only reinforced President Reagan's determination to visit \nthe Republic of Korea that November. President Reagan addressed the \nKorean National Assembly on November 12, 1983, and said to the people \nof South Korea: ``In these days of turmoil and testing, the American \npeople are very thankful for such a constant and devoted ally. Today, \nAmerica is grateful. to you.''\n  President Reagan and his administration stood by South Korea during a \nvolatile and historic period, including the North Korean terrorist \nbombing of Korean Airlines flight 858 in November 1987, which killed \n115 South Korean citizens; the first peaceful transfer of power from \nPresident Chun Doo Hwan to President Roh Tae Woo in February 1988; and \nthe 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul.\n  As we see both opportunity and risk on the Korean Peninsula, \nincluding the recent ground breaking visit of Japanese Prime Minister \nJunichiro Koizumi to Pyongyang, the commitment of President Reagan and \nthe United States to peace through strength on the Korean peninsula and \nthroughout Asia and the world remains strong.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the statement of Ambassador Joseph Verner \nReed, who last year accepted the Great World Peace Award on behalf of \nPresident Reagan, be printed in the Record.\n  The statement follows.\n\n    Remarks by Ambassador Joseph Verner Reed on the Occasion of the \n  Awarding to President Ronald W. Reagan the Great World Peace Award, \n   Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Republic of Korea, September 27, 2001\n\n\n                                america\n\n     ``One flag,\n       one land,\n         one heart,\n           one hand,\n             one Nation,\n               evermore.''\n\n                                           --Oliver Wendell Holmes\n\n     Chancellor Young Seek Choue,\n       Distinguished Friends: It is a signal honor for me to be in \n     Seoul, the noble nation of the Republic of Korea to represent \n     President Ronald W. Reagan and to accept on the President's \n     behalf the Great World Peace Award from Keyung Hee \n     University.\n       I have the highest regard for Chancellor Choue. I stand \n     with great respect for the Chancellor's extraordinary \n     achievements in the world of education and in his untiring \n     quest to seek peace on our troubled planet. As the godfather \n     of the International Day of Peace his legacy is assured by \n     leaders around the globe. As a spirited leader in education \n     in this great country of Korea his fame and presence in \n     modern day Korean history is already set in granite. I salute \n     the Chancellor.\n       President Reagan is a most deserving leader to receive this \n     Award. The President's close friend and colleague Charles Z. \n     Wick, who was a senior official in both Reagan \n     Administrations, was to have journeyed to Seoul to accept the \n     Award. The Day of Terror precluded that.\n       I stand humbly before you to accept the Award for the \n     President. Having served in President Reagan's two \n     Administrations--first as envoy to the Kingdom of Morocco and \n     then as envoy to the United Nations, I appreciate and applaud \n     what the President did in searching for peace--the \n     President's vision brought stability to the globe. President \n     Reagan defined and symbolized Peace--peace among mankind.\n       I stand before you as an American.\n\n\n                     the war against THE TERRORIST\n\n       September 11.--I was on my way to the United Nations to \n     participate in the opening of the General Assembly on the \n     very day when we should have been celebrating the \n     International Day of Peace at the Parliament of Man.\n       8:48 a.m.--And the world as we knew it changed forever in a \n     millisecond. The Day of Terror and the aftermath was, is and \n     continues to be a shock for the world. Americans and friends \n     around the globe are reeling from the attack on America's \n     sovereignty.\n       As a diplomat working for you at your United Nations I have \n     a perspective on the catastrophe. I am going to place my \n     citizen of the United States hat on with these few \n     observations--observations that I sincerely regret to make on \n     an occasion when we should all be in celebration of Peace.\n       This war will be won or lost by the American citizens, not \n     diplomats, politicians or soldiers.\n       In spite of what the media is telling us, this act was not \n     committed by a group of mentally deranged fanatics. To \n     dismiss them as such would be among the gravest of mistakes. \n     This attack was committed by a ferocious, intelligent and \n     dedicated adversary. Don't take this the wrong way. I don't \n     admire these men and I deplore their tactics, but I respect \n     their capabilities. The many parallels that have been made \n     with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor are apropos. It was \n     a brilliant sneak attack against a complacent America.\n       These men hate the United States with all of their being, \n     and we must not underestimate the power of their moral \n     commitment. Napoleon, perhaps the world's greatest \n     combination of soldier and statesman, stated ``the moral is \n     the physical as three is to one.'' Our enemies are willing--\n     better said, anxious--to give their lives for their cause.\n       In addition to the demonstration of great moral conviction, \n     the recent attack demonstrated a mastery of some of the basic \n     fundamentals of warfare namely: simplicity, security and \n     surprise.\n       This was not a random act of violence, and we can expect \n     the same sort of military competence to be displayed in the \n     battle to come.\n       This war will escalate, and a good portion of it may happen \n     right in the United States.\n       These men will not go easily into the night. They do not \n     fear us. We must not fear them. In spite of our overwhelming \n     conventional strength as the world's only ``superpower'', we \n     are the underdog in this fight. As you listen to the \n     carefully scripted rhetoric designed to prepare us for the \n     march for war, please realize that America is not equipped or \n     seriously trained for the battle ahead. To be certain, our \n     soldiers are much better than the enemy, and we have some \n     excellent ``counter-terrorist'' organizations, but they are \n     mostly trained for hostage rescues, airfield seizures, or the \n     occasional ``body snatch,'' (Which may come in handy). We \n     will be fighting a war of annihilation, because if their \n     early efforts are any indication, our enemies are ready and \n     willing to die to the last man. Eradicating the enemy will be \n     costly and time consuming. They have already deployed their \n     forces in as many as 20 countries. They are likely living the \n     lives of everyday citizens as ``next door.'' Simply put, our \n     soldiers will be tasked with a search and destroy mission on \n     multiple foreign landscapes, and the public must be patient \n     and supportive until the strategy and tactics can be worked \n     out.\n       For the most part, our military is still in the process of \n     redefining itself and presided over by men and women who grew \n     up with, and were promoted because they excelled in--``The \n     Cold War--doctrine, strategy and tactics. This will not be \n     linear warfare, there will be no clear ``centers of gravity'' \n     to strike with high technology weapons.\n       America's vast technological edge will certainly be \n     helpful, but it will not be decisive. Perhaps the perfect \n     metaphor for the coming battle was introduced by the \n     terrorists themselves aboard the hijacked aircraft--this will \n     be ``a knife fight'', it will be won or\n\n[[Page S9594]]\n\n     lost by the ingenuity and will of citizens and soldiers, not \n     by software or ``smart bombs'''.\n       Unlike Americans, who are eager to put this messy time \n     behind us, our adversaries have time on their side, and they \n     will use it. They plan to flight a battle of attrition, \n     hoping to drag the battle out until the American public loses \n     its will to fight.\n       It is clear to me that the will of the American citizenry \n     is the center of gravity the enemy has targeted. It will be \n     the fulcrum upon which victory or defeat will turn.\n       The Prussian General Carl von Clausewitz, says that there \n     is a ``remarkable trinity of war'' that is composed of (1) \n     the will of the people, (2) the political leadership of the \n     government, and (3) the chance and probability that plays out \n     on the field of battle--in that order. Every American \n     citizen, not just those who were unfortunate enough to be in \n     the World Trade Center or Pentagon, was in the crosshairs of \n     last Tuesday's attack. The will of the American people will \n     decide this war.\n       If America is to win, it will be because we have what it \n     takes to persevere through a few more hits, learn from our \n     mistakes, improvise and adapt. If we can do that, we will \n     eventually prevail.\n       New York's remarkable response to the catastrophic attack \n     at the World Trade Center has been well documented. Above the \n     tragic din, at the very highest level of government, have \n     come the essential voices of sanity. In closing, may I say \n     that after all that has just passed, all the lives taken and \n     all the possibilities and hopes that died with them, it is \n     natural to wonder if America's future is one of fear. Some \n     speak of an age of terror. With the obscene toll of those \n     lost climbing above 6,000, it is hard to speak without rage.\n       In Korea and on this Peninsula you have known all too well \n     the ravages of war and occupation. It is therefore why I have \n     taken you time today to share my observations on the world we \n     live in and what we may have to expect. I know there are \n     struggles ahead and dangers to face. As an American and a \n     friend of the Republic of Korea I can say frankly that I \n     believe America will define our times, not be defined by \n     them. As long as the United States of America is determined \n     and strong, this will not be the age of terror. This will be \n     the age of liberty in America and across the world.\n       I know you will join me in extending our deepest sympathies \n     to the thousands affected by the tragic events of September \n     11. It was a Day of Terror and the aftermath has been of \n     unspeakable pain. Our hearts and prayers extend to all--the \n     victims, their families and all those who hold America so \n     dear.\n       Chancellor Choue--on behalf of President Ronald W. Reagan I \n     extend great thanks to you for offering the President this \n     Award. With humbleness, with honor and with great pride, I \n     accept on behalf of President Ronald Reagan, this most \n     distinguished Award--The Great World Peace Award.\n       Chancellor Choue, ladies and gentleman, keep faith in \n     America--the outcome of the battle is certain.\n       God Bless America!\n       Thank you!\n       Happy Chusok.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/30/senate-section/article/S9594-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING BIODIESEL-FUELED DRAGSTER\n\n Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity \nto recognize a remarkable achievement receiving worldwide attention \nfrom farmers, environmentalists, and racing fans. The Smith family of \nPuxico, MO, has set repeated world records with its biodiesel-fueled \ndragster named ``Wild Thang.'' Wild Thang is a family affair for the \nSmiths. Mark Smith drives the dragster, assisted by his wife Shelia and \nsons Jared and Cannon. Their ingenuity has helped showcase the \nlimitless potential of biofuels. They make me proud to be a Missourian.\n  Wild Thang is fueled 100 percent by biodiesel, a soybean-based \nrenewable fuel that can help us rely on the Midwest, rather than the \nMiddle East to meet our energy needs. The Smiths are proving in \nappearances across the Nation that soybean-based biodiesel can perform \nunder the most rigorous conditions. Wild Thang produces 6,000 pounds of \nthrust and five g's of force against the driver's body while \naccelerating. In just 3.8 seconds, Wild Thang can travel \\1/8\\ of a \nmile.\n  I commend the Smith family and their network of supporters for their \nhard work. They are tremendous ambassadors for rural Missouri and for \nbiodiesel. I am confident that the future will prove that the efforts \nof the Smith family are playing a key role in promoting of farmer-\nproduced biofuels. These fuels have unlimited potential to revitalize \nrural economies while preserving the environment. I commend the Smith \nfamily's achievements, and wish them continued success as they continue \ntheir exciting endeavor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/30/senate-section/article/S9594-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/30/senate-section/article/S9594-3", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/30/senate-section/article/S9594-4", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 3, 2001, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on September 30, 2002, during the recess \nof the Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker has signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 1646.

A bill to designate the United States courthouse at South \nFederal Place in Santa Fe, New Mexico, as the ``Santiago E. Campos \nUnited States Courthouse''; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator \nDomenici to introduce a bill to designate the United States Courthouse \nin Santa Fe, NM, as the ``Honorable Santiago E. Campos United States \nCourthouse.'' Santiago Campos was appointed to the Federal Bench in \n1978 by President Jimmy Carter and was the first Hispanic Federal judge \nin New Mexico. He held the title of Chief U.S. District Judge from \nFebruary 5, 1987 to December 31, 1989, and took senior status in 1992. \nJudge Campos had his chambers in the courthouse in Santa Fe for over 22 \nyears. He was also the prime mover in reestablishing Federal court \njudicial activity in Santa Fe and in renovating the courthouse there.\n  Sadly, Judge Campos passed away January 20, 2001 after a long battle \nwith cancer. Judge Campos was not only a great man, but also a \ndedicated and passionate public servant who spent most of his life \ncommitted to working for the people of New Mexico and our Nation. Judge \nCampos was an extraordinary jurist and served as a role model and \nmentor to others in New Mexico. He was admired and respected by all \nthat knew him. I believe that it would be an appropriate tribute to \nJudge Campos to have the courthouse in Santa Fe bear his name.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE:\n  S. 3016. A bill to amend the Farm Security and Rural Investment act \nof 2002 to require the Secretary of Agriculture to establish research, \nextension, and educational programs to implement biobased energy \ntechnologies, products, and economic diversification in rural areas of \nthe United States; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. DASHCLE. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Sun Grant \nInitiative for Renewable Energy and Biobased Products Act. The Sun \nGrant Initiative, or SGI, reflects a dynamic vision for the future of \nagriculture and rural America--a vision that can reduce our dependence \non foreign energy, provide environmentally-friendly biobased \nalternative products, and infuse needed economic development for our \nnation's rural communities. SGI will build upon what our nation does \nbest by using the power of innovation to open up new avenues of \nopportunity.\n  Specifically, SGI would identify new methods of converting various \ncrop varieties and biobased natural resources into energy and other \nvalue-added products and provide a technology transfer of those \nproducts by:\n  Establishing a national consortium of land-grant universities to lead \nthe SGI effort in coordination with the U.S. Departments of Agriculture \nand Energy.\n  The mission of the consortium would be to make significant advances--\nnot only in technological developments, but also in making sure those \nnew technologies make it to market, therefore providing income \nalternatives to farmers and ranchers and providing opportunities for \neconomic diversification to rural communities.\n  Increasing our nation's investment in renewable fuels and other \nproducts like pharmaculticals, building materials including bio-\nplastics, textiles, lubricants, solvents, and adhesives.\n  Providing a framework for new investments in necessary research, and \nfor ensuring that producers, communities, and our nation as a whole \nbenefit from the results of that research.\n  I am hopeful that Senators will review the legislation and consider \ncosponsoring this exciting effort to help build a biobased economy that \ncan assist our nation in so many important ways.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN:\n  S. 3017. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to provide \nretroactive effect to a sentencing safety valve provision; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Safety Valve \nFairness Act. This bill addresses inequities in sentencing that were \ncreated by the passage of ``safety valve'' provisions contained in the \n1994 crime bill.\n  Mandatory minimum sentencing laws allow judges little or no \ndiscretion in making sentencing determinations. An unfortunate \nbyproduct of this lack of discretion has been the imposition of \ndisproportionately long sentences for some relatively low-level \nnonviolent offenders.\n  Congress acknowledged this in enacting so-called ``safety valve'' \nprovisions as part of the 1994 crime bill. These provisions allowed a \nnarrow class of offenders, that is individuals with no criminal \nhistory, who committed a nonviolent crime, were not leaders or \norganizers of the crime, and who cooperated fully with the government, \nto petition the court for a review of their sentence. However, the \nsafety valve provisions did not apply to offenders sentenced before the \nbill became law in 1994. As a result, individuals who have arguably \nbeen most impacted by the mandatory minimum sentencing laws that the \nsafety valve provisions sought to remedy, have been unable to benefit \nfrom their passage. This bill would rectify this situation by making \nthe safety valve provisions retroactive to allow first-time nonviolent \ndrug offenders convicted prior to the passage of the 1994 crime bill to \npetition the court for a reconsideration of their sentence.\n  The existing safety valve law is not a ``get out of jail free'' card. \nIt simply allows prisoners to petition the courts for reconsideration. \nIn order to have the mandatory minimum sentenced modified, offenders \nmust first demonstrate to the court that they meet the criteria I \nmentioned earlier. It is up to the court to determine whether an \nindividual is eligible to have their sentence modified and that a \nmodification is appropriate in each case. I believe the original safety \nvalve provisions appropriately restored discretion to the courts and \nit's only fair that the law be changed so it applies equally to all \nindividuals without regard to when they were convicted.\n  Making the safety valve provisions retroactive would impact only an \nextremely small number of cases. According to the United States \nSentencing Commission, only 25 to 40 currently incarcerated federal \noffenders would be eligible to petition the court to reconsider their \nsentences. All of these individuals have served at least eight years in \nprison and many have served significantly longer. Mr. President, I \nrequest unanimous consent to print a letter from the Sentencing \nCommission in the Record.\n  The same considerations that motivated the Senate's original passage \nof the safety valve legislation apply to those offenders who were \nsentenced before 1994. Fairness dictates that all those offenders who \nmeet the criteria set out in the safety valve law should have their \ncases heard and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                                   U.S. Sentencing Commission,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 2002.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, D.C.\n       Dear Senator Levin: Thank you for your June 14, 2002, \n     letter inquiring about the number of federal offenders who \n     would be affected if the ``safety valve'' provision enacted \n     on September 13, 1994, were made retroactive. We estimate \n     that 25 to 40 federal offenders currently incarcerated would \n     benefit if the safety valve provision of the 1994 Crime Bill \n     were made retroactive to cases sentenced prior to September \n     13, 1994.\n       We cannot provide a more exact figure because of a number \n     of data limitations. In order for the safety valve to apply, \n     the sentencing judge must find that the offender meets \n     certain criteria defined by Congress. For example, one such \n     criterion is whether the defendant truthfully provided to the \n     Government all information and evidence the defendant had \n     concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same \n     course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan. Because this \n     criterion was not relevant to sentencing prior to the \n     enactment of the safety valve provision, presentence reports \n     for cases sentenced prior to September 13, 1994, do not\n\n[[Page S9597]]\n\n     necessarily address this factor. As a result, to respond to \n     your inquiry we had to use receipt of a sentencing reduction \n     for acceptance of responsibility as a rough proxy for this \n     particular safety valve criterion, which may overstate or \n     understate the actual number of offenders who would meet this \n     criterion if the safety value were made retroactive. Proxies \n     for certain other safety valve criterion also had to be used. \n     In addition, the Commission does not have complete data with \n     respect to release dates for offenders.\n       I hope you find this information helpful.\n           Sincerely,\n     Diana E.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The use of computers and the Internet is rapidly \n     transforming societal interactions and the relationships \n     among citizens, private businesses, and the Government.\n       (2) The Federal Government has had uneven success in \n     applying advances in information technology to enhance \n     governmental functions and services, achieve more efficient \n     performance, increase access to Government information, and \n     increase citizen participation in Government.\n       (3) Most Internet-based services of the Federal Government \n     are developed and presented separately, according to the \n     jurisdictional boundaries of an individual department or \n     agency, rather than being integrated cooperatively according \n     to function or topic.\n       (4) Internet-based Government services involving \n     interagency cooperation are especially difficult to develop \n     and promote, in part because of a lack of sufficient funding \n     mechanisms to support such interagency cooperation.\n       (5) Electronic Government has its impact through improved \n     Government performance and outcomes within and across \n     agencies.\n       (6) Electronic Government is a critical element in the \n     management of Government, to be implemented as part of a \n     management framework that also addresses finance, \n     procurement, human capital, and other challenges to improve \n     the performance of Government.\n       (7) To take full advantage of the improved Government \n     performance that can be achieved through the use of Internet-\n     based technology requires strong leadership, better \n     organization, improved interagency collaboration, and more \n     focused oversight of agency compliance with statutes related \n     to information resource management.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this division are the \n     following:\n       (1) To provide effective leadership of Federal Government \n     efforts to develop and promote electronic Government services \n     and processes by establishing an Administrator of a new \n     Office of Electronic Government within the Office of \n     Management and Budget.\n       (2) To promote use of the Internet and other information \n     technologies to provide increased opportunities for citizen \n     participation in Government.\n       (3) To promote interagency collaboration in providing \n     electronic Government services, where this collaboration \n     would improve the service to citizens by integrating related \n     functions, and in the use of internal electronic Government \n     processes, where this collaboration would improve the \n     efficiency and effectiveness of the processes.\n       (4) To improve the ability of the Government to achieve \n     agency missions and program performance goals.\n       (5) To promote the use of the Internet and emerging \n     technologies within and across Government agencies to provide \n     citizen-centric Government information and services.\n       (6) To reduce costs and burdens for businesses and other \n     Government entities.\n       (7) To promote better informed decisionmaking by policy \n     makers.\n       (8) To promote access to high quality Government \n     information and services across multiple channels.\n       (9) To make the Federal Government more transparent and \n     accountable.\n       (10) To transform agency operations by utilizing, where \n     appropriate, best practices from public and private sector \n     organizations.\n       (11) To provide enhanced access to Government information \n     and services in a manner consistent with laws regarding \n     protection of personal privacy, national security, records \n     retention, access for persons with disabilities, and other \n     relevant laws.\n\n   TITLE XXXI--OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET ELECTRONIC GOVERNMENT \n                                SERVICES\n\n     SEC. 3101.

Mr. President, we have had another unproductive day. As you \nknow, we are starting the fifth week on homeland security and the \nInterior appropriations bill. As I said a few weeks ago, it appears the \nother side does not want us to pass these two bills, and they are \naccomplishing what they set out to do. We are not doing the work of the \ncountry.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, we have lost 2 million jobs in the \nlast 18 months. We have had the weakest economic growth in some 50 \nyears. Business investment has been down in each of the last six \nquarters, the weakest trend in 50 years. There has been a $4.5 trillion \nloss in stock market wealth, the sharpest decline since President \nHoover--$440 billion lost in 401(k) and IRA retirement savings this \npast year--and the median family income was down last year, the first \ndecrease in 12 years. The Nasdaq stock exchange was down to its lowest \nlevel in 6 years. Of course, it dropped again today. The Dow Jones \ndropped again today. The poverty rate is up for the first time in 10 \nyears.\n  We have a lot of problems with the economy, and we are not addressing \nthem. We are focused on Iraq. I have no problem focusing on Iraq, but \nwe can focus on more than one issue, and we have not done that. I do \nnot think that is good for the people of the State I represent, the \npeople the Presiding Officer represents, or anyplace else in the \ncountry.\n  I hope we can change direction from what we are doing now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/30/senate-section/article/S9649-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            A FOND FAREWELL\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I came to the Congress 10 years ago. One of \nthe people with whom I came was Bob Torricelli. He and I have been \nfriends for 20 years now. I didn't know him before he and I were \nelected to the House of Representatives. Today, he announced he was not \ngoing to continue in his election, and I feel terrible about it. It \nshows the class he has. I talked to Senator Torricelli this afternoon. \nHe recognizes the Senate seat in New Jersey is more important than him. \nAs a result of that, he knows it would be better for the institution, \nthe Senate, that he not continue in his election contest.\n  For me, the memories of having served with this fine man are very \nsignificant. The work he did first as the assistant to Senator Bob \nKerry's campaign committee and then as chairman of the campaign \ncommittee will be written in the history books. He did the impossible. \nHe did what only he said could be done. Most of us did not believe he \ncould do what he did, and that is elect all the Democrats he was \nresponsible for because he made us competitive. He was a voracious \nfundraiser.\n  I extend my best wishes to Bob Torricelli. I congratulate him for the \n20 years of service to the State of New Jersey and the country as a \nMember of the U.S. Congress. I do hope his great talents will be used. \nHe is a fine speaker. He has a great mind. His knowledge of foreign \naffairs is unsurpassed.\n  He and I served together on that committee in the House of \nRepresentatives. I wish I had words to describe the affection I have \nfor Senator Torricelli and the expression I would like to make of the \ncourage he showed this afternoon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/30/senate-section/article/S9649-3", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9649-S9650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      REMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SECRECY--TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 107-17\n\n  Mr. REID.

I transmit also, for the \ninformation of the Senate, the report of the Department of State \nconcerning these revisions.\n  The 1992 Partial Revision, which was adopted at WARC-92, constitutes \na revision of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Radio \nRegulations (Geneva, 1979), as revised, to which the United States is a \nparty. It provides for additional spectrum for new or expanding \ntelecommunication services, primarily terrestrial and satellite \nbroadcasting, terrestrial and satellite mobile and space services and \nis consistent with the proposals and positions taken by the United \nStates at the conference.\n  Subject to the U.S. declarations and reservations mentioned above, I \nbelieve that the United States should become a party to the 1992 \nPartial Revision, which provides additional spectrum for existing and \nnew telecommunication services in which the United States plays a \nsignificant leadership role. It is my hope that the Senate will take \nearly action on this matter and give its advice and consent to \nratification.\n                                                      George W.
