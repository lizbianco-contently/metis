Durbin, Herb \n           Kohl.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is with regret that we are filing this \ncloture motion this morning. Obviously, it won't ripen until Friday. I \ndon't know that there is any debate about the importance of getting \nthis legislation finished. This is an emergency. This is a commitment \nthat we must make prior to the time we leave, in large measure because \nthe Congressional Budget Office has indicated they will not score it as \nmoney that can be utilized. We would not be able to commit the money \nprior to the time we leave.\n  We all know the stakes. But when Senators come to the floor and offer \namendments on Medicare lockboxes on an emergency issue such as this, it \nis a clear indication that we are not really very serious about \nfinishing this legislation on time.\n  I reluctantly will also ask for a vote to reconsider the \nTransportation appropriations bill at 11 o'clock this morning. That \nwill at least temporarily take us off of Agriculture and\n\n[[Page S8500]]\n\nmove us back onto the highway legislation, the Transportation \nappropriations bill, because that, too, is a critical piece of \nlegislation that has to be addressed before we leave. We have made that \nvery clear.\n  I tell all of my colleagues that there will be no respite tonight, if \nSenators choose to use the full 30 hours, which is their right, prior \nto the time we go to final passage. We will be in all night long. There \nis no other recourse.\n  I want to put my colleagues on notice that will happen. I regret the \ninconvenience, but that is what we will have to do in order for us to \nfinish this bill.\n  It is my expectation that if that also happens while we continue to \nnegotiate to find some solution to this Agriculture bill--and let me \napplaud him while he is on the floor. The chairman has done an \noutstanding job of getting us to this point. And I, as always, have \ngreat admiration for our ranking Member of this committee as well. We \ncouldn't have two better legislative partners than the two of them.\n  I am hopeful that over the period of time we are now debating the \nTransportation appropriations bill, and maybe even the VA-HUD bill, we \ncan come to some resolution on this question. But clearly, no one \nshould misinterpret what we are going to be doing this morning. We will \ncontinue to be on this bill for whatever length of time it takes to \ncomplete it and to do it right. I regret that it may be Friday, \nSaturday, or Sunday. But if that is the case, that is exactly what we \nare going to have to do.\n  I want to make sure that Members understand this delay is \nunfortunate. We are not apparently serious enough if we are going to be \nmaking up lockbox amendments. We have to use this time as productively \nas possible.\n  It seems to me that the best way to do that is to now take up the \nhighway bill, finish it, and perhaps move to HUD-VA, and return--as we \nwill--to the Agriculture emergency supplemental bill as soon as it is \nappropriate to do so.\n  I wanted to share that with my colleagues to make sure Members know \nwhat the exact schedule is likely to be for the remainder of the day. \nThey should expect a very late night tonight if the 30 hours that is \nrequired prior to the time we go to final passage would be consumed \nprior to the time we have the ability to vote.\n  I expect a vote at 11 o'clock on the cloture motion on the \nTransportation appropriations bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. What is the will of the Senate?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, at 11 o'clock today there is, in my \nestimation, a very important vote. It is a vote that will allow the \nSenate to move on and complete another appropriations bill. This will \nmake four bills we have completed during this year.\n  Last year at this time we had completed eight appropriations bills, \nand it was done, as the Presiding Officer will recall, by the minority \ndiving in and helping the majority pass those bills. A lot of them--as \nall appropriations bills are--were very contentious and had a lot of \namendments tied to them.\n  In the minority, I was given the assignment directly by our leader \nand the ranking member, the now-chairman, of the Appropriations \nCommittee to do what I could to work through these amendments. And we \ndid a good job. We helped the then-majority, I repeat, pass eight \nappropriations bills.\n  We are struggling to get through four. And we are going to do five \nbefore the break. I certainly hope we can do that. We can do it. The \nleader said we are going to do it.\n  This vote at 11 o'clock will terminate a very prolonged debate on \nsomething I believe we should have gotten out of here and taken, as is \ndone in all legislative processes, to conference, where it would be \nworked out.\n  The issue of contention is one that deals with NAFTA, the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement, and how trucks coming from Mexico are \ntreated in the United States.\n  The House of Representatives, in their appropriations bill dealing \nwith transportation, in effect, said there will be no Mexican trucks \ncoming into the United States. However, in the Senate, Senator Shelby \nand Senator Murray crafted what appeared to me to be a very reasonable \nprocess to determine what processes would be allowed for Mexican trucks \nto come into the United States.\n  We have a couple Senators who have been leading this effort who have \nsaid it is not good enough. Well, maybe it isn't, but it was something \non which the two managers of this bill spent weeks of time. I say if \npeople do not like it--and we understand the President of the United \nStates does not like it--take the matter to conference, where the views \nof the White House are always listened to, and I will bet there would \nbe a compromise worked out.\n  That is my belief. The way it is now, we are not completing the work \nthat has to be done.\n  In the State of Nevada, we badly need a Transportation appropriations \nbill. I don't know what the rest of the 49 States want, but if we don't \nhave a Transportation appropriations bill, it will do, in many \ninstances, irreparable damage to the people of the State of Nevada. Las \nVegas, the most rapidly growing city in America; Nevada, the most \nrapidly growing State, we need help.\n  Last year we needed to build one new school every month to keep up \nwith the growth in Las Vegas. That has changed. Now we need to build 14 \nschools a year in Clark County to keep up with the growth of the area. \nWe need roads. We need bridges. We need other programs this \nTransportation bill will take care of, including some programs that \ndeal with mass transit.\n  I certainly hope the vote on cloture will allow us to move on and \ncomplete the legislation. The President has made his point clear. My \nfriends, Senator Gramm of Texas and Senator McCain, have made their \npoint very clear. They have done a good job of explaining what they \nbelieve. They believe this legislation is a violation of NAFTA. I \npersonally disagree, having studied it, but they might be right. But \ntake it to conference; deal with the House. Their provision, under any \nview, especially under the view of Senators McCain and Gramm, is much \nmore in violation of NAFTA than our reasonable approach.\n  I can think of many places in the State of Nevada that need this \nhighway bill. For example, there is money in this bill for a new bridge \nover the Colorado River to take pressure off Boulder/Hoover Dam. The \nonly way to get across the Colorado River in that area is a road that \ngoes over the dam. That traffic backs up for 5, 6, 7, 10 miles \nsometimes. People wait for hours to get across. Not only is it bad for \ncommerce; it is dangerous. Think what a terrorist could do at Hoover \nDam. It supplies the power to southern California and parts of Nevada. \nThrough that system comes the water for southern California and for \nparts of Nevada.\n  Many years ago, we authorized a new bridge over the river. We are now \nfunding it. Part of that money is in this bill. It is extremely \nimportant for Arizona and Nevada. Not far from where that new bridge \nwill be is the place I was born, Searchlight, NV. That is the busiest \ntwo-lane highway in the State. I hate to have my children, when I am in \nSearchlight, come to visit me because of the road. I am afraid because \nof the danger of the road. I worry when I know they are coming until I \nsee them come into my little house. I worry about them. That road is \nthe busiest two-lane highway in the State of Nevada. It is dangerous. \nPeople are passing. They don't know how to drive on the two-lane \nhighways, especially when there is so much traffic.\n  There is money in this bill to provide for doubling the lanes of \ntraffic halfway, and then the next year hopefully we can do the rest of \nit. It means not only making roads safer but allowing commerce to \nproceed more rapidly.\n  Regarding I-15, the road between southern California and southern \nNevada will be benefited if we pass this highway transportation bill. \nThere are things in this bill that are very important to the State of \nNevada. If we had all 100 Senators speaking, the same\n\n[[Page S8501]]\n\nwould apply. I hope we can invoke cloture on this at 11 o'clock. It is \nextremely important for the country. I hope it can be done. Then we can \nget off of it quickly, and we will not have to spend the whole night \nhere if we do. Many of us have already signed up for the night.\n\n  Mr. President, I will yield the floor, but I ask that because of a \ntragedy that occurred in Senator Dayton's State in the last 24 hours, \nhe be allowed to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Dayton, is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dayton are located in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. DAYTON. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the Chamber this morning to \nexpress my frustration to my colleagues about where we are as a Senate \nin trying to resolve some very important issues for the American \npeople: A Transportation appropriations bill on which I understand we \nwill have a cloture vote at 11, and if cloture is successful, then we \nwill be on that bill, I would guess, through its duration. That, \ntherefore, replaces the current activity on the floor of dealing with \nthe Supplemental Ag Emergency Act of 2001 that many of us believe is \nvery important.\n  What is most important about this particular legislation is the \ntimeliness of needing to deal with it before the August recess.\n  I also understand that the majority leader filed cloture on the Ag \nsupplemental. That could ripen on Friday. If it does, and we are not on \nthat debate until Friday, then we will work through the weekend.\n  There is a complication in dealing with the Ag supplemental emergency \nlegislation prior to the weekend. If we differ from the House-passed \nversion--and it is very possible that we will --those differences will \nhave to be worked out. We know that is called a conference. A \nconference committee will be convened, appointed by the leaders of both \nHouses, to work out our differences. And from that committee will come \na report on which this body must act.\n  The House plans to go out on late Thursday or early Friday for their \nAugust recess and may well not be here to act on a bill they acted on \nsome time ago. In fact, they acted on it a number of weeks ago, \nrecognizing the very critical nature of this emergency funding, and \nbelieved they would have it done in a timely fashion.\n  The bill passed by the House 6 weeks ago, and here we are now in the \nlate hour prior to the traditional August recess trying to resolve our \ndifferences on this issue. And those time lines create a very real \nproblem.\n  I have a letter from the Congressional Budget Office that I requested \nyesterday from Dan Crippen. I asked a very simple question: If we fail \nto act, what happens to the $5.5 billion that is in the budget for this \nemergency spending purpose? Basically, he said that it goes away. In \nother words, the scoring necessary to fall within the budget resolution \nwould not be gained because the amount of money--the $5.5 billion--\ncould not be expended before the September 30 deadline. Therefore, it \nwould fall into next year. And what would happen to the money? Well, it \nwould go to pay down debt. That is not all bad, but I think those of us \nwho are concerned about the plight of production agriculture in this \ncountry--and farmers have really had it very tough--recognize that the \nchairman of the authorizing committee, who is in the Chamber, and the \nranking member, have tried to resolve this issue and bring some relief.\n  There is a difference, though, in the House version of that relief \nand the Senate version of that relief. That difference may not get \nworked out. Yesterday, the Senator from Indiana, Mr. Lugar, our ranking \nmember on the authorizing committee, offered the House version; it was \nnarrowly defeated. If we had passed it, it would be on its way to the \nPresident's desk possibly today or tomorrow. It could well be signed \ninto law before we even leave for the August recess. If that were true, \nthere is no question that the Department of Agriculture would have time \nto cut the checks, and the money would be expended before the September \n30 end of fiscal year timing that would cause this money to disappear, \nto go away, or in other words, be applied to the debt.\n  I must tell you, Mr. President, that I don't agree totally with the \nHouse version. There are provisions in the Senate bill that I would \nlike to see us work our differences out on with the House. But that may \nnot be possible at this moment. If we strive for the perfect, we may \nend up not serving the need of American farmers and ranchers in a way \nthat I think this Senate intends to and wants to, and we should.\n  So it is a question of timing. It is a question of how we deal with \nthis issue on the floor and the give and take that is going to be \nnecessary over the last days before the August recess to resolve this, \nto comply with the wishes of the majority leader to get Transportation \ndone, get the Agriculture supplemental done and, I believe, VA-HUD. I \nand others have insisted that we try to respond in an appropriate way \nto the President and the nominees he has sent to the Senate to be \nconfirmed so that he can run the Government--at least the executive \nbranch of Government, which he is charged with doing and which the \nAmerican people elected him to do.\n  There are 25 or 30 nominees who should have been confirmed weeks ago, \nwho could be in place now making decisions at agency levels and \ndistrict or regional levels of agencies, and they are not in place \ntoday. The human side of that little story and that equation is that \nmany of these nominees have young families and they need to have them \nin place before the end of August because kids are going back to \nschool. And these are not wealthy people. They need to sell their home \nwhere they live to buy a home here in the Washington, DC, area. They \ncan't do that largely because the Senate has not responded in a timely \nand appropriate fashion in some instances.\n\n  That is too bad. I hope we can--at least for those who have had \nhearings and have been dealt with in the appropriate fashion before the \nauthorizing committees and the committees of jurisdiction--we ought to \nget them confirmed before we adjourn for the August recess. There are \nothers I wish we had hearings on.\n  Obviously, there is foot dragging--I believe that--on the part of \nsome chairmen who have philosophical differences. I guess my point is \nthat there is a lot of work to get done, and that work is going to \ndepend on our willingness to come together on some of these issues as \nto cloture now. And to move to Transportation when we have not resolved \nthe Mexican trucking issue is really amazing to me. We have a very \nsimple compromise to be worked out on that. If we haven't worked that \nout, my guess is that we run the limit of the Transportation timing of \ncloture, and then we go to Agriculture and, my goodness, that puts us \ninto next week. That is not going to make for a lot of happy campers in \nthe Senate. But then again, let us stay and let us do our work \nappropriately. That is necessary and appropriate. That is the choice of \nthe majority leader to bring us to that point. I guess that is the \nburden of leadership.\n  At the same time, there is one most time-sensitive issue of all that \nwe are talking about, and that is this Emergency Agriculture Assistance \nAct of 2001. Oh, we can muscle up and say: House, stay in place, do \nyour work before you leave town. The only problem is, they did their \nwork 6 weeks ago and we are now just doing our work. So it is not \nreally, shall I say, kosher to suggest that they ought to stay in town \nbeyond their time for adjournment. Maybe we ought to say: Get it done \nSenate, and get it done now.\n  Let's agree on something that we can come together quickly on and not \ndeprive the American food producers of a little bit of relief from some \nvery difficult price squeezes and now some difficult input costs of \nenergy and other requirements. Those are the issues before us.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, in the letter I have, makes it very \nclear:\n\n[[Page S8502]]\n\n Get it done, get it signed, and the Department of Agriculture cuts the \nchecks before September 30, or this money, in fact, goes away and we \nhave lost the opportunity to expend $5.5 billion for the American \nagricultural producers.\n  Of course, Mr. President, as you know, as chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, dollars are short and needs are great. As we \nmove now into September and October, with new fiscal reports out about \na recession and a waning total surplus, our flexibility gets limited.\n  So I urge Senators to come to like mind and deal with that which we \ncan deal with now before we move on to other issues because at 11 \no'clock, I assume cloture will be gained and our window of opportunity \nto work and help the American farmer begins to close. We should not \nallow that to happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have listened very carefully to the \ncomments of my friend and colleague from Idaho. I say to my friend from \nIdaho that right now we could be in conference with the House--the \nAgriculture Committee--right now, this morning, but for the fact that \non his side of the aisle we are being held up. We reported this bill \nout of committee. We debated it in committee. We had our votes in \ncommittee. On a 12-9 vote this bill was reported out.\n  In good faith, the ranking member, my good friend from Indiana, \noffered an amendment yesterday to go to the House bill. It was fully \ndebated. I thought it was a good debate. And we voted, as we are \nsupposed to do. That didn't succeed. Then, I think the proper thing is \nto go ahead and vote up or down on the bill we reported from the \nAgriculture Committee, I say to my friend from Idaho, and let us go to \nconference and work out the difference.\n  Yesterday morning, the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee \nwas present on the floor along with the ranking member. I indicated to \nboth of them if we could finish the bill today--meaning yesterday--we \ncould meet today. There are not that many differences in the House and \nSenate bill. The difference really is in money. There are not big \npolicy differences that, when you go to conference, require a lot of \ntime to work out. Money differences can be worked out. I still believe \nif we can get to conference with the House, we can probably be through \nwith the conference in a few hours. But we can't go because we can't \nget to a final vote on this bill.\n  Let us look at the record. Last Friday, I say to my friend from \nIdaho, we had to file a cloture petition on the motion to proceed to \nget to the Agriculture bill. That chewed up a couple of days right \nthere. When we finally had the vote, I think it was 95-2 to go to the \nbill.\n  When we finally got on the bill--and I thought we had a good day \nyesterday. We had our debate yesterday on the major substance of \nwhether we would go with the committee bill or a substitute. That vote \nwas taken. It was a close vote, but it was a vote nonetheless. One side \nwon and one side did not. It seemed to me, at that point we were ready \nto go.\n  We have no amendments on this side of the aisle. Yet last night, I \nbelieve it was the Senator from Ohio on that side of the aisle who \noffered a lockbox amendment on this emergency Agriculture bill. That \ndid not come from this side. That is going to delay it even more.\n  I say to my friend from Idaho, but for the delay on your side of the \naisle, we would be sitting in conference at 10:40 a.m. on August 1, \nmaybe even with a view to wrapping it up by noon. But they will not let \nus go to conference.\n  I thought we were operating in good faith yesterday. There was an \namendment offered again on a dairy compact. I thought maybe we would \nhave to vote on that, too. Okay, fine. Then that was withdrawn. I \nthought, hope springs eternal; that maybe that would be the end of it \nand we could go to third reading.\n  No, there was more delay. Now we have a lockbox amendment that has \nabsolutely nothing to do with this bill. That is going to delay it even \nfurther. I understand now, I say to my friend from Idaho, we are in the \nposition of maybe filing a cloture petition on the bill itself just so \nwe can get to a vote on it.\n  We may have some difference of opinion on how much we ought to be \nputting into the emergency package for Agriculture, but we had that \ndebate in the Agriculture Committee. We had those votes both in \ncommittee and in the Chamber.\n  Again, we had to file cloture on the motion to proceed, and now maybe \nwe will have to file cloture on the emergency bill. I do not think this \nis the way to handle an essential bill like this.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the majority has expired.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will be brief. I appreciate the \nfrustration just expressed by the chairman of the authorizing committee \nwho is managing this supplemental. He has every right to be frustrated. \nThis is an important issue, and I have expressed that.\n  I must say when we got to dairy compacts yesterday, we all know that \nwas a bipartisan issue. It was not driven by one political side or the \nother. Both sides wanted to debate that issue, and there was a period \nof time when it was talked about and then it was withdrawn, as the \nchairman said. It was withdrawn with the anticipation it would be \nreoffered today, or it would have been debated yesterday and probably \ndebated long into the evening, and we might still well be debating that \nissue today.\n  There is an outstanding issue that is yet to be resolved on both \nsides, even if we can agree to go to final passage, and that would be \nthe dairy compact issue. That is, without question, a bipartisan issue. \nAs a filler, yes, one of our colleagues came and offered a lockbox \namendment.\n  I agree that could fit anywhere. It does not necessarily find itself \nappropriately on an Ag supplemental appropriations bill or an emergency \nspending bill, but it can fit there. What is important is there is one \nlarge issue left unresolved, and that is the dairy compact extension, \nas I understand it, and that one writes itself very clearly as a \nbipartisan issue. If it has been resolved, I am unaware of it. I follow \nthat issue closely because it is an important issue to me and my State.\n  I do not believe we are ready to go to final passage on Agriculture \nunless those who are intent on offering amendments to deal with dairy \ncompacts, either the Northeast or the opportunity to extend that \nauthority to other areas of the Nation, have resolved their differences \nand plan not to offer the amendment. If that is the case, then I \nsuggest that is resolved. I understand there are no dilatory tactics \nholding this bill from a third reading and final passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to have the opportunity to \nexpress my support for the Emergency Agricultural Assistance Act of \n2001. I commend Senator Harkin for his leadership on this, his first \npiece of legislation as the chairman of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee.\n  The bill provides much needed relief for our farmers and farm \ncommunities. The market loss assistance payments will provide an \nimmediate boost to the sagging farm industry in Missouri.\n  I am especially grateful to Senators Harkin and Leahy for their \nassistance in providing $25 million in relief to farmers whose crops \nhave been damaged by an invasion of armyworms. Armyworms marching \nthrough Missouri have left a trail of crop destruction and economic \nloss in their wake. The armyworm is a caterpillar only about one and a \nhalf inches long, but they march in large groups, moving on only after \ncompletely stripping an area. Last winter's unusually warm weather and \nthis summer's drought have conspired to make life easy for the armyworm \nand hard for the farmer.\n  Thousands of farmers across southern Missouri have been devastated. \nOne official at the Missouri Department of Agriculture said that this \nyear's invasion is the worst he has seen in his 38 years at the \nDepartment. Damage reports are still being compiled, and it may be a \nwhile before we know the full extent of the damage. We do know that in \nDouglas County 3,281 farms lost more than 50-percent of their hay and \nforage crop. In Wright County it is 2,430 farms.\n\n[[Page S8503]]\n\n  The armyworms work extremely fast. Jim Smith, a cattle farmer in \nWashington County, completely lost 30 acres of hay field and most of \nthe hay on another 30 acres. He said that he did not even know he had \narmyworms until 20 acres had been mowed down ``slick as concrete'' by \nthe insects. In his 73 years on the farm, Mr. Smith says this is the \nworst he has ever seen.\n  Dusty Shaw, a farmer in Oregon County, normally harvests 80-100,000 \npounds of fescue grass seed which is used all over the Nation for lawns \nand turf building. This year, however, all 1,000 acres of his seed \nfields were eaten by armyworms. Even at a conservative estimate of 20 \ncents a pound, this represents a loss of $16,000 for Mr. Shaw.\n  This invasion has had severe economic consequences for my State. \nMissouri is second in the nation in cattle farming. With nothing to \nfeed their cattle, farmers are forced to sell yearlings early and \nliquidate parts of their herd. The U.S. Department of Agriculture \nestimates that Howell County lost over $5 million and Oregon County has \nalready lost over $3 million. With little or no hay crop this summer, \nfarmers will have no hay reserves this winter. The effects of this \ninfestation will be felt long into the next year.\n  It isn't just the farmers that are suffering economic loss. When the \nfarmers hurt financially so do the feed merchants, farm supply dealers \nand gas stations. Dusty Shaw told me he is only buying what he has to. \nThe fences will have to hold for another year, the barn will have to \nhold out the snow for another winter, and the fields will have to do \nwith less fertilizer than last season.\n  The funds provided in this bill will help these farmers feed their \ncattle, and keep their farms. So I support this bill, I look forward to \nits speedy passage in the Senate, and hope it is soon signed into law.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I will comment briefly on the colloquy we \nare having on the responsibilities with regard to the Agriculture bill. \nI respect very much my colleague from Iowa, the distinguished chairman \nof the committee, pursuing this vigorously, as I am.\n  Without being repetitious, let me point out even if the bill were in \nconference as of 10:45 this morning, it is unlikely we would have \nsuccess.\n  The predicament I have pointed out and others have pointed out is an \nimportant one; namely, our conference has to find a result in a bill \nthat will be signed by the President of the United States.\n  The President of the United States visited with Senators on the Hill \nyesterday. It is not conjecture. The President indicated we ought to \ntake seriously our budget responsibilities. The President said this \ndirectly to us.\n  In addition, both the distinguished chairman of the committee and I \nhave received from the President's advisers this message, and let me \nquote some relevant paragraphs: The administration strongly opposes S. \n1246, the bill that came out of the Agriculture Committee, because \nspending authorized by the bill would exceed $5.5 billion, the amount \nprovided in the budget resolution and the amount adopted by the House.\n  If S. 1246 is presented to the President at a level higher than $5.5 \nbillion, the President's senior advisers will recommend he veto the \nbill.\n  When the President of the United States then comes to the Hill, as he \ndid yesterday, and asks Senators whom he addressed to do their duty, \nthis is not conjecture. I have tried to say in every way I can it seems \nto me we ought to take the President seriously.\n  I offered the House language yesterday, not because I was author of \nthe language or find all of that language to be perfection, but it is a \nbill that has passed the House. It is a bill that, if adopted by the \nSenate, would make a conference unnecessary. It is a bill the President \nwould sign immediately, which would guarantee that money goes to \nfarmers.\n  I am prepared to accept the fact we have debated this thoroughly, and \nthe Senate, by a vote of 52-48, chose to go another way; namely, to try \nout for size the $7.5 billion.\n  Apparently, Senators who had an interest in the bill felt it was \nworth the gamble. I hope the farmers who are watching this debate \nunderstand that.\n  I do not see many farmers on this floor. I do not see very many \npeople even intimately involved in agriculture, with the exception of \nmy dear friend from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, who, I know, has a son managing \na farm and working the soil out in Iowa, and my modest efforts in \nIndiana. I still do take responsibility for that farm, do the market \nplan, try to understand crop insurance, try to understand the bills we \ndo. I am not certain there are too many people here who are going to be \naffected by this bill.\n  We have a lot of advocates for farmers, a lot of people pleading the \nfarmers' case, a lot of people saying, ``I feel your pain,'' and this \ngoes on hour by hour. In terms of direct assistance that makes any \ndifference to farmers, not a whole lot is happening.\n  I sincerely respect the right of any Senator to plead the case for \nany number of farmers he wants to plead for, but I hope ultimately \ncommon sense will dictate this is an emergency. We have heard that if \nwe do not act the money goes away. If, in fact, we are not going to be \nable to act and have a bill the President signs, no money will go to \nany farmers from all of this effort. That is the unfortunate truth of \nthe debate.\n  I do not know how we arrive at a solution. Presumably, if we had a \nconference, to take one hypothetical, and the distinguished Senator \nfrom Iowa sat down with Mr. Combest and Mr. Stenholm or others around \nthe table, our distinguished House Members have already told us: Take \nthe House bill. They came here yesterday. They were in the aisle right \nhere about a quarter after 12. They said: Please, we are planning to \nleave Thursday, tomorrow. The distinguished Senator from Iowa said we \ncan all work it out; there is not much difference--just money--involved \nin this bill.\n\n  There is all the difference from $7.5 billion and $5.5 billion. Maybe \nour conference would come to $5.5 billion. We could confer and accept \nthe House bill because that is the one the President will sign, or we \ncould speculate and say the President really did not mean it. After \nall, Presidents bluff, advisers send over these letters; OMB really did \nnot mean it; this was all meant to color the flavor of the debate; \nlet's try them on; let's settle for, say, $6.5 billion; let's split the \ndifference as honest people might do. Try that one on for size.\n  We will try to get it back through the House and the Senate. We hope \nthe House is still there at that point to pass the bill. Let's say the \ncorporal's guard remains and they wave it on.\n  Then the President says, unfortunately: You did not hear me, but you \nhad better hear me because this is likely to happen again and again \nwith appropriations bills. This is a pretty small bill in comparison to \nthings I am going to have to face down the trail, but I am prepared to \ndo my duty; I hope you are prepared to do yours. And at last he vetoes \nthe bill. We are gone at that point, and the American farmers have no \nmoney.\n  I do not mean to be repetitive, but this is a fairly straightforward \nsituation without great complexity. It is a test of wills. The Senate \nmay decide the President really did not mean it or the President should \nnot mean it or, on reflection, he will not mean it. Maybe that is \nright, but that is not the President I saw eyeball to eyeball yesterday \nat noon.\n  We are looking at a very straightforward situation that I hope will \nbe resolved. The resolution of it is to accept the House language and \nto get on with it. Any other course of action now is to have a rather \nprotracted situation ending with a veto, and that would be a misfortune \nfor the Senate and for American agriculture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inouye). Who yields time?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I yield to the distinguished Senator from Mississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak as in morning business for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Reserving the right to object, how long does the Senator \nintend to speak?\n\n[[Page S8504]]\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. My request was to speak for up to 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Cochran are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business'').\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/01/senate-section/article/S8504-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8504-S8505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRANSPORTATION APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, in every part of our country, Americans \nare frustrated by the transportation problems we face every day.\n  We sit in traffic on overcrowded roads.\n  We wait through delays in congested airports.\n  We have rural areas trapped in the past--without the roads and \ninfrastructure they need to survive.\n  We have many Americans who rely on a Coast Guard that doesn't have \nthe resources to fully protect us.\n  We have many families who live near oil and gas pipelines and who \nwant us to ensure their safety.\n  Our transportation problems frustrate us as individuals, and they \nfrustrate our Nation's economy--slowing down our productivity and \nputting the brakes on our progress. It is time to help Americans on our \nhighways, railways, airways, and waterways, and we can, by passing the \nTransportation appropriations bill.\n  For months, Senator Shelby and I have worked in a bipartisan way--\nwith almost every Member of the Senate--to meet the transportation \nneeds in all 50 States.\n  You told us your priorities--and we found a way to accommodate them. \nWe have come up with a balanced, bipartisan bill that will make our \nhighways safer, our roads less crowded, and our country more \nproductive. And now is our chance to put this progress to work for the \npeople we represent.\n  Our bill has broad support from both parties. It passed the \nsubcommittee and the full committee unanimously. Now it is before the \nfull Senate--ready for a vote--ready to go to work to help Americans \nwho are fed up with traffic congestion and airport delays.\n  Today, I hope the Senate will again vote to invoke cloture so we can \nbegin working on the many solutions across the country that will \nimprove our lives, our travel, and our productivity.\n  This vote is about two things: fixing the transportation problems we \nface; and ensuring the safety of our transportation infrastructure.\n  If you vote for cloture, you are voting to give your communities the \nresources they need to escape from crippling traffic and overcrowded \nroads.\n  If you vote for cloture, you are saying that our highways must be \nsafe--that trucks coming from Mexico must meet our safety standards--if \nthey are going to share our roads.\n  But if you vote against cloture, you are telling the people in your \nState that they will have to keep waiting in traffic and keep wasting \ntime in congestion.\n  And if you vote against cloture, you are voting against the safety \nstandards in this bill. A ``no'' vote would open our borders to trucks \nthat we know are unsafe--without the inspections and safety standards \nwe deserve. This is not about partisanship or protectionism. It is \nabout productivity and public safety.\n  I want to highlight how this bill will improve highway travel, \nairline safety, pipeline safety, and Coast Guard protection. First and \nforemost, this bill will address the chronic traffic problems facing \nour communities.\n  In fact, under this bill, every State will receive more highway \nconstruction funding than they would under either the President's \nrequest or the levels assumed in TEA-21. Our bill improves America's \nhighways. Let's vote for cloture so we can begin sending that help to \nyour State.\n  Second, this bill will improve air transportation. It will make air \ntravel more safe by providing funding to hire 221 more FAA inspectors. \nLet's vote for cloture so we can begin putting those new inspectors on \nthe job for our safety.\n  Third, our bill boosts funding for the Office of Pipeline Safety by \nmore than $11 million above current levels. Let's vote for cloture so \nwe can begin making America's pipelines safer before another tragedy \nclaims more innocent lives.\n  Fourth, this bill will give the Coast Guard the funding it needs to \nprotect us and our environment. Let's vote for cloture so we can begin \nmaking our waterways safer.\n  These examples show how this bill will help address the \ntransportation problems we face. This vote is also about making sure \nour highways are safe--so I would like to turn to the issue of Mexican \ntrucks. And I want to clear up a few things.\n  Some Members have suggested that Senator Shelby and I have refused to \nnegotiate on this bill. That is just not the case. As I have said \nseveral times here on the floor, we are here, we are ready, and we are \nlistening. And we have also had extensive meetings bringing both sides \ntogether.\n  Last week, our staffs met several nights until well after midnight. \nOne day our staffs met from 2 o'clock in the afternoon until 3 a.m. in \nthe morning. We have worked with all sides to move this bill forward. \nBut I want to point something else out to those who say we must \ncompromise, compromise, compromise.\n  The Murray-Shelby bill itself is a compromise. It is a balanced, \nmoderate compromise between the extreme positions taken by the \nadministration and the House of Representatives. On one hand, we have \nthe administration--which took a hands-off approach to let all Mexican \ntrucks across our border--and then inspect them later--up to a year and \nhalf later.\n  Even though we know these trucks are much less safe than American or \nCanadian trucks, the administration thinks it is fine for us to share \nthe road with them wihtout any assurance of their safety. At the other \nextreme, was the ``strict protectionist'' position of the House of \nRepresentatives. It said that no Mexican trucks can cross the border, \nand that not one penny could be spent to inspect them.\n  Those are two extreme positions. The administration said; Let all the \ntrucks in without ensuring their safety. The House of Representatives \nsaid; Don't let any trucks in because they are not safe.\n  Senator Shelby and I worked hard, and we found a balanced, \nbipartisan, commonsense compromise. We listened to the safety experts, \nto the Department of Transportation's inspector general, to the GAO and \nto the industry. And we came up with a compromise that will allow \nMexican trucks onto our highways and will ensure that those trucks and \ntheir drivers are safe.\n  With this balanced bill, free trade and highway safety can move \nforward side-by-side. This bill doesn't punish Mexico--and that is not \nour intention. Mexico is an important neighbor, ally, and friend. \nMexican drivers are working hard to put food on their family's tables. \nWe want them to be safe--both for their families and for ours.\n  NAFTA was passed to strengthen our partnerships, and to raise the \nstandards of living of all three countries. We are continuing to move \ntoward that goal, and the bipartisan Murray-Shelby compromise will help \nus get there. Because right now, Mexican trucks are not as safe as they \nshould be.\n\n  According to the Department of Transportation inspector general, \nMexican trucks are significantly less safe than American trucks. Last \nyear, nearly two in five Mexican trucks failed their safety \ninspections. That compares with one in four American trucks and only \none in seven Canadian trucks. Even today, Mexican trucks have been \nroutinely violating the current restrictions that limit their travel to \nthe 20-mile commercial zone.\n  We have a responsibility to insure the safety of America's highways. \nThe Murray-Shelby compromise allows us to promote safety without \nviolating NAFTA. During this debate we have heard some Senators and \nWhite House aides say that they think ensuring the safety of Mexican \ntrucks would violate NAFTA.\n  I appreciate their opinions. But with all due respect, there is only \none authority, only one official body, that decides what violates NAFTA \nand what doesn't. It's the arbitral panel established under the NAFTA \ntreaty itself. That official panel said:\n\n       The United States may not be required to treat applications \n     from Mexican trucking\n\n[[Page S8505]]\n\n     firms in exactly the same manner as applications from United \n     States or Canadian firms . . .\n       U.S. authorities are responsible for the safe operations of \n     trucks within U.S. territory, whether ownership is United \n     States, Canadian, or Mexican.\n\n  It is that simple. We can ensure the safety of Mexican trucks and \ncomply with NAFTA--and this bill shows us how with commonsense safety \nmeasures.\n  Under our bill, when you are driving on the highway behind a Mexican \ntruck, you can feel safe. The administration's plan is far too weak. \nUnder the administration's plan, trucking companies would mail in a \nform saying that they are safe and begin driving on our highways.\n  No inspections for up to a year and a half. The administration is \ntelling American families that the safety check is in the mail. I don't \nknow about you, but I wouldn't bet my family's safety on it. I want an \nactual inspector looking at that truck, checking that driver's record, \nmaking sure that truck won't threaten me or my family.\n  The White House says: Take the trucking company at its word that its \ntrucks and drivers are safe. Senator Shelby and I say: Trust an \nAmerican safety inspector to make sure that truck and driver will be \nsafe on our roads. This is a solid compromise. It will allow robust \ntrade while ensuring the safety of our highways. The people of America \nneed help in the transportation challenges they face every day on \ncrowded roads.\n  This bill provides real help and funds the projects that members have \nbeen asking for. Some Senators would hold every transportation project \nin the country hostage until they have weakened the safety standards in \nthe Murray-Shelby compromise. That is the wrong thing to do.\n  Let's keep the safety standards in place so that when you're driving \ndown the highway next to a truck with Mexican license plates you will \nknow that truck is safe. Let's vote for safety by voting for cloture on \nthis bill.\n  So in closing, this vote is about two things: Helping Americans who \nare frustrated every day by transportation problems and ensuring the \nsafety of our transportation infrastructure.\n  Voting for cloture means we can begin making our roads less crowded, \nour airports less congested, our waterways safer, our railways better, \nand our highways safer.\n  Those who vote for cloture are voting to begin making progress across \nthe country and to ensure the safety of our highways.\n  Those who vote against cloture are voting to keep our roads and \nairports crowded and to expose Americans to new dangers on our \nhighways.\n  The choice is simple, and I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture so \nwe can begin putting this good, balanced bill to work for the people we \nrepresent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I hope that occurs sooner rather \nthan later. All of us have constituents who are waiting in traffic for \nus to make sure we do the right thing for the infrastructure of this \ncountry.\n  As I have said before, Senator Shelby and I have worked very hard \ntogether. I commend him and his staff, and our staff, for the many \nhours they have worked to get to the point where we have a bill that \nrepresents the important needs of our country--whether it is our \nairports, our waterways, our highways, our infrastructure. I think we \nhave done a good job with that.\n  There have been a lot of remarks over the last several weeks \nregarding the Mexico truck provision. I want to submit for the Record a \nletter from members of the Hispanic caucus in the House.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the letter printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                    July 31, 2001.\n     Hon. Patty Murray,\n     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,\n     Senate Appropriations Committee, Subcommittee on \n         Transportation, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Murray and Shelby: We are writing to express \n     our disbelief over comments we have read implying that the \n     truck safety measures that you have included in the \n     Transportation Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2002 are \n     somehow ``anti-Hispanic'' or ``anti-Mexican.'' As you know, \n     when the Transportation Appropriations Bill passed the House, \n     an amendment was adopted that prohibited any Mexican trucks \n     from being granted authority to operate in the United States \n     during Fiscal Year 2002. In a seemingly less extreme \n     approach, the Senate version of the bill, as drafted by your \n     subcommittee, includes several provisions intended to address \n     obvious safety concerns regarding Mexican trucks that have \n     been voiced by impartial and knowledgeable observes such as \n     the U.S. Department of Transportation Inspector General.\n       The issue of safety on our highways is not an ``Hispanic \n     issue.'' All Americans are equally at risk from unsafe \n     conditions on our highways for all Americans and we share \n     that goal.\n           Sincerely,\n         Ed Pastor, Grace F. Napolitano, Lucille Roybal-Allard, \n           Hilda L. Solis, Solomon P. Ortiz, Silvestre Reyes, Luis \n           V. Gutierrez, Joe Baca, Nydia M.\n\n[[Page S8506]]\n\n           Velazquez, Ruben Hinojosa, Ciro D. Rodriguez.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I think those words speak for themselves. I am happy to \nsubmit it for the Record and to assure our colleagues we are working \nfor the safety of all Americans.\n  I have a number of points to which, if this debate continues, I will \nbe speaking this afternoon. But I truly hope that now we can move on \nand put this bill into place so that we can move to conference, and to \nmake sure we have done the right thing in terms of the infrastructure \nin our country that is so important to all of our constituents.\n  I thank the President and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to quickly respond to the \nSenator from Washington. The Senator from Texas and I, and others, may \nnot use too many hours on this issue, but I want to assure the Senator \nfrom Washington we are not moving on. We are not moving on. We have the \nopportunity to have three more cloture votes on this issue. We intend \nto fight every single one of those when we return in September.\n  So to put the mind of the Senator from Washington at ease, we are not \nmoving on. We may have a vote for final passage. We are not moving on. \nWe are not moving on until we have exhausted every last remedy because \nthere is a great deal at stake. There is a huge amount at stake: Not \nonly the fact, according to the Presidents of both nations, that this \nlanguage represents a violation of a solemn treaty entered into by \nthree nations, but it also sets a terrible precedent.\n  Are we going to have appropriations bills that violate treaties in \nthe view of the executives of both nations? The proponents of this \nlegislation can say it does not violate NAFTA until they are blue in \nthe face. That is fine with me. But none of those Members was elected \nPresident of the United States. We have one President. That President \nand his advisers have said this language is in violation of a solemn \ntreaty entered into by three nations. That treaty is being violated, \nand he will veto the bill. And I say, with supreme confidence, that we \ncan muster 34 votes to sustain a Presidential veto.\n  The Senator from Washington and the proponents of this bill should \nunderstand that because the President has made it perfectly clear that \nhe will veto this bill, the responsibility then for the veto will rest \nwith the proponents of this bill who refuse to seriously negotiate on \nthis bill. They have refused to sit down and have meaningful \nnegotiations. They have said it, and they have alleged it, but they \nhave not done it.\n\n  I have not been around here as long as the Senator from Texas or \nother Senators, but I have been around here long enough to know serious \nnegotiations when I see them, and unserious negotiations when I see \nthem. Negotiations have not been serious. As I have said before, I have \nnegotiated a whole lot of very difficult issues, ranging from a line-\nitem veto, to a Patients' Bill of Rights, to campaign finance reform, \nwith people who were serious about negotiating. I know serious \nnegotiations when I see them. They are not present on this issue.\n  So without serious negotiations, without removing the unacceptable \nprovisions of this legislation, the President of the United States will \nveto the bill. The responsibility will be for those who have refused to \nreach an accommodation not with just the Senator from Texas and me but \nwith the administration.\n  I might add, those who say they are voting for this bill to move it \nalong, even though they agree with our opposition, well, thanks, but, \nin all candor, the way you stop legislation around here is by voting \nagainst it.\n  So, Mr. President, this is a serious issue. I have never, since I \nentered this body in 1987, impeded the legislative process. I have \ncertainly voted against and spoken against a lot of the measures with \nwhich I disagreed. I have never used parliamentary procedures to hold \nup legislation, and I hope I never will again, because I think it is an \nextreme measure to do so.\n  I know we have important issues to address. But when we are talking \nabout legislation on an appropriations bill, with never a hearing, \nnever a markup in the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation--oh, there were hearings; there was a hearing on Mexican \ntrucks. We could mark up a bill in the Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation Committee tomorrow--tomorrow--and bring it to the floor \nof this Senate. Then it would be done in the appropriate fashion. I do \nnot know if the chairman of the Commerce Committee was consulted on \nthis particular language in the appropriations bill; I know I was not; \nand I know no Member on my side of the aisle was consulted when this \nlanguage was inserted by people who have not given a proper airing of \nthis issue and have clearly not taken into consideration the views of \nthe President of Mexico and the President of the United States.\n  So I repeat, we will not move on. We intend to do whatever is \nnecessary to try to bring about a set of negotiations in which we know \nthe administration would be eager to join, so that we could reach \nremoval of basically four issues that remain that are of difference. \nThere are only four issues, but they are significant differences.\n\n  We have received clear written notification from the administration \nthat if either the provisions of this bill or the House-passed measure \nregarding cross-border trucking are sent to the President, we can \nexpect the bill to be vetoed. I quote from the Statement of \nAdministrative Policy transmitted to the Senate on July 19:\n\n       The Senate committee has adopted provisions that could \n     cause the United States to violate our commitments under \n     NAFTA. Unless changes are made to the Senate bill, the \n     President's senior advisors will recommend that the President \n     veto the bill.\n\n  There have been some beneficial effects of Senator Gramm's and my \nactivities on this issue because it has gotten the attention of \neditorial writers around the country. I would like to quote from some \nof those editorial writers from different newspapers around the country \nfor the benefit of the President. I quote from an editorial in the \nAtlanta Constitution, a July 31 editorial, headlined ``Open U.S. Roads \nto Mexican Trucks.''\n\n       Can you imagine a world in which Mexican 18-wheelers were \n     allowed to roam freely across U.S. highways--maybe properly \n     inspected, maybe not, with drivers maybe properly trained and \n     licensed, maybe not?\n       A lot of folks seem unable to grasp what they believe would \n     be a frightening vision, but they really don't have to look \n     very far to get a reliable glimpse of what it would be like. \n     All they have to do is look less than 20 years into the past, \n     when Mexican trucks were permitted free access to America's \n     roads as a matter of course. That practice ended only when \n     Ronald Reagan changed the policy in a dispute over access for \n     U.S. trucks to Mexico's roads.\n       The old right of access was supposed to have been restored \n     as part of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and \n     President Bush has been pushing to do just that. But now he's \n     having to fight the Teamsters' Union, the Democrats in \n     Congress who habitually do labor's bidding, and even a few \n     members of his own party who don't seem to have bothered to \n     examine the issue.\n       The truckers' union, of course, is interested only in job \n     protectionism. Under current rules, Mexican trucks can carry \n     goods into border states, but only for a maximum of 20 miles; \n     then, cargo must be loaded onto American trucks, driven by \n     American drivers, most of whom--what a coincidence--happen to \n     be members of the Teamsters. They have disguised their self-\n     interest, however, in a provocative pitch for public safety, \n     painting a picture of U.S. highways plagued by decrepit, \n     faulty vehicles driven by unskilled and careless Mexican \n     cowboys.\n       There is probably as much prejudice as protectionism in \n     this image; actual statistics do show that Mexican trucks \n     crossing the border fail inspections at higher rates than \n     American vehicles, but the difference has been steadily \n     narrowing. In 1995, 54 percent of the Mexican trucks failed, \n     but that figure has fallen to 36 percent; besides, the \n     Teamster-driven vehicles are no paragons--the failure rate \n     for U.S. trucks is a surprising 24 percent. (Canadian trucks \n     fail at a rate of only 17 percent; maybe we should ban U.S. \n     trucks and only allow those from north of the border.)\n       It should be noted that the Mexican trucks failing the \n     tests are untypical of that country's fleet. Border crossings \n     can take hours, so companies use older, less tidy vehicles \n     for the short runs for cargo transfers. Trucks that would be \n     used for long-distance hauling within the United States are \n     much newer, some more modern than those used by American \n     firms. (Authorities sometimes catch Mexican trucks that went \n     illegally outside the 20-mile border area; of those, just 19 \n     percent failed inspections, which is a better record than \n     U.S. trucks can boast.)\n       Continuing to restrict access is a mistake, especially \n     because it would be a continuing violation of U.S. \n     obligations under NAFTA, a trade agreement that has brought \n     unparalleled economic benefits to all three of its\n\n[[Page S8507]]\n\n     member countries. The Bush administration plans to spend $144 \n     million for new state and federal inspection stations and \n     personnel, and for checking the safety records and practices \n     of Mexican carriers. That should be enough to allay the \n     concerns of anyone who is truly concerned about safety on the \n     highways--especially since it will create a much more \n     dependable system than the one that existed for all the \n     decades when Mexican trucks did roam freely on our roads.\n       Republicans in Congress should do a little more homework, \n     and the Democrats should start trying to be something other \n     than toadys for labor unions. This is a battle for self-\n     interest, not for safety, and it's time for it to be over.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Washington Post \neditorials and a San Diego Union-Tribune editorial be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 29, 2001]\n\n                            NAFTA in Trouble\n\n       On Thursday U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick gave \n     a stirring speech about the North American Free Trade \n     Agreement (NAFTA), which seven years ago created the world's \n     largest free trade area. He noted that U.S. exports to the \n     two NAFTA partners--Mexico and Canada--support 2.9 million \n     American jobs, up from 2 million at the time of the \n     agreement, and that such jobs pay wages that are 13 percent \n     to 18 percent higher than the average in this country. Trade \n     with Mexico alone has tripled. Mexico now buys more from the \n     United States than from Britain, France, Germany and Italy \n     combined.\n       Unfortunately, Mr. Zoellick's fine speech was not the only \n     NAFTA news last Thursday, for the Senate was simultaneously \n     debating the treaty. A large majority of senators--Thursday's \n     procedural vote went 70 to 30--appears to believe that \n     NAFTA's provisions on trucking across the Mexico border need \n     not be implemented promptly. As a result, Mexico's government \n     is likely to retaliate with $1 billion or more in trade \n     sanctions. The great forward momentum of the U.S.-Mexican \n     economic relationship may start to be unraveled.\n       Under NAFTA, Mexican trucks in the United States must abide \n     by U.S. regulations: If they are too dangerous or dirty, they \n     can be pulled off the road. But NAFTA's opponents want to \n     keep Mexican trucks out--period. For the past seven years, \n     the United States has bowed to protectionists by refusing to \n     process Mexican applications for trucking licenses, a \n     practice that NAFTA's dispute-settlement panel has condemned. \n     Now the Bush administration wants to end this obstructionism, \n     but Congress is getting in the way. The House has passed a \n     transportation spending bill that would bar the \n     administration from processing Mexican applications. The \n     Senate is adopting the subtler approach of allowing Mexican \n     trucks in--but only on various burdensome conditions that \n     will have the effect of delaying the opening of the border by \n     a year or more.\n       The sponsors of the Senate measure, Patty Murray (D-Wash.) \n     and Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), say these conditions are \n     reasonable because Mexican trucks fail U.S. safety standards \n     50 percent more often than American ones. But this claim is \n     based on questionable numbers, and the right response to high \n     Mexican failure rates is to apply existing U.S. trucking \n     regulations rigorously. The Senate measure goes beyond \n     legitimate rigor and blurs into imposing discriminatory \n     regulations on Mexican carriers. President Bush says he will \n     veto legislation unless such discrimination is removed from \n     it. That is the right course.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 31, 2001]\n\n Ban on Mexican Trucks Called ``Isolationist'' Sign; White House Turns \n                           Tables on Critics\n\n                   (By Dana Milbank and Helen Dewar)\n\n       White House officials, borrowing one of their critics' main \n     lines of attack, charged yesterday that those who opposed \n     President Bush's free-trade positions were ``isolationist'' \n     and ``unilateralist.''\n       The immediate issue in question was a Democratic proposal \n     before the Senate to block Mexican trucks from U.S. roads. \n     The proposal, which critics say includes 22 separate safety \n     provisions that together would have the effect of barring \n     Mexican trucks for two to three years, is included in a \n     transportation funding bill for next year. The House has \n     already passed a ban on Mexican trucks.\n       Bush ``thinks that the action taken by the United States \n     Senate is unilateralist,'' White House press secretary Ari \n     Fleischer said yesterday. He called the issue one of the \n     ``troubling signs of isolationism on the Hill.''\n       The argument, echoed by others in the administration, \n     signaled a new defense of Bush's policies that goes beyond \n     the narrow issue of what inspections would be required of \n     Mexican trucks entering the United States. Democrats and \n     other critics of the administration have argued that Bush is \n     pursuing a ``unilateralist'' foreign policy by rejecting \n     international efforts to limit global warming, small arms, \n     biological weapons and tax havens, and by promoting a \n     missile-defense proposal.\n       Bush advisers have decided to turn the tables on critics by \n     painting the Democrats as isolationists in other areas. In a \n     speech Thursday, U.S. Trade Representative Robert B. Zoellick \n     used a similar argument to promote the North American Free \n     Trade Agreement in general, warning against ``economic \n     isolationists and false purveyors of fright and retreat.''\n       In addition to Mexican trucks and NAFTA, White House \n     officials indicated they would make the ``isolationist'' \n     charge against Democrats over objections to giving Bush \n     broader trade negotiating authority and over their delay in \n     confirming Bush's choice for United Nations ambassador. \n     Consideration of the nominee, John D. Negroponte, has been \n     held up by criticism of his work as ambassador to Honduras in \n     the 1980s.\n       ``There's a series of issues Congress is taking up now \n     where it has to chose between an isolationist response and \n     whether America can compete and win in the world, and \n     Congress is leaning in the direction of isolation,'' \n     Fleischer said.\n       In the debate over Mexican trucks, the White House and its \n     allies also tried to reverse an argument about racial \n     insensitivity often used by Democrats. Last week, Senate \n     Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) criticized Democrats for \n     ``an anti-Mexican, anti-Hispanic, anti-NAFTA attitude.''\n       White House officials declined to join Lott in that \n     argument, saying only that the opposition to Mexican trucks \n     in the United States is ``unfair to Mexico'' because it would \n     single out that nation rather than impose a single standard \n     for the United States, Canada and Mexico. ``This is an issue \n     where the Democrats have to be careful or they're going to \n     cede the Hispanic vote to Republicans in 2002,'' a senior GOP \n     official said yesterday.\n       The Senate Democrats' proposal to impose strict safety \n     standards on Mexican trucks remained stalled yesterday by GOP \n     delaying tactics aimed at forcing a compromise acceptable to \n     the White House. Supporters of the Democrats' proposal, which \n     Bush has threatened to veto as an infringement on NAFTA, got \n     more than enough votes to cut off one filibuster against it \n     last week, virtually assuring its passage at some point. But \n     the proposal, opposed by Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Phil \n     Gramm (R-Tex.), faces more procedural hurdles before it can \n     be passed.\n       Senate Majority Leader Thomas A. Daschle (D-S.D.) yesterday \n     reiterated his determination to win passage of the measure \n     before the start of Congress's month-long summer recess this \n     weekend. Lott held out some hope that a House-Senate \n     conference might approve language satisfactory to Bush. If \n     not, he said, Bush will veto the bill and Congress will \n     sustain the veto.\n       As the Senate marked time on the issue, Enrique Ramirez \n     Jackson, president of the Mexican Senate, met separately with \n     Lott and Daschle on issues affecting the two countries and \n     expressed Mexico's hopes that its trucks will be given full \n     access to the United States, according to Senate aides.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the San Diego Union-Tribune, July 30, 2001]\n\n                          Fight for Free Trade\n\n       Under the North American Free Trade Agreement, U.S. trucks \n     are supposed to have unrestricted access to Mexico, and \n     Mexican trucks are supposed to have unrestricted access to \n     the United States. But for six years the powerful Teamsters \n     union has succeeded in keeping Mexican trucks off American \n     roads--in plain violation of NAFTA.\n       Now, it falls to President Bush to stand up once and for \n     all to the Teamsters' political muscle and defend the vital \n     principle of free cross-border trade. Bush should not \n     hesitate to veto a $60 billion transportation spending bill \n     that is the vehicle for the domestic trucking lobby's efforts \n     to block Mexican truckers' access to American highways.\n       Based on pre-NAFTA rules, which still are being enforced, \n     Mexican trucks are permitted to operate only within a 20-mile \n     zone north of the border. Beyond the border zone, their \n     cargoes must be transferred to American trucks for shipment \n     elsewhere in the United States or Canada. This is a costly \n     and time-consuming process that drives up prices for American \n     consumers.\n       Last year, when provisions of NAFTA required that Mexican \n     trucks be allowed to travel freely throughout the United \n     States, the Teamsters persuaded the Clinton White House to \n     suspend the requirement, on grounds that Mexican trucks were \n     unsafe. At the time, Vice President Al Gore was courting the \n     Teamsters' backing for his presidential campaign. When Mexico \n     rightly challenged the Clinton administration's politically \n     motivated action, a NAFTA arbitration panel ruled that the \n     U.S. ban on Mexican trucks violated the trade agreement.\n       To its credit, the Bush administration announced earlier \n     this year it would honor American obligations under NAFTA and \n     lift the restrictions on Mexican trucks. That touched off a \n     fierce lobbying drive by the Teamsters on Capitol Hill to \n     overturn the president's decision.\n       In response, the House voted to retain the ban on Mexican \n     trucks, while the Senate approved a milder version that would \n     impose much tougher safety standards on Mexican trucks than \n     exist for Canadian trucks, thereby making it more difficult \n     for Mexican trucks to enter the United States. (Because many \n     of its 1.4 million members are Canadians, the Teamsters union \n     has not sought to curb access by Canadian commercial vehicles \n     to American roads).\n       The Teamsters and their allies contend Mexican rigs are \n     unsafe, but the union's real\n\n[[Page S8508]]\n\n     motivation is to thwart competition from Mexican truckers. \n     When the House voted on the ban, it even refused to \n     appropriate the money President Bush had sought to strengthen \n     border inspection stations and keep out unsafe vehicles.\n       The White House is right on this issue.\n       President Bush should stand his ground and veto the \n     transportation measure if the onerous trucking provisions are \n     not removed. The simple way to deal with potentially unsafe \n     Mexican trucks is through robust inspections that turn back \n     unsafe vehicles--not through legislative subterfuge that is \n     little more than thinly disguised protectionism.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the papers I am quoting from--the New York \nTimes, Washington Post, Atlanta Constitution, Cleveland Plain Dealer--\nare not renowned rightwing conservative periodicals.\n  This is from the Cleveland Plain Dealer of July 30, 2001:\n\n       The Democrat-controlled Senate, with the help of enough \n     Republicans to block a filibuster, decided last week that \n     equal protection under the law doesn't apply to Mexico under \n     NAFTA.\n       Beneath a veneer of safety concerns, the Senate refused to \n     eliminate the trade barriers that keep Mexican trucking \n     companies from carrying freight beyond a 20-mile border zone, \n     no matter that among their fleets are some of the most \n     modern, best-equipped trucks on any nation's roads.\n       It's a witches' brew of protectionist politics disguised as \n     precaution, fueled by the demands of organized labor, that \n     gives off a stench of old-fashioned ethnic prejudice. What's \n     more, it invites a trade war of retaliation, should Mexico \n     decide to close its borders to U.S.-driven imports. Combined \n     with an even harsher House-passed version incorporated in the \n     Department of Transportation appropriations bill, it invites \n     a veto by President George W. Bush.\n       No one supporting Mexico's rights under the North American \n     Free Trade Agreement ever has argued that American roads \n     should be opened to unsafe vehicles. But in the years since \n     NAFTA was passed, Mexico has made giant strides to improve \n     its fleets. Some of its largest trucking companies now have \n     rigs whose quality surpasses those of American companies.\n       But safety is little more than a straw dog in this fight. \n     What this is about is the $140 billion in goods shipped to \n     the United States from Mexico each year, and the Teamsters \n     Union's desire that its members keep control of that \n     lucrative trade.\n       Labor--which documents gathered in a four-year Federal \n     Elections Commission Probe show has had veto power over \n     Democratic Party positions for years--has never accepted the \n     benefits of expanded hemispheric trade. It has been adamant \n     in its opposition to allowing Mexican trucks, no matter how \n     modern the equipment or well-trained the drivers, access to \n     U.S. highways. It was this opposition that kept President \n     Bill Clinton from implementing the agreement, and it is this \n     opposition that yet drives labor's handservants, who now \n     control the Senate.\n       This position should be an embarrassment to a party that \n     makes a show of its concerns for the poor and downtrodden. It \n     is a setback to U.S.-Mexican relations, and an insult to \n     Mexico's good and earnest efforts to improve relations with \n     its northern neighbor. It is an abrogation of our treaty \n     responsibilities, and it must not be allowed to stand.\n\n  I repeat, that is from the Cleveland Plain Dealer.\n  Quoting from the New York Times from July 30, the Monday edition, \ntitled ``Teamsters May Stall Bush Goals for Mexican Trucks and Trade,'' \nan article by Philip Shenon:\n\n       A lobbying campaign led by the Teamsters union to keep \n     Mexican trucks off American roads is on the verge of handing \n     organized labor a major legislative victory over President \n     Bush, endangering one of his most cherished foreign policy \n     goals and reminding the White House of the political muscle \n     still flexed here by labor unions.\n       If the Teamsters prevail, it could undermine the \n     president's hopes of improved trade and diplomatic ties with \n     Mexico, which has demanded the opening of the border to \n     Mexican trucks under terms of the eight-year-old North \n     American Free Trade Agreement. Mr. Bush had hoped to comply \n     by next year.\n       Nafta and its liberalized trade rules have long been a \n     target of the Teamsters, which has 1.4 million members, many \n     of them truck drivers.\n\n  Mr. President, it is a very interesting article. I won't take the \ntime to read it all. It basically points out the facts, which are that \nthis is not really about safety; this is about the Teamsters Union and \nlabor flexing their muscles. I will repeat, as I have over and over \nagain, the Senator from Texas and I have put detailed, comprehensive \nsafety requirements into our legislation which would clearly protect \nevery American from any unsafe Mexican truck entering into the United \nStates of America because it requires every Mexican truck to be \ninspected. But, obviously, that is not good enough for the Teamsters or \nfor those who support the legislation that is presently in the \nTransportation appropriations legislation.\n  I want to say a few words about the underlying bill. It is \ninteresting. So far this year, spending levels, including this bill, \nhave surpassed the President's total budget request by nearly $4 \nbillion. This year's bill contains 683 earmarks, totaling $3.148 \nbillion in porkbarrel spending. Last year there were 753 earmarks, \ntotaling $702 million. There has been a dramatic increase in the number \nof earmarks and porkbarrel spending.\n  According to the Office of Management and Budget, the number of \nunrequested projects inserted into spending bills approved by Congress \nrose from 1,724 in 1993 to 3,476 in 2000 and, ultimately, to 6,454 in \nthe current fiscal year.\n  Our colleagues in the House of Representatives requested close to \n19,000 earmarks this year, at a cost of $279 billion if all were \napproved. This year's overindulgence of earmarks is so egregious that \nMitch Daniels, Director of OMB, wrote a letter to the Senate \nAppropriations Committee imploring them to cut the excessive earmarks \nincluded in the House-passed appropriations bills when they got to the \nSenate.\n  As always, some benefit substantially more than others. I have \nmentioned the State of West Virginia, which will be the proud recipient \nof $6,599,062 under the National Scenic Byways Program. I have also \nmentioned the State of Washington, which benefits substantially from \nthe National Scenic Byways Program. Under that portion of the bill, \nWashington will receive $2,683,767, of which $790,680 will fund the \nNorth Pend Orielle Scenic Byway--Sweet Creek Falls Interpretive Trail \nProject, et cetera, et cetera.\n  I am sure these are worthy projects. Why in the world weren't they \nauthorized? Why was there not a hearing? Why were they inserted in \nlegislation which gave no consideration to other projects and programs \nthat other States have? Every State deserves the right to compete for \nFederal dollars under programs such as the National Scenic Byways \nProgram, not just States that are fortunate to have representation in \nthe congressional Appropriations committees.\n  I can't let this opportunity go by again without mentioning the \n$4.650 million that is carved out of the Coast Guard portion of this \nbill to ``test and evaluate'' a currently developed 85-foot fast patrol \ncraft that is manufactured in the United States and has a top speed of \n40 knots. Mr. President, translation. That is ``French'' for a \nporkbarrel project for the State of Washington. It is the only place \nwhere this vessel can be tested and evaluated in the United States, and \nit has a top speed of 40 knots. Guess where. Guardian Marine \nInternational, located in Edmonds, WA. Not only did the U.S. Coast \nGuard not ask for this vessel, they looked at the Guardian vessel, \nconsidered its merits, and concluded it would not meet the Coast \nGuard's needs.\n\n  What is wrong with that? Well, we have severe personnel problems with \nrecruitment and retention in the Coast Guard today. We need to spend \nthis money not on an 85-foot patrol craft that the Coast Guard doesn't \nwant or need; we need to spend it on the men and women in the Coast \nGuard, improve their housing, improve their living conditions. We need \nto provide them with the pay and benefits they need and deserve.\n  What are we doing spending $4.650 million on a project that will be \nuseless? This will be a one-of-a-kind vessel. It will sit by itself, \nand it will have huge maintenance and upkeep costs because it will be \none of a kind, instead of giving the Air Force the craft they need.\n  I guess the Senate Appropriations Committee has a better \nunderstanding than the Coast Guard of what equipment will and won't \nwork best. Maybe we are all wasting our time. Perhaps we should abolish \nthe Department of Transportation and allow our appropriators to act as \nour new transportation specialists.\n  I will mention one thing that was in Congress Daily this morning:\n\n       Nussle Warns of Possible Fiscal Year 2001 Spending Cuts.\n       House Budget Chairman Nussle warned Tuesday that if budget \n     forecasts continue to worsen, Congress might have to take \n     drastic\n\n[[Page S8509]]\n\n     steps, including trimming Federal spending, to preserve \n     surpluses for debt reduction. ``Spending may have to be \n     curtailed after CBO releases the midsession review,'' Nussle \n     said. ``If we want to pay off more debt, we need to reduce \n     spending.''\n\n  What is this appropriations bill doing? Increasing spending. What did \nthe others do? Already we have increased spending in the appropriations \nbills we have passed by some $4 billion. It is a dangerous course of \naction we are engaged in. This continued earmark porkbarrel spending is \ngoing to exact a very heavy price. This bill is replete with them. This \nbill, in my view, is typical of the kind of product for which we may \npay a very heavy price in the future, where we may have to make cuts in \nreally needed programs, including those that are for those who are in \nneed in our society and our Nation.\n  So I want to assure my colleagues that, contrary to what may have \nbeen contemplated here, yes, we will have a vote on final passage of \nthe bill. Then there will be three votes after that concerning the \nappointment of conferees that are key and are debatable and will \nrequire cloture motions as well. So, clearly, we will have stretched \nthis issue out into the month of September, at least.\n  I remind my colleagues that our President is welcoming the President \nof Mexico to the United States in September. In fact, I am told that \nthe first official state dinner hosted by President Bush will be in \nhonor of President Fox. I think that is a very appropriate and very \nimportant and significant occasion because of the importance of our \nrelations with Mexico. I hope we will not be continuing on a course of \nviolating a solemn treaty between our two nations while the President \nof Mexico is present and being honored in the United States of America.\n  I thank my colleague from Texas for his steadfast efforts in this \nendeavor. I think he may join me again this year in being voted ``Miss \nCongeniality.'' Perhaps we will share the honor. The fact is that we \nbelieve passionately that this kind of activity --legislative activity \non an appropriations bill--is absolutely, totally inappropriate, and \nthe impact and implications of passage of such legislation through the \nCongress of the United States not only is very bad for our relations \nwith one country, but if this body gets into the business on \nappropriations bills of amending treaties and making solemn treaties \nillegal and unconstitutional, and violates them, then of course that \nkind of precedent is very bad for all of the institutions of this great \ndemocracy of ours.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I have a number of editorials which \nsupport the position the majority of Senators have taken in terms of \nthe commonsense safety approaches written in the underlying \nTransportation bill.\n  Let me begin by quoting from the Seattle Post-Intelligencer editorial \nboard from this morning:\n\n       Mexican trucks are welcome in this country so long as they \n     make the same safety criteria required of all the vehicles \n     that travel here. Senator Patty Murray has taken just the \n     right approach to this sensitive and contentious issue. The \n     Bush administration, which unwisely has threatened to veto \n     the transportation bill over this matter, contends that under \n     terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mexican \n     trucks should be allowed to travel freely beyond the 20-mile \n     commercial zone at the southern border to which they are now \n     restricted.\n       The House of Representatives disagrees. It voted to keep \n     the trucks limited to where they now are, permitted to travel \n     when delivering Mexican goods to U.S. markets. Murray, who \n     heads the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on \n     Transportation, wrote the transportation bill that rightly \n     requires Mexican trucks to have safety inspections and to be \n     insured by a carrier licensed to do business in the United \n     States before they can travel in this country. These are \n     simple, commonsense requirements.\n\n  From the Roanoke Times & World News:\n\n       Among other things, certainly the inspections indicate an \n     element of protectionism but of the public safety, not the \n     spirit of free trade. By a large bipartisan majority, 19 \n     Republicans joined all 50 Democrats and one independent. The \n     Senate voted Thursday to end a filibuster to kill the tougher \n     standards. Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott charged that the \n     initiative was anti-Mexican and anti-Hispanic and suggested \n     that Mexican trucks should be inspected according to the same \n     standards as Canadian trucks. Lott commits aggravated \n     silliness.\n       A recent study by the Inspector General of the \n     Transportation Department found that nearly two in five \n     Mexican trucks failed basic safety inspections compared with \n     one in four U.S. trucks and one in seven Canadian trucks. In \n     addition, Mexican truckers are often overworked and their \n     fatigue could pose a danger to American drivers.\n       As for violating the free trade spirit of NAFTA, the treaty \n     already contains provisions allowing legitimate safety \n     regulations. Given the clear evidence presented by the \n     Transportation Department, Congress would be remiss by \n     opening U.S. borders to trucks known to be unsafe.\n\n  From the Press Democrat in Santa Rosa, CA:\n\n       With Mexican trucks failing border inspections nearly two \n     in five times, safety is a far more important concern. The \n     dismal record is an indication that a well-funded border \n     inspection program is critical. The Senate proposal, which \n     requires around-the-clock border inspections, is a balanced \n     measure that will allow trucking while still keeping roads \n     relatively safe. But with one in four American trucks failing \n     safety tests, do not take your eyes off the rear view mirror \n     any time soon.\n\n  From the Sarasota Herald Tribune:\n\n       Public safety, not politics, money, free trade or \n     international relations, should be the priority as American \n     leaders debate whether to allow tractor trailers from Mexico \n     to deliver goods in the United States.\n\n  From the Deseret News:\n\n       A Senate bill would apply a simple solution. It would \n     require the Mexican truckers to obtain U.S. insurance and to \n     pass safety inspections before crossing the border. Then the \n     trucks would be free to travel where they would like within \n     the United States and presumably to Canada. These are \n     sensible requirements that ultimately could save lives. The \n     only objection the President can offer is that Congress does \n     not hold Canadian truckers to the same standards, but \n     Congress does not need to do so. Canada already holds its \n     truckers to standards more rigid than those in the United \n     States.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       The only way to end the problem of illegal immigration is \n     to help Mexico's economy grow to the point where leaving the \n     country no longer is necessary for survival and prosperity. \n     But this cannot be done at the peril of highway safety in the \n     United States. Despite the threats of a veto, Congress needs \n     to pass tough standards on all trucks that come from south of \n     the border.\n\n  From the Providence Journal:\n\n       Kudos to the Senate for voting 70-30 for strict safety \n     standards for Mexican trucks on U.S. roads. The government \n     has the duty to ensure that foreign truckers follow the same \n     rules that American ones do. Statistics show trucks from \n     Mexico with more lenient safety standards than the United \n     States are 50 percent more likely to fail U.S. inspections \n     than ours. A race to the bottom is intolerable.\n\n  From the Seattle Times Editorial Board:\n\n       Suggesting inspections will inhibit free trade is more than \n     a bit disingenuous, given that current law keeps Mexican \n     trucks within a 20-mile zone along the U.S. border. Earlier \n     this summer, the House of Representatives passed a harsh \n     measure to block any Mexican trucks from venturing beyond \n     that zone. Opening U.S. highways to Mexico's trucking \n     industry is in the full spirit of NAFTA, as long as the \n     trucks are safe and insured. This is hardly onerous. Indeed, \n     Canadian trucks and truckers have a better inspection record \n     than U.S. trucks. Do not take too much of the Teamsters \n     Union's backing the safety measure as if to suggest it was a \n     topic with heavy labor influence. Only a fraction of U.S. \n     drivers are represented by organized labor. This fight is \n     fundamentally about highway safety. Creating a haven of \n     lesser standards south of the border might invite the U.S. \n     trucking industry to essentially reflag their fleets where \n     regulations are lax.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that all of the editorials \nto which I have referred, as well as a press release from the AAA of \nTexas chapter, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Aug. 1, 2001]\n\n             Impose U.S. Safety Standards on Mexican Trucks\n\n       Mexican trucks are welcome in this country--so long as they \n     meet the same safety criteria required of all other vehicles \n     that travel here.\n       Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., has taken just the right \n     approach to this sensitive and contentious issue, which \n     threatens to derail the transportation bill and some $140 \n     million in much-needed funding earmarked by Murray for this \n     state.\n       The Bush administration, which unwisely has threatened to \n     veto the transportation bill over this matter, contends that \n     under terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement, \n     Mexican trucks should be allowed to travel freely beyond the \n     20-mile\n\n[[Page S8510]]\n\n     commercial zone at the southern border to which they are now \n     restricted.\n       The House of Representatives disagrees; it voted to keep \n     the trucks limited to where they now are permitted to travel \n     when delivering Mexican goods to U.S. markets.\n       Murray, who heads the Senate appropriations subcommittee on \n     transportation, wrote the transportation bill that rightly \n     requires Mexican trucks to have safety inspections and to be \n     insured by a carrier licensed to do business in the United \n     States before they can travel in this country.\n       These are simply common-sense requirements. However, care \n     must be taken in implementation to avoid having them become a \n     bogus trade barrier.\n       Murray contends Mexican trucks are less safe than U.S. \n     trucks. She says a recent study by the inspector general of \n     the Department of Transportation found that nearly two in \n     five Mexican trucks failed basic safety inspections compared \n     with one in four American trucks and one in seven Canadian \n     trucks. Since Canadian trucks appear safer than American \n     ones, there seems no rationale for imposing additional \n     requirements on them.\n       But President Bush, rightly has at the top of his \n     international agenda improving relations with Mexico, says it \n     would be too expensive and time-consuming to require the \n     Mexican trucks to meet U.S. safety and insurance standards. \n     However, introducing unsafe trucks on U.S. highways is \n     unlikely to improve relations between our two countries; \n     quite the opposite.\n       Mexico, meanwhile, has raised the possibility that it might \n     restrict the import of American agricultural goods in \n     retaliation. That's non-productive. A better course is to \n     assure Mexican trucks meet international safety standards.\n       Murray, who also chairs the Democratic Senate Campaign \n     Committee, happens to be on the same page in this dispute as \n     the all-powerful Teamsters union, which ardently opposes the \n     entrance of Mexican trucks and their low-paid, often \n     overworked, non-unionized drivers. The Teamsters clearly have \n     a self-interest in putting the brakes on the entrance of \n     Mexican trucks.\n       Murray's business, however, is the public interest, not \n     that of the Teamsters. We believe that in insisting that \n     Mexican trucks comply with U.S. laws, she's property \n     discharging that larger duty.\n       As a NAFTA arbitration panel acknowledged last February, \n     the United States is ``responsible for the safe operation of \n     trucks within U.S. territory, whether ownership is U.S., \n     Canadian or Mexican.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n          [From the Roanoke Times & World News, July 28, 2001]\n\n             Require Mexican Trucks To Meet the Safety Test\n\n       As frequent drivers of Interstate 81 can attest, sharing \n     the road with high-balling semi-trailer trucks intensifies \n     anxiety about highway safety, even with the assumption those \n     behemoths meet safety-inspection standards.\n       The same assumption cannot be applied to Mexican trucks, \n     about 40 percent of which fail U.S. standards, so the U.S. \n     Senate's hesitation this week to allow free entry of big \n     commercial Mexican vehicles onto U.S. highways in January is \n     both understandable and prudent.\n       President Bush, the Senate's Republican leadership and the \n     Mexican government have opposed an amendment to the pending \n     $60 billion Senate transportation spending bill that would \n     require much stricter safety inspections before allowing the \n     Mexican trucks to venture freely onto U.S. highways. \n     Opponents contend that such a restriction violates the North \n     American Free Trade Agreement.\n       Certainly, the inspections indicate an element of \n     protectionism--but of the public safety, not the spirit of \n     free trade.

Some alarm has been expressed \n     by farming states and agriculture lobbyists after Mexican \n     officials threatened to consider restrictions on U.S. \n     agricultural imports if the bill becomes law.\n       Congress should be more concerned about the lives of \n     Americans driving on U.S. highways.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          [From the Press Democrat Santa Rosa, July 30, 2001]\n\n Mexican Trucks Senate Proposal Allows Free Trade While Ensuring Safer \n                                 Roads\n\n       In February an arbitration panel determined that the \n     Clinton administration policy limiting Mexican trucks to a \n     20-mile border zone violated the North American Free Trade \n     Agreement.\n       Since that ruling, Congress, President Bush and the \n     Teamsters union have been fighting over how to regulate 18-\n     wheelers originating from Mexico.\n       The Teamsters union opposes opening the border to Mexican \n     truckers because it fears losing union jobs. In other words, \n     having lost the free trade battle in 1993, it is now trying \n     to unravel NAFTA piece-by-piece.

Currently, big trucks from Mexico are limited to \n     a 20-mile zone near the border.\n       In recent days, a bipartisan group in the Senate has pushed \n     for a stricter U.S. inspection program for Mexican trucks. \n     They cite statistics indicating that trucks from Mexico are \n     almost 50 percent more likely to fail inspections than U.S. \n     trucks.\n       But Bush and his allies on this issue, including Sen.

In recent years, federal safety officials \n     have documented a steady increase in the number of deaths \n     caused by accidents involving big trucks.

For the \n     Bush administration, it has to do with the Hispanic vote, of \n     which he obtained only 35 percent last year. For the \n     Democrats, it has to do with organized labor, which would \n     love to drive into Mexico but doesn't want to lose any jobs \n     by allowing the Mexicans to drive here.\n       Those are the currents running swiftly beneath the surface. \n     On the top, however, the debate is centering on the only \n     thing that really ought to matter--safety.\n       Organized labor lost its fight to keep Mexican businesses \n     out eight years ago when Congress passed the North American \n     Free Trade Agreement. Bush's support among Hispanics, and his \n     relationship with Mexican President Vicente Fox (who has \n     threatened trade retaliation against the United States) have \n     to be dealt with in a different arena. This is a question of \n     keeping unsafe vehicles off the highway.\n       Current rules allow Mexican trucks to travel no further \n     than 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) over the border--just far \n     enough to unload their cargo onto American trucks. Border \n     inspectors there have found that more than one-third of \n     Mexican trucks fail to meet the safety standards required of \n     American trucks.\n       A Senate bill would apply a simply solution. It would \n     require the Mexican truckers to obtain U.S. insurance and to \n     pass safety inspections before crossing the border. Then the \n     trucks would be free to travel where they would like within \n     the United States and, presumably, to Canada. These are \n     sensible requirements that ultimately could save lives. The \n     only objection the president can offer is that Congress \n     doesn't hold Canadian truckers to the same standards.\n       But Congress doesn't need to do so. Canada already holds \n     its truckers to standards more rigid than those in the United \n     States.\n       In many ways, this is an example of the types of conflicts \n     that will occasionally arise when attempting free trade with \n     a nation\n\n[[Page S8511]]\n\n     whose economy is struggling to stand on its own. Mexico has \n     made great strides in recent years, eliminating much of the \n     corruption that used to plague its one-party government. The \n     United States should reward those efforts with increased \n     trade.

Despite the threats of a veto, Congress \n     needs to pass tough standards on all trucks that come from \n     south of the border.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Providence Journal, July 29, 2001]\n\n                           Divers Ruminations\n\n       Kudos to the Senate for voting, 70 to 30, for strict safety \n     standards for Mexican trucks on U.S. roads.

Patty Murray led a strong, appropriate \n     effort to require tougher safety standards for Mexican trucks \n     entering the United States.\n       The White House and Republican leadership waged a phony war \n     against this highway-safety measure with claims it undermined \n     the 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement and relations \n     with our neighbor.\n       Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., stooped so low \n     as to suggest the effort was anti-Mexican. Poppycock. This is \n     about improving standards for Mexican trucks that are 50 \n     percent more likely to fail U.S. inspections than American \n     vehicles.\n       Nineteen Republicans joined Senate Democrats to knock down \n     parliamentary attempts to tie up the requirements for regular \n     U.S. inspections of Mexican trucks and drivers, on-site \n     audits of Mexican trucking firms, and more scales and \n     inspectors at 27 U.S. border stations.\n       Suggesting inspections will inhibit free trade is more than \n     a bit disingenuous given that current law keeps Mexican \n     trucks within a 20-mile zone along the U.S. border. Earlier \n     this summer, the House of Representatives passed a harsh \n     measure to block any Mexican trucks from venturing beyond \n     that zone.\n       Opening U.S. highways to Mexico's trucking industry is in \n     the full spirit of NAFTA, as long as the trucks are safe and \n     insured. This is hardly onerous. Indeed, Canadian trucks and \n     truckers have a better inspection record than U.S. trucks.\n       Don't make too much of the Teamsters Union backing the \n     safety measure, as if to suggest it was a topic with heavy \n     labor influence. Only a fraction of U.S. drivers are \n     represented by organized labor. This fight is fundamentally \n     about highway safety.\n       Creating a haven of lesser standards south of the border \n     might invite the U.S. trucking industry to essentially re-\n     flag their fleets where regulations are lax.\n       At the same time, Congress must not create a system of \n     rules and standards that are thinly veiled trade barriers. \n     Murray and Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., transportation \n     committee allies on this effort, are not headed in that \n     direction.\n       The White House wants to make sure NAFTA is supported and \n     that Mexico is nurtured as a friend, ally and trading \n     partner. But the Bush administration's garbled, inconsistent \n     response on truck safety only confused matters.\n       Opening America's roads to Mexican trucks and truckers is \n     in the best spirit of free trade.

By a large bipartisan majority--19 Republicans \n     joined all 50 Democrats and one independent--the Senate voted \n     Thursday to end a filibuster to kill the tougher standards.\n       Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., charged that \n     the initiative was ``anti-Mexican'' and ``anti-Hispanic,'' \n     and suggested that Mexican trucks should be inspected \n     according to the same standards as Canadian trucks.\n       Lott commits aggravated silliness. A recent study by the \n     inspector general of the Transportation Department found that \n     nearly two in five Mexican trucks failed basic safety \n     inspections, compared with one in four U.S. trucks and one in \n     seven Canadian trucks. In addition, Mexican truckers are \n     often overworked, and their fatigue could pose a danger to \n     American drivers.\n       As for violating the free-trade spirit of NAFTA, the treaty \n     already contains provisions allowing legitimate safety \n     regulations. Given the clear evidence presented by the \n     Transportation Department, Congress would be remiss by \n     opening U.S. borders to trucks known to be unsafe.\n       President Bush has threatened to veto the entire \n     transportation spending bill if Congress fails to remove the \n     tougher inspection standards. Some alarm has been expressed \n     by farming states and agriculture lobbyists after Mexican \n     officials threatened to consider restrictions on U.S. \n     agricultural imports if the bill becomes law.\n       Congress should be more concerned about the lives of \n     Americans driving on U.S. highways.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          [Press release from the ``Triple A'' Texas Chapter]\n\n  Truck Safety Inspections Must Drive Plan To Open Border; AAA Texas \n             Calls on Congress To Put Motorist Safety First\n\n       (News/Assignment Editors & Government/Automotive Writers)\n\n       Houston--(Business Wire)--July 25, 2001.--AAA Texas is \n     urging Congress to significantly increase the safety \n     inspections of Mexico-origination trucks before allowing them \n     unrestricted access to roads in Texas and the rest of the \n     U.S. as provided under the North American Free Trade \n     Agreement (NAFTA).\n       Currently, trucks based in Mexico are allowed to travel up \n     to 20 miles inside the U.S. border.

The Senate \n     proposal is being debated this week for inclusion in the \n     Department of Transportation appropriations bill.\n\n  These are not my words. They are not the words of Senator Shelby. \nThey are not the words of any Senator. They are the words of the AAA of \nTexas chapter.\n  Our opponents have clearly lost the safety debate and, unfortunately, \ninstead of allowing us to move forward with a balanced bipartisan \ncompromise, they have used many parliamentary tactics to slow down this \nprocess in hopes of extracting some concessions.\n  Their approach, I believe, is unfortunate and unsuccessful. I am not \nhere to respond in kind. Their attacks have done a disservice to this \nimportant debate on the highway safety issue. I want my colleagues to \nrecognize these insults have been unnecessary and have delayed putting \nthis bill to work for the American people. Opponents held hostage a $60 \nbillion bill that funds transportation solutions in every State because \nthey want to lower safety standards for Mexican trucks.\n  We can improve free trade and ensure our own safety at the same time. \nThis bill is a balanced and bipartisan compromise. I will turn to some \nof the specific provisions that have the other side so concerned. They \nare simple and they make sense. They do not violate NAFTA. Most \nimportantly, they will help keep Americans safe on the highways.\n  Here is what our bill requires: Mexican trucks only be allowed to \ncross the border at stations where there are inspectors on duty; our \nbill requires the Department of Transportation's inspector general to \ncertify border inspection officers are fully trained as safety \nspecialists capable of conducting compliance reviews; further, the \nadministration cannot raid the safety personnel who are working at \nother areas today just to staff the southern border; that the \nDepartment of Transportation perform a compliance review of Mexican \ntrucking firms and that these take place onsite at each firm's \nfacilities; that Mexican truckers comply with pertinent hours of \nservice rules; that the United States and Mexican Governments work out \na system where United States law enforcement officials can verify the \nstatus and validity of licenses, vehicle registration, operating \nauthority, and proper insurance; that all State inspectors, funded in \npart or in whole with Federal funds, check for violations of Federal \nregulations; that all violations of Federal law detected by State \ninspectors will either be enforced by State inspectors or forwarded to \nFederal authorities for enforcement action; that the Department of \nTransportation's inspector general certify there is adequate capacity \nto conduct a sufficient number of meaningful truck inspections to \nmaintain safety; that proper systems be put in place to ensure \ncompliance with United States weight limits; that an adequate system be \nestablished to allow access to data related to the safety record of \nMexican trucking firms and drivers; and finally, that the Department of \nTransportation enact rules on the following points: To ensure that \nmotor carriers are knowledgeable about United States safety standards; \nto improve training and provide certification of motor carrier safety \nauditors; to ensure that foreign motor carriers be prohibited from \nleasing their vehicles to another carrier to transport products to the \nUnited States while the firm is subjected to a suspension, restriction, \nor limitation on rights to operate in the United States; and that the \nUnited States permanently disqualify foreign motor carriers that have \nbeen found to have operated illegally in the United States.\n  These are commonsense standards which the President is opposing. \nThese simple, reasonable standards are what those on the other side \nhave used to stall this bill. Senator Shelby and I have spent hours, \nwhich have turned into days, and now weeks, trying to find \naccommodation with the opponents of this provision. Safety opponents \nseem most upset by the onsite inspection and the insurance \nrequirements, but the truth is these are the same standards we \ncurrently follow with Mexico in areas such as food safety.\n  Let's start with the requirement that American inspectors review the \nrecords and conduct onsite inspections in Mexico. Safety opponents want \nus to believe this is somehow an invasion of Mexico's sovereignty, but \nthere is nothing uncommon about this provision. The trucking records \nand the facilities are in Mexico. That is where our inspectors need to \ngo if they are going to check. Onsite safety inspections are common in \nother industries.\n\n  In my home State of Washington, we grow the best apples in the world. \nI know the Presiding Officer may disagree, but I believe we do. They \ninclude varieties such as the Red Delicious, the Gala, the Johnny Gold, \nand the Fuji. We grow these apples in my home State of Washington, and \nwe export them all over the world, including Mexico. Before Mexico will \nallow the growers in my State to send those apples to Mexican \nconsumers, those apples have to be inspected. Who inspects them? \nMexican inspectors. Where are these apples inspected? Onsite, in \nWashington State. In fact, American apple growers foot the bill for \nMexican inspectors to evaluate our fruit in my home State of \nWashington.\n  It is not just Washington State. Mexican inspectors are in \nCalifornia, inspecting fruit, checking for pests in crops such as \nmangoes and avocados.\n  Today on food safety issues, Mexican inspectors are in the United \nStates conducting onsite investigations in our orchards and on our \nfarms. To the other side, that is OK. But for some reason, when we want \nour safety inspectors to conduct onsite inspections at Mexican trucking \nfacilities, it is an attack on Mexican sovereignty. On food safety \nissues, inspectors are in both countries with the full support of both \nGovernments.\n  Why should traffic safety be any different? How can we argue that we \nshould protect our agricultural interests and neglect the very real \nsafety concerns on America's roadways? How can we protect the food \ndestined for America's children yet leave them vulnerable to unsafe \ntrucks on our roadways?\n  I turn now to a second issue. Safety opponents do not like the \ninsurance portion of this bill which requires Mexican trucks to carry \nadequate insurance with an insurer that is licensed to operate in the \nUnited States. Our safety opponents have been on the floor saying that \nis discriminatory. The truth is, Canadian trucks have to follow the \nsame rule today. And even\n\n[[Page S8513]]\n\nmore significantly, Mexico requires the same thing of American drivers \ntoday. That is right. I invite my colleagues to go to the Web page of \nthe State of Texas Department of Insurance. You will find a special \nmessage from the Texas Insurance Commissioner, stating:\n\n       If you plan to drive to Mexico, your preparations should \n     include making sure you have car insurance that will protect \n     you if you have an accident south of the border. Don't count \n     on your Texas auto policy for protection.\n\n  It goes on:\n\n       Mexico does not recognize auto viability policies issued by \n     U.S. insurance companies. It is important, therefore, to buy \n     liability coverage from authorized Mexican casualty insurance \n     companies before driving any distance in Mexico.\n\n  Madam President, that applies to trucks, as well. Let me repeat what \nthe State of Texas Insurance Commissioner is warning American drivers:\n\n       Mexico does not recognize auto liability policies issued by \n     U.S. insurance companies. It is, therefore, important to buy \n     liability coverage from authorized Mexican casualty insurance \n     companies before driving any distance in Mexico.\n\n  Why is it OK for American drivers to be required to get Mexican \ninsurance to drive to Mexico but discriminatory for Mexican drivers to \nbe required to get American insurance when they drive in the United \nStates? The truth is, there is no difference.\n  On yet another point, the opponents of safety standards lose because \nwhat they oppose is already part of our relationship with Mexico and \nthey cannot have it both ways. We have nothing against Mexican truck \ndrivers. Like American truck drivers, they are just trying to earn a \nliving and put food on their family's table. We welcome them to the \nUnited States. We want their trucks to be able to share our roads. But \nwe want them to be safe, first, both for our well-being and for their \nwell-being.\n  Unfortunately, today Mexican trucks are not as safe as American \ntrucks. In fact, there is not even a system in place to check the \nsafety of Mexican drivers. We want to enable Mexico to meet our safety \nstandards, which are the same safety standards Canadian drivers must \nmeet every day.\n  Right now, Mexican standards are not up to American standards. For \nexample, Mexico has a far less rigid safety regime in place than Canada \nor the United States. Mexico has no experience with laws restricting \nthe amount of time a driver may spend behind the wheel. The United \nStates and Canada do. Mexico has no experience with logbook \nrequirements as a way to enforce hours of service regulations. The \nUnited States and Canada do.\n  Mexico has no requirement for the periodic inspection of their \nequipment for safety purposes. The United States and Canada do.\n  Mexico does not have a fully operational roadside inspection regime \nto ensure compliance with driver and equipment safety standards. The \nUnited States and Canada do.\n  Mexico does not have adequate data regarding Mexican firms or drivers \nto guarantee against forged documentation as we do with domestic and \nCanadian firms.\n  All of this means that when a Mexican truck crosses the border into \nthe United States, we will have virtually no assurance that those \ntrucks meet U.S. highway safety standards. The proof is in the record. \nMexican trucks that cross the U.S. border to legally serve the \ncommercial zone have been ordered off the road by U.S. motor carrier \ninspectors 50 percent more frequently than U.S.-owned trucks.\n  Some of my colleagues in the administration think this is just fine. \nI do not and Senator Shelby does not and a majority of the Senate does \nnot. We as a country have made great strides to improve our highway \nsafety. One of the greatest contributions to highway safety was an \ninitiative by Senator Danforth requiring a uniform commercial driver's \nlicense or CDL here in the United States. That requirement came in the \nwake of numerous horror stories where U.S. truckdrivers had their \nlicenses revoked and then got new licenses in other States so they \ncould continue driving. Jack Danforth put a stop to that. He \nestablished a system in the United States where we monitor the issuance \nof commercial driver's licenses in all 50 States to ensure that \nmultiple licenses are not being issued to the same driver. There is no \nsuch system in Mexico. In fact, there is hardly a system at all that \nallows access to the driving record history of Mexican drivers.\n  None of us want to learn of a catastrophic truck accident that could \nhave been avoided. For some reason our commonsense safety provisions \nare being called discriminatory. Under NAFTA, we are entitled to treat \nCanadian, U.S., and Mexican trucking firms differently based on what we \nknow about the safety risks they represent.\n  The opponents of this provision are fond of quoting the NAFTA \nprovisions related to national treatment and most-favored-nation \ntreatment, and they read, respectively:\n\n       Each party shall accord to service providers of another \n     party, treatment no less favorable than it accords in like \n     circumstances to its own service providers.\n       Each party shall accord to service providers of another \n     party, treatment no less favorable than it accords in like \n     circumstances to its own service providers of any other party \n     or of a nonparty.\n\n  The opponents of this provision have focused on the ``no less \nfavorable'' language of this clause, but they have left the other part \nout. I want to spend a moment discussing ``like circumstances'' \nlanguage. It permits differential treatment where appropriate to meet \nlegitimate regulatory goals, including highway safety. Don't take my \nword for it. Let's look at NAFTA, chapter 21, which says clearly \n``nothing in chapter 12''--this is the cross-border trade services \nsection:\n\n       . . . shall be construed to prevent the adoption or \n     enforcement by any party of any measures necessary to \n     security compliance with laws or regulations that are not \n     inconsistent with the provisions of this agreement including \n     those related to health and safety and consumer protection.\n\n  In 1993, when Congress ratified the NAFTA-implementing language, it \nalso approved the U.S. Statement of Administrative Actions which says \nin part:\n\n       The ``no less favorable'' standard applied in articles 1202 \n     and 1203 does not require that service providers from other \n     NAFTA countries receive the same or even equal treatment as \n     that provided to local companies or other foreign firms. \n     Foreign Service providers can be treated differently if \n     circumstances warrant. For example, a State may impose \n     special requirements on Canadian and Mexican service \n     providers if necessary to protect consumers, to the same \n     degree as they are protected in respective local firms.\n\n  Ultimately there is one authority that decides what violates NAFTA \nand what does not, despite what we have heard on this floor over the \nlast week and a half. Who decides is the NAFTA arbitration panel. Here \nis what they had to say in their ruling on this very topic:\n\n       The United States may not be required to treat applications \n     from Mexican trucking firms in exactly the same manner as \n     applications from the United States or Canadian firms. U.S. \n     authorities are responsible for the safe operations of trucks \n     within U.S. territory, whether ownership is United States, \n     Canadian, or Mexican.\n\n  So the NAFTA treaty itself stipulates that the U.S. can take measures \nto ensure the safety of its citizens. Congress' intent was clearly to \nallow this, and the NAFTA arbitration panel agrees.\n  Opponents have repeatedly quoted just part of the NAFTA treaty to \nmake their case. But when you look at the entire treaty, at the \nspecific implementing language passed by our Congress--and I will again \nremind our colleagues I voted for that--and at the official arbitration \npanel's ruling, it is clear that our safety provisions are consistent \nwith NAFTA.\n  Those are the facts. But in spite of the facts, we hear the \nadministration's allies suggesting this is driven by special interests. \nLet's take a look at who those special interests are, suggesting the \nCongress fulfill its obligation to protect the health and welfare of \nour citizens.\n  Let me read to you who those special interests are who back the \nmajority of the Senate and the safety provisions in this bill: \nAdvocates for Highway and Auto Safety, Public Citizen, Parents Against \nTired Truckers, Consumer Federation of America, the Trauma Foundation, \nTriple A of Texas, American Insurance Association, the California \nTrucking Association, Citizens for Reliable and Safe Highways, \nCommercial Vehicle Safety Alliance, an independent drivers association \nin Mexico, Friends of the Earth, the Owners, Operators and Independent \nDrivers Association, the Sierra Club, and organized labor.\n\n[[Page S8514]]\n\n  Those are the special interests that believe our constituents should \nbe safe on our highways.\n  Finally, let me address the issue of implementation of NAFTA. To be \nsure, this is not a problem that the Bush administration created. It is \none that it inherited. The problem is how this administration has \nchosen to respond to the challenge.\n  As I have stated previously, this debate is not about how to keep \nMexican trucks out of the United States. This is about the conditions \nunder which we will let them enter. For all of the discussion of our \nobligations to our neighbors to the south, my first obligation is to \nthe people who elected me. We can comply with NAFTA, promote free \ntrade, and ensure the safety of our roadways simultaneously.\n  I believe Senator Shelby and I have crafted a provision that will \nhelp us achieve those goals.\n  The administration and its allies have taken considerable exception \nto this, and while I am working with them to seek ways to address their \nconcerns, I am unwilling to sacrifice my principles. With the provision \ncontained in our bill, when you are driving on the highway behind a \nMexican truck you can feel safe. You will know that the truck was \ninspected and the company has a good truck record.\n  You will know that American inspectors visited their facility and \nexamined their records.\n  You will know the driver is licensed and insured, and that the truck \nwas weighed and is safe for our roads and for our bridges.\n  You will know that they will keep track of which drivers are obeying \nlaws and which ones are not.\n  You will know that drivers who break our laws won't be on our roads \nbecause their licenses will be revoked.\n  You will know that the driver behind the wheel of an 18-wheeler has \nnot been driving for 20 or 30 straight hours.\n  You will know that the truck didn't just cross our border unchecked \nbut crossed where there were inspectors on duty.\n  That is real safety. We should get about the business of passage.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the delay and the insults and pass \nthis good, balanced bill that will help our country make progress on \nthe transportation challenges that are getting worse every day. This \nbill is balanced; it is bipartisan; and it is beneficial. Let's put it \nto work for the American people.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Boxer). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, our dear colleague from Washington says \nopponents of this provision--such as the New York Times, the Washington \nPost, the Chicago Tribune, the Cleveland Plain Dealer--are trying to \ncloud the issues. But supporters of her provision, such as the Deseret \nNews, see it in crystal-clear terms.\n  Let me begin by saying that our colleague from Washington asked: Who \ncan be opposed to truck safety? How could anyone be in favor of unsafe \ntrucks on American roads? The answer to that is very simple. No one is \nopposed to truck safety. No one wants unsafe trucks on our roads.\n  I will begin by asking that amendment No. 1053, which is the \nsubstitute that Senator McCain and I submitted, and which is supported \nby the administration, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the amendment was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 1053\n\n       On page 72, beginning with line 14, strike through line 24 \n     on page 78 and insert the following:\n       Sec. 343. Safety of Cross-Border Trucking Between United \n     States and Mexico.--No funds limited or appropriated by this \n     Act may be obligated or expended for the review or processing \n     of an application by a motor carrier for authority to operate \n     beyond United States municipalities and commercial zones on \n     the United States-Mexico border until--\n       (1) the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration--\n       (A)(i) requires a safety review of such motor carrier to be \n     performed before the carrier is granted conditional operating \n     authority to operate beyond United States municipalities and \n     commercial zones on the United States-Mexico border, and \n     before the carrier is granted permanent operating authority \n     to operate beyond United States municipalities and commercial \n     zones on the United States-Mexico border;\n       (ii) requires the safety review to include verification of \n     available performance data and safety management programs, \n     including drug and alcohol testing, drivers' qualifications, \n     drivers' hours-of-service records, records of periodic \n     vehicle inspections, insurance, and other information \n     necessary to determine the carrier's preparedness to comply \n     with Federal motor carrier safety rules and regulations; and\n       (iii) requires that every commercial vehicle operating \n     beyond United States municipalities and commercial zones on \n     the United States-Mexico border, that is operated by a motor \n     carrier authorized to operate beyond those municipalities and \n     zones, display a valid Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance \n     decal obtained as a result of a Level I North American \n     Standard Inspection, or a Level V Vehicle-Only Inspection, \n     whenever that vehicle is operating beyond such motor carrier \n     operating a vehicle in violation of this requirement to pay a \n     fine of up to $10,000 for each such violation;\n       (B) establishes a policy that any safety review of such a \n     motor carrier should be conducted on site at the motor \n     carrier's facilities where warranted by safety considerations \n     or the availability of safety performance data;\n       (C) requires Federal and State inspectors, in conjunction \n     with a Level I North American Standard Inspection, to verify, \n     electronically or otherwise, the license of each driver of \n     such a motor carrier's commercial vehicle crossing the \n     border, and institutes a policy for random electronic \n     verification of the license of drivers of such motor \n     carrier's commercial vehicles at United States-Mexico border \n     crossings;\n       (D) gives a distinctive Department of Transportation number \n     to each such motor carrier to assist inspectors in enforcing \n     motor carrier safety regulations, including hours-of-service \n     rules part 395 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations;\n       (E) requires State inspectors whose operations are funded \n     in part or in whole by Federal funds to check for violations \n     of Federal motor carrier safety laws and regulations, \n     including those pertaining to operating authority and \n     insurance;\n       (F) authorizes State inspectors who detect violations of \n     Federal motor carrier safety laws or regulations to enforce \n     such laws and regulations or to notify Federal authorities of \n     such violations;\n       (G)(i) determines that there is a means of determining the \n     weight of such motor carrier commercial vehicles at each \n     crossing of the United States-Mexico border at which there is \n     a sufficient number of such commercial vehicle crossings; and\n       (ii) initiates a study to determine which crossings should \n     also be equipped with weight-in-motion systems that would \n     enable State inspectors to verify the weight of each such \n     commercial vehicle entering the United States at such a \n     crossing;\n       (H) has implemented a policy to ensure that no such motor \n     carrier will be granted authority to operate beyond United \n     States municipalities and commercial zones on the United \n     States-Mexico border unless that carrier provides proof of \n     valid insurance with an insurance company licensed in the \n     United States;\n       (I) issues a policy--\n       (i) requiring motor carrier safety inspectors to be on duty \n     during all operating hours at all United States-Mexico border \n     crossings used by commercial vehicles;\n       (ii) with respect to standards for the determination of the \n     appropriate number of Federal and State motor carrier \n     inspectors for the United States-Mexico border (under \n     sections 218(a) and (b) of the Motor Carrier Safety \n     Improvement Act of 1999 (49 U.S.C. 31133 nt.)); and\n       (iii) with respect to prohibiting foreign motor carriers \n     from operating in the United States that are found to have \n     operated illegally in the United States (under section 219(a) \n     of that Act (49 U.S.C. 14901 nt.)); and\n       (J) completes its rulemaking--\n       (i) to establish minimum requirements for motor carriers, \n     including foreign motor carriers, to ensure they are \n     knowledgeable about Federal safety standards (under section \n     210(b) of the Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999 \n     (49 U.S.C. 31144 nt.)),\n       (ii) to implement measures to improve training and provide \n     for the certification of motor carrier safety auditors (under \n     section 31148 of title 49, United States Code), and\n       (iii) to prohibit foreign motor carriers from leasing \n     vehicles to another carrier to transport products to the \n     United States while the lessor is subject to a suspension, \n     restriction, or limitation on its right to operate in the \n     United States (under section 219(d), of that Act (49 U.S.C. \n     14901 nt.)),\n\n     or transmits to the Congress, within 30 days after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, a notice in writing that it will \n     not be able to complete any such rulemaking, that explains \n     why it will not be able to complete the rulemaking, and that \n     states the date by which it expects to complete the \n     rulemaking; and\n       (2) until the Department of Transportation Inspector \n     General certifies in writing to the Secretary of \n     Transportation and to the Senate Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation, the Senate Committee on \n     Appropriations, the House of Representatives Committee on \n     Transportation and Infrastructure, and the House of \n     Representatives Committee on Appropriations that the \n     Inspector General will report in writing to the Secretary and \n     to each such Committee--\n       (A) on the number of Federal motor carrier safety \n     inspectors hired, trained as safety specialists, and prepared \n     to be on duty during\n\n[[Page S8515]]\n\n     hours of operation at the United States-Mexico border by \n     January 1, 2002;\n       (B) periodically--\n       (i) on the adequacy of the number of Federal and State \n     inspectors at the United States-Mexico border; and\n       (ii) as to whether the Federal Motor Carrier Safety \n     Administration is ensuring compliance with hours-of-service \n     rules under part 395 of title 49, Code of Federal \n     Regulations, by such motor carriers;\n       (iii) as to whether United States and Mexican enforcement \n     databases are sufficiently integrated and accessible to \n     ensure that licenses, vehicle registrations, and insurance \n     information can be verified at border crossings or by mobile \n     enforcement units; and\n       (iv) as to whether there is adequate capacity at each \n     United States-Mexico border crossing used by motor carrier \n     commercial vehicles to conduct a sufficient number of vehicle \n     safety inspections and to accommodate vehicles placed out-of-\n     service as a result of the inspections.\n\n     In this section, the term ``motor carrier'' means a motor \n     carrier domiciled in Mexico that seeks authority to operate \n     beyond United States municipalities and commercial zones on \n     the United States-Mexico border.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I want people to see this amendment \nbecause the amendment requires that every Mexican truck be inspected. \nIt requires that the most stringent safety standards are met before \nMexican trucks come into America, but it does it in a way that complies \nwith NAFTA, a treaty obligation of the United States. It does it in a \nway that is common sense, to use the Senator's words, and that deals \nwith legitimate safety concerns.\n  Rather than going on all day, let me try to do the following thing, \nwhich I think represents about as fair a way of responding to the \nSenator from Washington as one can respond.\n  She sets the standard that it be common sense and that it meet \nlegitimate safety concerns. I wish to add to that that it not violate \ntreaty obligations of the United States.\n  I would like to take four provisions of the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Washington, and I would like to submit it to those tests.\n  I have to say that I am quite pleased that the major newspapers in \nAmerica have not been confused by this debate. In fact, the Chicago \nTribune probably put it best in their lead editorial entitled ``Honk if \nyou smell cheap politics.''\n\n       The truth is that Teamsters truckers don't want competition \n     from their Mexican counterparts.\n\n  I am pleased that people have not been confused. But in case anybody \nstill has any confusion about what we are talking about, I want to take \nfive provisions from the Murray amendment and submit them to her test \nof common sense, legitimate safety concerns, and do they violate NAFTA.\n  The first has to do with a provision of the Motor Carrier Safety \nImprovement Act of 1999. This is a bill that was adopted by Congress, \nthat has not been implemented fully by either the Clinton \nadministration or the Bush administration, and it has to do with \nsafety. These provisions apply to every truck operating on American \nhighways. They apply to United States trucks, to Canadian trucks, and \nto Mexican trucks.\n  The Senator from Washington says in her amendment that until this \n1999 law is fully implemented, even though it applies to American \ntrucks, American trucks can continue to operate; and even though this \nlaw applies to Canadian trucks, Canadian trucks can continue to \noperate; but until this law is fully implemented, until the regulations \nare written--and the administration says that these regulations cannot \nbe written and this bill cannot be fully implemented for at least 18 \nmonths--until that is the case, no Mexican truck would be allowed to \noperate in interstate commerce in the United States. And that provision \nwould be clearly in violation of NAFTA.\n  I ask a question: If it is common sense that we don't want trucks to \noperate until this law is implemented, why don't we say all trucks? In \nfact, if we said all trucks, we probably would not be able to eat lunch \nthis afternoon. But it would be common sense and it would not violate \nNAFTA.\n  The first provision of the Senator's amendment, in essence, says that \nsomething that cannot happen for 18 months has to be done before we are \ngoing to comply with a treaty related to Mexican trucks. That is as \narbitrary as saying that Mexican trucks can't come into the United \nStates until the 29th of February falls on a Tuesday. It is totally \narbitrary, and it is aimed at only one objective; that is, to treat \nMexican trucks differently than American trucks, differently than \nCanadian trucks, and in the process of violating NAFTA.\n  I think any objective person would say that requiring an action that \nhas nothing to do with Mexican trucks to be undertaken by the U.S. \nGovernment before we are going to live up to a solemn treaty obligation \nof the United States has no element of common sense in it, nor does it \nhave anything to do with legitimate safety. If it had anything to do \nwith legitimate safety, we would restrict all trucks until this law was \nimplemented.\n  Finally, the final test: Does it violate NAFTA?\n  Our requirement under NAFTA is very simple. It is one sentence. It is \nin the section on cross-border trade and services on page 1129. It \nsays:\n\n       Each party shall accord the service providers of another \n     party treatment no less favorable than that it accords in \n     like circumstances with its own service provider.\n\n  This is the point: We are saying to American truckers that you can \noperate every day, even though this 1999 law is not implemented. We say \na few Canadian trucks can operate today, even though this law is not \nimplemented, but Mexican truckers can never operate, even though in \nNAFTA we promised they could. They can never operate until this law is \nfully implemented and the regulations are written.\n  That is clearly not equal protection of the law; it is clearly not \nequal treatment; and it clearly violates NAFTA.\n  The second provision of the Murray amendment that doesn't make common \nsense, that has nothing to do with legitimate safety, and that violates \nNAFTA has to do with truck leasing.\n  Let me set it in context. Big trucking companies don't own trucks \nanymore. They lease them to each other. The last thing any trucking \ncompany can afford to do is have trucks that cost $250,000 sitting in \ntheir parking lot.\n  (Mrs. BOXER assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. GRAMM. So what happens is, when a trucking company loses business \nor is under some limitation, the first thing they do is get on the \nInternet, and they put their trucks out for lease. They lease them to \nother companies, and the trucks are used. You cannot stay in the \ntrucking business if you cannot lease your trucks.\n  The second provision of the Murray amendment says, if any Mexican \ntrucking company is under any suspension, restriction, or limitation, \nthey cannot lease their trucks.\n  There is not a major trucking company in America today that is not \nunder some restriction or some limitation. You cannot operate trucks in \nAmerica without having some restriction or limitation. It may be that \nyou thought your turn signal was working, and it was not when you were \ninspected, or your mud flap tore off, but there is not a major trucking \ncompany in America today that does not have some limitation.\n  What the Murray amendment says is it is OK if a Canadian company has \na limitation or has a suspension; they can lease their trucks to \nanother company to operate--after all, they would go broke if they \ncould not do it--and any American company that is under a restriction \nor a limitation can lease its trucks. But under the Murray amendment, a \nMexican company that is under a restriction or a limitation cannot \nlease its trucks.\n  Does that make common sense? No. Is that a legitimate safety issue? \nNo. Does that violate NAFTA? You bet your life it violates NAFTA \nbecause it treats Canadian companies and it treats American companies \ndifferent from Mexican companies.\n  Why, if your objective is safety, would you want to have a provision \nthat says that while Canadian companies can lease trucks and American \ncompanies can lease trucks--because they have to do it to stay in \nbusiness--Mexican companies cannot lease trucks? You do not put that in \nan amendment because you are concerned about safety; you put it in an \namendment as a poison pill to make it impossible for Mexican companies \nto operate in the United States. It is as arbitrary as saying: We can \ntake our safety exams in English, but Mexican truck\n\n[[Page S8516]]\n\ndrivers have to take their safety exams in Chinese. It is totally \npernicious and totally discriminatory against Mexico.\n  Now look, you can argue we should have or we should not have entered \ninto an agreement to allow a North American market to be opened to \ntrucks of the three countries that joined the agreement. But the point \nis, we did agree to it. It was signed by a Republican President. We \nratified it in Congress under a Democrat President. The final \nenforcement is occurring under a Republican President. We are committed \nto the obligations we entered into here.\n  No one can argue that not allowing Mexican companies to lease \ntrucks--when no major American company could operate without being able \nto lease trucks--is a legitimate safety concern. No one can argue that \nthat has anything to do with the application of common sense, nor can \nanybody argue that that does not violate NAFTA.\n  Now, today, almost every truck in Canada is insured by a company that \nis domiciled outside the United States. Most of them are insured by \nLloyds of London. Some are insured by Canadian companies. Some are \ninsured by European companies. The plain truth is, it is almost \nimpossible in the world in which we live to know where an insurance \ncompany is domiciled because insurance companies are now doing business \nall over the world. So it is very difficult to know what \n``nationality'' they are.\n\n  American trucking companies are not required to buy insurance from \nAmerican companies. In fact, some of them have insurance with Dutch \ncompanies, with British companies and with Canadian companies. That is \nthe way we operate. And that is common sense. That meets legitimate \nsafety concerns. And that does not violate NAFTA. But whereas we let \nCanadian trucking companies buy insurance that is not sold by American-\ndomiciled companies, and whereas we let American trucking companies buy \ninsurance that is not sold by American-domiciled companies, the Murray \namendment requires that Mexican trucks purchase insurance from \ncompanies domiciled in the United States. That violates common sense. \nIt is not a legitimate safety issue, and it clearly violates NAFTA.\n  No. 4, as I mentioned earlier, almost any trucking company, at any \none time, would have numerous violations--some small, some large, but \nit would have numerous violations--and you have a gradation of \npenalties for those violations. The same is true with regard to \nCanadian companies. But under the Murray amendment, if you are a \nMexican company--we say in NAFTA that you are going to be treated \nexactly as an American company, exactly as a Canadian company; no \nbetter, no worse--but under the Murray amendment, if you have a \nviolation, you are barred from operating in the United States of \nAmerica. You have a penalty, and it is the death penalty.\n  Does that make common sense? Is that a legitimate safety concern? Is \nthat a violation of NAFTA? The answer is, no, no, yes. It does not make \ncommon sense; it is not a legitimate safety concern; and it does \nviolate NAFTA.\n  Let me just take a simple provision. If you needed living proof that \nthis debate has nothing to do with safety, let me pose the following \nquestion: If you really wanted safe Mexican trucks--and I remind my \ncolleagues that with the support of the administration, Senator McCain \nand I offered an amendment that required the inspection of every single \nMexican truck coming into the United States, something we do not do \nwith regard to Canadian trucks, something we do not do with regard to \nour own trucks, but if you were really concerned about safety, and you \nwere going to implement NAFTA and allow Mexican trucks in interstate \ncommerce, would you want to take your best, most experienced inspectors \nand put them where they are going to be inspecting Mexican trucks? I \nwould. And I think that is a reasonable question.\n  If your concern is safety and not protectionism, if your concern is \nlegitimate safety and not a back door way of violating NAFTA, if your \nconcern is about safe trucks, not about keeping Mexican trucks out of \nthe United States, wouldn't you want to have your most experienced \ninspectors inspecting Mexican trucks --and we require inspecting every \none of them--because you want your best people inspecting new trucks \nthat are coming into the country for the first time? Doesn't that make \nsense?\n  Would it make any sense, if your objective was safety, to have a \nprovision that current inspectors who have training and experience \ncould not be moved to inspect Mexican trucks? Could anyone who had any \nconcern about safety of Mexican trucks support a provision that said \nyou could not take inspectors who are trained and experienced and move \nthem to the Mexican border to inspect existing trucks?\n  You have to start from scratch. You have to hire new people, you have \nto train them, and you have to get them experienced. Remember, months, \nyears are ticking off the clock.\n  Could anybody have any reason to believe that a provision that said \nexperienced inspectors could not be moved so they would be inspecting \nnew Mexican trucks coming into the United States--if your concern was \nabout safety, that would be the last provision you would ever put in \nyour bill. If you were concerned about safety, you would never ever \nsupport a provision that said you have to inspect Mexican trucks, but \nyou cannot take people who are trained and experienced--who are now \ninspecting trucks --and move them so that they can inspect Mexican \ntrucks. That would be the last thing on Earth you would ever do. But \nthe Murray amendment does it.\n  Remarkably enough, the Murray amendment says that they are so eager \nto inspect these Mexican trucks, that they are so concerned about their \nsafety, that not one inspector who is currently inspecting trucks in \nAmerica, not one inspector who currently has both training and \nexperience, can be moved to meet this new need of inspection.\n  Why on Earth would anybody who is concerned about safety ever have \nsuch a provision? The only reason that any such provision would ever be \nwritten into an amendment is if the objective was not safe Mexican \ntrucks but the objective was no Mexican trucks.\n  The Murray amendment literally says: Anybody who is currently \ninspecting trucks, anybody currently licensed to inspect trucks, \nanybody currently trained to inspect trucks cannot be moved so that \nthey inspect Mexican trucks. They have to be recruited, trained, and \nthen they have to get practical experience.\n  The net result of that is not safe Mexican trucks; quite the \ncontrary. To the extent they came into the country, it would mean \nunsafe trucks. But the objective, the only logical, commonsense reason \nthat such a provision would ever be in a bill is if you want to \nprohibit Mexican trucks.\n  Our colleagues can say over and over and over and over again that \nthis is about safety. The problem is, the administration, Senator \nMcCain, and I support inspecting every Mexican truck, something we do \nnot do with Canadian trucks, something we do not do with American \ntrucks. We support employing exactly the same standards in requiring \nthem to meet every standard we have to meet, and we support a more \nstringent inspection regime until they prove they are meeting those \nstandards.\n  What we do not support, what we cannot support or accept, and what we \nwill continue to oppose through three more clotures and ultimately a \nPresidential veto, is discrimination against Mexico. We will not \nsupport and we will not accept provisions that go back on our \ncommitment in NAFTA.\n  The greatest country in the history of the world does not violate \ncommitments it makes in treaties. I repeat: While I know it is easier \nto cover this story by saying this is about various levels of safety \nstandards, the things that the administration objects to and the \nMexican Government objects to and Senator McCain objects to and I \nobject to have nothing to do with safety. They have to do with \nprovisions that are written for one and only one purpose; that is, to \nprevent Mexican trucks from coming into the United States and, in the \nprocess, violating NAFTA.\n  I have outlined--there are others I could go through--five \nirrefutable examples where we say: Until some regulation is promulgated \nthat applies to all trucks, not just Mexican trucks, that Mexican \ntrucks shall not come into the country.\n  I have talked about not letting Mexican trucking companies lease \ntheir\n\n[[Page S8517]]\n\ntrucks when we let American and Canadian companies lease their trucks. \nThe only reason you would not do it is if you want to make it so people \ncannot be in the trucking business. I have talked about buying \ninsurance. We don't make our own companies buy American insurance. We \nmake them buy insurance that is licensed, that meets our standards, but \nthey can buy Dutch insurance, British insurance, Canadian insurance, \nJapanese insurance. What this provision would do is treat Mexico \ndifferently than everybody else.\n  This is not about safety. This is about discrimination. This is about \ntreating Mexico, an equal partner in NAFTA, as a second-class citizen. \nThis is about sham safety provisions that basically have the result of \npreventing Mexican trucks from operating in the United States and \nviolating NAFTA.\n  Let me conclude by making the following point: It is an incredible \nparadox. A lot of talk has been made about Mexican trucks. Today \nMexican trucks bring goods to the border, come across the border, go to \na warehouse, and unload and go back. The Mexican trucks that are \noperating in the 20-mile radius of the border are basically hauling \nwatermelons and cabbages and vegetables. You are dealing with old \ntrucks. People do not haul cabbages across the border in 18-wheelers.\n  The figures being used about safety inspections, even though Mexican \ntrucks are being inspected twice as much as Canadian trucks today--and \nby the way, the drivers in the inspections are being rated better than \nAmerican drivers; many of them are college graduates--people are using \ntrucks that are hauling cabbages as an example of the kind of trucks \nthat are going to be operating in interstate commerce.\n  The plain truth is that Mexican trucking companies are going to lease \ntrucks from the same leasing companies that lease trucks to American \ntrucking companies, and they are going to buy new trucks to lease. The \ndebate is not about safety. The debate is about protectionism. The \ndebate is about a well-organized special interest group, the Teamsters \nunion, which has worked very hard to try to prevent the United States \nfrom living up to NAFTA. They are not going to win.\n  First of all, we have three more clotures, and we intend to use every \nright we have because this is an important issue. I have to say, I am \nsurprised that so many of the major newspapers in America--the New York \nTimes, the Washington Post, the Chicago Tribune, the Cleveland Plain \nDealer--despite all of this fog of rhetoric, ``safety, safety, safety, \nsafety,'' when the provisions in dispute have nothing to do with \nsafety, I am pleased that they have seen through the fog.\n  The reason the Founding Fathers structured the Senate as they did was \nthat they were not counting on the New York Times or the Washington \nPost seeing through the fog. They recognized that there were going to \nbe issues where you were going to have well-organized special interest \ngroups standing outside that door. They were going to be lobbying. They \nwere going to be pushing, and it was going to be possible to take raw, \nrotten special interests--in this case, special interests that would \nhave us violate a solemn treaty agreement of the United States--and \nmake us hypocrites all over the world when we call on our trading \npartners to live up to their agreements, when we are violating our \nagreement with our neighbor to the south.\n\n  The Founding Fathers recognized that people would get confused, that \nissues would get clouded. And so when they structured the Senate, they \ngave a few Senators--one Senator, any Senator--rights to defend their \nposition. Senator McCain and I have used those rights. We are going to \ncontinue to use them. There are three more clotures before this bill \nwill ever go to conference. The bill, if it does get to conference, \nwill be fixed, or the President will veto it, and we will start the \nwhole process over.\n  In the end, when we are dealing with something as important as NAFTA, \nwhen we are dealing with something as important as America living up to \nits treaty obligations, if that is not worth fighting for, the job of a \nSenator is not worth having.\n  I am pleased that the major papers in America are not confused. I am \npleased that it is clear to them that people should know that this is \nabout special interests. This does violate NAFTA. I have given five \nclear examples, beyond any reasonable doubt, where no person could \nargue that the provisions of the Murray amendment have any objective at \nall other than preventing Mexican trucks from coming into the country.\n  The one that I spent the most time on is the one that has to do with \nsimply the question of whether you want inspectors to inspect Mexican \ntrucks. The Murray amendment says no. Any inspector currently \ninspecting trucks in America can't go inspect Mexican trucks. You have \nto hire new people. You have to train them. You have to let them get \nexperience.\n  That provision is not about safety. That provision is about raw, \nrotten protectionism. Happily people are recognizing it for what it is.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I think it is very important that we \ngo back and look at what has happened on the issue of Mexican trucks, \nNAFTA, and the safety of American highways.\n  When NAFTA was passed, it was explicit in permitting the Federal \nGovernment and individual States to establish and enforce their own \nrequirements for truck safety. It also said that there should be a \nsingle standard in every jurisdiction. So the standard should apply to \ntrucks from the United States, Mexico, and Canada.\n  However, what I think has been missed in this debate is the ruling of \nthe international tribunal in February which, it has been pointed out, \ndid find the United States in violation because we actually had halted \nthe truck safety rules in 1995 in this country, and so the United \nStates had failed to meet the deadline.\n  But the other part of this Mexican tribunal ruling was that the \nUnited States does not have to treat applications from Mexican-based \ncarriers in exactly the same manner as United States or Canadian firms. \nIn fact, there are some differences in the treatment of Canadian firms \nbecause of different operating authorities in that sovereign country.\n  The panel also said that the United States is not required to grant \noperating authority to any specific number of Mexican applicants. I \nwent back and looked at the makeup of the NAFTA tribunal because I \nthought it would be important to know. The tribunal was two Mexican \ncitizens, two United States citizens, and the chairman was from \nBritain. The vote was unanimous because it was noted that there could \nbe different rules for certain countries because of the significant \ndifferences in the country's safety regimes. So this was not a 3-2 \nvote, where the Mexican nationals voted differently from the United \nStates and British nationals. It was a unanimous vote that acknowledged \nthere would be differences that could be addressed.\n  The Bush administration, to its credit, is playing catchup because we \nhave had 5 years of delays from the previous administration. Their \nproposed rule that came out of the Department of Transportation was a \nstart, but it was not adequate to provide clear United States safety \nunder any kind of term that would be considered acceptable.\n  The original Department of Transportation rule would require that, \nfor the first 18 months of operation, Mexican carriers would be \nrequired to comply with documentary production, insurance requirements, \nand undefined safety inspections. The rule was vague and insufficient. \nThat is why I sat down with officials from the Department of \nTransportation and I said: These rules are inadequate. We cannot allow \ntrucks to come into our country that haven't either been certified or \ninspected, and the certification would only come from inspection. That \nwould not be prudent. It would not be responsible.\n  The Department of Transportation authority agreed. We have been \nworking all along--Senator Murray, Senator Shelby, Senator Gramm, and \nSenator McCain, along with myself--with the Department of \nTransportation to beef up those rules. I think it is fair to say that \nthe Murray-Shelby language has part of the requirement for beefing up \nthose rules, and Senators McCain and Gramm have suggested, in the form\n\n[[Page S8518]]\n\nof drafts, other requirements. In fact, I have offered \nother requirements that are not in either bill, which I think are very \nimportant.\n\n  Yes, I think we can change some of the parts in this underlying bill. \nI think the discussion that has been going on for almost 2 weeks on \nthis floor is really a process discussion, not a substantive one. I say \nthat because I think we are very close to agreeing to the parts of the \nunderlying bill that should remain, the parts that should change; and I \nthink all of us are in agreement that the House version is unacceptable \nbecause the House version does what has caused us to get in trouble \nunder the NAFTA agreement, and that is shut down the regulations and \nact as if we are just not going to comply. That is not responsible. The \nHouse position is not tenable.\n  On the other hand, I think we are very close to significant changes \nin the original Department of Transportation regulation because they \nwere totally inadequate and they now have stepped up to the plate and \nagreed, working with Senator Murray, myself, and with Senators Gramm \nand McCain, to come up with good safety regulations.\n  The bottom line for all of us is that we must have inspections of \nevery truck. When we talk about whether we go into Mexico to the site \nof the trucking company to make the inspection, I think we should do \nthat if we have the permission to do it. And it will be in the interest \nof the trucking company in Mexico to allow the inspectors in, because \nif you get the certification stamp on your truck as a result of being \ninspected onsite, then your truck will not be stopped at the border. It \nwill have been inspected and certified, and you will be able to operate \nit under the same rules as a U.S. truck operates. And if the Mexicans \nagree that it is in their best interest--and I think they will--then \nthat is going to alleviate a lot of problems, and it is going to ensure \nthe inspections that will ensure the safety.\n  Secondly, the Murray language in the underlying bill does something \nvery important to implement this regulation, which the House failed to \ndo, and that is, it has the $103 million that has been requested by the \nPresident to finance the infrastructure to hire and train the \ninspectors at the border and to provide aid to States to inspect trucks \nalong the United States-Mexico border.\n  Now, I cannot imagine anything worse than saying we are going to have \nall these regulations, but we are not going to have any inspectors. One \nof the reasons so many of my border constituents are concerned about \nthe Mexican truck issue is because we have had Mexican trucks within a \n20-mile limit through the border, and they have not all been inspected; \nthey have not all met the requirements that would make people on our \nhighways feel safe. In fact, I will quote from the AAA Texas Chapter \npress release in which it says:\n\n       The U.S. Department of Transportation reports that more \n     than 35 percent of trucks from Mexico, under this 20-mile \n     rule, were taken out of service for safety violations in \n     2000. That compares to 24 percent for U.S. trucks and 17 \n     percent for trucks from Canada.\n  It is very important we look at the people who are living with this \nproblem the most right now. We have had a lot of editorials read into \nthe Record, and I will read two editorials from Texas newspapers, one \nfrom the El Paso Times. The heading is: ``It Is About Safety. No ifs, \nands or trucks--unless they pass the test.''\n\n       Just as the U.S. Senate was voting in favor of tough safety \n     standards for Mexican trucks crossing into the United States, \n     a new truck-inspection site sprang up at Delta Drive and \n     Hammond Street, near the Bridge of the Americas.\n       It was a welcome surprise, given the extreme level of \n     concern about the safety of Mexican trucks coming into the \n     country and driving through El Paso.\n       The new inspection station near the Americas Bridge should \n     furnish a clearer picture of how bad the safety problems with \n     Mexican trucks are or are not. Between January and June, \n     inspectors at international bridges placed 132 American \n     trucks out of service, and 944 Mexican trucks. This indicates \n     a severe problem exists.\n\n  So it is very important.\n  I ask unanimous consent the editorial from the El Paso Times be made \na part of the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the El Paso Times, July 29, 2001]\n\n   It's About Safety--No Ifs, Ands or Trucks--Unless They Pass Tests\n\n       Just as the U.S. Senate was voting in favor of tough safety \n     standards for Mexican trucks crossing into the United States, \n     a new truck-inspection site sprang up at Delta Drive and \n     Hammett Street, near the Bridge of the Americas.\n       It was a welcome surprise, given the extreme level of \n     concern about the safety of Mexican trucks coming into the \n     country and driving through El Paso.\n       State Rep. Joe Pickett, D-El Paso, said the information \n     gleaned from the inspections would be forwarded to President \n     Bush to let him know ``what kind of trucks are coming \n     through.''\n       Bush is currently engaged in a bitter fight with Congress \n     over how tough safety standards should be for Mexican trucks \n     entering this country. Bush has threatened to veto the \n     tougher rules the Senate is advocating.\n       The new inspection station near the Americas Bridge should \n     furnish a clearer picture of how bad the safety problems with \n     Mexican trucks are or aren't. Between January and June, \n     inspectors at international bridges placed 132 American \n     trucks out of service--and 944 Mexican trucks. That indicates \n     a severe problem exists.\n       Pickett said the state isn't planning to make the new \n     inspection station a permanent fixture. But during its \n     lifespan, it should be able to furnish much pertinent \n     information to the discussion over truck safety.\n       Meanwhile, the president and Congress have to meet at some \n     middle ground concerning Mexican trucks. The North American \n     Free Trade Agreement mandates allowing Mexican trucks access \n     to all parts of the United States.\n       That, of course, should be honored.\n       But both Congress and the president must also look out for \n     the safety of American highways and American motorists.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I will also read from the Austin \nAmerican Statesman of July 31, 2001; the headline, ``No Matter Their \nOrigin, Trucks Must Be Safe.''\n\n       For Central Texans, the fight over Mexican trucks on \n     America's roads and highways is more than just an inside-the-\n     beltway partisan political battle. Austin is ground zero for \n     trucks coming across the border and up Interstate 35. I-35 \n     from San Antonio to Dallas is already one of the most \n     dangerous stretches of interstate in the Nation. Adding \n     thousands of unsafe trucks to the mix increases the threat to \n     accidents, injuries and fatalities. What is spirited debate \n     and hardball politics in Washington is deadly reality in \n     Austin. In fact, both sides may be right. A NAFTA panel said \n     as much earlier this year when it found the United States in \n     violation of the treaty for restricting Mexican trucks but \n     then added, the safety of trucks crossing the border is a \n     legitimate issue and an important responsibility of the \n     Federal Government.\n\n  That is the tribunal that was unanimously speaking with two Mexican \nmembers, two United States members, and a British chairman.\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Congress should not abrogate NAFTA for purely political \n     purposes and force Mexican trucks to meet stiffer standards \n     than the American-Canadian fleets. If the Mexican trucks do \n     not meet the standards, however, pull them off the road. It \n     should, as President Bush suggests, step up inspections and \n     increase enforcement of the safety standards already in \n     place.\n\n  That is exactly what the bill before us today does. It beefs up \ninspections.\n  This is common sense. Of course we must beef up inspections. The \nMurray language does that. Of course we must pay for it. The Murray \nlanguage makes it a priority.\n  After the House passed the amendment that would shut down the \ninspections at the border and take the money away, I went to Senator \nMurray and said, this is not responsible governing. She agreed, and she \nhas worked with a lot of different interests to try to forge what is \nright. Maybe it is not perfect. I do not agree with every single part \nof it. I think Senator Gramm and Senator McCain have made a few good \npoints, but I do not think holding up the bill and keeping progress \nfrom going forward is the right approach. They certainly have the right \nto do that, as any Member of the Senate does, but I do not think we are \ngoing to get to the goal they want by holding up the bill.\n  We have a workable bill before us. We can make some changes, and I \nthink Senator Murray will work with us to make those changes.\n  The Department of Inspection and President Bush have made very solid \nsuggestions on what we need to uphold NAFTA and to uphold the integrity \nof safety on the U.S. highway system.\n  I hope the games will end. I hope we can go forward with a very good \nstart on this problem so we will be able to immediately begin the \nprocess of putting those border inspection stations in\n\n[[Page S8519]]\n\nplace, because without the inspections, none of this is going to make \nsense. I assure my colleagues, we will not have safety if we do not \nhave the capacity to inspect, and that is the most important goal we \nshould all have.\n  I agree with the Austin American Statesman and the El Paso Times. \nThese are two cities. Austin is our State capital. El Paso is the \nlargest Texas border city with Mexico. The largest Mexican city on the \nentire border is Juarez. We know safety is important for every person \nwho is on our highways: Americans, Hispanic Americans, Black Americans, \nAsian Americans, and foreign people traveling on our highways. We have \na reputation for safety. We must uphold that reputation for the sake of \nour families and our children.\n\n  I do not want unsafe American trucks. I do not want unsafe American \ncars. That is why we have inspection requirements because people \ntraveling on our highways feel safe, and we must assure they stay that \nway.\n  We are close to a compromise. I do not really think we are talking \nsubstance anymore. We are talking process. We have a solution the \nDepartment of Transportation, the President of the United States, and \nevery Member of the Senate is going to agree is the right solution. The \nreal donnybrook is whether we put it on the bill now or we hammer it \nout in conference with all sides at the table. We can do it in \nconference with all sides at the table.\n  Reasonable minds can disagree on this. I certainly think every \nSenator has the right to hold up progress, but inevitably we are going \nto sit down at the table in conference and work this out. I hope that \ndoes not mean September because we will have lost a month of setting up \nthose inspection stations and starting the process of getting our house \nin order to have inspections of every truck coming into our country, \nfrom Canada or Mexico.\n  If we wait until September, because of the process initiatives that \nhave been going on for over a week on this bill, we are not serving the \nbest interests of our constituents and the people who depend on us to \nmake the right decisions. I hope we will listen to the tribunal that \nspoke out and said we have the sovereign ability to keep our roads \nsafe. We can come to an agreement that will do that and comply with our \nresponsibilities under trade agreements as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on a \nsubject unrelated to the topic that is now before us, and that my \ncomments follow those of the Senator from Mississippi this morning, Mr. \nCochran, who spoke on missile defense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, could I ask the Senator for \nhow long he wishes to speak?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I request 20 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. That will be fine. I ask unanimous consent I be recognized \nat the expiration of those remarks.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not, of \ncourse, object to the request to speak, my understanding is we are on \nthe Department of Transportation appropriations bill. I came over \nintending to speak on that matter, on the amendment that has been \ndiscussed most recently.\n  The Senator from Nevada wishes to be recognized following the Senator \nfrom Colorado; is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the understanding of the Chair.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I shall not object. I did want to indicate I wanted to \nspeak on this bill, on the amendment, but I will certainly defer to the \nmorning business request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Allard are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business''.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I heard this morning the Senator from \nWashington, the manager of this bill, talk about why this legislation \nis important. Earlier this morning, I talked about why this legislation \nis important to people of the State of Nevada. I heard her this morning \nread into the Record the names of organizations that support this \nlegislation, and a few minutes later I walked over to my office.\n  As I walked to my office, one of my friends said: I would like you to \nmeet someone. As I proceeded over to see the person that I was asked to \nmeet, I was introduced to a woman from the State of Maine. I cannot \nremember her name. I was introduced to her outside this Chamber. She \nwas here representing Parents Against Tired Truckers. It doesn't sound \nlike much, does it?\n  This woman lost a son. In 1993, her son was killed by a truckdriver \nwho had been on the road too long. That is what this legislation is all \nabout, making sure our roads are safer. I acknowledge that there are \nthings we could do with American truckdrivers that would create safer \nways for me and my family to travel on these roads. But we do not need \nto get into that today.\n  What we need to get into today is recognizing what Senators Murray \nand Shelby have done, which is to write legislation to make our roads \nsafer so that we do not have this organization gaining more parents who \nhave lost children as a result of tired truckers.\n  I told the woman whose son was killed in 1993: I appreciate you being \ninvolved for so long.\n  She said: I am never going to give up.\n  That is how I look at the Senator from Washington: She is never going \nto give up. She believes strongly that what she and Senator Shelby have \ncrafted is fair. Keep in mind, it is not as if the Senator from \nWashington is working in a vacuum.\n  What the House of Representatives did, by a 2-1 vote, is outlaw \nMexican trucks coming into the United States. So it seems to me this \napproach is reasonable; it does not outlaw all Mexican trucks coming \ninto the United States, but to say we want Mexican trucks coming into \nthe United States to have certain basic safety features. And we want to \ncheck to see if they are adhering to those safety features. That is \nwhat her legislation does.\n  So I personally am very happy with this legislation. It is no wonder \nthat we have people lobbying the Senate. When you hear about lobbyists, \nthe first thing you think of are people wearing Gucci shoes and driving \nin limousines. The woman from Maine did not have a limousine, and she \nwas not wearing Gucci shoes. She paid her own way here to advocate for \nsafer highways. This legislation is important to her.\n  That is why we have all kinds of organizations--too lengthy to put in \nthe Record; some of these names have already been put in the Record--\nthat are advocates for highway and auto safety.\n  Public Citizen is a public interest organization that is involved in \nmany things dealing with consumer safety. They are concerned about this \nlegislation. They favor the Murray proposal.\n  Consumer Federation of America: Of course, we know what the Consumer \nFederation of America is. It is an organization that supports consumers \ngetting a fair break in America. That is what the legislation is from \nthe Senator from Washington. It is just to make sure that the traveling \npublic will be on highways and roads where the trucks coming from other \ncountries have certain minimal safety features. That is how I look at \nit. Others may look at it differently.\n  The Trauma Foundation: Why would the Trauma Foundation be interested \nin legislation such as this? The Trauma Foundation is interested in \nlegislation such as this because people get hurt on these roads--people \nget maimed, injured, and killed. That is why the Trauma Foundation of \nAmerica supports this legislation.\n\n  I think one of the most interesting aspects of this legislation is \nthat the Texas Automobile Association of America supports this \nlegislation. I think that is pretty good. In fact, the Texas AAA issued \na press release, going line by line over the legislation of the Senator \nfrom Washington, supporting her legislation.\n  On-site safety audits at the company facilities prior to authorizing \ntheir trucks to cross the border: This isn't\n\n[[Page S8520]]\n\nwhat Senator Murray is saying; this is what the Texas Automobile \nAssociation of America is saying.\n  They also say there should be significant improvements in safety \ninspections at the border, including enforcement of U.S. weight limits. \nThey also said there should be adequate resources for enforcement \nthroughout the United States. They believe there should be verifiable \ninsurance on each vehicle. It does not seem too bizarre to me that this \nlegislation calls for trucks coming into the United States to have \nadequate and verifiable insurance information on each vehicle.\n  There should be shared tracking of the company's truck and driver \nsafety records between the United States and Mexican authorities. The \nTexas AAA says there should be enforcement of safety laws, including \nlimiting the number of continuous hours spent driving. That also does \nnot seem too outrageous to me, that if we are going to have these huge \ntrucks with over 100,000 pounds of material on them, we are asking that \nthe drivers have a limited amount of hours driving these trucks. I \nthink that is something that is extremely important.\n  So they end their press release by saying: The safety of the motoring \npublic should not be risked in the rush to meet an apparently arbitrary \ndeadline. They believe that it is extremely important. So I think it \nkind of says it all, if we have the Texas AAA asking that we uphold \nthis legislation. It is reasonable legislation.\n  Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the pending \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I would be delighted to yield.\n  Madam President, I want to say a word about the Mexican truck \namendment, the Murray-Shelby amendment, particularly to commend both \nSenator Murray and Senator Shelby on their diligence. The Senator from \nWashington has been persistent and has been ultimately fair.\n  What happens is--since we have been criticized about even putting \nthis on an appropriations bill--many times the cart gets before the \nhorse. And what happened on this occasion was that the President of the \nUnited States announced summarily that come January 1 we were going to \nadmit the Mexican trucks, ipso facto--bam, that was it.\n  I go back immediately to the debate that we had about NAFTA, where it \nhad been suggested that we use the common market approach rather than \nthe free market approach. The Europeans learned long since that the \nfree market approach did not work. On the contrary, they said: What we \nneed to do is to develop the infrastructure of a free market; namely, \nproperty ownership, labor rights, respect for the judiciary, the \ninfrastructure, if you please, for safety and for health care.\n  The Europeans thereafter taxed themselves some $5.7 billion over a 5-\nyear period, setting those elements of infrastructure up within Greece \nand Portugal before they admitted Greece and Portugal into the common \nmarket.\n  We see the result of not having done that. Here we are faced with the \nannouncement by the President and, thereupon, the action by the House \nin their appropriations bill. So while we had, in the authorizing \ncommittee, scheduled a hearing with respect to the Mexican trucking \nproblem, we had to act in the Appropriations Committee in order to make \nit deliberate and sound and fair.\n  The action on the House side was not that deliberate, sound, or fair. \nOn the outside they just said: Look, we cut off any and all funds for \nthe admission of Mexican trucking into the United States come January \n1--or during the fiscal year 2002.\n  I would agree with the President, that would be a nonstarter. So what \nwe did then, working with Senator Murray and Senator Shelby at the \nauthorizing level, is we continued, we had the hearing, and we \naddressed elements included in the Murray-Shelby amendment providing \njust those things that are required by U.S. truckers.\n  I was particularly sensitive to that. There was no one who opposed \nNAFTA any more strongly than this particular Senator. Yet now we have \nit. It is not going to be repealed. It should be made to work.\n\n  Very interestingly, since my colleague from Texas is on the floor, \nwhat happened was, it didn't work, NAFTA didn't work. Drugs got worse. \nImmigration got worse. The take-home pay of Mexicans got worse. We were \nsupposed to get 200,000 jobs. We lost 500,000 jobs. Instead of a $5 \nbillion-plus balance of trade, we have a $25 billion deficit in the \nbalance of trade with Mexico.\n  There was one good message that went to the American people. For the \nfirst time in some 82 years, they kicked out the PRI. And who is in as \nthe Foreign Minister? Jorge Castaneda, one of the biggest opponents of \nNAFTA. Who is in as security chief down in Mexico? Mr. Adolfo Aguilar \nZinser. I worked with these gentlemen. They were trying to build up \nMexico's infrastructure.\n  Yesterday, I met with Mexico's Minister of the Economy, Luis Ernesto \nDerbez. I said: Mr. Minister, point out to me whereby there is any one \nof these provisions here in Murray-Shelby that is not required of the \nAmerican truckers. He couldn't point out a one. I said: I know you \nhaven't had a chance to study it because the White House and others \nhave been calling around, jumping on them down in Mexico, saying: Get \non up here. We have an anti-Mexican thing going on here. They are \njumping all around, and they don't know what they are talking about.\n  I said: Write me a letter and point out whereby we don't require of \nour American truckers what we are requiring in Murray-Shelby. Of \ncourse, they can't do it.\n  So this idea of ``negotiate, negotiate,'' and ``they bypassed us,'' \nand all that, that is out of whole cloth. We had an authorizing \nhearing. We had the witnesses appear. This isn't pro-Mexican; it isn't \nanti-Mexican. Trade is a two-way street. If we require it of the \nMexicans, that which we are requiring of our own truckers, they \nimmediately will counter and require it of our American truckers. When \nyou do not have the infrastructure, that is when the damage is done; so \nwe put in Murray-Shelby that on-site safety inspections take place.\n  The Secretary of Transportation, my good friend, said: Are we going \nin to inspect them? The Mexican inspectors come up to Senator Murray's \nhome State of Washington to check the apples, and, yes, we are going in \nto check those stations, like the Canadians check ours and we check \ntheirs. Why? Because once we know the work there at that safety station \nis sound and thorough and reliable, then they can come to the border \nwith a sheet of paper and we will pass them right on through. We can't \njust have passthroughs and a sheet of paper giving you nothing.\n  This thing has gotten wholly out of kilter. I think it was really \ndone to slow down the process, because we were doing too well over \nhere. We passed the Patients' Bill of Rights, and we have been passing \nother things around here. We are going to pass some appropriations \nbills.\n  Our opponents say we haven't negotiated. Baloney. I've been \nnegotiating and I remain ready to negotiate.\n  Put up your amendment, and we will vote. Let's get on with this \nparticular measure. Get it over to the conference. Pass this one and \nmove forward. But don't put this in the context of anti-Mexican or \nunfair or in violation of NAFTA.\n  I went immediately to the arbitration panel, and Minister Derbez \nyesterday agreed. He said: No, we understand safety is required on both \nsides of the border. It is part of NAFTA. It is not in violation of \nNAFTA. So we know we hadn't violated NAFTA and violated our treaty. I \ndon't know why all this sanctimony about violating treaties around \nhere. That is all we have ever had, violations of these trade treaties. \nI had the book this morning put out by the special trade \nrepresentative--it is an inch and a half thick--of all the violations, \n68 pages by the Japanese. Come on. We can't get into Japan 50 years \nlater. So we really have to honor our treaty and all that? Come on.\n\n[[Page S8521]]\n\n  I have heard enough of it now. The Senator from Alabama, Mr. Shelby, \nand Senator Murray have gone about this in a purely bipartisan manner. \nThere is no partisan or anti-Mexican feature to this whatsoever. It is \na political slowdown. They know it.\n  Let's get on with the slowdown and let's go on home as we are \nsupposed to in the month of August. The month of August has arrived. I \nsee the distinguished minority leader is here. He likes to go home at 7 \no'clock. I like to go home in August.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, in the interest of time, might I inquire \nof the Senator from North Dakota, was he seeking time to speak further \non the issue?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I came to speak on the amendment in the \nbill. I agreed to a unanimous consent request to allow a Member on the \nminority leader's side to do 20 minutes of morning business on this \nsubject. I have waited to have an opportunity to speak for about 8 to \n10 minutes on the issue of Mexican trucks.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, of course we try to accommodate each other \non both sides of the aisle. We try to go back and forth in those \nspeeches. I was not aware of that earlier agreement. I am perfectly \nwilling to allow the Senator to go forward at this point. Then I will \nspeak next in line.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Mississippi, the minority leader, is \nmost generous. There was not an agreement. When the Senator from \nColorado sought 20 minutes in morning business, I was here waiting to \nspeak on the bill. He certainly was entitled to speak in morning \nbusiness. I thank the Senator for his generosity.\n  I rise to address the issue of Mexican trucks. My friend, the Senator \nfrom Arizona, has spoken about it today. My friend, the Senator from \nTexas, has spoken.\n  After all the debate, it is important for everyone to understand, \nthere is nothing here about punishment or being punitive to the country \nof Mexico. That is not what this is about. Some of my colleagues have \nsaid we are being discriminatory. That is not true.\n  The truth is, this issue is about highway safety. Senator Murray from \nthe State of Washington has put a provision in the appropriations bill \nthat is not only appropriate but needs to be kept in this bill in order \nto assure safety on America's highways. Frankly, I wish she had chosen \nto use the House language which was presented by Congressman Sabo. It \nis stronger language. It would prohibit, during this coming fiscal \nyear, the use of funds in this legislation to certify Mexican trucks \ndesiring to go beyond the 20-mile limit.\n  I wish Senator Murray had included that. She did not. She chose to \ntake a different approach. She has taken an approach that also will \nprovide a measure of safety for American highways.\n  What is this issue really about? It is not about whether we are \nviolating a trade agreement. No one can credibly argue that any trade \nagreement at any time under any circumstances requires this country to \nsacrifice safety on its highways.\n  It is about using common sense to understand when and under what \ncircumstances shall we allow Mexican long-haul truckers to go beyond \nthe 20-mile limit that now exists.\n  Some will say: Let's immediately allow Mexican long-haul trucks to \noperate throughout the United States. That is what President Bush says. \nOn January 1, we intend to allow long-haul Mexican truckers into this \ncountry beyond the 20-mile limit. He says we will provide inspections \nand so forth.\n  The fact is, there will not be sufficient inspections. There are not \nsufficient inspection stations. There are not sufficient inspectors. \nThere are not sufficient compliance officers. There is not a ghost of a \nchance of that happening. Everyone knows it.\n  I sat in a 3- to 4-hour hearing in the Commerce Committee with the \nSecretary of Transportation and the Department of Transportation \nInspector General. All of us understand that the numbers of inspectors \nand compliance officers requested for the border fall short of what is \nrequired for safety monitoring.\n  To those who say we can allow access throughout the United States to \nMexican trucks on January 1 and those traveling on our highways will be \nprotected, the numbers don't add up. We will not be protected. There \nare not the resources available to hire the number of inspectors or the \ncompliance officers to allow this to happen.\n  Are there reasons for us to be concerned if you don't have a regime \nof inspections? The answer clearly is yes. I would refer again to a \nnews report about long-haul trucking in Mexico that featured in the San \nFrancisco Chronicle in March. This article simply mirrors what most of \nus know about the lack of standards in Mexico. A reporter went down and \ntraveled for 3 days with a Mexican long-haul trucker. In 3 days this \nMexican long-haul trucker drove 1,800 miles and slept 7 hours. Yes, \nthat is right; in 3 days, he slept a total of 7 hours. He didn't run \ninto safety inspections because safety inspections are not common in \nMexico. The driver didn't keep a logbook because, although they are \nrequired in Mexico, drivers don't keep them.\n\n  The fact is, in Mexico, they don't have limitations on hours of \nservice, and so a truckdriver can drive 3 days and sleep only 7 hours \nand will not be in violation of Mexican laws.\n  The question is, Would you want the truckdriver in the San Francisco \nChronicle article to cross the U.S.-Mexico border into this country, \nafter having slept only 7 hours in 3 days while having driven 1,800 \nmiles in a truck that could not meet this country's safety standards \nbecause it had a broken windshield? I don't think anybody would want \nhim to cross into this country and travel on America's highways. That \nclearly compromises safety on our highways.\n  So, the Senator from Washington has placed a provision in this \nlegislation. She had to put it on this appropriations bill because the \nPresident indicated he intends to move on January 1. Really, the only \noption to stop the President's intentions is to put the provision in \nthe appropriations bill and give us some assurance of safety on \nAmerica's highways. That is what this dispute is about.\n  I agree that there is room for different opinions, but on this \nlegislation, the facts are quite clear. I sat in a hearing for hours on \nthis subject, hearing from the Department of Transportation's Inspector \nGeneral. The Inspector General's report represents the base of facts \nhere. The Mexican trucking industry does not have the same standards we \ndo. There is no requirement for such standards. The inspection stations \nthat should exist in the United States don't exist. Those inspection \nstations that do exist are not open sufficient hours to for proper \ninspection. If trucks happen to be inspected, at the vast majority of \nsites, there aren't enough spaces to park the trucks with serious \nsafety violations. You can't send them back to Mexico because, for \nexample, they may not have brakes. These are insurmountable problems to \novercome prior to January 1.\n  That is why the Senator from Washington has done what she did. She \nneeded to put restrictions in this legislation that I think are \nnecessary to assure highway safety.\n  My understanding is that the Senator from Kentucky would like me to \nyield for a unanimous consent request. I would be happy to yield to him \nfor that purpose, providing I am recognized following that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Under the provisions of rule XXII, I yield my hour to \nthe minority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, in the interest of time and in the \ninterest of responding to the Senator from Mississippi, who graciously \nallowed me to be recognized, I will complete my statement only by \nsaying this: My colleague from South Carolina made a statement about \nthe issue of the NAFTA trade agreement. I saw another colleague smile \nto himself as to what my colleague, Senator Hollings, said. The NAFTA \ntrade agreement has been awful. Some people walk around here and think \nit is one of the best things that ever happened to this country. I have \nno idea why they think that. This\n\n[[Page S8522]]\n\nis a trade agreement that turned a trade surplus we had with Mexico \ninto a huge deficit and a growing deficit. It took a modest deficit \nwith Canada and doubled it very quickly. It is beyond me how someone \ncan view that as progress. I think, in fact, it has injured this \ncountry in many, many ways.\n  I was intrigued by a statement by Senator Gramm, who said, ``Do you \nknow what the Mexicans have said? They have said if we put this \nprovision in this appropriations bill restricting President Bush's \nability to allow Mexican long-haul trucks to come into this country \nbeyond the 20-mile limit, Mexico is going to retaliate against us on \nthe issue of high-fructose corn syrup.''\n  High-fructose corn syrup. I wonder if my colleague knows that Mexico \nhas already been dealing with high-fructose corn syrup in a way that \nessentially abrogates the NAFTA treaty and, in fact, Mexico has been \nfound guilty of violating the trade agreement on the corn syrup. Mexico \nis already in violation on syrup, and they are threatening that somehow \nif we don't take the Murray language out of the bill they are going to \ntake action on corn syrup. I am sorry, they already took that action \nand it violated the NAFTA trade agreement.\n  Incidentally, nothing that protects America's highways, in my \njudgment, should ever be considered a violation of a trade agreement. \nThe next time somebody says there is a violation of NAFTA or a trade \nagreement, I will simply observe that on corn syrup, which has been the \none area raised on the floor, the only violation that exists is Mexico \nviolating a trade agreement with the United States.\n  So I find it intriguing that there is this sort of blame-our-country-\nfirst on all these issues. Our country has been open; it has been \nwilling to embrace all kinds of trade expansion opportunities almost \neverywhere in the world. But every time we turn around we discover that \neither a trade agreement was negotiated in an inappropriate way or \nsomeone is refusing to enforce a trade agreement.\n  This is a circumstance that is very simple. Senator Murray has put in \na rather simple, easy-to-understand amendment. We ought to be willing \nto stand behind it on behalf of safety on America's highways. This is \nnot about anti-Mexico. It is not about sending a discriminatory message \nto anybody; it is about standing up for safety on America's highways. \nWe are nowhere near ready to be able to allow Mexican long-haul trucks \ninto this country. Their safety standards are nowhere near compatible \nwith ours, and it would compromise safety on our highways to allow \nMexican trucks to operate throughout the United States beginning on \nJanuary 1. That is what the Murray amendment says. That is why we are \ntrying to keep that amendment in this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is my understanding that the minority leader from \nMississippi may be seeking recognition. I don't believe he is at this \nmoment. I will yield as soon as he is prepared to speak. I want to make \na statement on this issue in a moment.\n  I thank the Senator from North Dakota because I think he summarized \nthis issue. I went home to Illinois over the weekend. It is interesting \nhow many people are following this debate but no real surprise. How \nmany of us are out on the highways now going back and forth to work or \non vacations? Look on the freeways in Chicago or on the interstate \nhighways in downstate Illinois; you see a lot of trucks. We can rightly \nassume, if they are American trucks, that they are subject to pretty \nsubstantial standards in terms of the safety of the vehicle and the \ncompetency of the driver. What kind of standards? An inspection, No. 1, \nto make sure the brakes work, make sure the trucks don't weigh too \nmuch, make certain the lights work on the trucks, and basic things such \nas that.\n  Secondly, when it comes to the competency of American truckdrivers, \nwe are pretty demanding. We ask them to keep a log and tell us how \nfrequently they are driving and for what period of time. We subject \nthem to drug tests and alcohol tests. We go through a lengthy \nbackground check to see if they have a history of driving under the \ninfluence or reckless driving. We make them pass a CDL exam for their \nlicense and to go out on the road. It is a demanding examination. We \nwant them to understand the highway standards and regulations for \nsafety in the United States.\n  When my family is driving down the highway for a vacation--which I \nhope will happen sometime in August--and we see a truck coming up \nbehind us, if it is an American truck from an American trucking company \nwith an American driver, I at least have the peace of mind that it is \nmore likely than not that the truck has been inspected and that the \ndriver has passed the test.\n  What is this amendment all about? This is about trucks that aren't \nAmerican trucks and are driven by people who are not American citizens. \nWe are talking about trucks coming in from Mexico. Many of the people \nwho come here today and support this provision by Senator Murray \nrequiring standards for Mexican truck inspection, standards for Mexican \ntruckdrivers, voted against the North American Free Trade Agreement. \nSome of them, as previous speakers have said, believe it was not in the \nbest interest of the United States.\n  I don't come from that position at all. I am from the State of \nIllinois. Exports are critical to Illinois, whether it is in the \nagricultural sector or the manufacturing sector. I voted for NAFTA.\n  I voted for NAFTA believing we were doing two things: opening up a \npotential market for the United States in Mexico and opening up a \npotential market for Mexico in the United States. I believe in free \ntrade so long as it is fair, so long as it is subject to standards and \nrules that are enforced.\n  In the middle of this debate, it could have been one of the most \ncontentious debates I recall in Congress. I was a Member of the House \nof Representatives when the NAFTA issue came before us. During the \ncourse of this debate, there was a high intensity feeling, particularly \nopposition from a number of people, environmentalists, those \nrepresenting labor unions. They were opposed to NAFTA.\n  A number of us went to the Clinton administration and said, if we \npass this NAFTA treaty, we want to understand how it is going to work. \nThe first question I asked, and received a response in writing, was \nthis: If we agree to NAFTA, a trade agreement with Mexico, will we have \nto compromise any of our health and safety standards in the United \nStates?\n  The answer came back, unequivocally, no. If a health and safety \nstandard is imposed on an American company, the same standard can be \nimposed on the Mexican company and product coming into the United \nStates. Whether it is the safety of food that is brought in or whether \nit is the safety of trucks driven in from Mexico, they are subject to \nthe same standards.\n  A few weeks ago the Ambassador of Mexico came to my office. He is a \nvery nice gentleman. I met him there and then again in Chicago when \nPresident Vicente Fox visited Chicago 2 weeks ago. We had a long talk \nabout this.\n  I said: Mr. Ambassador, let me ask one basic question. If we will \nhold Mexico to the same standards when it comes to the safety of trucks \non the highway and the competency of drivers that we hold American \ntrucks and American truckdrivers to, will that be acceptable?\n  He said: Yes, that is not unreasonable.\n  I remember this particularly. He said: When it comes to logbooks, \ntell us what is wanted in these logbooks. The color of the cover of the \nlogbooks can be told to us. We will live by the same standard as \nAmerican truckdrivers.\n  I thought that was a reasonable position to take. It certainly is \nwhat I understood when we voted for NAFTA, but if one listens to the \ncritics of Senator Murray's amendment, they are suggesting holding \nMexico to the same standards as the United States is protectionist; it \nis violating free trade; it is violating NAFTA.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth. I think they have \noverreacted. I invite them to read the language Senator Murray has put \nin this bill. What she has said time and again is: The Mexican trucks \nand Mexican truckdrivers will be subject to the same standards.\n  What if we should take out the Murray language altogether? What if we \nhad no such language in the law? What could we expect?\n\n[[Page S8523]]\n\n  There are several things we know about Mexican trucking companies. \nOne, under Mexican law, there is no limit to the number of hours a \ndriver can drive a truck. In the United States, there are specific \nlimits. We believe that if someone is behind the wheel for a long \nperiod of time, it can take its toll. They are not as responsive as \nthey should be. They may not be as careful as they should be. In \nMexico, there is no limitation.\n  We heard the comments earlier from the Senator from North Dakota, \nwhen a reporter from the San Francisco newspaper traveled with the \nMexican truckdriver, they covered 1,800 miles in 3 days and the \ntruckdriver slept a total of 7 hours. Think about yourself driving \n1,800 miles, perhaps driving from St. Louis to Los Angeles. Or going \nback and forth across the country, and in a span of 3 days you cover \nthat trip with 7 hours' sleep. How good are you going to be behind the \nwheel at that point?\n\n  Let us change this. You are not just behind the wheel of your car. \nYou are driving a truck down that highway that could weigh 135,000 \npounds. That 135,000 pounds is another important figure because we have \na limitation on the weight of trucks in the United States at 85,000, \nbut not in Mexico. They can put trucks on the road at 135,000 pounds.\n  We have a driver who has no limitation on the number of hours that he \ncan consecutively drive down the highway, with a truck that is \nsubstantially larger than anything permissible under the law in the \nUnited States. That driver keeps no logbooks because the law is not \nenforced in Mexico. That driver is not subject to the same drug and \nalcohol testing as American truckdrivers because they have not \nestablished the laboratories for testing. We see that time and time \nagain. The Mexican truck companies and the Mexican truckdrivers do not \nmeet the minimum standards we expect in the United States.\n  What if there was an accident? This is worth noting, too. In the \nUnited States, if someone has a truck on the road, with an American \ntruckdriver and an American truck, their liability insurance will range \nfrom $750,000 to $5 million. A Mexican truckdriver has average \ninsurance of $70,000. Think about how little that covers if one is in a \nserious accident with a lot of injuries.\n  The Murray amendment is a reasonable amendment. It is one I hope \nthose who support free trade, as I support free trade, will understand \nis part of the bargain. We are prepared to say to Mexico, we will live \nup to their standards when it comes to our exports to their country. \nThey should live up to our standards when it comes to their exports to \nthe United States of America.\n  That is not unreasonable. That is what fair trade is all about. The \nMurray amendment is a substantial step forward to establish a standard.\n  When people in Illinois have said to me, Senator, when you get back \nto Washington make sure the Mexican trucks are safe, they understand, \nas well as I do, when we are going down the highway with our family, \nheading for vacation and look in the rearview mirror, we should not \nhave to look twice to try to determine whether that license plate is \nfrom the United States or from Mexico as to whether it is safe.\n  We ought to know wherever those trucks are from, they are going to be \nsafe for all families on the highway in the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Presiding Officer, in her capacity as a \nSenator from New York, pursuant to rule XXII, yields her hour to the \nSenator from Washington, the manager of the bill.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, Senator Daschle and I have been talking \nand working on what agreement can be worked out about how to proceed \nfor the remainder of the evening and tomorrow and maybe even into \nSeptember. While we are checking with all the interested parties, I \nhave not spoken at length on this issue. I do not wish to speak at \nlength now, but I think I should speak to some of the issues that are \nbefore us with regard to the Transportation appropriations bill and \nthis very important issue of how the operation of buses and trucks from \nMexico and the United States are able to go back and forth across the \nborder.\n  First of all, I emphasize I appreciate the work that has been done by \nthe manager of this legislation on both sides of the aisle with regard \nto transportation. Transportation is a very important part of what the \nFederal Government does and it is one of those areas where the Federal \nGovernment does the allocation of funds in the right way. We do not \ngenerally direct all the money must go to one place or another, even \nthough there are some areas where we provide direct instructions. The \nbulk of the money is sent to the States based on a formula that is \ndecided, of course, in the TEA-21 bill. The States get a large sum of \nmoney and then they decide what the priorities are in terms of what \nroads or what bridges are worked on and in what priority, how much of \nthat money can go for railroads, because we gave a lot more flexibility \nunder TEA-21, the Transportation Act, that we passed a couple of years \nago. I guess it has been 3 years ago now. That money can go into \nrailroads or it can go into mass transit. There has been a lot of \nflexibility, but most of the key decisions are made by the States once \nthey get the money. So this is important legislation.\n  As we look to the future economic growth of this country, in my mind, \nobviously, how the Government works with the people, can we control \nregulations? Can we control the burdens? How much are people able to \nkeep of their own money? That is a very important part of economic \ngrowth. I think the energy area is a very important area of our future \neconomic growth. It is a matter of national security, but certainly it \nis key to being able to have a growing economy in this country.\n  We are going to have to have more exploration for oil and gas, more \nuse of other fuels, more opportunity for alternative fuels, more \nincentives for conservation, the entire energy package. As a part of \nthis, trade is important, but transportation is also critical. It does \ncreate jobs. It is about safety on our highways.\n\n  If we are going to have a growing country and a growing economy, we \nhave to have the whole package, too. It is not just about roads and \nbridges. It is about urban mass transportation, railroads, airports, \nrivers, and harbors, all the different aspects of transportation.\n  In my own State, I have tried to emphasize that as we try to make \neconomic progress, it is critical to focus on improving education and \nthat we have a decent transportation system because so many areas that \nneeded economic development could not get them. It was next to \nimpossible. The roads were not four lanes; they were two lanes narrow \nand dangerous. Many people, including my own father, were killed on \nthose roads because of the unsafe hilly nature of our road system. If \nwe are going to have the economic development we are seeking, we have \nto have a good overall transportation system.\n  Of course, the third component is jobs creation. If you are not \naggressively pursuing expansion of existing industries and businesses \nand seeking other industries to come in, international corporations to \ncome in, as we have in my own State of Mississippi--Nissan is \nconstructing a facility that will cost approximately $1.2 billion, the \nlargest new single-industry plant in the history of our State. In order \nfor that to succeed, they will have to have access to a transportation \nsystem.\n  I commend the managers of the legislation for the work they have done \non this bill. I in no way object. I approve of what is in this \nlegislation to the extent I know exactly what is in it.\n  How did we reach this point on the Mexican truck issue? When the \nSenate was prepared to vote on the North American Free Trade Act, I had \nsome reservations about it and expressed those reservations. Some of \nthe concerns I had were addressed as we went through the process. I \nkept asking\n\n[[Page S8524]]\n\nquestions and expressing concern about trucks and truck safety coming \nout of Mexico. Those around at the time or those following it will \nremember it was one of the last issues that was addressed in the NAFTA \nlegislation. I was sympathetic. Nobody wants unsafe trucks on America's \nhighways. Nobody wants unsafe trucks, whether they are from Mexico, \nCanada, or America. We have all had the scary experience of having an \n18-wheeler meet us and come too close or go by us with flaps blowing in \nthe wind. We did resolve the problem. We have been living with that.\n  Again, I think sometimes trucking and truckers do get a bum rap; that \ncompanies are conscious of safety needs. These drivers in the United \nStates, our own drivers, are good men and women whose lives are at \nstake, also. I had an occasion for a few years to be a part owner of a \ntrucking company. I know all that is involved in trying to make ends \nmeet with a trucking company and how difficult it is to have a \ntruckload going to Chicago and come back empty. A company can wipe out \nan entire profit with empty backhauls.\n  I know a little bit about all the licensing requirements in America, \nthe number of tags needed, the different requirements in the different \nStates. For every truck that comes into my State, and I guess other \nStates in America, there is a weigh station. They are lined up coming \nfrom Mobile, AL, headed to my home State, to pull off the highway and \ngo through the weigh station and be inspected. Quite often, we have the \nhighway patrol observing who is going and coming.\n  I do not want to in any way demonize truckers in this country for the \njob they do. They are an important part of our economy.\n  This has become very much a problem in this particular bill. Why? The \ntruth is, I think there was too much of a rush to just say, come on in, \ntrucks from Mexico, without proper inspection. That is inadequate, \nunacceptable, but also the situation where we have trucks come from \nMexico to within a 20-mile zone and they hand off the goods to American \ntrucks. They cannot come any further than that. I had occasion last \nDecember to be in Laredo, TX. I saw the trucks lined up down the \nhighway, but they could only come so far, and then there was a very \nexpensive and dilatory process of passing on the goods to come on into \nthe United States.\n  We have a growing, improving relationship with our neighbors to the \nsouth. President Bush has worked with the leaders in Mexico, both as \nthe Governor of Texas, and now as President, with their new President \nFox. They are addressing a number of issues, including drug \ntrafficking, how we deal with the necessary extradition of criminals \nbetween the two countries, how we deal with the immigration question, \nand, yes, transportation, how we deal with the border crossings and the \nillegal aliens who, in many instances, prefer to be legal aliens. These \nare all difficult issues but they are important and we are addressing \nthem now in a broader sense than ever in my memory.\n  I met this past week with four members of the Mexican Senate \nincluding the President, President Jackson. We talked about some of \nthese issues and how they don't always agree. I think they represented \nthree different parties; they do not always agree with President Fox; \nthey do agree we should continue to have free-flowing trade and \ntransportation and communication between our countries.\n  The idea that trucks from Mexico can only come in 20 miles and must \nstop and cannot go further is unacceptable. Also, the idea that trucks \ncan come into this country without proper inspection, without proper \ninsurance, without proper licensing, without safety inspections, is \nunacceptable.\n  I have never suggested trucks from anywhere be able to come into this \ncountry on our roads and not comply with our safety requirements. But \nthere is a limit how far that can go. They have to have credible \ninsurance. The idea that some say they cannot have insurance coverage \nfrom a Mexican company, what kind of attitude is that? We can't require \nthat they have to have insurance in America. Both countries should \nrequire in the other country's case that it has to be credible \ninsurance; it has to be a real company; it has to be sufficient; and \nthere has to be a process so we know who is providing that insurance \nfrom Mexico, and they can turn the tables on us and say we must know it \nis credible insurance of the United States.\n  The drivers must be properly trained and licensed. You do not just \njump in an 18-wheeler and take off. You cannot even shift gears in \nthose things. I have tried it. They have to meet certain licensing \nrequirements.\n  There is no disagreement that we should have inspection, but it \nshould be reasonable and fair. It should be affordable in terms of what \nthe government has to pay, and it has to be done in a reasonable period \nof time. Those who don't want Mexican trucks on our American highways \nhave an ``anti-attitude.'' Some people don't like it that I have called \nit anti-Hispanic or anti-NAFTA. How can anyone justify that kind of an \nattitude? We cannot have that.\n\n  We need to find a way to work through this because of perhaps an \neagerness to get this process underway that contributed to the \ndifficulty we are having now. The House of Representatives lost control \nof the issue and wound up putting the same old language in the \nTransportation bill that basically said you would not be able to bring \nthe trucks in here; just stop it. They made a big mistake. It does not \nmake a difference if it is a Republican or Democrat House, whether it \nis bipartisan or unanimous. That cannot be where we leave the issue.\n  Then the administration contacted members of the Appropriations \nCommittee in the Senate and said: We have a big problem with that \nlanguage; so will Mexico. We are running the risk of being held in \nnoncompliance with NAFTA. We are running the risk of having action \ntaken against American goods, whether it is telecommunications or corn \nsyrup products. We have to solve this problem.\n  The appropriators, to their credit, Republican and Democrat, worked \non the language. They came up with what is now referred to as the \nMurray-Shelby language. They thought, I believe, that they had made \nsufficient progress. Subsequent to that, on reviewing that language, it \nwas clear that language was very problematic.\n  Secretary of Transportation, Norm Mineta, expressed his concern to a \nnumber of Senators, including to me, personally, about how there were \ntoo many restrictions; there was not enough flexibility; it would cost \nalmost twice as much as what the President asked for, which I think was \n$88 million for safety compliance. And because of the restrictions and \nthe extra costs and the contracting involved, the trucks from Mexico \nwould not be able to come into the United States for months or even a \nyear or more.\n  By the way, it is a two-way street. As long as we are not letting \nMexican trucks come into the United States, American trucks are not \ngoing to be able to go to Mexico. That is why the Mississippi Truckers \nAssociation wants to get this matter worked out and why they oppose the \nMurray language. They want to be able to take our products from \nthroughout the Southeast or anywhere in the country and haul it in the \nother direction.\n\n  So that is when a number of Senators started saying the language that \ncame out of the Appropriations Transportation Subcommittee presented \ntoo many problems; we need to find a way to correct it.\n  What are those concerns? It does have to do with flexibility. Does \nthe Department of Transportation have sufficient flexibility to \neffectively administer safety requirements? It is a basic question. We \nwant safety requirements and responsibilities, but there must be some \ndegree of flexibility, of how those are administered. The language in \nsection 343 of this bill, S. 1178, raises serious questions about that.\n  In order for the operators from Mexico to come across the border, \nthere were some 22 separate requirements that had to be met. Standing \nalone, certain requirements may be acceptable, but taken as an \naggregate, they result in a violation of commitments.\n  It is going to lead, as I pointed out, to delays. Just one example of \nthe type of thing we talked about is the one I referred to in a number \nof discussions earlier, the cost of the weigh stations, for instance. \nThe requirements to install weigh-in-motion systems, fixed scales, \nelectronic scanning machines,\n\n[[Page S8525]]\n\nand hand-held tracking systems as well as requirements to employ \nadditional inspectors and to conduct inspections within Mexico would \njust require lots of extra money, lots of delays, and lots of time. I \nwill give a couple of examples.\n  Why would you require weigh-in-motion scales and static scales, both, \nnot one or the other? And, by the way, if you require them both, you \nhave to contract it. You do not just run out there and take these \nscales off the shelf. You have to contract for them; you have to get \nthem and have them put in place. This would require you to have both. I \ndo not think we have that in most of our States. When trucks come in \nfrom Arkansas or Louisiana or Tennessee, we weigh them statically. \nMaybe we do weigh some of them in motion, but we do not have to have \nboth of them.\n  The other example is conducting inspections in Mexico. As time goes \nforward, perhaps both countries would like to have some of that. I had \none Senator say to me: Look, FAA requires inspection at the base before \na plane flies into the United States. There is a big difference, \nthough. When a plane leaves Mexico, the next stop is an airport or \nlanding strip in the United States. The difference between the place of \ndoing business of a truck in that situation is they have to cross the \nborder. There is a point at which there would be an inspection.\n  Perhaps this can be worked out. But to impose at the beginning the \nrequirement that we have to go into the place of business and inspect \nwithin that country and they are going to require the reverse--that \nthey be able to come in and inspect in our country--is just one more \nexample of some of the problems we have.\n  Never, ever have I seen a bill where a compromise could have been \nmore easily and quickly worked out than this one. Yet the warring sides \nrefuse to agree to do that. I think sometimes maybe there were \nmisunderstandings. Somebody told me on this side of the aisle, on the \nDemocratic side--or maybe I should not say just Democratic--the \nproponents of the language in the bill said: Why wouldn't you go with \nthe California solution? I said: Great, it sounds fine to me. Why don't \nwe do what they do in California, the inspection areas where they have \ncrossings into California? They said it was because your opponents to \nthis language would not agree to it.\n\n  That came as a surprise to me. As a matter of fact, in talking to \nSenator Gramm and Senator McCain, I had the clear impression that what \nthey were advocating was the California inspection regimen. So I think \nthe two sides passed in the night here.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. That is actually in the bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. There was an agreement, yet they never could seem to come \nto closure on it.\n  I know the Teamsters, a group with whom I do not have a problem. I \nhave worked with the Teamsters. I have been supported by the Teamsters \nsometimes--probably not again anytime soon. I understand their concern. \nBut because this language was in the appropriations bill because, it \nappears to me, the Teamsters really do not want Mexican trucks to come \ninto America, and because of misunderstandings, and, yes, because of \npersonalities, we could not resolve this.\n  We could have done this bill at least a week ago. Everybody in this \nroom and everybody on both sides knows it can be done. Now the \nappropriators said: Wait a minute, you are getting too exercised. This \nis not necessary. We will fix it in the conference. Don't worry, don't \nworry, we will fix it in the conference.\n  Yes, and usually I buy that argument. But there is a little problem \nwith this one. You have totally unrealistic, unacceptable language in \nthe House bill, the Sabo language. And the language in the Senate \nTransportation appropriations bill also has a number of concerns--these \n22 requirements. So if you have a bad situation and a worse situation, \nhow do you split the difference? That is usually what happens in \nconference. You go somewhere between where the House is and where the \nSenate is. Yet the solution is outside both.\n  I know the immaculate conceptions that come out of these conferences. \nIt really doesn't make a difference what the House and Senate did; the \nconferees will do what they want to, particularly on a bill that is not \nan appropriations bill, because they are not affected by rule XVI \nanymore. So maybe they will come out with something that is fair, \nunderstandable, not unduly restrictive, affordable, that both the \nproponents and opponents are satisfied with and the President can sign, \nand we can go on with our business.\n  But I have been a little ill at ease about that. So I have gone back \nto some of the supporters of the language we have in this bill and \nasked them again: Will you assure me that in conference there will be \nthis dedicated effort, and in fact you will get a bill the President \ncan sign? And they have assured me of that.\n  I guess if they do not sign the conference, they might make that \nstick. Maybe others will say we will see about that. And there are \nthose who are thinking: We will do what we want to. If the President \nvetoes it, we will override the veto.\n  That will not happen. That will not happen. I can guarantee the \nSenate right here, right now, if this is not properly resolved and the \nPresident does not sign it, if he vetoes it, we will sustain the veto. \nWe will sustain the veto.\n\n  But have I advocated that? No. The President doesn't want to veto \nthis bill, and I don't want him to veto the bill. I don't want to have \nto make sure we have the votes to sustain the veto. The solution is: \nResolve this. Make it NAFTA compliant. Let's be fair to both sides.\n  I don't always agree with what this administration or previous \nadministrations have advocated with regard to Mexico--or Canada, for \nthat matter. I get very upset with what Canada is doing to the United \nStates in our trade relations. I think what they are doing with regard \nto soft lumber products is totally unacceptable, and I think this \nadministration should be at least as aggressive as the previous \nadministration, through the Customs Office and through our Trade \nRepresentative, in assuring that the Canadians comply with our lumber \nagreements.\n  So it is not that I am one who is always here taking firm stands in \nsupport of our neighbors and in support of even the treaties when I \nthink the treaties are not being administered fairly or they turn out \nto be basically fair. So I don't profess to be 100-percent pure on \nthis.\n  But you cannot defend, legitimately, honestly, and intellectually, a \nsituation where we say to our neighbors and to legitimate truckers, you \ncannot come any more than 20 miles into the United States. That is not \nwhere we should be.\n  So the President has expressed his interest in this. I think he has \ntried to be restrained in terms of threats. But he has made it clear \nthis is important. President Fox is going to be in the United States \nthe first week in September when this bill is going to be in \nconference, I guess, or about to go to conference. I hope we will not \nbe in the process of passing legislation and sending to our President \nat the time something that clearly President Fox will not agree with \nand will be opposed to while he is in town. I guess he is coming to \ntown September 3 or 4 or 5, or something of that nature.\n  We do have correspondence here that clearly states the Mexican \nGovernment's concern. I have a letter.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent this letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 24, 2001.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Senate Majority Leader,\n     Washington, DC.\n       We have been following the legislative process regarding \n     cross border trucking on the floor of the U.S. Senate. This \n     is an issue of extreme importance to Mexico on both legal and \n     economic grounds. From a legal standpoint, Mexico expects \n     non-discriminatory treatment from the U.S. as stipulated \n     under the NAFTA. The integrity of the Agreement is at stake \n     as is the commitment of the U.S. to live up to its \n     international obligations under the NAFTA. I would like to \n     reiterate that Mexico has never sought reduced safety and \n     security standards. Each and every truck company from Mexico \n     ought to be given the opportunity to show it complies fully \n     with U.S. standards at the state and federal levels.\n       The economic arguments are clear-cut: Because of NAFTA, \n     Mexico has become the second largest U.S. trading partner \n     with $263\n\n[[Page S8526]]\n\n     billion of goods now being exchanged yearly. About 75% of \n     these goods move by truck. In a few years, Mexico may surpass \n     Canada as the U.S. largest trading partner and market. \n     Compliance with the panel ruling means that products will \n     flow far more smoothly and far less expensively between our \n     nations. Doing so will enable us to take advantage of the \n     only permanent comparative advantage we have: that is our \n     geographic proximity. The winners will be consumers, \n     businesses and workers in the three countries.\n       We are very concerned after regarding the Murray amendment \n     and the Administration's position regarding it that the \n     legislative outcome may still constitute a violation of the \n     Agreement. In this light, we hope the legislative language \n     will allow the prompt and nondiscriminatory opening of the \n     border of international trucking.\n       Finally I would like to undermine our position, that to the \n     Mexican government the integrity of the NAFTA is of the \n     utmost importance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                     Luis Ernesto Derbez Bautista,\n                                         Secretary of the Economy.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. This is a letter from the Secretary of the Economy in \nMexico. It says:\n\n       The economic arguments are clear-cut. Because of the NAFTA, \n     Mexico has become the second largest U.S. trading partner \n     with $263 billion dollars of goods now being exchanged \n     yearly. About 75 percent of those goods move by truck. In a \n     few years, Mexico's may surpass Canada as the U.S. largest \n     trading partner and market.\n\n  It goes on to note they believe the language in this bill does not \nmeet the requirements of NAFTA.\n  They believe it is a violation of our agreement and that reasonable \nchange and a reasonable agreement should be worked out soon.\n  I very rarely agree with what I read in the editorial pages of the \nWashington Post. But to my absolute amazement, on Saturday I got up and \nread the Washington Post, and there it was--an editorial saying ``NAFTA \nin trouble''--the Washington Post editorializing against the \nrestrictions on the Mexican trucks coming into the United States. The \nconcluding sentences are shocking sentences. It says:\n\n       President Bush says he will veto legislation unless such \n     discrimination is removed from it.\n\n  That is the right course.\n  That is what this is all about.\n  I don't affix blame at any one place, or the administration, or on \nus. Somehow or another we have gotten to where we are. Now we can't \nseem to find a way to let go. Now we have a situation where Senators \nwere willing to pass this on a voice vote at 2 o'clock. Now it is 10 \nminutes until 3. We are not going to have a vote on it, I guess, until \ntomorrow. That delays other legislation we are working on with \ninterested parties on both sides. Senators Daschle, Reid, and Nickles \nhave been involved along with Senators Gramm and McCain.\n  A lot of this is just totally unnecessary. Here we are talking, once \nagain, about an issue we have been talking about for a week or more. \nWho is to blame? Yes. Sure. I am sure Senators will say we would have \nbeen glad to have voted on this last week. I have been through this \nexplanation of how we got here.\n  But I wanted to make the point that we were ready to finish with this \nissue an hour ago, and we couldn't get it done. I hope maybe we can use \nthis as a case study.\n  When you go to law school, you learn the law by studying trials, \nlawsuits, and cases that have gone before. This should be a case study \nfor the administration, for the House, for the Senate, for our trading \npartners, and for us as to how not to deal with an issue. I hope we \nwill learn from it.\n  I hope we can put it behind us and move on in a positive way to other \nappropriations and other bills. But it has been a difficult one.\n  I have supported Senators McCain and Gramm in their efforts. I have \nhad some Members on the other side ask: Why would you do that? You \nhaven't always agreed with those guys on other subjects. Right. But the \ndifference this time is I thought they were right. It is real simple. I \nwasn't mad at anyone. I just couldn't defend where the United States is \nat this time with regard to Mexican trucks.\n  I had not spoken on the floor on this issue. I wanted to give a \nlittle bit of the history and urge my colleagues to find a way to \ncomplete this and move on to other legislation that is also very \nimportant for our country. Rather than recriminations, let's just learn \nfrom the experience.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, presently negotiations are going on to try \nto get a unanimous consent agreement to resolve this issue, and to move \non to other issues. Among those negotiations is the subject of \nnominations. I hope that is part of any agreement that may be made.\n  (The further remarks of Mr. McCain are printed in today's Record \nunder ``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1213\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I send a management package to the desk \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray], for herself and \n     Mr. Shelby, proposes an amendment No. 1213.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.''\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to amendment No. 1213.\n  The amendment (No. 1213) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, earlier today, my colleague from Texas, \nSenator Gramm, asked that his substitute be printed again in the \nRecord. Much has been said about this substitute amendment. The claim \nis made that this substitute will protect safety while complying with \nNAFTA. That is just plain wrong. This claim is indicative of the \nproblem we have had in these negotiations--the fact that our opponents \ndefine compliance with NAFTA as gutting the safety provisions in our \nbill.\n  Lets look at the specifics of the McCain-Gramm substitute.\n  The McCain-Gramm amendment is a legislative sleight of hand intended \nto take the teeth out of the safety provisions that were approved \nunanimously by the Appropriations Committee.\n  They create loopholes large enough to drive a Mexican truck through.\n  Their amendment looks and sounds very much like the committee-adopted \nprovisions when, in fact, the amendment weakens the committee-adopted \nprovisions in several critical and dangerous ways.\n  First, the McCain-Gramm amendment completely does away with the \nrequirement that all Mexican trucking companies undergo a thorough \ncompliance review before they are given authority to operate in the \nUnited States. Instead of that requirement, the McCain-Gramm amendment \nsubstitutes a cursory ``safety review''.\n  A safety review is a much comprehensive review of a trucking \ncompany's operations. It is a quick and dirty paper check. It is not a \nthorough examination to ensure that a trucking company complies with \nall U.S. safety standards. It does not approach a compliance review in \nterms of ensuring that a trucking firm's operations are safe.\n  My colleagues should not be fooled. A safety review and a compliance \nreview are not the same thing. They are two\n\n[[Page S8527]]\n\nvery different things. A safety review should provide the American \npublic with a whole lot less comfort than a compliance review when it \ncomes to the operations of Mexican trucking firms.\n  Second, the McCain-Gramm amendment completely does away with the \nrequirement that compliance reviews be performed on site at each \ntrucking firm's facility. Every time a U.S. Motor Carrier Safety \nInspector performs a compliance review on a U.S. trucking firm, it is \ndone at the trucking firm's facility. Every time a U.S. Motor Carrier \nSafety Inspector performs a compliance review on a Canadian trucking \nfirm, it is done at the Canadian trucking firm's facility. Now when it \ncomes to Mexico, the McCain-Gramm amendment wants to allow compliance \nreviews to be conducted at the border. This is a farce.\n  A compliance review, by definition, requires the inspector to \ncarefully review the trucking firm's vehicles, record books, log books, \nwage and hour records, and much, much more. You can't perform a \ncompliance review at a remote site. It is not even a poor substitute.\n  There is a long list of abuses that can result if inspectors never \nvisit a trucking company's facility. For the life of me, I can not \nimagine why the sponsors of the McCain-Gramm amendment want to allow \nthose potential abuses on the part of Mexican trucking firms while \ninsisting that every compliance review here in the United States and in \nCanada is performed on site.\n  Third, the McCain-Gramm amendment waives the requirement that the DOT \npublish critical safety rules before allowing trucks across the border. \nThe McCain-Gramm amendment would allow the requirement to be waived by \nthe Secretary by simply signing a letter stating that he will not \npublish these rules and sending it to Congress.\n  The provision unanimously adopted by the Appropriations Committee \nrequires that critically important safety rules must be completed by \nthe DOT before the border can be opened. These rules were not randomly \nselected. The rules that we require to be published before the border \ncan be opened are targeted at the specific safety concerns surrounding \nMexican trucks.\n  The McCain-Gramm amendment pretends to mandate that these rules go \nforward but simultaneously includes a provision that guts the same \nrequirement. My colleagues--don't be fooled, the requirement in the \nMcCain-Gramm amendment is a phony one that severely weakens the \nmeasures included in the committee-adopted provision.\n  Fourth, the McCain-Gramm amendment does away with the requirement \nthat the inspector general certify that critical safety measures are in \nplace before the border is opened.\n  Instead of requiring that the inspector general certify that it is \nsafe at the border, the McCain-Gramm amendment simply requires that the \nSecretary of Transportation periodically submit reports to the \ncommittee on the state of problems at the border.\n  This is a monstrous loophole. It creates more and more paperwork in \nWashington while the Mexican trucks come streaming across our border. \nIt completely guts a number of the critical requirements in the \nunderlying committee provision.\n  The Committee on Appropriations receives a great many mandated \nreports by the Department of Transportation. Unfortunately, the record \nof the Department of Transportation in submitting reports to the \ncommittee is a poor one.\n  As of this date, the Department of Transportation is overdue in \nsubmitting more than 22 reports to our committee from five different \nagencies within the Department of Transportation. Some of the deadlines \nof these reports date as far back as December 1995.\n  This provision, frankly, is an insult. What our highway safety agenda \nneeds is not more reports, it needs real improvements in the safety of \nthe vehicles and drivers moving 18-wheelers across our country.\n  That observation is not only applicable to Mexican drivers, it is \napplicable to United States drivers and Canadian drivers as well. All \nthe reports in the world are not going to improve the condition of \nhighway safety in the United States.\n  What we need are firm mandates like those adopted by the \nAppropriations Committee to ensure that critical safety measures are in \nplace before we face an influx of Mexican trucks that we are not ready \nfor.\n  The provisions in the committee bill must not be watered down. The \ncommittee provisions won't stop trade across our border. But they will \nstop unsafe drivers and unsafe trucks from threatening the American \npublic. These provisions must not be weakened.\n  Under our bill, when you are driving on the highway and there's an \n18-wheeler with a Mexican license plate in front of you, you can feel \nsafe.\n  You will know that the truck was inspected.\n  You will know that the company has a good track record.\n  You will know that an American inspector visited their facility--on \nsite--and examined their records--just like we do with Canadian \ntrucking firms.\n  You will know that the driver is licensed and insured.\n  You will know that the truck was weighed and is safe for our roads \nand bridges.\n  You will know that we're keeping track of which companies and which \ndrivers are following our laws and which ones are not.\n  You will know that, if a driver is breaking our laws, his license \nwill be revoked.\n  You will know that the truck didn't just cross our border unchecked, \nbut crossed where there were inspectors on duty--ensuring our safety.\n  That is a real safety program. That program must not be watered down, \nweakened, or gutted, as is proposed by the McCain-Gramm amendment.\n  Mr. President, the committee bill is a solid compromise. It will \nallow robust trade--while ensuring the safety of our highways. I urge \nall Members to reject this effort to weaken the committee bill and \nendanger lives on our highways.\n\n\n                     woodrow wilson memorial bridge\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today to engage in a short colloquy \nwith Virginia's Senior Senator, Senator Warner; Senators Mikulski and \nSarbanes from Maryland; Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee \nchair, Senator Murray and ranking member, Senator Shelby regarding the \nWoodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge was \ncompleted in 1961 and carries more than 200,000 vehicles per day--far \nexceeding the 75,000 vehicle per day design. It is the Nation's only \nfederally owned bridge. Newspaper accounts from 1994 cited the fact \nthat the deteriorating condition of the bridge and its inadequate \nnumber of lanes has contributed to accident rates twice those of other \nsegments of the Capital Beltway.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, last year after years of negotiating, \nCongress was able to reach a compromise to finally replace this \ndilapidated bridge. We were able to work with our colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle, from Maryland, and from the House to make certain \nthis much needed replacement project was fully funded. This decision by \nCongress demonstrates the strong commitment by the United States Senate \nto provide all our citizens a flexible, safe, and efficient interstate \nhighway system.\n  This year, the administration and the House of Representatives have \ndemonstrated their support of this project as the President requested \n$28.2 million and the House allocated $29.5 million for Fiscal Year \n2002. However, the Senate FY2002 Transportation appropriations bill \ndoes not address funding for the Wilson Bridge, placing this project in \njeopardy.\n  Mr. President, the unique nature of this roadway as a federally owned \nbridge, its importance to the Capital region, and the surrounding mid-\nAtlantic region, demands that we restore these funds.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, in working with the Senators from \nWashington and Alabama, it is our understanding that they intend to \nwork with the conferees to retain funding at the House level. Because \nof the Federal Government's ownership, the Woodrow Wilson Bridge \ncontinues to be a priority legislative issue for me and for my Senate \ncolleagues. Accordingly, this appropriation will help keep the\n\n[[Page S8528]]\n\nreplacement project on pace and maintain the safety of the current \nbridge in the interim.\n  Ms. MURRAY. Mr. President, I understand the importance of the Wilson \nBridge for the eastern coastal region. I can assure the Senators from \nVirginia and Maryland that Senator Shelby and I will keep their views \nin mind when the bill goes to conference.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I agree, Mr. President, on the importance of the Federal \nGovernment's role in maintaining a safe interstate highway system and \nwill work with the chairwoman and other interested Senators to fulfill \nthe federal commitment and maintain the interstate.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I thank the Transportation Appropriations \nchair and ranking member for their willingness to work with us on this \nissue and for their leadership in crafting a bill that increases \ntransportation funding across the entire country. I also thank my \ncolleagues from Maryland and Senator Warner for their continued \nrepresentation and leadership for the people of the region and America. \nWe look forward to completing the much-needed Woodrow Wilson Memorial \nBridge replacement and closing the debate on the bill permanently.\n\n\n                            florida projects\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, the report language that \naccompanies the fiscal year 2002 Transportation Appropriations bill \nidentifies many worthy projects that the committee recommends be funded \nby the Department of Transportation. I thank the chairwoman for her and \nthe committee's support of projects in Florida that were requested by \nSenator Graham and myself. However, many other worthwhile projects were \nnot included on this list. It is my understanding that the report \nlanguage is intended to guide conferees in setting the final spending \nmeasure, but does not preclude other projects from also being \nconsidered for inclusion. Is this correct?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Florida is correct. The committee \nendorses the projects included in the bill's report, and will press for \nthe adoption of that list in conference on this bill. However, the \nlimited nature of that list does not prevent other projects from being \nsupported during conference, should available resources be found.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Senator for that clarification. \nThe bill before us makes the best of a difficult situation by spreading \nlimited funds over as many worthwhile transportation programs and \nprojects as possible. I believe the committee has worked diligently to \nsupport a great number of projects in spite of limited resources. I \nfurther understand that if additional resources cannot be found, it \nmight be possible to redistribute funds over a more diverse list of \nworthwhile recipients than is currently outlined in the Committee's \nreport. Specifically, there are two counties in Florida, Brevard County \nand Polk County, that are deserving of federal funds for bus \nacquisition, which were unfortunately not included in either the House \nor Senate reports. I understand that the Senator from Washington may be \nable to work with conferees to see that these counties receive some \nfederal funds for bus and bus facilities, either by finding additional \nresources or by reallocating funds within this account. Is this \ncorrect?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I will be happy to work with you to address these \nconcerns as the Transportation bill moves through the process.\n  Mr. NELSON. I thank the distinguished Senator. I appreciate your \nsupport and that of your staff on this issue, and look forward to \nworking with you.\n\n\n           asr-9 airport radar service life extension program\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the \nAppropriations Committee has recommended an increase of $10M above the \nFAA's $12.8M budget request to expedite the ASR-9 service life \nextension program. Unfortunately, the House Transportation bill failed \nto provide an increase in funding for this critical program.\n  I have been advised that major portions of the ASR-9 radar processor \nwill be unsupportable within 2 years. The supply of various critical \nspare parts--which are no longer manufactured by various commercial \nsuppliers--is nearing a critical stage. When the supply of these parts \nrun out, we run the risk of dangerous radar outages at 125 of our \ncountries busiest airports.\n  I am particularly concerned that if this $10 million of additional \nfunding is not preserved in conference, delays in program startup will \nprevent the insertion of new technology in time to avoid potential \nradar outages.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Let me say to the Senator from Maryland that we will \nkeep her concerns in mind as the Transportation bill moves through \nconference.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the chairwoman for her leadership on this issue \nand look forward to working with you on this important issue.\n\n\n                        transportation research\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to spend just a few minutes \ntoday discussing two existing transportation research programs with the \nchairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, my friend \nSenator Murray. Is the distinguished chairman aware of the existing New \nMexico Road Lifecycle Innovative Financing and Evaluation (RoadLIFE) \nprogram at the Federal Highway Administration and the National \nTransportation Network Analysis Capability (NTNAC) program funded \nthrough the Department's Transportation Planning, Research and \nDevelopment Program?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Yes, I am aware of these two valuable programs in the \nDepartment of Transportation and appreciate the opportunity to discuss \nthem with you.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The ongoing RoadLIFE program is a partnership between \nFHWA, the State of New Mexico, and several universities to demonstrate \nthe possible benefits of innovate financing methods, such as Grant \nAnticipation Revenue Vehicle (GARVEE), and performance warranties on \nhighway safety, road quality and on the long-term costs to maintain a \nhighway. Last year, the Department announced a 20-year research \nagreement between the Department, the Volpe Center and the State of New \nMexico to validate the cost savings to the government of these \ninnovative funding approaches. Does the chairman agree that this study \ncould provide valuable information that could change the future of road \nbuilding in America?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from New Mexico, is correct. The RoadLIFE \nprogram could be a valuable effort not only to New Mexico, but to all \nstates that are interested in using innovative highway financing \nmethods.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The State of New Mexico will continue to shoulder most \nof the costs associated with the RoadLIFE research initiative and the \nFHWA has been an essential and valued partner in the development and \nimplementation of the innovative approaches to financing and warranties \nbeing tested in New Mexico. Does the chairman join me in encouraging \nthe FHWA and Volpe Center to give priority consideration to continuing \nto provide staff and financial support to the RoadLIFE program to \nensure that the results will be useful to the Nation?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Yes, I agree, the Department should give priority \nconsideration to continuing of this important project.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The National Transportation Network Analysis Capability \n(NTNAC) is being developed to simulate the operation of the national \ntransportation system, including individual modes--trucks, trains, \nplanes, waterborne vessels--and the transportation infrastructure used \nby these carriers. Based on the technology underlying the successful \nTRANSIMS model, NTNAC is a simulation that will view the national \ntransportation infrastructure as a single, integrated system. Los \nAlamos National Laboratory is the lead technical agency for this \neffort. Does the chairman agree that NTNAC could provide the DOT with \nnew capabilities to assess and formulate critical policy and investment \noptions that take into account transportation economics, modes, public \nsafety, and environmental concerns, as well as infrastructure \nrequirements and vulnerabilities?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Yes, I agree that this ongoing effort could provide DOT \nan\n\n[[Page S8529]]\n\nimportant tool to assess the consequences of transportation policies \nbefore they are implemented.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Prior efforts on NTNAC have demonstrated the capability \nto model nation-wide freight transportation and provided valuable \nanalytical insights into the nation's freight and transportation \nsystem. For example, NTNAC is currently capable of simulating the \nmovement of millions of trucks across the nation's highway network from \npoint-of-origin to final destination. Does the chairman agree that the \nDepartment of Transportation should give priority consideration to \nproviding additional funding in fiscal year 2002 to extend and \nconsolidate these achievements and to move towards a full-scale \ndevelopment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I agree, the Department should give priority \nconsideration to continuing the NTNAC project under the Transportation \nPlanning, Research and Development Program.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the distinguished chairman for her fine work on \nthis bill and for this opportunity to discuss these two important \nresearch programs in New Mexico.\n\n\n                            AIRLINE INDUSTRY\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. I would like to take a moment to talk about a \ntransportation issue that is very much on the mind of many Americans as \nwe head into the busy summer travel season. That issue is potentially \nunfair and deceptive practices in the airline industry. My good friend \nand Pacific Northwest colleague, Senator Murray, has heard me talk \nabout this before, in the context of pushing for passenger rights \nlegislation. But today, I would like to talk briefly about a small step \nthe government could take without enacting any new legislation. It \nwouldn't solve all the problems, but I think it would be a step in the \nright direction.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Senator Wyden has certainly been a leading and forceful \nvoice for consumer protections in the airline industry. So I would be \nhappy to hear his idea on this subject.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Senator, both for this opportunity and for all \nher hard work and leadership in crafting an excellent Transportation \nappropriations bill. The bill will do a great deal for all types of \ntransportation in this country, including aviation. She has served the \npublic well, as she has done throughout her service here in Congress.\n  But as the Senator knows, airline travelers are frustrated. In the \nlast five years, delays, cancellations, and consumer complaints have \nall risen dramatically. Earlier this year, the DOT inspector general \nreported that ``the aviation system is not working well.''\n  Part of the problem is insufficient capacity. That is why I support \nefforts to increase capacity by building more runways and improving air \ntraffic control. It is also why Senator Murray's efforts on the \naviation portions of this year's are so appreciated.\n  At the same time, part of the problem is that there isn't enough \ncompetition. Airlines too often treat consumers in ways that would not \nbe tolerated for long in other industries--and the airlines get away \nwith it because passengers have limited choices for air travel.\n  The Department of Transportation is charged with protecting consumers \nagainst airlines that engage in ``unfair and deceptive'' practices. But \nthe truth is, the Department of Transportation is not primarily a \nconsumer protection agency. It has limited resources for this task, and \nlimited experience with ``unfair and deceptive'' practice enforcement.\n  The agency with the most expertise in this area is the Federal Trade \nCommission. Protecting consumers against unfair and deceptive practices \nis the FTC's bread and butter. Under existing law, the FTC cannot \ntake enforcement actions against airlines. And I am not proposing to \nchange that.\n\n  However, while the FTC has no enforcement authority over airlines, \nnothing prevents it from studying and reporting on unfair practices in \nthe airline industry. I believe the FTC could do a real service to the \nflying public by providing some much needed expert analysis of arguably \nunfair practices in the airline industry.\n  For example, I think it would be very illuminating for the FTC to \ntake a look at whether airlines tend to cancel flights simply because \nthey are not sufficiently full. A movie theater doesn't cancel the 3:00 \nmatinee just because only a handful of people show up. But does this \nhappen in the airline industry? The FTC, with its strong economic and \ninvestigatory staff, would be in an excellent position to get to the \nbottom of this issue.\n  Let me be clear. I am not in a position to tell the FTC what to do. \nAnd I am not proposing to impose new requirements on them through \nlegislation. I am simply saying that if the FTC chose to look into \nthis, I think its conclusions would carry a lot of weight. In my \nopinion, the FTC's involvement here, on a purely investigatory basis, \ncould make an important contribution to our understanding of what goes \non in the airline industry.\n  I think there is that potential. To do any really serious analysis, \nthe FTC would need cooperation from the Department of Transportation \nfor important data and statistics. Clearly, the sharing of data would \nbe more efficient and cost effective than having the FTC try to \nduplicate all the extensive data gathering that the Department of \nTransportation has already done.\n  My fear is that everything could get bogged down in institutional \njealousies and jurisdictional squabbles. If the Department of \nTransportation chose not to cooperate, the FTC's effort would be slowed \ntremendously or even stalled entirely.\n  The good news is, I don't see any legitimate reason why the \nDepartment of Transportation shouldn't cooperate. As chair of the \nTransportation Appropriations Subcommittee, is the Senator aware of \nanything in this year's funding bill or in any other law governing the \nDepartment that would prevent it from cooperating, in the event that \nFTC chose to pursue one or more airline-related investigations?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. No, I agree with the Senator that the Department of \nTransportation would be free to cooperate.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I appreciate that response, and I heartily agree. If I \ncould just briefly sum up my point here, it is that if the FTC decides \nto investigate airline practices--which it can already do under current \nlaw--I believe it could do an important service. And I wouldn't want \nlack of cooperation from the Department of Transportation to stand in \nthe way.\n  I thank my friend from Washington for her attention.\n\n\n                  approach lighting system improvement\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am pleased to see that the Senate \nTransportation appropriations bill has included a provision which makes \n$33,331,000 available for the Approach Lighting System Improvement \nProgram (ALSIP). I thank my colleague from Washington, the chair of the \nSubcommittee, Mrs. Murray for her help in securing this funding.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is correct, $33,331,000 is available for \nALSIP.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The language on page 51 of the Senate Report (107-38) \ndoes not specify that the funding that is made available is provided \nboth for the installation of the previously purchased medium approach \nlighting systems with runway alignment indicator lights (MALSR) and for \nfuture procurement, so as to keep the production line operational. I \nwould like to ask for clarification: is money in this account to be \nused both for installation and procurement?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Yes, that is correct.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I hope that language to this effect can be included in \nthe conference report.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I will look to clarify this in the final language.\n\n\n   section 315 (gp) and air traffic congestion in the chicago region\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I believe the chairwoman and ranking member \nare aware of the air traffic congestion and capacity issues facing the \nChicago area. Not only are these important issues for the national \naviation system, but for the greater Chicagoland area as well. I thank \nthe chairwoman and the ranking member for the attention given to this \nregional and national dilemma.\n  As you know, the Chicago area desperately needs additional airport \ncapacity. I believe the Gary/Chicago Airport is capable of immediately \nproviding the capacity needed to relieve Chicago's O'Hare and Midway \nAirports. I continue my longstanding support for the Gary/Chicago \nAirport as an integral part of the solution to meet the air traffic \nneeds of the region.\n  I am working closely with my colleagues Senator Lugar, Congressman \nVisclosky in the House of Representatives, Indiana Governor Frank\n\n[[Page S8530]]\n\nO'Bannon, and with local officials in Indiana to ensure that the Gary/\nChicago Airport is included in any discussions at the federal level \nabout how to relieve air traffic congestion in the Chicago region.\n  Section 315 (General Provisions) requires the Secretary of \nTransportation to work with the Federal Aviation Administrator (FAA) to \nencourage a locally developed and executed plan between the State of \nIllinois, the City of Chicago, and affected communities for the purpose \nof modernizing O'Hare International Airport. It is my hope that any \ndiscussions in Congress, at the FAA, or elsewhere, include Indiana and \nthe Gary/Chicago Airport as a part of the solution to this crisis.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I appreciate the attention the \nAppropriations Committee has given to this important issue. I join with \nmy colleague from Indiana Senator Bayh in sharing with the committee \nour thoughts about section 315 of the bill. I hope the committee will \nbe mindful of our strong interest in this issue, and that we believe \nIndiana should be specifically listed and included in any matters or \ndiscussions relating to federal proposals or legislation intended to \nrelieve air traffic in the Chicago region.\n  The Chicago region needs additional airport capacity and some of this \ncapacity can be accommodated at the Gary/Chicago Airport. Throughout my \nservice in the Senate, I have been a strong supporter of the Gary/\nChicago Airport as a viable part of the solution that will help meet \nthe current pressing air traffic needs of the region.\n  Earlier this year, the Gary Airport submitted to the FAA a draft of \nits phase II20-year master plan/airport layout plan. This effort \nproposes an expansion of existing airport facilities, including \nnavigational improvements, runway extensions and construction of \nparallel runway. I strongly support the airport's plan for future \ngrowth and believe this master plan is an essential part of the \nsolution to helping relieve air traffic congestion now and in the long \nterm. It is especially important to keep in mind that the Gary/Chicago \nAirport today is an active, fully operational aviation facility with a \n7,000 foot main runway and a crosswind runway that can help provide \nimmediate relief to the problem of aviation congestion in the Chicago \nregion.\n  On June 12, I hosted a meeting in Washington with Transportation \nSecretary Mineta and was joined by my colleagues Senator Bayh and \nRepresentative Visclosky, along with Indiana Governor O'Bannon and Gary \nMayor King. During this productive and positive meeting, we emphasized \nto Transportation Secretary Mineta our strong and unified support for \nthe master plan/ALP submitted by the Gary/Chicago Airport that is \ncurrently being evaluated by the FAA. We specifically requested \nSecretary Mineta's assistance in ensuring that Gary's master plan/ALP \nreceive full and fair consideration, and that the FAA work to expedite \ntheir consideration of Gary's plan. We hope Gary's master plan/ALP will \nbe approved by the FAA this year.\n  The problem of air congestion in the Chicago region and the urgent \nneed for relief should be national priorities. I believe that existing, \noperating, regional airport facilities such as the Gary/Chicago Airport \nshould be included as part of both short-term and long-term solutions \nto this aviation safety and public transportation challenge. I wish to \nthank the chairwoman and ranking member for their attention to our \nconcerns about this important matter.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the committee is aware of the Senator's \nstrong interest in making sure that Indiana is a part of these \nimportant discussions, and the committee agrees that the Gary/Chicago \nAirport should be specifically included as part of federal \ndeliberations concerning air traffic congestion in the Chicago region.\n\n\n                        san bernardino metrolink\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise with the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee to discuss a \ntransportation infrastructure project that is of great importance to \nthe southern California region.\n  I want to first, however, thank Chairman Murray and Senator Shelby \nfor their outstanding work on this bill. The fiscal year 2002 \nTransportation Appropriations bill provides appropriations for \nimportant transportation and transit projects in the State of \nCalifornia and the rest of the nation. The transportation needs in \nCalifornia alone are tremendous. I understand the difficulty you faced \nin trying to meet as many of these needs as possible under tight budget \nconstraints.\n  I am concerned, however, that this is an important California project \nthat was not funded--the Metrolink's double track project on the San \nBernardino line.\n  Mr. SHELBY. The committee is aware of this project. It is my \nunderstanding that as one of the fastest growing commuter rail systems \nin the country, Metrolink is integral to the commuting requirements of \nthe citizens of the Los Angeles basin. It provides service to Orange, \nRiverside, San Bernardino, Los Angeles, Ventura, and San Diego \nCounties.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Metrolink has received appropriations in each of the \npast 2 fiscal years. A local match of 70 percent is already in place, \nrepresenting a substantial local and state commitment to the project. I \nunderstand the Senator from California's concern over this project and \nI will continue to work with her to try to determine whether funding \ncan be made available for this project.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the chairman and ranking member for their \nunderstanding and willingness to work with me on this project. The \nMetrolink system is quickly reaching capacity. With continued federal \nsupport, it will be able to meet the growing demands for its service, \nwhile reducing congestion and improving the air quality of southern \nCalifornia.\n\n\n funding to improve the highway system of aroostook county in northern \n                                 maine\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the chairman and ranking member of the \nSubcommittee on Transportation Appropriations for providing needed \nfunding for projects of great importance to Maine. My senior colleague \nfrom our great State and I would like to engage you in a brief colloquy \nabout one such project--the improvement of the highway system in \nnorthern Maine. The Senate report accompanying the fiscal year 2002 \nTransportation appropriations bill sets aside $6 million to help us \nmove forward extending Maine's highway system beyond the termination \npoint of Interstate 95 in Houlton. Having been born and raised in \nnorthern Maine I can tell you first hand about the critical importance \nto that region's economy of improving the highway system of Aroostook \nCounty.\n  Ms. SNOWE. As Senator Collins expressed, your efforts on behalf of \nour State are deeply appreciated. We are committed to improving the \nhighway system in Aroostook County and therefore welcome your support \nfor this project. Interstate 95's current termination point is more \nthan one hundred miles away from Maine's northern-most communities, \nwhich inhibits their ability to interact and to transact with the rest \nof the State and beyond.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. We are well aware of the importance of this project to \nthe State of Maine and are pleased to provide support.\n  Ms. COLLINS. We would respectfully ask that you make every effort to \nretain the $6 million earmark in the conference on your bill with the \nHouse of Representatives, so that these funds can be used next year to \ncover engineering, construction, and planning costs associated with \nenhancing the highway system in northern Maine.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I can assure you that I will keep your concerns in mind \nas we go to conference with the House.\n  Mr. SHELBY. And I provide you similar assurances of support for your \nproject, as you have described it, during the conference on the \nTransportation appropriations bill.\n  Ms. SNOWE. We very much appreciate your willingness to advocate on \nour behalf, and on behalf of our State. The $6 million will be a \ncritical down-payment on this ambitious project.\n\n\n                Northstar Corridor Commuter Rail Project\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with my \ndistinguished colleague from Washington, the chairwoman of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Transportation. The purpose is to \ndiscuss an important initiative in the State of Minnesota, the \nNorthstar Corridor. I would also like to thank the chairwoman and the \nsubcommittee for providing funding to support several projects in my\n\n[[Page S8531]]\n\nstate including the Hiawatha Corridor, the Minnesota Valley Regional \nRail Authority, the Phalen Boulevard, Trunk Highway 610/10, as well as \nbus procurement for the Metro Transit and Greater Minnesota Transit \nAuthorities.\n  As my colleague knows, many regions of our country are experiencing \nsignificant growth. This is true for the Twin Cities Metropolitan area \nin Minnesota. In order to help commuters and reduce congestion in the \nNorth metro area, the Northstar Corridor project has been undertaken by \nlocal authorities to provide commuter rail service between Minneapolis \nand St. Cloud. This project is one of the corridors included in the \ncomprehensive Twin Cities Transitways Project to provide much needed \nlight rail and commuter rail services in the region.\n  Specifically, the Northstar Corridor, which was authorized in TEA-21, \nwill provide a direct connection between two major regional centers for \nbusiness, education and health care. The 80-mile commuter rail line \nwill operate on existing BNSF track. The Northstar Corridor has been \nidentified by both the Minnesota Department of Transportation and the \nTwin Cities Metropolitan Council as the highest priority corridor for \nimplementation of commuter rail in the state. While the bill before us \ncontains significant funding for new start construction projects under \nthe jurisdiction of the Federal Transit Authority, including the \nHiawatha light rail corridor in Minneapolis, funding was not included \nfor the Northstar Corridor. However, H.R. 2299 does include $10 million \nfor the Northstar Corridor. This funding will support right of way \nacquisition, final design and engineering of stations, vehicles, \ncapacity improvements to existing track and maintenance facility. I \nwould seek my colleague's assurance that during consideration of the \nconference report on the FY 2002 Department of Transportation \nappropriations bill, that she would be supportive of the Northstar \nCorridor commuter rail project.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am aware of the Twin cities Transitways Project and I \nam pleased that this bill includes $50 million to support the Hiawatha \nCorridor. While the subcommittee was unable to provide funding for the \nNorthstar Corridor initiative, we will give that project consideration \nwhen we go to the conference committee with the House on the FY 2002 \nDepartment of Transportation Appropriations bill.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague for her work as chairwoman and \nfor her support for the Northstar Corridor.\n\n\n                         michigan itcs project\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with the \ndistinguished chairwoman of the Transportation Appropriations \nSubcommittee. As the chairwoman knows, since Fiscal Year 1996, the \nCongress has appropriated a total of $13 million for the Michigan \nIncremental Train Control System (ITCS) Project, a public--private \npartnership to develop, test, prove and demonstrate an advanced \npositive train control system on a portion of the Detroit--Chicago rail \ncorridor between Kalamazoo and Porter, Michigan to provide high speed \nrail operations. The Michigan ITCS project focuses on upgrading the \nexisting wayside signal system to facilitate passenger train speeds in \nexcess of 80 miles per hour, while still controlling freight trains \nthat move at slower speeds.\n  The administration's Fiscal Year 2002 DOT Budget proposal provides \nthat $3 million of funding provided for ``high speed train control \nsystems'' under the Next Generation High Speed Rail Program be \nallocated to the Michigan ITCS Project, which is entering its final \nphase. In the bill before us, a total of $11 million is provided for \n``high speed train control systems'' with $5 million of those funds \nallocated to a PTC project in Wisconsin. Mr. President, I ask \ndistinguished chairwoman to give this important project consideration \nin conference, and provide $3 million for the final phase of Michigan \nITCS project, consistent with the administration's budget request. Any \nconsideration that the distinguished chairwoman can provide is much \nappreciated.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Michigan in urging \nyou to give this worthy project consideration in conference. The \nDetroit-Chicago Corridor has been designated as one of only ten high-\nspeed rail corridors in the nation. In order to make that designation a \nreality we must develop the necessary technology to allow high-speed \nrail to operate safely on existing infrastructure. That means \ncompleting the development of an effective train control system. This \nproject, as a public-private partnership, has had the ongoing \nparticipation and support from the State of Michigan, the Federal \nRailroad Administration, Amtrak and Harmon Industries, the company \ndeveloping the technology. It also has the support of Michigan's two \nSenators and I hope we can find a way to continue Federal support for \nthis project.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senators from \nMichigan, and I will be happy to work with her in conference on this \nimportant Michigan ITCS project.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the distinguished chairwoman of the \nsubcommittee.\n\n\n                     federal highway administration\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I wish to engage the esteemed Chair of \nthe Senate Transportation Subcommittee in a brief colloquy regarding a \nrecent Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) interpretative memorandum.\n  FHWA, in response to a legitimate concern about maintaining the \nuniformity of the signs on our nation's highways, has issued a \nmemorandum proscribing restrictions for the text of signs used in state \nAdopt-A-Highway programs.\n  FHWA's intention, I believe, is a good one--to prevent the \ncommercialization of our nation's relatively uniform interstate highway \nsigns. It might amuse my colleague's to know that uniformity is the \nresult of very serious tome entitled the Manual on Uniform Traffic \nControl Devices, or ``MUCTDA'' as some call it.\n  Despite its funny name, MUCTDA represents sound public policy. Since \nthe inception of Adopt-A-Highway programs, several participating states \nhave referred to MUCTDA's section 2D-47, when trying to determine how \nto appropriately recognize the roadway sponsor on Adopt-A-Highway \nsigns.\n  This section states that ``messages, symbols, and trademarks that \nresemble any official traffic control device shall not be used on \nAdopt-A-Highway signs.'' This implies that other logos which do not \nresemble official traffic control devices are acceptable.\n  The recent interpretive memorandum, however, says that all logos \nconstitute advertising and, as such, Adopt-A-Highway signs with any \nlogos must come down.\n  This is extremely problematic for New York, which has awarded over \n$26 million in Adopt-A-Highway contracts since 1996. Without the \nability to post any logos, both corporate and non-corporate sponsors \nwill end their involvement. This could undermine a great deal of \nprogress we have made in keeping New York's roadways clean and safe.\n  In short, this interpretive memorandum could completely hobble the \nAdopt-A-Highway program in my state and in others, which I am sure is \nnot FHWA's intent.\n  I am not trying to block FHWA from proscribing regulations pertaining \nto Adopt-A-Highway signage, but I do believe that the affected states \nshould be consulted first because so much revenue for maintaining \nhighways is at stake.\n  As the Senator prepares for conference committee deliberations I hope \nshe will agree that FHWA has an obligation to work with the affected \nstates to find some resolution to this Adopt-A-Highway signage issue \nbecause this interpretative memorandum appears to change FHWA's policy \nat mid-course.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I agree with the Senator from New York that FHWA should \nengage the state transportation departments to find some resolution \nthat provides for a uniform national policy without, if possible, \nunnecessarily jeopardizing existing Adopt-A-Highway contracts.\n\n\n                       new starts transit program\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to highlight the fact that \nthe bill pending before us provides an additional $100 million for the \nNew Starts transit program above the amount guaranteed in the \nTransportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21).\n\n[[Page S8532]]\n\nThis is a critically important investment in our nation's \ntransportation infrastructure which will ultimately provide more \ntransportation options for all Americans.\n  All across the country, congestion and gridlock are taking their toll \nin terms of economic loss, environmental impacts, and personal \nfrustration. According to the Texas Transportation Institute, in 1999, \nAmericans in 68 urban areas spent 4.5 billion hours stuck in traffic, \nwith an estimated cost to the nation of $78 billion in lost time and \nwasted fuel. And the problem is growing.\n  In response, Americans are searching for alternatives. According to \nthe American Public Transportation Association, Americans took over 9.4 \nbillion trips on transit in 2000--the highest level in 40 years. In \nfact, over the past five years, transit ridership has increased by 21 \npercent, growing more than four times faster than the U.S. population. \nOver 200 communities around the country, in urban, suburban, and rural \nareas, are considering light rail or other fixed guideway transit \ninvestments to meet their growing transportation needs.\n  When Congress passed TEA-21 in 1998, we made a significant commitment \nto supporting communities' public transportation investments. TEA-21 \nauthorized almost $8.2 billion over six years to fund new rail \nprojects; $6 billion of that amount was guaranteed.\n  In the years since TEA-21's passage, it has become clear that \ncommunities' need for New Starts funding has grown even faster than \nanticipated in 1998. Yet the program has consistently been funded only \nat the guaranteed level, leaving the remaining authorization \nunutilized. Now, for the first time, the Appropriations Committee has \nprovided funding for New Starts above the amount guaranteed by TEA-21, \nappropriating $100 million of the $430 million non-guaranteed \nauthorization. I commend the Committee for taking this step toward \naddressing the growing need for transit funds within TEA-21's statutory \nframework.\n  Increased investment in transit will ultimately benefit all \nAmericans. For example, as cities and towns across America are \ndiscovering, public transit can stimulate the economic life of any \ncommunity. Studies have shown that a nearby transit station increases \nthe value of local businesses and real estate. Increased property \nvalues mean more tax revenues to states and local jurisdictions; new \nbusiness development around a transit station means more jobs. \nMoreover, I believe the potential of mass transit to help address our \nnation's current energy crunch has been consistently overlooked. With \ngas prices soaring and congestion increasing, public transit offers one \nof the best solutions to America's growing pains.\n  I am gratified to see that the Appropriations Committee has \nrecognized the strong demand for transit in communities across the \ncountry by funding the New Starts program above the guaranteed level. \nThis is an important first step toward addressing America's long-term \ntransportation needs.\n\n\n                 PORTS TO PLAINS HIGH PRIORITY CORRIDOR\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to briefly engage the \nChairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Transportation Appropriations \nSubcommittee on a transportation issue important to the State of \nColorado.\n  The Ports to Plains High Priority Corridor is a most pressing issue \nfor my state, however, I have concerns about language currently in the \nTransportation Appropriations bill. As it stands, the bill contains a \n$1 million feasibility study for a section of the corridor on US 64/87 \nin New Mexico.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I would say to the Senator from Colorado that I am \ncertainly aware of the issues surrounding the Ports to Plains corridor \nand I understand his concerns.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I appreciate that. As the Senator knows the states of \nTexas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Colorado have been engaged for several \nyears now in determining the best route for this TEA-21 authorized \ntrade corridor. Just last week, the Colorado Transportation Commission \nvoted unanimously for designation of the Eastern Colorado route from \nthe Oklahoma panhandle to Denver via US 287. A feasibility study for a \nNew Mexico section of this route would clearly send a signal that \nCongress intends to legislate that the corridor be routed up Interstate \n25 into Denver.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would like to add a similar resolution passed by the \nOklahoma Transportation Commission also supports US 287 as the \npreferred route to Denver, CO. I think it should also be noted that the \nTexas Department of Transportation has indicated that it would defer to \nColorado to negotiate the alignment of the northern section of the \ncorridor. I share the concerns of the Senator from Colorado about a New \nMexico feasibility study.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his support. We \nunderstand the wishes of our friends in New Mexico. However, we feel \nthat the overwhelming support for the US 287 route coupled with the \nmassive opposition in Colorado to encouraging any further traffic on \nInterstate 25 simply needs to be heard. Further, the existence of the \nCamino Real High Priority Corridor on Interstate 25 should be taken \ninto account--allowing another High Priority Corridor on already-\ncongested Interstate 25 just doesn't make sense. It should be noted \nthat many of the high population centers along Interstate 25 south of \nDenver have made their opposition to the corridor well known. Those \nalong US 287 in Eastern Colorado have made their support equally as \nwell known.\n  In fact, just this week, the four states got together one more time \nand have been able to iron out a compromise that accommodates all \nparties. Allowing this feasibility study to stay in the bill would \nfurther complicate and delay a process that is clearly working.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I would say to the Senators from Colorado and Oklahoma \nthat I am certainly aware of the actions of the states on this and I \nwould agree that their views are of utmost importance in any final \ndesignation. I would share with the Senators that I am hesitant for the \nCongress to designate routes when the process among the States to \ndetermine the corridor's working toward conclusion.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I would agree with the distinguished Ranking Member and \nI agree that we will need to address this in the joint Senate-House \nConference Committee.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I would concur with the Chairman and would say that it is \nmy intent as well to minimize or eliminate Congressional involvement in \nthis issue at this time.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senators for their interest in working with \nus on this issue. I look forward to the conference committee's outcome.\n\n\n                   air traffic instructional services\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, the Federal Aviation Administration \noperates a critical program of proficiency and developmental training \nfor air traffic controllers. It has been demonstrated that this \ntraining reduces operational errors and makes the skies safer for the \nflying public. Over the past several years the Senate Transportation \nAppropriations Subcommittee has required that the Federal Aviation \nAdministration spend its appropriated funds on the Air Traffic \nInstructional Services, or ATIS, program and not reprogram these funds \nto other accounts without approval of the subcommittee. This has worked \nwell in the past and has insured proper expenditure of these funds.\n  I hope this support for the ATIS program will continue in fiscal year \n2002. Is it your understanding that the operational account of the FAA \nfully funds the budget request for the ATIS program? Do you agree that \nthese funds are to be spent only on this account unless expressly \napproved by the Subcommittee?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I appreciate the opportunity to address this matter. It \nis my intention to continue to press for full funding of the ATIS \nprogram in conference committee deliberations with the House. It should \nalso be known that the subcommittee believes that full funding for ATIS \nis critical to the safety of our airways and that any reprogramming by \nthe FAA should be done only after consultation with the subcommittee.\n\n\n                    tennessee public transportation\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nthank the Chairwoman and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on \nTransportation Appropriations for their efforts in securing the 5309 \nappropriations for public transportation in our state of Tennessee. Our \nstate's public transit\n\n[[Page S8533]]\n\nprograms historically have not received the necessary federal funding \ncritical to supply invaluable services to the people of Tennessee. Our \nstate is one of only five in the nation that provides public \ntransportation to citizens in each county, with eleven rural and twelve \nurban transit systems servicing all 95 counties. To fund this effort \nand compensate for lower federal funding in recent years, it is my hope \nthat the Conference Committee will recognize that the $12 million \nfunding level recommended by the House is fully justify for public \ntransportation initiatives in Tennessee. I have shared my concerns with \nSenators Murray and Shelby about the importance of effective transit \nprograms in a growing state like ours and I hope that my friends will \ndo all that they can to ensure that Tennessee's public transportation \nsystem will be provided $12 million in federal funding when the \nConference Committee convenes. Again let me reiterate my appreciation \nto the Chairwoman and Ranking Member. I look forward to working with \nboth of you on this issue.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I strongly support the words of my good \nfriend and colleague from Tennessee. I, too, would like to thank \nChairwoman Murray and Ranking Member Shelby for their leadership on the \nTransportation Subcommittee. I give my full support to developing \neffective public transportation programs that serve the needs of all \nTennesseans. Our public transit systems have not historically seen the \nlevel of federal support they need to develop properly. As our cities \ngrow and our transportation needs change 279 active urban transit buses \nnow exceed their 12-year useful service life. Additionally, there are \n218 rural transit vans with mileage in excess of the 100,000-mile \nservice life. The $12 million funding level provided in the House will \nimprove public safety and reduce maintenance costs while ensuring that \nan adequate infrastructure is in place to better serve all the counties \nof our growing state. It is my sincere hope that the Conference \nCommittee will restore the full funding level recommended by the House.\n  Mr. FRIST. I would like to echo the sentiment of my friend and \ncolleague and reiterate the need to develop and expand public \ntransportation services in our state. The federal contribution to these \nservices has been low for some time. I look forward to working with the \nConference Committee to act in the interests of those who depend upon \nefficient public transportation by providing the full $12 million, as \nprovided by the House.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank my colleague from Tennessee for his work on \nthis issue of great importance to thousands of our constituents. I \neagerly await with him for action by the Conference Committee.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I have duly noted the concerns of my friends from \nTennessee and look forward to working with them on this issue.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I thank the Senator from Tennessee for raising their \nconcerns and I also will work with my friends from Tennessee to address \ntheir concerns during conference.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank my friends and colleagues. Mr. President, I yield \nthe balance of my time.\n\n\n                     Essential Air Service Program\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the chairman and ranking member of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Transportation for working closely with \nme and Senator Collins on projects of importance to our state, as well \nas critical national priorities. Your efforts are very much \nappreciated. As you know, one issue of great importance to my home \nstate of Maine, as a rural state with many small, remote communities, \nis the U.S. Department of Transportation Essential Air Service--EAS--\nprogram. Air service in rural areas is not simply a luxury, it is an \nimperative. Any municipality or small business owner will tell that \nwithout quality, affordable air service, economic development is \nvirtually impossible. The EAS program is designed to ensure that small \ncommunities that were served by commercial air carriers prior to \nderegulation maintain scheduled air service. Today, the EAS program \nserves over 80 rural communities nationwide. The reality of deregulated \nair service is that four of Maine's six commercial airports--including \nthe State Capital's airport in Augusta--rely on EAS to have any service \nto all. Unfortunately, the Administration has proposed a change in the \neligibility criteria for the program which would result in the \nelimination of air service to a number of rural communities nationwide, \nincluding Augusta.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I would like to express my appreciation to the Chairman \nand Ranking Member of the Subcommittee as well, and would like to add \nto what my colleague from Maine has said regarding the EAS program, \nwhich is so critical in Maine. The EAS program sustains important \neconomic, social, and quality of life benefits for the rural \ncommunities it serves. In Maine's case, Augusta, Maine, the State of \nCapital, would lose air service. Commercial air service in our Capital \nis absolutely crucial. Loss of service would undermine the region's \neconomy and hinder the operation of the State government.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am aware of your concern and I can assure you that \nduring the Senate-House conference on this bill, we will keep your \nviews in mind.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Likewise, I am well aware of your support for the \nprogram, and I know how important it is to rural areas including the \ncommunity of Muscle Shoals, Alabama. I will work with the Chair during \nthe conference to address the concerns you have raised.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you very much. We appreciate your willingness to \naddress this important matter. We look forward to working with you as \nthe appropriations process continues.\n  Mrs. SNOWE. Once again, I would like to thank the Subcommittee for \nits strong support and its willingness to make an effort to address \nissues of concern to rural states like Maine. Thank you both very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the yeas and \nnays on the bill be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on the engrossment of the amendments and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read \na third time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The bill (H.R. 2299), as amended, was passed.\n  (The bill will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, I want to turn to the nomination of John \nWalters, the President's choice for drug czar, who also deserves a \nconfirmation hearing so he can offer his views on how to reduce drug \nabuse in our nation.\n  With all the damage drugs are doing to our children and to adult \nAmericans, why in the world is the Senate dragging its feet on even \nhaving a confirmation hearing for our nation's highest ranking drug \npolicy official?\n  John is uniquely qualified for the job of drug czar.\n  He distinguished himself during the first Bush administration as \nDeputy Director for Supply Reduction, Chief of Staff and National \nSecurity Director, and Acting Director of the Office of National Drug \nControl Policy. During the administration of President Reagan, John \nserved as Chief of Staff and Counselor to the Secretary of Education, \nas well as Assistant to the Secretary, the Secretary's Representative \nto the National Drug Policy Board, and the Secretary's Representative \nto the Domestic Policy Council's Health Policy Working Group.\n  John is currently serving as president of the Philanthropy \nRoundtable, a national association of charitable donors who are doing \ngreat work in our communities. He was previously president of the New \nCitizenship Project, an organization created to promote greater civic \nparticipation in our national life.\n  John also served on the Council on Crime in America, a bipartisan \ncommission on violent crime co-chaired by Bill Bennett and President \nCarter's Attorney General Griffin Bell. And, in 1988, John created the \nMadison Center, a nonprofit organization dedicated to early childhood \neducation and drug abuse prevention.\n  Mr. President, John Walters has now waited almost 2 months for a \nconfirmation hearing. I urge my colleagues to move forward on his \nnomination.\n\n\n  nomination of josefina carbonell to be assistant secretary for aging\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I want to voice my enthusiastic \nsupport for Josefina Carbonell's nomination to be Assistant Secretary \nfor Aging at the Department of Health and Human Services. She has \nserved her community admirably, and is highly respected for her work \nwith the Little Havana Activities and Nutrition Centers of Miami-Dade \nCounty. This is an organization she founded in 1972. Under her \nleadership, it has grown from a one-site project into the largest \naging, health and nutrition program in Florida and the largest Hispanic \ngeriatric health and human service organization in the nation. Today \nLittle Havana operates twenty-one different sites, serving over 55,000 \nregistered clients. The program served over one million meals to 50,000 \nolder Americans in 2000, and now operate six senior centers and three \nadult care centers, and while providing services through numerous \nfederal health-care and employment programs.\n  As a young girl, Ms. Carbonell came to this country from Cuba and \ndedicated her life to serving her community. Her contributions to the \nwell-being of the greater Miami community are well-known, and, I would \nsay some have become legendary.\n  Her many years living and working among South Florida's large senior \npopulation and her direct hands-on experience providing services for \nthese citizens make her a superb choice to be Assistant Secretary for \nAging at the Department of Health and Human Services.\n  In Josefina Carbonell, our seniors will have an outstanding advocate \nin Washington. I look forward to working with her to improve both the \nquality of life for our senior citizens and the services we provide \nthem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/01/senate-section/article/S8534-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent the \nmajority leader may, after consultation with the Republican leader, \nturn to the consideration of the export administration bill, S. 149, \nbut not before September 4, 2001; further, that the Senate now turn to \nthe consideration of H.R. 2620, the VA-HUD appropriations, and Senator \nMikulski be recognized to offer the text of the Senate bill, S. 1216, \nas a substitute amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there is objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, \nbut if I could just have 2 minutes before we go to VA-HUD for some \nfinal cleanup on the Transportation bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Reserving the right to object, could I have 2 minutes \nafter Senator Murray?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask that be part of the unanimous \nconsent request.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, I reserve 2 minutes after \nthe Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I add that one, too.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that immediately following the next rollcall vote, the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider the nomination of Asa \nHutchinson to be Administrator for Drug Enforcement, that there be 30 \nminutes for debate equally divided among Senators\n\n[[Page S8535]]\n\nLeahy, Hatch, and Hutchinson, that at the conclusion of that debate the \nSenate vote on the confirmation of that nomination, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, the President be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action, any statement thereon be printed in \nthe Record, and the Senate return to legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object for two purposes, first of \nall, let me clarify. In the middle of this request it says that there \nbe--is it 10 minutes each for Leahy, Hatch, and Hutchinson, as opposed \nto 2 minutes for debate as has been earlier indicated? You put it at 10 \nminutes each for those 3; is that correct?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is correct, 30 minutes of debate equally divided \namong three Senators, 10 minutes each.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I was going to reserve on behalf of Senator \nThompson, but I see that he is present. I withdraw my reservation so \nSenator Thompson can make this request himself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, reserving right to object, I wanted to \nask whether or not the unanimous consent request covered the \nconsideration of the Export Administration Act.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is correct. The Export Administration Act is \npart of the unanimous consent agreement that we entered into a moment \nago. It allows the majority leader to call up the bill on September 4.\n  I say to my colleagues, and especially to my colleague from \nTennessee, that this is an agreement he and I discussed prior to \nentering into the agreement. It acknowledges that we would have at \nleast 2 full days of debate that would accommodate the interest of the \nSenator from Tennessee in discussing this issue prior to the time I \nwould file a cloture motion. I confirm that for the Record, and fully \nexpect that those 2 full days of debate will be immediately following \nthe time we come back.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, my understanding was that there would be \n2 full days of debate on the bill and amendments. Does the Senator \nstate in the unanimous consent as to when the bill would be taken up? \nWould it be September 4 or is that left open?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I indicated in the unanimous consent \nrequest that it would be at the discretion of the majority leader, but \nwe did list September 4 as the anticipated date for the beginning of \nthe consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, if I may inquire, I believe we also \ndiscussed that the 2 full days--if that be the case--would be September \n5 and 6. Cloture would not be filed before September 7. Is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I have no objection.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I thank the \nmajority leader for his willingness to move a large number of nominees \nforward and to work with Senator Nickles also and Senator Reid to bring \nus the number we have today. I trust that some can move tomorrow out of \ncommittee, and possibly by Friday we will even advance a good many \nmore. But I must tell you that there are others hanging in committee--\nsome that have been there since April and May.\n  I must tell you that I was very frustrated when the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee asked about one nominee in particular and said we \nmight get to him sometime next year. I do not know how to read that \nstatement. But I will tell you, if I read it the way I thought it was \nintended, that is unacceptable. He has not had a hearing. And I know \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee talked about the frustration of \ntiming. But he has been before the committee since May 24.\n  Things change around here substantially. All of us know that and \naccept that. But to suggest that we will not get to one of our \nPresident's important nominees for 1 year nearly after he is nominated, \nif that were to happen, September is going to be a pretty difficult \nmonth around here for all of us. I don't say that as a threat. I don't \nthreaten. We know that. We don't do that in the Senate. But we cannot \naccept those kinds of statements coming from key chairmen of committees \nwho have a responsibility to deal in a timely fashion with these \nnominees. If there is a problem, have the hearing, bring him out and \nvote him down. But don't suggest to him or to the administration that \nsometime next year we will have this happen.\n\n  I was inclined to object. But thanks to Senator Nickles and also \nSenator Reid, and the work done here and the majority leader's \nwillingness to advance it, I will not.\n  But there are other opportunities. There is a very clear timeline to \nget an awful lot of work done in the Senate. I hope I am sending a \nmessage to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee that those kinds of \nstatements and those kinds of actions cannot stand. Most importantly, \nif he chooses that, then vote him down and tell the administration that \nthey have picked the wrong person--or people--and there are other \nnominees or someone who is more acceptable to that chairman and to the \ncommittee and to the Senate as a whole.\n  As you know, I talked to the leader about the pure human side of \nthis. People need to move their kids by August to get them in school. I \nthink the majority leader has been sensitive to that. I mean that most \nsincerely, because the majority leader is moving a large number now, \nand that will allow them time to do what they need to do in the human \nsense.\n  But it will be a real tragedy, if this Senate becomes part of a \nlimiting factor on any administration's ability to bring together its \nteam and execute the responsibility of the executive branch.\n  I have spoken enough. I think my feelings are very clear. I must tell \nyou that there will be an increasingly concerted effort, if those kinds \nof remarks and actions that follow are ones that will not move \nnominees, or give them their day, or vote them down and move on so we \ncan fill these very important decisionmaking positions for our \nGovernment.\n  I will not object. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Idaho. I feel I \nmay need to call an ambulance. I think I just bit off my tongue.\n  I will say in all sincerity that I think he just gave the speech that \nI have repeated probably 25 or 30 times over the last 6 years, \nverbatim. I can't tell you how many people languished for not days or \nweeks but years. But I have said on this floor repeatedly that we will \nnot engage in payback. We will not engage in that kind of practice \nbecause I don't believe in it. But I must say the record so far speaks \nfor itself.\n  Since assuming the majority--and we have only been able to deal with \nnominations since we came back. Prior to that time, we didn't have \nMembers on committees. Since the organizing resolution passed, we have \nheld hearings on 114 Presidential nominees. This last week Democrats \nreported favorably out of committee 17 nominees. In addition, during \nthe 17-day period when Democrats won the majority in January, 13 \nhearings were held on Cabinet level appointees. During the brief time \nsince the organizing resolution was passed, four judicial nominees have \nalready had hearings before the committee, 100 percent more than were \nheld before Senator Leahy became chairman. The majority has already \nconfirmed three judicial nominees. President Bush has been slow to send \nthe necessary documentation on some of the nominees. As of July 24, 34 \npercent of the 132 nominees announced by the administration have not \nhad their paperwork sent to the Senate.\n  I guess my point is that we are trying to accommodate all of those \nnominees whose paperwork has been sent. I think today again \ndemonstrates the sincere desire to continue making progress just as \nquickly as the committees report out their work. We have confirmed 110 \nnominations since taking the majority, with an agreement on one more as \nsoon as Mr. Hutchinson has been confirmed.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, will the leader yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader. I mean this \nmost sincerely. We are about at the status quo between what Republicans \nwere\n\n[[Page S8536]]\n\nable to do and what Democrats were able to do for President Clinton and \nwhat the majority leader is now doing. But I must tell you because the \ngentlemen and/or ladies have languished in these committees since April \nand May and their paperwork was there, there is something amiss.\n  That was my objection. Obviously, the majority leader has now \nexpedited them. We have worked with the majority leader, and I \ncompliment him for that. I think that is important.\n  But if there is a problem, let us not suggest that the gentleman \ndoesn't get heard before next year. Let's send the right message \ninstead of that kind of a statement. If there is a problem, what is the \nproblem? If this person is unacceptable, hold the hearing, vote on him, \nand move him out or move him down.\n  That is my point. We need to get on with the business of allowing our \nPresident to have his people in place to govern. We made a major step, \nand I thank the majority leader for that.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Idaho for his \ncomment. There clearly will be nominees who will face challenges. We \nsee that in the Commerce Committee as we speak. There will be others. \nBut we will do our level best. That does not mean we are going to roll \nover and rubberstamp every nominee who comes forward because that isn't \nwhy we are here.\n  We have an obligation to ask questions, to review the data, and to \nmake a decision. We are going to do that. But to whatever extent \npossible, we are going to be fair, and we are not going to reciprocate, \neven though I must say there are sometimes temptations that are fairly \npowerful. I hope we will continue to make progress on the nominations.\n  I also thank my colleagues, Senator Reid and Senator Nickles, for \nmoving us along on the nominations, and Senator Lott in particular for \nhis work in trying to reach an accommodation.\n  My desire now is to work relatively late into the evening so that we \nmight be able to get some of these amendments disposed of tonight. I do \nnot think we will finish the bill tonight, but there is a lot of work \nto be done on the VA-HUD bill. We still have the Ag appropriations \nlegislation left to do. So there is much to be done. Today is Wednesday \nafternoon, and we still have a day and a half, or 2, 3, 4, or 5 days \nperhaps, to do our work. But it is going to get done before we leave.\n  We will move now to the VA-HUD bill after the Senators who sought \nrecognition are allowed to speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/01/senate-section/article/S8536-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8536-S8537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRANSPORTATION APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate has now \nfinally passed the Senate Transportation appropriations bill. It has \nbeen a long and arduous process, but we have done the right thing \ntoday. We have done the right thing for our constituents who have been \nsitting in traffic, for our constituents who are concerned about safety \nat our airports, for our constituents who daily travel in this country, \nwho use our waterways and our highways and our air transportation \nsystem.\n  We have moved this bill forward in a way that I think is very sound. \nWe have tried to meet the needs, as I said, of all of the Senators, who \nI think have done a good job on this floor. But, most importantly, I am \nespecially pleased that we have moved the Senate Transportation \nAppropriations bill out of the Senate without compromising one iota on \nthe safety of our families on our highways in regard to the Mexican \ntruck provision. I think that is absolutely the way to go. I commend my \ncolleagues who stood with me on this issue as we have moved this bill \nthrough the Senate.\n  I also take this opportunity to thank my staff: Peter Rogoff, Kate \nHallahan, Denise Matthews, Cyndi Stowe, Angela Lee, and Dale Learn; as \nwell as Senator Shelby's staff: Wally Burnett, Paul Doerrer, and \nCandice Rogers; and our Commerce Committee staff: Debbie Hersman.\n  All of our staff members have spent countless hours in this Chamber, \nnegotiating late into the night on many evenings over the past 10 days. \nI especially thank all of them for their tremendously good work and \nhard work and for being a part of getting this bill passed out today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Murray for her \nsuccess on Transportation appropriations. This Senate, commencing a \nsummer recess, is required to deal with Mexican trucks and northeastern \ncows. We now have one success behind us, and one more to go.\n  There are those who are going to claim that our insistence on the \ninspection of Mexican trucks is somehow a defeat for free trade. \nNothing could be further from the truth. The commitment of this Senate \nto free, fair, and open trade is complete. We understand that the \nfoundation of our prosperity rests upon open markets and free trade. \nBut because we worship at the altar of free trade does not mean we have \nabandoned our faith in truck safety, the rights of labor, or \nenvironmental protection. We must keep a commitment to all of these \nthings at the same time.\n  The roads of the United States are open to Mexican trucks--as they \nare open to Canadian trucks--when Mexico can pass a regimen of truck \nweights, the licensing of drivers for hazardous cargo, that licenses \nare issued to 21-year-old drivers, and that the Mexican trucks can meet \nour safety requirements.\n  Upon current inspections, nearly 40 percent of Mexican trucks are \nfailing inspections. Our borders are not ready for 24-hour inspections \nto ensure safety. We want Mexico to have access to American highways. \nBut for 50 years we have insisted that all trucks on our highways have \nlimited weights, properly licensed drivers, and disclose hazardous \ncargoes. As we have insisted upon these requirements for Canadian and \nAmerican drivers, we insist upon them for Mexican drivers. We welcome \nthat day. What we have done today is a success.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I know in time Mexico will be able to comply with \nthese requirements.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I extend my appreciation to the majority \nleader and to the Republican leader for negotiating this issue out so \nthat we could move forward. I did not enjoy this exercise. As I \nmentioned before, I have never--and I have been in the Senate since \n1987--engaged in parliamentary maneuvering in order to block \nconsideration of a bill. And I would not have--and I hope I never have \nto again--if it were not for the fact that it is a solemn treaty. So I \nthank the majority leader for his assistance in working this out, as \nwell as Senator Lott.\n  During the upcoming recess, we are going to meet with the Department \nof Transportation administration officials to find out exactly what \nlanguage it is that they need in order to satisfy the concerns we all \nhave about the present language in the bill, which they view and the \nMexicans view as a violation of NAFTA. I hope we can come back, at the \nend of the recess, and we can agree on that language. Then we can move \nforward.\n  However, I remind my colleagues that there are three more--three \nmore--cloture votes that may be required which will all involve, of \ncourse, extended debate. I do not want to do that. But, if necessary, \nwe will continue through until finality because we really are concerned \nabout language on an appropriations bill affecting a solemn treaty made \nbetween three nations.\n  So again, I thank the majority leader for working this out and giving \nus the courtesy he has extended. I apologize to him for impeding the \nimportant work of the Senate. I hope he understands why we had to do \nthis. I am hopeful this will all be worked out over the recess so that \nwe can come to an agreement on language which will achieve the goal we \nseek, which is to make sure that every vehicle that enters the United \nStates is safe and inspected and every driver is licensed and \nqualified.\n  So I hope we can get this issue resolved. I hope the administration \nwill\n\n[[Page S8537]]\n\nbe able to work with us and the other side and develop the necessary \nlanguage. I hope we do not have to continue this parliamentary \nmaneuvering, but we will, if necessary. I hope all understand that this \nis the importance of this issue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/01/senate-section/article/S8537-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8537-S8549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DEPARTMENTS OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND \n             INDEPENDENT AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2002\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I call up the VA-HUD appropriations \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2620) making appropriations for the \n     Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban \n     Development, and for sundry independent agencies, boards, \n     commissions, corporations, and offices for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2002, and for other purposes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am indeed quite happy and proud to \npresent the Senate with the VA-HUD and independent agencies \nappropriations for fiscal year 2002.\n  I thank Chairman Byrd and Senator Stevens for working with the \nsubcommittee in order to give us an allocation that made the bill \nworkable. The funding level falls within the subcommittee's 302(b) \nallocation. I also thank Senator Bond and his staff for their \nbipartisanship and cooperation in support of this bill.\n  This subcommittee has had a history of bipartisanship. That tradition \ncontinues today.\n  When we began the 107th Congress, Senator Bond chaired this \nsubcommittee. It is one of the most important because it funds so many \nof the agencies that meet compelling human need as well as the long-\nrange needs of the United States of America.\n  When the transition came, it came in an orderly, seamless, and \ncollegial way. I hope that will also be the general tenor of our \ndebate, that we can move forward on this bill on a bipartisan basis.\n  I believe this bill is balanced, fair and meets the needs of the \nAmerican people.\n  My guiding principles in drafting this bill were simple: keep the \npromises to our veterans; meet the compelling day-to-day needs of \nworking poor; re-build our neighborhoods and communities; and, invest \nin science and technology to create jobs today and jobs tomorrow.\n  Based on the President's budget proposal and our subcommittee's \nallocation, we had to focus on restoring cuts in the President's budget \nand avoiding riders.\n  Our overriding goal was to make sure that the core programs in \nveterans and housing were taken care of first, and we did that.\n  We could not increase spending for any programs until our core \nprograms for veterans and the poor were taken care of.\n  While I wish the subcommittee had more resources for science, we did \nthe best we could do given our allocation.\n  I remain fully committed to doubling the budget for NSF over the next \n5 years, but without the support of the administration, the authorizing \ncommittees, and the Budget Committees, the appropriators can not do it \nalone.\n  Finally, we did not break new ground this year. We are staying the \ncourse because this is a year of transition both in the administration \nand in the Senate.\n  For our Nation's veterans, we have increased VA healthcare by $1.1 \nbillion over last year, for a total of $21.4 billion. This is $400 \nmillion more than the President's request. This will allow the VA \nhealthcare system to serve 4 million patients in 2002 through 172 \nmedical centers, 876 outpatients clinics, 135 nursing homes and 43 \ndomiciliaries.\n  VA continues to shift from an inpatient focus to outpatient care to \nserve more veterans in their communities. The funding in this bill will \nallow VA to open more community based outpatient clinics to better \nserve our Nation's veterans. This bill provides funding for VA to open \n33 new outpatient clinics in fiscal year 2002.\n  This marks the second year in a row that we have had billion-dollar-\nplus increase for veterans healthcare.\n  We have also increased funding for VA medical research by $40 million \nover last year and $30 million above the President's request. This \nfunding level will allow VA to continue progress in the treatment of \nchronic diseases; diagnoses and treatment of degenerative brain \ndiseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, and; research involving \nspecial populations, especially those who suffer from spinal cord \ninjury, stroke, nervous system diseases, and posttraumatic stress \ndisorder.\n  VA is also a training ground for doctors, nurses, and physician \nassistants.\n  VA medical care and research is a national asset that benefits both \nveterans and non-veterans.\n  We have also maintained our commitment to the VA State home \nconstruction program. As our veterans age in place, their needs and the \nneeds of their families are changing. Outpatient clinics and State \nveterans homes bring the delivery of healthcare and healtcare services \ncloser to our veterans and their families. This approach reduces costs \nfor the VA and improves the quality of services for the veterans.\n  We have also provided funding to speed the processing of veterans \nclaims. From the time a veteran files a claim, to the time he or she \nreceives a decision, takes an average of 205 days or nearly 7 months. \nThis bill includes $46 million to hire additional claims processors to \nhelp reduce waiting times to 100 days by the summer of 2003.\n  For the Department of Housing and Urban Development, we had two \noverall goals: expand housing opportunities for the poor, and rebuild \nour neighborhoods and communities; and help special needs populations.\n  First, we have fully funded the renewal of all section 8 housing \nvouchers by funding the housing certificate fund at $15.6 billion. This \nis $1.7 billion more than last year.\n  This amount includes an advance appropriation of $4.2 billion, for \nfiscal year 2003.\n  This advance appropriation was included as part of the concurrent \nbudget resolution for fiscal year 2002 adopted earlier this year. We \nhave carried this advance appropriation for the last several years and \ncontinue it this year.\n  Within the section 8 account, we have provided funding for 17,000 new \nor ``incremental'' vouchers to provide more vouchers for people waiting \nfor section 8 assistance.\n  We have restored the cuts proposed by the President to critical the \npublic housing capital account.\n  The Public Housing Capital Program provides funds to public housing \nauthorities to repair and renovate public housing units to update \nheating, ventilation, electrical, and plumbing systems. Funds can also \nbe used to construct new public housing, as well as renovating existing \nunits.\n  We have provided $2.9 billion for public housing capital which is \njust below last year's level.\n  We have restored funding for the Drug Elimination Grant Program to \nfight crime and drugs in public housing.\n  We have provided $300 million for the Drug Elimination Program, just \nbelow last year's funding level. President Bush eliminated this program \nin his budget.\n  We cannot stop or delay our fight against drugs and crime in public \nhousing. HUD needs to be a force for stability in the neighborhoods \nthat surround public housing.\n  We increased funding for the CDBG program by $200 million over last \nyear, to just over $5 billion in FY 2002. The CDBG program is one of \nthe most effective tools for local economic development efforts. It \ngives our State and local officials flexibility to use Federal funds to \nmeet local needs.\n  For other HUD programs, we have continued funding at last year's \nlevels for: empowerment zones; brownfields; homeless grants; and \nhousing for the elderly and disabled. We would like to have increased \nfunding for these programs this year, but our allocation was simply not \nhigh enough to provide across-the-board increases.\n  We have included language to raise the FHA loan limits for multi-\nfamily housing by 25 percent this year--the first increase in many \nyears.\n  This proposal was included as part of the administration's budget \nrequest, and we included it as part of our bill. Raising the loan \nlimits will help increase the supply of multi-family housing in this \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S8538]]\n\n  I wish we could do more for housing production. We cannot voucher our \nway out of our housing crisis. We need a new production program.\n  I look forward to the recommendations of the Millennial Housing \nCommission and the Commission on Senior Housing. These two \ncongressionally chartered commissions will give the Congress a \nblueprint for addressing the crisis in affordable housing. Once we \nreceive those recommendations, I hope the Congress can take a step \nforward in solving this crisis.\n  In the area of predatory lending and flipping, we are providing HUD \nwith expanded legal authority to deny FHA insurance to lenders who have \nhigh default rates to help fight flipping and predatory lending.\n  Earlier this year, I held a field hearing in Baltimore on the subject \nof flipping. Unfortunately, despite some progress, this despicable \npractice continues.\n  To give HUD more resources to fight this problem, we have provided \nthe Inspector General's office with $10 million specifically targeted \nto anti-predatory lending activities.\n  In the area of community development, one of my highest priorities \nhas been to help this country cross the digital divide. In this bill, \nwe provide $80 million to help create computer learning centers in low-\nincome neighborhoods through competitive grants to local governments \nand non-profits.\n  For EPA, we provide $7.75 billion, an increase of $435 million above \nthe President's request.\n  We ensure that Federal enforcement of environmental laws remains \nstrong by restoring the 270 enforcement jobs cut by the President's \nrequest.\n  The President proposed a major shift in policy this year. He proposed \nto cut 270 environmental ``cops on the beat'' and shift enforcement to \nthe States through a new $25 million State enforcement grant program.\n  But major concerns have been raised about this approach. The EPA \ninspector general has found numerous examples of weaknesses in State \nenforcement programs. This is a very important issue, and we need to \nhear from our authorizers about how we should allocate our resources \nbefore we make a major policy shift. So we did not break new ground in \nthis area, and we maintained the status quo for Federal enforcement.\n  This bill also keeps our commitment to clean and safe water by fully \nfunding the Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund at $1.35 billion.\n  The Nation is facing an enormous backlog of funding for water \ninfrastructure projects--some estimates say as high as $23 billion per \nyear. The committee acknowledges the validity of the problems faced by \nlarge cities and small communities alike in upgrading sewer and \ndrinking water systems.\n  Unfortunately, the administration chose to fund the new Combined \nSewer Grant Program at the expense of the Clean Water State Loan Fund. \nThis approach was opposed by our authorizers, and GAO told us it was a \nbad idea because it would weaken the Clean Water Fund.\n  We regret that the administration took this approach and that we \ncannot provide the $450 million requested for the sewer grant program.\n  We hope that in the future, the President's request will be more \nadequate to meet the needs of our communities.\n  For the Federal Emergency Management Agency, our bill provides a \ntotal of $3.3 billion. Of this total, $2.3 billion is designated for \nthe disaster relief account to be available in the event of an \nemergency or natural disaster.\n  I should note for my colleagues that of the $2.3 billion designated \nfor disaster relief, $2.0 billion is designated as an emergency under \nthe terms of the Budget Act.\n  Tropical Storm Allison had a devastating impact on Texas, Louisiana, \nand Pennsylvania. We need to replenish the disaster account so the \nfunds continue to be available for the victims of Allison and future \ndisasters we may face.\n  We restore $25 million for Project Impact, an important effort that \nhelps to raise visibility and public awareness for the need for pre-\ndisaster mitigation.\n  We also increase the FEMA fire grant program to $150 million. In the \nfirst year of this program, FEMA received over 30,000 applications \nrequesting nearly $3 billion for fire fighting equipment, vehicles, and \nprotective clothing.\n  After seeing what our firefighters in Baltimore went through to deal \nwith the Howard Street tunnel fire, the least we can do for these brave \nmen and women is help give them the equipment and support they need to \ndeal with the hazardous, life threatening situations they constantly \nconfront on our behalf.\n  We have also provided the FEMA Director with support to establish and \nrun the new office of national preparedness as requested by the \nPresident. This new office will coordinate all the various Federal \nprograms dealing with consequence management resulting from weapons of \nmass destruction. This is a very important initiative; so much so that \nthe Appropriations Committee held 3 days of hearings earlier this year \non the President's action plan.\n  And we provide nearly $140 million for the emergency food and shelter \nand over $20 million to help FEMA modernize their flood mapping \noperation.\n  We provide $14.6 billion for NASA programs, $50 million over the \nPresident's request and $300 million over last year.\n  This was one of the more difficult parts of the appropriations bill \nto put together. We found ourselves dealing with a $4 billion plus \noverrun on the international space station.\n  Let me say that while I am disappointed and appalled at the \nmismanagement of the space station, I am still committed to seeing the \nspace station completed.\n  NASA is currently having an outside review team conduct a thorough \nindependent evaluation of the space station. That will give us a new \nroad map for the station. Although we do make a slight reduction to the \noverall space station budget, we did not make any major decisions \nregarding the future of the station. We want to wait and see what the \nadministration will do later this year and in their 2003 budget.\n  Unfortunately, this is not the first cost overrun we have had with \nthe space station. Since 1993 we have seen at least six different \nrevised cost estimates that have taken the station's cost from $17.4 \nbillion up to a staggering $28.3 billion--a stunning 61 percent \nincrease.\n  The committee is adamant that this has to stop. We are committed to \ncompleting the space station and that it be the world class research \nfacility it was also supposed to be. But the culture at NASA has got to \nchange so that NASA management gets these costs under control.\n  The committee is not going to let NASA raid other important space \nprograms to pay for these space station management failures. So here's \nwhat we do.\n  First, we provide $1.7 billion for continued construction of the \ninternational space station. We redirect $50 million to the shuttle for \nsafety upgrades. Protecting our astronauts is one of the most important \npriorities within the committee.\n  Second, we cap total space station costs over the next 4 years at a \ntotal of $6.7 billion. Any proposal to exceed this cap must come with a \npresidential certification that it is needed and the additional costs \nare well known.\n  Third, to ensure the station is in fact a world-class research \nfacility, we add $50 million to the life and microgravity research \nprogram, which takes the program up to $333.6 million for fiscal year \n2002. Then we transfer space station research out of the human space \nflight account into the science account where we protect it from being \nused any further to pay for space station overruns.\n  Finally, we want NASA to create an independent review committee to \ndevelop options that will increase the amount of time crew members will \nhave to conduct research on board the station.\n  If this is going to a world-class research facility, we have to be \nsure the personnel on board have the time and support to carry out a \nviable research program.\n  Over in the Science, Aeronautics and Technology account, we provide \n$7.7 billion. This is $478 million more than the President's request \nand is driven primarily by the transfer of the biological and physical \nsciences research program out of the space station account and into the \nscience account to improve aviation safety and commercial \ncompetitiveness.\n\n[[Page S8539]]\n\n  For the National Science Foundation, we provide a total of $4.7 \nbillion for research and education. This is an increase of $256 million \nor 6 percent over last year.\n  We had hoped to provide more. Senator Bond and I--and a large number \nof our Senate colleagues--believe it is in the national interest to \ndouble the NSF budget over the next 5 years.\n  This recommendation represents a downpayment on that policy \nobjective.\n  We reject the administration's proposal to cut the NSF research \nprograms and instead, we increase them by $187.5 million over the \nrequest.\n  We provide nearly $500 million for nanotechnology and information \ntechnology--two critically important research activities related to the \nNation's economic competitiveness; $150 million to help meet the needs \nof developing institutions and States with $110 million for EPSCoR, \nExperimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research, $25 million \nspecifically for instrumentation at smaller institutions, and $15 \nmillion for innovation partnerships between smaller schools and local \nindustry.\n  We provide $55 million for supercomputing hardware: $45 million for \nan earthquake research network, and $12.5 million to continue \nconstructing a new radio telescope, called ALMA.\n  We link hi-tech economic development with out academic centers of \nexcellence through a new $10 million regional innovation clusters \ninitiative designed to bring universities, industries and local \ngovernment together to map out and carry out strategic R and economic \ndevelopment plans.\n  Math and science education programs increase by nearly $90 million or \n11%--to over $870 million, $872.4 million. We provide $190 million for \nthe President's Math and Science Partnership program, $130 million in \nthis bill; additional $60 million through hi-tech visa fees. We \nincrease the stipends for graduate students in science and engineering \nby nearly 20 percent (or $3,500) to $21,500 per year. We provide $20 \nmillion for a new undergraduate workforce initiative. We increase \nsupport for programs related to historically black colleges and \nuniversities and other under-represented groups to $100 million.\n  This is a Science Foundation budget that emphasizes three critical \ngoals:\n  (1) support for people--from the scientist to the grad student to our \nelementary and secondary school teachers of science and math;\n  (2) support for the basic research enterprise of this country in \nstrategic areas as well as to core disciplines in science and \nengineering; and\n  (3) support for tools--the cutting edge equipment and instrumentation \nthat is so crucial to move science forward.\n  We have funded National Service at $420 million, which is $4 million \nmore than the President's request, to keep National Service strong.\n  Volunteerism is our national trademark. It highlights what is best \nabout America.\n  Volunteer programs are the backbone of our communities. They help \npreserve the safety net for seniors, keep our communities safe and \nclean, and get our kids ready to learn.\n  The 2002 VA-HUD bill maintains our commitment to AmeriCorps by \nproviding funding to support 50,000 members to continue our spirit of \nproviding community service, reducing student debt, and to creating \n``habits of the heart.''\n  We also continue our promise to bridging the digital divide. We \nprovide $25 million to teach-the-teachers, to bring technology skills \nto those who have been left out or left behind in our digital economy.\n  The bill meets compelling human needs and invests for our future.\n  I would like to have been able to do more for science, technology and \nhousing production, but this is the best we can do under our allocation \nand satisfy the priorities of our Members.\n  To reiterate, this committee reported the bill and it compromises $84 \nbillion in discretionary budget authority and $88 billion in outlays. \nThe bill is balanced and fair and meets the needs of the American \npeople. Our job was to meet certain compelling issues.\n  My guiding principles were, No. 1, to keep our promises to the \nveterans for them to have the health care they need and not stand in \nline when they have to apply for their pensions; to work in the area of \nhousing and urban development, that we would develop the programs and \npolicies that would empower the poor to be able to move to a better \nlife as well as rebuilding our neighborhoods and our community; also to \nstand up and protect the environment and invest in science and \ntechnology to create jobs today and jobs tomorrow.\n  Based on the President's budget proposal and the subcommittee \nallocation, we had to focus on restoring cuts in the President's budget \nand, of course, we worked very hard to avoid riders. Our overriding \ngoal was to make sure that core programs in veterans and housing and \nthe environment were taken care of. We did that. We could not increase \nthe funding for every program that was meritorious, but we could meet \nthe basic needs of our responsibilities.\n  One of the areas that we were sorry we could not increase funding to \nthe level we wanted was in doubling the budget for the National Science \nFoundation over the next 5 years.\n  I want to talk about what we have done for veterans. We increased VA \nhealth care by over $1 billion. This is $400 million more than the \nPresident's request. It will allow the VA health care system to serve 4 \nmillion patients through 2002, 172 medical centers, 876 outpatient \nclinics, and over 135 nursing homes. VA continues to shift from \ninpatient focus to outpatient care. The funding in this bill will allow \nVA to open more community-based clinics.\n  This marks also the second year in a row that we have increased \nfunding for veterans health care. We have also increased funding for VA \nmedical research by $40 million over last year.\n  This funding level will allow VA to continue its progress in the \ntreatment of chronic diseases, also the diagnosis and treatment of \ndegenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, and \nspecial populations, often those who bear the permanent wounds of war, \nthat of spinal cord injury and post-traumatic stress.\n  VA is a training ground for health care providers, and we have been \nable to keep our programs that encourage scholarships and other grant \nprograms to do this.\n  The other area we worked on was to increase the speed of processing \nfor veteran claims. Right now, when a veteran files for a claim, it \ntakes 205 days or nearly 7 months. We don't think veterans should have \nto stand in line to get this consideration. This bill includes $46 \nmillion to improve technology and hire additional processors.\n  In the area of HUD, for the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, we had two overall goals: expand housing opportunities for \nthe poor, but in an empowerment way, rebuild our neighborhoods and \ncommunities; and also help special needs populations.\n  First, we fully fund the renewal of all section 8 housing vouchers by \nfunding the housing certificate fund at $15.6 billion. This is $1.7 \nbillion more than last year. This amount also includes an advance \nappropriation of $4.2 billion. This advanced appropriation was included \nin the concurrent budget resolution.\n\n  Within the section 8 account, we provided funding for 17,000 new or \nincremental vouchers. We also restored the cuts proposed by the \nPresident to the public housing capital account. The public housing \ncapital program provides funds to public housing authorities to repair \nand renovate public housing units, to update heating, ventilation, and \nplumbing.\n  These are absolutely essential. We should not be a slum landlord. We \nhave to raise those standards. Also, we have provided $300 million in \nthe drug elimination program. President Bush eliminated this program, \nand we have very serious question about what is the best way to \nproceed.\n  This year we didn't want to break new ground in terms of our general \npolicies, so we have kept in the $300 million for drug elimination. We \nasked the authorizers to hold hearings on what is the best way we can \nkeep drugs out of public housing and make sure that drug dealers don't \nuse public housing as small business incubators for their deals.\n  We also increased funding for CDBG by $200 million, taking it to just \nover $5 billion.\n  We continued funding empowerment zones, brownfields, homeless grants, \nand housing for the elderly and disabled. We would surely like to have \nincreased funding for these programs, but our allocation was not enough \nto do this. We hope that in next year's budget, we could take a look at \nit because\n\n[[Page S8540]]\n\nthese certainly are very meritorious. We have also included language to \nraise the FHA loan limit for multiple family housing by 25 percent. \nThis is the first increase in many years. This proposal was included in \nthe administration's budget request. Raising the loan limit will \nincrease the supply of multiple family housing in this country. We need \nmore affordable apartments. Rents are going sky high. We cannot voucher \nour way out of a housing crisis. We also need it for the middle class.\n  Also, again, on a bipartisan basis, we know we need a new production \nprogram. We are looking forward to the recommendations of the housing \ncommission and the Commission on Senior Housing so that we could then \nget a framework for proceeding.\n  Also, my senior colleague, Senator Paul Sarbanes, chairing the \nHousing and Banking Committee, has been leading the fight against \npredatory lending. We started that fight in this committee under \nSenator Bond, and we are going to continue that. We have added funds in \nthe inspector general's office to target the antipredatory lending \nactivities.\n  Also, we have provided in this bill $80 million to create computer \nlearning centers in low-income neighborhoods. These will be competitive \ngrants to nonprofits and to local governments. I prefer to keep it to \nnonprofits. This will help cross the digital divide and, we believe, \ncan be used for job training during the day, structured afterschool \nactivities in the afternoon, and essentially be one of the important \nempowerment tools.\n  Let's move on to the environment. For EPA, we provide $7.5 billion, \nan increase of $435 million above the President's request. We ensure \nthat the Federal enforcement of environmental programs remains strong. \nWe restore 270 enforcement jobs cut by the President. The President \nproposed a major shift in policy this year. These 270 jobs are like our \nenvironmental cops on the beat. The President wanted to shift this to a \ngrants program of $25 million. We again felt we were breaking new \nground without the authorizers taking a look at what is the best way to \nenforce the environmental laws. We know it needs to be a Federal-State \npartnership. But we didn't want to eliminate our current framework \nuntil we had really a very clear, well-thought-through process.\n  The EPA inspector general found numerous examples of weaknesses in \nState enforcement programs. That is why we had so many yellow flashing \nlights.\n  This bill keeps our commitment to clean and safe water by fully \nfunding the clean water State revolving loan fund at $1.35 billion. \nThis Nation is facing an enormous backlog of funding for water \ninfrastructure projects--some estimate as high as $23 billion per year. \nOut of all the requests we got for congressionally designated projects, \nprobably the largest number and those that just cried out for a \nresponse were in water and sewer, from very small rural communities \nthat are on the brink of disaster to large metropolitan water supplies \nwhere the water and sewer was built over 100 years ago and are on the \nverge of collapse.\n  Mr. President, we really hope that it will be a major initiative of \nthe authorizing committee to look at our infrastructure needs. I think \nthis is very important in terms of a public investment for our \ncommunities.\n  Let's go to FEMA. Our bill provides, for the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency, $3.3 billion. Of this total, $2.3 billion is \ndesignated for the disaster relief account to be available in the event \nof an emergency or natural disaster.\n  I should note for my colleagues that of the $2.3 billion designated \nfor disaster relief, $2 billion is designated as an emergency under the \nterms of the Budget Act. Tropical Storm Allison had a devastating \nimpact on Texas, Louisiana, and Pennsylvania. We have to replenish this \ndisaster account and at the same time have a cushion for these \nimpending disasters. We restore $25 million for Project Impact and \nincrease the FEMA fire grant program to $150 million. I will be saying \nmore about that in the course of the bill.\n  Mr. President, I want to move on to NASA. We provided $1.46 billion \nfor NASA programs--$50 million over the President's request--and $300 \nmillion over last year. This was one of the more difficult parts of our \nappropriations. We found ourselves dealing with a $4 billion-plus \noverrun on the international space station. I will say that again. We \nfound ourselves dealing with a $4 billion overrun on the international \nspace station. I am very disappointed and dismayed at the way the space \nstation is being managed. I am going to be very clear on the record. I \nam absolutely committed to the space station, and I am going to do all \nI can to see that it is completed. But NASA needs to get its act \ntogether on the space station and deal with these cost overruns.\n  We really want to ensure that we do complete the space station but \nnot at the expense of cannibalizing other programs or reducing the \nspace station to only three astronauts. You cannot do the space station \nscience for which this whole project was completed with three \nastronauts. We also need to be sure that our astronauts can return \nsafely. We need to focus on the safety of our astronauts, and this is \none of the other reasons we are working on shuttle upgrades.\n  On the National Science Foundation, know that Senator Bond and I \nwanted to double it, but we could not. We did increase it by $256 \nmillion. We hope to provide more. Senator Bond and I, and a large \nnumber of colleagues, think it is in our national interest to do so. \nThis recommendation represents a downpayment on that policy objective.\n  We provide nearly $500 million for nonotechnology and information \ntechnology, and $150 million to meet the needs of institutions and \nStates. We also are increasing math and science education, as well as \nsupercomputing hardware.\n\n  The Science Foundation budget will emphasize three goals: Support for \npeople--from the scientist to the graduate student; to develop support \nfor the basic research enterprise of this country; and also support for \nthe tools we need for future science and technology.\n  Let me go into national service. We funded national service at $420 \nmillion. This keeps national service strong. Voluntarism is our \ntrademark and it highlights the best of America. What we did here was \nprovide $25 million to teach-the-teachers in technology. We have \nincluded that in the bill to encourage veterans to volunteer with our \nyoung people. Again, we could have done more, but we just didn't have \nthe money. I think what we did do meets these needs.\n  This speech is kind of boring because it is about numbers and data--\n$500 million over here, $300 million this, and the President's that, \nand our requests, et cetera. But when you get down to it, what this \nmoney represents is really a commitment to honoring our veterans, \nbuilding our communities, housing and urban development, protecting our \nenvironment, and investing in space in the National Science Foundation \nso that we have the new ideas to come up with the new products, \nencouraging voluntarism.\n  We also provide that in the event any community is hit by a national \ndisaster, while they have to go through the records, they would not \nhave to forage for funds to pay for it.\n  I thank Senator Bond and his very capable staff for their most \ncollegial and cooperative efforts in moving this bill forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am very pleased to stand wholeheartedly in \nenthusiastic support of S. 1216, the VA-HUD fiscal year 2002 \nappropriations bill as reported from the Committee on Appropriations.\n  My compliments to Senator Mikulski as the new chair of the VA-HUD-\nIndependent Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee for her hard work and \nher commitment to making this bill a balanced piece of legislation for \nall Members, for the administration and, most of all, for the people \nwho are served by it--and they are many--as the Senator has so \neloquently outlined.\n  I could not ask for a better chair and, previous to the \ntransmogrification, a better ranking member. I know that some identify \nus as one of the more collegial teams in this Chamber. I am proud of \nthat. I think we make a good team.\n  After extensive, hard work on the very important and difficult and \ncomplex issues in this bill, we agree on the\n\n[[Page S8541]]\n\npolicy outlines and on the specific allocation included in this bill \nfor the VA-HUD fiscal year 2002 bill. I think the bill is grounded both \nin good policy and fiscal responsibility. As the Senator from Maryland \nhas discussed, the legislation is within our 302(b) discretionary \nfunding allocation of $84 billion-plus in budget authority and some $88 \nbillion in outlays.\n  In addition, while no bill is perfect or addresses every Member's \nconcerns--and certainly we had many hundreds and thousands of \nconcerns--I think the bill strikes the right balance in funding both \nthe Members' priorities and the administration's priorities.\n  In particular, despite our tight allocation, we have done our best to \nsatisfy the priorities of Senators who made special requests for \neconomic development grants, water infrastructure improvements, as well \nas requests for other State and local priorities. Such requests \nnumbered over 1,600 individual requests, totaling over $22 billion, \nwhich illustrates the level of interest and demand for assistance in \nthe bill. That means, on the average, each Senator submitted 16 \nrequests, costing a total of $220 million for our humble little bill. \nWe obviously could not address all of these requests, but we have tried \nhard to address as many of the most pressing needs as we could.\n  We have also met most of the administration's funding priorities. I \ncompliment the administration for not looking to create a series of new \nprograms, but instead focusing on--with some exceptions--maintaining \nexisting program levels and reforming program implementation to ensure \nthat the agency can deliver the needed assistance under existing \nprogram requirements.\n  Again, I emphasize that we don't need a lot of new programs in this \nbill. We do need to ensure that existing programs are managed well and \neffectively and the people who are to be served receive the benefits \nthat are intended in the bill.\n  I will be relatively brief in my review of the bill because the VA \nand veterans' needs remain the highest priority, and funding decisions \nin the bill are designed to ensure the best quality of medical care for \nour veterans, to keep the best doctors in the VA system. To achieve \nthis, we have funded VA medical care at $21.4 billion, an increase of \nsome $400 million over the President's request, and over $1.1 billion \nover the 2001 level.\n  I know some Members believe the funds are inadequate, but I emphasize \nwe have increased this account every year and have worked hard to \nensure there are adequate funds for the medical needs of our veterans. \nIn fairness, we can spend only so many funds efficiently and \neffectively. I believe we have done the best we can.\n  Moreover, Senator Mikulski and I are committed to meeting the medical \nneeds of veterans, and we are working with VA to ensure successful \nimplementation of the new CARES process that will result in better VA \nfacilities, the better targeting of services and medical care \nthroughout the country, assuring we do not waste money that is meant \nfor veterans medical care on maintaining unneeded or excessive capacity \nbuildings.\n  The 2002 VA-HUD Senate appropriations bill provides $31 billion for \nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development, which is $443 million \nover the budget request and $2.5 billion over last year's level. This \nincludes funding needed to renew all expiring section 8 contracts and \nalso provides funds for 17,000 incremental vouchers.\n  I personally remain deeply concerned that vouchers do not work well \nin many housing markets. We need to develop new production programs \nthat assist extremely low-income families in particular.\n  We have also included $650 million for the Public Housing Capital \nFund over and above the President's budget request, and have added $300 \nmillion for the Public Housing Drug Elimination Program, a program the \nadministration sought to eliminate in its budget. These are both \nimportant programs, and the VA-HUD bill essentially preserves last \nyear's funding levels.\n  In particular, I emphasize my support for the public housing capital \nfunding, which is critically needed to address some $20 billion in \noutstanding public housing capital needs. We must ensure those people \nwho live in assisted housing have decent housing in which to live and \nto raise their families. As a civilized and developed nation, we owe \nthe least of our citizens, in terms of economic wealth, at least that \nmuch.\n  In addition, we maintain funding for both the CDGB and HOME programs \nat the 2001 level, while rejecting an administration set-aside of $200 \nmillion in home funds for a new downpayment program. The set-aside is \nunnecessary, in our view, since this activity is already eligible under \nthe HOME program. I stress my support for both HOME and CDBG because \nthey rely on decisionmaking guided by local choice and need. We are \nasking the people who are there on the ground, in the community, to \ndetermine how best to use funds for community development and to meet \nthe housing needs of the population in their communities.\n  I hope and trust these funds are used by States and localities as an \ninvestment in housing production to meet the increasing housing needs \nof low-income and extremely low-income families.\n  In addition, the bill funds section 202 elderly housing at $783 \nmillion; section 811 housing for disabled at $217.7 million. These \nfunding levels are the administration's requests and approximately the \nsame as the 2001 level. The bill includes over $1 billion for homeless \nfunding, with a separate account of almost $100 million for the renewal \nof the expiring shelter plus care contract. Again, these funding levels \nreflect the administration's request at last year's funding levels.\n\n  As for the Environmental Protection Agency, the bill includes $7.75 \nbillion, which is some $435 million over the 2002 budget request. It \nincludes $25 million for State information systems as requested by the \nadministration.\n  We did reject the administration's request to transfer some $25 \nmillion for State EPA and enforcement efforts, keeping these funds at \nEPA. I support that premise. As one who was a Governor, I ran \nenvironmental protection programs in my State. I have a great regard \nand a great respect for the work done at the State level, but the \nproposed transfer of enforcement responsibilities from EPA to the \nStates may be premature. It appears to us a number of States may need \nto upgrade their enforcement capacity before a transfer of EPA \nenforcement responsibilities to States is warranted.\n  In addition, the bill maintains funding of the clean water State \nrevolving fund at $1.35 billion instead of reducing this amount by $500 \nmillion for the funding of a new sewer overflow grants program.\n  Funding of this new sewer overflow program is premature without \nadditional funding. Both the clean water and drinking water State \nrevolving funds are key to building and rebuilding our Nation's water \ninfrastructure systems and should not be compromised with new programs \nwithout significant new funding.\n  I cannot emphasize too strongly the importance of continuing to \nmaintain funding for these State revolving funds. For clean water \ninfrastructure financing alone, there is a need for some $200 billion \nover the next 20 years, excluding replacement costs and operations and \nmaintenance.\n  For FEMA, the bill appropriates an additional $2 billion in disaster \nrelief. The chairman and I intend to offer an amendment to make these \nfunds available upon enactment. We feel strongly these additional funds \nshould be available as soon as possible in the event we face disasters \nbeyond the normal expectations during the remainder of this fiscal \nyear. If we do not have that money, then this body is going to be put \nin a real bind to try to respond to a disaster which might occur in any \nof our States. I believe every Member should support this program \nbecause almost everyone represents a State which has benefited recently \nfrom the availability of these important disaster assistance funds in \nthe face of some unexpected and unfortunate disaster in their States.\n  We need to ensure FEMA has the necessary funds to meet all possible \nemergency contingencies during this fiscal year and the next fiscal \nyear. The VA-HUD appropriations bill also funds NASA at $14.56 billion. \nThis is an increase of $307.5 million over last year. It is $50 million \nabove the budget request. This includes $6.87 billion for human space \nflight, while capping the\n\n[[Page S8542]]\n\nfunds available for the international space station at $1.78 billion.\n  Senator Mikulski and I share huge concerns over the current status of \nthe space station, as she has so forcefully and eloquently noted, \nespecially when cost overruns currently exceed $4 billion this year \nalone. There also appears to be a total loss of management control by \nNASA with regard to the space station.\n  In the current configuration, the space station must depend upon the \nRussian Soyuz for any emergency escape capacity from the station, and \nthere continues to be inadequate habitation space that is needed for \nscience research, the primary justification for the construction of \nthis station.\n  Right now, they can only hold three astronauts in the space station. \nThe time of two and a half of them is required to operate the station. \nThat means we go through all the work and trouble of sending up a space \nshuttle, sending up astronauts, and we get one-half of one FTE working \non science. That is a disaster, and it is and should be an \nembarrassment for NASA.\n  Not to be too bleak, however, NASA is making great strides in other \nareas of research, including space and Earth science. Remote sensing is \nbecoming a viable and important technology and many of our space \nscience missions are unlocking the mysteries of the universe.\n  In addition, the bill continues our commitment to the space launch \ninitiative, the SLI. This is a critical program that should provide for \nthe development of alternative technologies for access to space. \nNevertheless, I have heard some reports that NASA may be losing control \nof the SLI program. Again, NASA needs to keep a tight focus on \ntechnologies being proposed and the funding which is approved.\n  In addition, the bill reaffirms our commitment to aeronautics, and \nNASA's leadership role is part of the Government-industry partnership \nto develop breakthrough technologies for the aviation community.\n  Finally, I restate emphatically my support for the National Science \nFoundation, again in total agreement with my friend and chair of the \nsubcommittee. Because of our budget allocation limitations, we were \nonly able to provide $4.67 billion for the National Science Foundation \nfor the coming year, a $256 million increase to the budget. This is \nstill a $200 million increase over the President's budget, but it is \nnot nearly as much as we want.\n  I believe this funding level is the best we can do under the \ncircumstances without jeopardizing the needs of our Nation's veterans, \nour commitment to EPA, and our investment in affordable housing for \nlow-income families.\n  Let me be clear. I am committed to working with Senator Mikulski and \nour House counterparts to find more funds for NSF in conference. I am \ncommitted to doubling the Foundation's budget over 5 years and will do \neverything I can to keep us on that important path.\n  I call on my colleagues who believe the future of the United States \ndepends upon our continuing to make great strides in the field of \nscience and engineering to join with us to make solid the commitment of \nthis body to doubling the funding.\n  We have seen in the past great strides made in the National \nInstitutes of Health. They are developing wonderful new cures, but they \ntell us that the work of NIH depends upon continuing work and \ndevelopment by the National Science Foundation. If you talk with people \nin the field of scientific endeavor, they will tell you that we are way \nout of balance because we have not done enough to keep up with basic \nscience and making sure we continue to be the leader in the world in \nall forms of technology and science, not limited to space and health, \nbut to biotechnology, nanotechnology, and the many other exciting \nissues on which the National Science Foundation is working.\n  I am not always sure everyone understands our investment in science \nand technology greatly influences the future of our Nation's economy \nand our quality of life. How goes the funding goes the future.\n  I thank Senator Mikulski's staff and my staff for the many long and \nhard hours they spent advising us and working on legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to voice my \nstrong support for the fiscal year 2002 HUD/VA appropriations bill. \nChairwoman Mikulski and Senator Bond have done an exemplary job of \nproviding HUD with the resources it needs, even while working within a \nvery tight allocation for all of the agencies within their \njurisdiction.\n  The administration's budget request for HUD, the agency that provides \nhousing assistance to this Nation's poorest families and funding for \ncommunity development and revitalization, was sorely inadequate. The \nadministration's proposal would not even have provided the funding \nnecessary to maintain HUD programs at current levels. Instead of \nfighting to expand housing opportunities to meet growing needs, the \nAdministration's budget request has put us in the unfortunate position \nof fighting just to retain current program levels.\n  We have a severe housing crisis in this country, and the need for \nhousing assistance continues to grow. There are almost 5 million very \nlow-income households in this country who have worst case housing \nneeds, either paying more than half of their income towards rent or \nliving in severely substandard housing. Another 2 million people will \nexperience homelessness this year. At a time when so many families are \nin need of housing assistance, housing programs need additional \nfunding.\n  One area of great concern are the proposed cuts in public housing, a \nprogram that provides housing to over 1.3 million of this Nation's \npoorest households.\n  Senators Mikulski and Bond realized that a significant number of \nfamilies would be affected if they went along with the proposal to cut \nover $1 billion in funding for public housing programs. The \nadministration proposed cutting $700 million, or 25 percent, from the \nCapital Fund, the fund used to repair and modernize public housing. \nThere is a significant need for these funds. HUD estimates that there \nis currently a $22 billion backlog in needed capital repairs in public \nhousing. A cut of this magnitude would have led to further \ndeterioration of this Nation's public housing stock. The \nadministration's budget says that this program can withstand such a cut \nbecause there are unexpended balances in the Capital Fund that can be \nused to fill in the gaps left by the budget cut. However, this is not \nthe case. HUD's own data show that Capital Funds are being spent well \nwithin the legal time-frames established in a bipartisan manner just a \nfew short years ago. Fortunately, the bill before us today provides \nalmost $3 billion for the Capital Fund, helping us to maintain a much \nneeded resource and to ensure that the federal investment in this \nhousing is protected. This is an important accomplishment of the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  In addition, this bill restores funding for the Public Housing Drug \nElimination Program, which supports anti-crime and anti-drug activities \nin public housing. The administration's proposed elimination of this \nprogram would have resulted in housing authority police officers being \nlaid off, after-school centers being shut down, and safety improvements \nnot being made. The bill before us today provides $300 million for this \nimportant program that helps to improve the lives of public housing \nresidents.\n  Unfortunately, the administration's budget did away with other \nimportant programs as well, including the Rural Housing and Economic \nDevelopment Program, which provides funding for housing and economic \ndevelopment in rural areas. This program helps to greatly enhance the \ncapacity of rural non-profits to fund innovative efforts to supply \nhousing and develop rural areas. HUD's own budget justifications state \nthat ``The previous rounds of funding recognize that rural communities \nface different socio-economic challenges than do cities . . . Many \nrural areas have been by-passed by employment, and low, stagnating \nwages. It is imperative that rural regions have greater access to \ncommunity and economic development funds that would foster investment \nin economic opportunities.'' I am pleased that the bill before us today \nprovides $25 million in funding for this program which allows rural \nAmerica to access essential resources.\n  While most of this bill helps to further the goals of ensuring that \nall\n\n[[Page S8543]]\n\nAmericans have access to decent, safe and affordable housing, I have a \nnumber of concerns with provisions in the bill related to Section 8 \nvouchers.\n  This bill only provides funding for an additional 17,000 section 8 \nvouchers. This is only half the vouchers requested by the \nadministration, and less than a quarter of the 79,000 new vouchers \nCongress funded last year. I recognize that the committee is concerned \nwith voucher utilization and the effectiveness of the program, as am I. \nHowever, section 8 vouchers work in most areas of the country, allowing \nfamilies to choose where to reside while lowering their rent burdens. I \nagree that there are improvements that must be made to strengthen this \nprogram and to ensure that all families who receive vouchers are able \nto find adequate housing. However, I strongly believe that we must \ncontinue to expand the voucher program so that we can meet the needs of \nthe many poor families waiting to receive housing assistance.\n  In addition to the decrease in section 8 vouchers, the administration \nhas proposed cutting section 8 reserves by $640 million, from two \nmonths to one month. These reserves are used in the event of higher \nprogram costs so that the section 8 program can continue to serve the \nsame number of families. The administration is correct that some of \nthese funds may not be necessary; however, HUD must have the \nflexibility to meet the needs of PHAs that must access more than one \nmonth of reserves in order to continue serving the families who \ncurrently receive vouchers. The House appropriations bill, which does \nnot give HUD this flexibility, will lead to a reduction in the number \nof poor families who receive housing assistance. I am pleased that the \nSenate did not adopt the flawed approach taken by the House, and I hope \nthat the conference report will give HUD the flexibility to provide \nmore than one month of reserves to housing authorities that will \notherwise be forced to cut their section 8 programs.\n  I am also concerned by language in this bill that has the potential \nto reduce funding for critical housing programs by diverting funds from \nHUD to other agencies. I appreciate and support the efforts of the \nchair and ranking member to protect funds allocated to the \nsubcommittee. However, I am concerned that, as drafted, this provision \ncould inadvertently result in funds being transferred from already \nstrapped housing programs and hinder the effective functioning of the \nvoucher program. I hope that the final legislation will ensure that all \nof the funds allocated to housing are used to meet the growing housing \nneeds in this country.\n  As a whole, I support this bill, and commend my colleagues on the \nAppropriations Committee for reporting out a bill that affirms our \ncommitment to housing this Nation's poor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to offer for the record the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring for S. 1216, the Department of Veterans \nAffairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies \nAppropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2002.\n  Including an advance appropriation into 2002 of $4.2 billion, the \nSenate bill provides $84.052 billion in nonemergency discretionary \nbudget authority, of which $138 million is for defense spending. The \n$84 billion in budget authority will result in new outlays in 2002 of \n$40.489 billion. When outlays from prior-year budget authority are \ntaken into account, discretionary outlays for the Senate bill total \n$88.463 billion in 2002. The Senate bill is at its section 302(b) \nallocation for both budget authority and outlays.\n  In addition, the Senate bill provides new emergency spending \nauthority of $2 billion to the Federal emergency Management Agency for \nDisaster Relief, which is not estimated to result in any outlays in \n2002. In accordance with standard budget practice, the budget committee \nwill adjust the appropriations committee's allocation for emergency \nspending at the end of conference. The bill also provides an advance \nappropriation for section 8 renewals of $4.2 billion for 2003. That \nadvance is allowed under the budget resolution adopted for 2002.\n  I again commend Chairman Byrd and Senator Stevens, as well as \nSenators Mikulski and Bond, for their bipartisan effort in moving this \nand other appropriations bills quickly to make up for the late start in \nthis year's appropriations process.\n  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that a table displaying \nthe budget committee scoring of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     S. 1216, DEPARTMENTS OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND HOUSING AND URBAN\n   DEVELOPMENT, AND INDEPENDENT AGENCIES, 2002; SPENDING COMPARISONS--\n                          SENATE-REPORTED BILL\n                        [In millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  General\n                                  purpose   Defense  Mandatory    Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n  Budget Authority.............    83,915       138     26,898   110,951\n  Outlays......................    88,327       136     26,662   115,125\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\\1\\\n  Budget Authority.............    83,915       138     26,898   110,951\n  Outlays......................    88,463         0     26,662   115,125\nHouse-reported:\n  Budget Authority.............    83,995       138     26,898   111,031\n  Outlays......................    87,933       136     26,662   114,731\nPresident's request:\n  Budget Authority.............    83,221       138     26,898   110,257\n  Outlays......................    87,827       136     26,662   114,625\n SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED\n               TO\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\\1\\\n  Budget Authority.............         0         0          0         0\n  Outlays......................         0         0          0         0\nHouse-reported:\n  Budget Authority.............

Because the firewall is for budget authority only, the\n  appropriations committee did not provide a separate allocation for\n  defense outlays. This table combines defense and nondefense outlays\n  together as ``general purpose'' for purposes of comparing the Senate-\n  reported outlays with the subcommittee's allocation.\n \nNotes.--Details may not add to totals due to rounding. Totals adjusted\n  for consistency, including removal of emergency funds ($2 billion in\n  BA, $0 in outlays) and inclusion of a 2002 advance appropriation ($4.2\n  billion in BA, $2.52 billion in outlays). The Senate Budget Committee\n  increases the committee's 302(a) allocation for emergencies when a\n  bill is reported out of conference. For enforcement purposes, the\n  Budget Committee compares the Senate-reported bill to the Senate\n  302(b) allocation.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. NELSON of Nebraska). The Senator from \nMaryland.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1214\n\n                (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1214.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski], for herself and \n     Mr. Bond, proposes an amendment numbered 1214.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1217 to Amendment No. 1214\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I have an amendment I send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski], for herself and \n     Mr. Bond, proposes an amendment numbered 1217 to amendment \n     No. 1214.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: to make $2,000,000,000 for FEMA disaster relief available \n                            upon enactment)\n\n       On page 81, line 2 of the amendment after \n     ``2,000,000,000,'' insert: ``to be available immediately upon \n     the enactment of this Act, and''.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this amendment is simple and \nstraightforward. It provides that FEMA disaster funding shall be \navailable upon enactment of this bill. It means that when the President \nsigns the VA-HUD conference report, which we hope will be in September, \ndisaster funding will become immediately available without waiting \nuntil October 1.\n  Why is this important? FEMA is down to $168 million as of yesterday \nthat has not been allocated or distributed. Normally FEMA has a cushion \nof $1 billion during hurricane season.\n  This is a very tough time of the year for many parts of our States \nfor natural disasters. Coastal States are hurricane prone. We know the \nprairie States are prone to tornadoes now, and our Western States are \nprone to terrible fires. We want to be sure there is enough money for \nFEMA to respond. Therefore, in this bill we want to have a cushion.\n  Yesterday, President Bush announced he was releasing $583 million\n\n[[Page S8544]]\n\nto cover the cost of recovering from tropical storm Allison. We sure \nsupport that. As a result, there is now almost a zero balance in the \ncontingency fund. This is far below what we need to prepare and \nrespond. This is why Senator Bond and I are offering this amendment. We \ncannot be left unprepared, and upon completion of the remarks of my \ncolleague, I will urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this is an extremely important amendment. It \nshould be an important amendment for every Member of this body. \nUnfortunately, we do not know for which Members it will be important \nbecause we do not know where the next disaster will strike.\n  Based on our past experience, as the chair has mentioned, there are \nproblems along the coast. We have tornadoes, we have hurricanes, we \nalso have fires in the West, and we still do floods, and wherever these \ndisasters strike, FEMA must be ready to respond. If we do not have a \nproblem, then the money is not spent.\n  With the release of the $583 million in contingent disaster relief \nfor previously declared disasters, including the assistance of victims \nof tropical storm Allison, several States of recent storms, flooding in \nMontana, Texas, West Virginia, and Virginia, and other declared \ndisasters, there are no additional funds available for release this \nyear. FEMA is perilously close to a situation where it does not have \nenough disaster funds for the rest of the year.\n  We do not know where or when or what kind of disaster will strike, \nbut we do know we should not roll the dice and be without this funding \navailable to FEMA should it be needed.\n  FEMA provides critical assistance in times of emergency. We want to \nbe sure they have this emergency assistance available. I join with my \ncolleague in asking it be adopted.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we know of no one who wishes to speak \nagainst this amendment. This is not a money amendment; it is a timing \namendment. We have the support of our colleagues. Knowing there is no \none else who wishes to speak on it, I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, without \nobjection, the amendment is adopted.\n  The amendment (No. 1217) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the bill, of course, is open to \namendment by any Member. We know our colleague, Senator Wellstone, has \nan amendment, and after that, we know our colleague, Senator Boxer, \nwill also be offering amendments. Then hopefully after that, Senator \nKyl will have an amendment. If everybody comes to the Chamber and \ncooperates the way Senator Wellstone immediately came to the floor, it \nis conceivable we can finish this bill this evening, a record time.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1218 to Amendment No. 1214\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say through the chair to the Senator \nfrom Maryland, I am cooperating. She has a way of eliciting \ncooperation. I made sure I got to the Chamber and cooperated with the \nSenator from Maryland and, of course, the Senator from Missouri.\n  I send my amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1218 to amendment No. 1214.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To increase the amount available for medical care for \n                       veterans by $650,000,000)\n\n       On page 7, line 19, strike ``$21,379,742,000'' and insert \n     ``$22,029,742,000''.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I can describe this amendment for \ncolleagues. This amendment will add $650 million to the funding that is \ncontained in this bill for veterans health care.\n  I will go through the numbers carefully because Senators have voted \nfor more than this amount of additional funding in prior votes. First I \nwill speak in a general way and then more specifically.\n  I thank both the Senator from Maryland and the Senator from Missouri \nfor their fine work on this bill and their fine work on behalf of \nveterans. I know, and they know, there is not nearly enough funding in \nmedical or housing needs. I propose this amendment to bump up the \nfunding. It does not get all the way there. I am not trying to do any \nshowcasing. I have been involved in these amendments year after year \nafter year, sometimes with success, sometimes without success. I will \ncontinue to force the issue when it comes to the funding because I \nknow, and I am sure other Senators know as well, in the most concrete \npersonal way just from our office in Minnesota and the number of people \ncalling.\n  I admit to every Senator in the Senate that I was completely naive \nabout this when I was elected. I never thought a large part of my work \nwould end up being veterans work. I didn't think that would be what I \nwould be doing. This all came about because our office is fortunate to \nhave great people: Josh Syrjamaki and Mike Siebenaler are heroes in the \nveterans community. They come through for people. The better we do for \nan individual person, the more the word gets around, and other people \ncome for help.\n  We helped a Vietnam vet. His daughter wrote me a poem about her dad. \nShe said, my dad was fine, and one day he took a shower, he came out of \nthe shower, and he had a complete mental breakdown, posttraumatic \nstress breakdown. It was a plea for help.\n  I will not use names because I don't know if families approve. I \nthink Tim Gilmore's family would not mind. Tim was struggling with \nAgent Orange and still not getting the compensation he needed. If he \ndid not get it and he passed away before receiving it, the family would \nnot get benefits. He was not thinking about himself any longer--he knew \nhe would die--but he didn't know whether his family would get any help.\n  When helping people such as these, with good people in your office--\nand I have the best--more and more people come for help. It turns out \nthis has been a lot of the work we do. People fall between the cracks.\n  Quite frankly, this appropriations bill is way under what we should \nprovide. I will add it up in a moment with concrete numbers. The \nmedical inflation alone, counted at 4 percent a year, gets close to $1 \nbillion. Look at the commitment we made to treat veterans with \nhepatitis C. Look at the Millennium Program and the commitment we are \nsupposed to be making to an ever-aging veterans community and the kind \nof help we will give them, or we say we will give them, and look at the \nwhole scandal of the number of homeless veterans. I venture to say \nprobably a third of adult men who are homeless in this country are \nveterans, many of them Vietnam veterans, many of them struggling with \nmental health issues, with substance abuse issues. Look at the \ncommitment we are supposed to be making toward expanding mental health \nservices, and look at the long delays it takes for people to get the \ncare they are supposed to receive from our VA medical system because we \ndo not have the systems in place or we do not have enough of the \npersonnel, and then look at the crisis in nursing. This is no way to \nsay thank you to veterans.\n  This amendment has the support of the Disabled American Veterans, \nAMVETS, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the Veterans of Foreign \nWars, the VFW; the American Legion supports this amendment. A lot of \nthe American service organizations support this amendment for good \nreason.\n  Now the specifics. During the debate on the budget resolution--I want \nSenators or staff to please listen because I am determined to pass this \namendment--the Senate passed by a vote of 53-46 an amendment to fully \nfund veterans health care. This amendment, which I introduced, added \n$1.7 billion to veterans health care above the President's request. \nThis was based on\n\n[[Page S8545]]\n\nthe work of veterans organizations which put together an independent \nbudget. We said to veterans organizations, we are tired of hearing you \ntell us what you are against. Tell us what you favor.\n  A variety of different veterans organizations did careful research \nand said, this is what we need to make this veterans health care budget \nwork. They put together this budget and, based on their work, I \nintroduced this amendment. It came out of the tax cut.\n  This amendment brought us to a level of funding recommended by the \nindependent budget--I didn't pick it out of thin air--which was the \n$2.6 billion over fiscal year 2001.\n  The Senate then adopted an amendment offered by Senator Bond that \nadded an additional $900 million above the $1.7 billion. That passed \n99-0. So the amendment I am offering today for an additional $650 \nmillion is only a quarter of the amount the Senate has gone on record \nin favor of adding to the President's request.\n  Members can't vote for the budget resolutions and say they are for \nthis and, when the rubber meets the road, vote against the additional \nappropriation. I feel strongly about this. The budget amendments were a \ntest of our priorities. Some Senators would not agree with this, and it \ndoesn't matter; I think you should vote for this amendment out of a \ncommitment to veterans. I never saw the sense in spending so darn much \nmoney on the tax cuts. Too much of it I thought was Robin Hood in \nreverse, too much going to the very top of the population.\n  I thought there were other needs: Of course, education; children; we \nwill be talking about defense later on; we are going to be talking \nabout prescription drug benefits, affordable prescription drug \nbenefits. What about veterans and veterans health care?\n  When it came to the vote, the Senate rose to the occasion in a \npositive vote for more money than I am now asking, to make veterans a \npriority. Unfortunately, the budget resolution that the Congress \nultimately adopted, which was basically the President's budget, \nshortchanged veterans by requesting a $700 million increase for health \ncare. In other words, to put this number in context, last year's \nrequested increase for the VA health care system alone was $1.4 \nbillion.\n  The simple inflation rate, 4.3 percent in the VA health care system, \nwould mean approximately $900 million would just go to cover medical \ninflation; $900 million is already gone. So the administration's \nproposed budget barely covered the cost of medical inflation.\n  The House did a little bit better than the administration, and the \nSenate appropriators did better still. I give credit where credit is \ndue. The Senate VA-HUD has a $1.1 billion increase over last year's \nlevel for health care. That is $400 million more than the President. \nThe appropriators got us part of the way there but nowhere near all the \nway. The independent budget produced by AMVETS and the VFW and the \nDisabled American Veterans and the Paralyzed Veterans demonstrates that \nthe VA will face approximately $2.6 billion more in health care costs \nin fiscal year 2002 than we face in the current fiscal year. So $1.1 \nbillion is nowhere close to $2.6 billion.\n  Here is what we are talking about: Uncontrollable costs such as \nmedical inflation and salaries, $1.3 billion; Millennium Act long-term \ncare initiative, $800 million; and other initiatives, including mental \nhealth care, pharmacy benefits for new patients, and I also argue, \nagain, some assistance for homeless vets.\n  I just think this amendment could not be more reasonable, frankly, in \nterms of what we ought to do.\n  As a Senator from Minnesota, I think long-term care ought to be one \nof our highest priorities. Last year we passed landmark legislation \ncalled the Veterans Millennium Healthcare and Benefits Act which \nsignificantly increased noninstitutional long-term care. For the first \ntime it would be available to all veterans who are enrolled in the VA \nhealth care system. The legislation is costly, if we are going to \nreally back it with resources, but it is critical for veterans and \ntheir families.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Nebraska, I learned \nabout this in a very personal way, and every Senator probably has had \nthe same experience. We have a wonderful VA medical center, a flagship, \nreally, in Minneapolis. I will go and visit veterans. If you should \nspend a little bit of time with their spouses--say, for example, you \nare visiting her husband and he is a World War II veteran or Korean War \nveteran. Then maybe you can get away from where her husband is and you \ngo out into the lounge and you sit down on the couch and maybe have a \ncup of coffee and you talk. She is terrified because she does not have \nthe slightest clue what she is going to do when he gets home because \nshe cannot take care of him any longer, not by herself.\n  I went through this with my mom and dad. My dad had advanced \nParkinson's disease. I know exactly what this is about.\n  Do you know what. More and more veterans--just more and more \nAmericans, thank God--are living to be 80 and 85 and 90 years of age. \nWe have our collective heads in the sand when it comes to veterans \nhealth care if we are not going to back our rhetoric with resources and \nput some resources into this Millennium Health Care Act. It is not done \non the cheap. Long-term care is not done on the cheap. Enabling a \nveteran to live at home in as near normal circumstances as possible, \nwith dignity--which is what we should do--is not done on the cheap.\n  Currently, we have 9 million veterans who are 65 years of age or \nolder. Over the next decade, half of the veteran population is going to \nbe 65 years of age or older. According to the Federal Advisory \nCommission on the Future of VA Long Term Care, about 610,000 veterans a \nday need some form of long-term care. That was in 1997, that study.\n  As the veterans population ages, long-term services are an \nincreasingly important part of our commitment to health care for \nveterans, and we are not funding it. We are not providing the necessary \nfunding.\n  The Millennium Act also ensures emergency care coverage for veterans \nwho do not have any other health insurance options. This is costly. It \nis another thing that has to be covered, but it is necessary. Nearly 1 \nmillion veterans enrolled with the VA are uninsured, and they are in \npoorer health than the general population.\n  Furthermore, we made the commitment to treating hepatitis C, we have \nother complex diseases such as HIV infection, and we have made the \ncommitment to provide care for veterans, but we do not have the \nadequate funding.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that full implementation of \nthe Millennium Act would cost over $1 billion in 2001--$1 billion \nalone. This is on top of the other initiatives, $500 million for \ninitiatives such as mental health, the homeless reintegration program, \nand treatment for hepatitis C.\n\n  When you take all the challenges and all the costs that the VA health \ncare system is going to face, including long-term care, emergency care, \nessential treatments, and medical inflation, a budget increase of $2.6 \nbillion is needed. That is the independent veterans budget. We are not \neven halfway there with what we have done, and I am now saying at least \nlet's add an additional $650 million.\n  The last 2 years have been a downpayment to the veterans health care \nbudget, enabling the VA to get back on course in delivering world class \nservice that is rightfully due to our Nation's veterans. I thank, \nagain, the Senator from Maryland and the Senator from Missouri for \ntheir work. These funding increases have been welcome. But the problem \nis they have not erased the prior years of flat funding. We all know \nwhat that means. Year after year, we had flat funding where we did not \nat all increase any of the appropriations, the money the veterans \nneeded. Over the last decade, the VA health care budget has experienced \ndeep cuts in real dollar terms, at a time when it should have been \naddressing an aging and increasingly health-care-dependent veterans \npopulation. That is the ``why'' of this amendment.\n  Let me repeat that because it is the unpleasant truth. Over the last \ndecade, all together, in real dollar terms, because of these flat \nbudgets, actually the VA health care budget was experiencing deep cuts, \nin real terms, at the same time we had more and more veterans who were \naging, more and more veterans with health care needs.\n  Based on VA statistics from January 2001, the national average \nwaiting time\n\n[[Page S8546]]\n\nfor a routine next-available appointment for primary care medicine is \n64 days. Do you hear me? Sixty-four days, with a range of between 36 \nand 80 days. For specialty care, the statistics are even worse. Eye \ncare average waiting time, 94 days; cardiology, average waiting time, \n53 days; orthopedics, average waiting time, 47 days; urology, average \nwaiting time, 79 days. Some veterans are waiting up to 18 months to get \ncare from the VA in Minnesota, and Minnesota is not alone, and that is \nnot acceptable. There should be support for this amendment.\n  In an era of budget surpluses, these stories are outrageous. I could \ngo on and on. I will not because I know my colleagues want to move the \nlegislation forward. I do not think that veterans, America's veterans, \nMinnesota's veterans, Nebraska's veterans, Missouri's veterans, \nunderstand why, with the Federal coffers overflowing, their budget is \nnowhere near fully funded.\n  We have heard a lot of rhetoric lately about returning the surplus to \ntaxpayers. We have been told the Federal coffers are overflowing and we \nshould return the excess. Certainly some of the tax cuts were in order. \nBut in all due respect, if you listen to the veterans community, if you \nvisit VA facilities, if you talk with the staff, it is clear that part \nof the surplus we have been enjoying has been paid for on the backs of \nAmerican veterans. That is why there should be support for this \nmoderate amendment that just bumps up the funding so we can do a little \nbit better.\n  I have about 5 more minutes to conclude my statement. I will wait for \nmy colleague's response.\n  The counterargument is: Wait a minute. This goes beyond the spending \ncaps.\n  I want Senators to listen to this. It is true that this amendment is \nnot offset. I could have tried to pay for this amendment by cutting \ninto housing programs in this appropriations bill. But the truth is, \nhousing is underfunded. In fact, it is absolutely unbelievable that \naffordable housing is not made the top priority in the Senate. It is \ngoing to soon become the crisis issue in the country. It is now. We \njust haven't faced up to it.\n  The opponents of the amendment are asking that we make a tradeoff--\nthat I am supposed to ask more for veterans and take something away \nfrom affordable housing; that I am supposed to choose between science \nand veterans. I reject the tradeoff. I think Minnesotans reject the \ntradeoff. I think the American people reject the tradeoff. Colleagues, \nthe Senate rejected the tradeoff when we debated the budget resolution. \nLet me go back to how you voted. Fifty-three Senators said: Let us do \nright by veterans and reduce the cost of the tax cut with this \namendment. Ninety-nine Senators said: Let us add at least an additional \n$900 million and just take it from the surplus with no offset. Ninety-\nnine Senators voted for this. Ninety-nine Senators said: Let's add an \nadditional $900 million and just take it off the surplus with no \noffset. This amendment adds only $650 million.\n  By the way, between these two amendments, the Senate voted \noverwhelmingly to add four times as much money to veterans health care \nas the amendment I am offering today. You are on record. We are on \nrecord. We didn't do our work. We did it because of the overwhelming \nneed that is out there.\n  Let me simply say that I make no apology for the amendment. I think \nSenators should vote for it.\n  I just say this to colleagues. Some historian is going to look back \nat this vote in one way. We know darn well that we are going to go \nbeyond the budget caps and limits when it comes to defense. We are \ngoing to do that. We already know it. We also know that we are not \ngoing to stick to the caps when it comes to education. Every Senator \nknows that, or should. We can't make the kind of investment that we \nhave rhetorically committed to education within these existing caps. We \ncan't make the kind of commitment that many have made to defense within \nthese existing caps. We cannot honor the commitment that we made to \nveterans within these caps.\n  It is crystal clear to me that we are on record. Ninety-nine Senators \nsaid: Let's add an additional $900 million and let's take it off \nsurplus with no offset. I said: Let's ask for $750 million. That is not \neven the $900 million for which 99 Senators voted.\n  I finish on this point: The reason for all the support from all of \nthese veterans organizations is this very real need. I come out here to \nspeak about it. I feel strongly about it because I know we have to do \nbetter. I hope this amendment will pass.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to comment on Senator Wellstone's \namendment. First of all, I have a great deal of admiration for my \ncolleague from Minnesota. His advocacy for veterans has been \nlongstanding from the day he walked into the Senate. He has been, first \nof all, a champion for health care for all Americans. He has also been \nparticularly vigorous in the issues related to veterans health care. He \nhas been one of the few to speak up for the so-called ``atomic \nveterans''--those exposed to nuclear testing and nuclear radiation. He \nhas spoken for the veterans who are homeless and mentally ill. I know \nhe is very closely identified with the veterans service organizations, \nespecially those that produce something called the independent budget \nwhere the veterans organizations themselves look at what the President \nis proposing. They gave commentary.\n  Senator Bond and I met with leaders of those veterans service \norganizations. They made compelling cases. They told us stories from \nthe waiting room about what our veterans were facing.\n  Senator Bond and I really would love to have increased veterans \nfunding even more. But we had an allocation. The allocation enforced \nbudget caps. This subcommittee intends to live within its budget caps.\n  This is why it is with great reluctance that I oppose Senator \nWellstone's amendment, because it is an addition of $650 million \nwithout an appropriate offset. This essentially breaks the caps.\n  What does breaking the caps mean? It puts us into deficit spending. \nAnd it could also result, because of other budget and tax break \ndecisions, in putting us even up against the Medicare and Social \nSecurity trust funds.\n  I don't dispute many of the compelling arguments that my colleague \nmade, but at the same time this subcommittee had the difficult task of \nbalancing many needs--veterans health care, the need of housing, the \nneed of low-income Americans to really try to deal with the terrible \nproblems that children face with lead paint poisoning--I know that is \nsomething the Senator from Minnesota has championed--protecting the \nenvironment, and other issues that we have enumerated in the bill.\n  We have a very tight allocation. I think we did a good job. First of \nall, we did not abandon the veterans. We did not break any promises to \nthe veterans. In fact, we added $1 billion more in veterans health care \nthan we had last year--$1 billion more than last year. This is actually \neven $400 million over what President Bush requested. It is over $100 \nmillion more than what is in the House bill that they sent over to us.\n  We think we have put our promises into the Federal checkbook.\n  What does this bill do? This level of funding will allow VA to open \nat least 33 more community-based outpatient clinics. It also makes sure \nthat we cut down on the waiting time for veterans to receive health \ncare.\n  We have also increased funding in veterans medical research. There is \n$390 million for VA medical and prosthetic research. What do we do \nthere?\n  The Senator has spoken about the chronic problems of aging veterans. \nHe is absolutely right. That is why we want to increase research for \ntheir treatment, and also to pay particular attention to Alzheimer's \nand Parkinson's.\n  Also, our research program encourages even more breakthroughs in \nprostate cancer. At the same time, we provide funds to recruit and \nretain high-quality medical professionals.\n  We are in a war for talent. There is a shortage of nurses. We are in \nbidding wars to be able to get those nurses. While we keep the nurses, \nwe have to try to recruit new ones. We are trying to create \nopportunities for nursing education so they can get their education\n\n[[Page S8547]]\n\nthrough VA so they will be there to maximize the care that veterans \nneed.\n  I want to talk about claims processing, this whole issue of standing \nin line in order to get your claims processed. What are we talking \nabout? We are talking about pensions. And we are talking about \ndisability benefits that are service related, taking 205 days--7 \nmonths--to get the first decision. We think that is too long. We also \nthink it is wrong. Therefore, working with our very able administrator, \nMr. Principi, we have come up with funds to be able to hire and train \nmore claims processors and improve technology and cut down that waiting \ntime.\n  We also want to talk about long-term care. There is money in this \nbill for what we call GREC, G-R-E-C. What does that mean? It means that \nthese are geriatric evaluation centers. What does a geriatric \nevaluation center do? It makes sure that veterans get appropriate care; \nthat we do not abandon them; and that we do not warehouse them. But a \ngeriatric evaluation gives a complete physical, a complete neurological \nand mental health evaluation, to determine why someone might be \nsuffering a loss of memory or undergoing behavioral changes. It could \nbe Alzheimer's or it could be a brain tumor; we want to know. It is \nreally in veterans health care where we are providing pioneering work \nin doing those evaluations.\n  I must say, it is the only place in the Federal budget where anyone \npays real attention to developing a cadre of geriatricians focusing \nprimarily on veterans. So we meet those funds. Could we open more \nGRECs? You bet. Could we train more geriatricians? I wish we could. But \nI will promise you that each year we move further along, and we will \ncontinue to do that.\n  At the same time, our veterans often do face the need for long-term \ncare. We like the partnerships between the Federal Government and the \nState governments. This is why we provide $100 million for something \ncalled State Home Construction for the Care of Aging Veterans. This \ndoubles the President's request and addresses the $285 million backlog \nin high-priority needs. We do have a backlog, and the backlog is not a \nwish list, it is a priority list.\n  So we believe we have really met veterans' needs. Have we met them \ncompletely? No. Have we met them robustly? I believe yes. The total \nfunding for the Veterans' Administration part of the VA-HUD bill is $51 \nbillion.\n  I would really commend to those on my side of the aisle to read the \nDemocratic Policy Committee analysis of what the bill is. We hear \nnumbers and statistics, and we can get lost in this. I hope they will \ntake the time to see what we really did do for veterans in this bill, \nas well as improve construction projects--major and minor--and the \nprocessing of claims, et cetera, that we said.\n  So again, I acknowledge the outstanding advocacy of my colleague, \nSenator Wellstone from Minnesota. I acknowledge the validity of many of \nthe points he has made. I thank the veterans service organizations for \ntheir very keen analysis of the independent budget. I say to them, I \nwish we could do more; but without breaking the caps, without coming \nright up against the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, we could \nnot do more.\n  So it is with great sadness but, nevertheless, fiscal responsibility \nto honor the budget caps that I will be opposing the Wellstone \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it has been suggested that we find a time to \nbe agreed upon for a vote on the motion to waive the point of order \nwhich will be raised. I wish to speak only about 5 minutes. I see the \ndistinguished assistant majority leader in the Chamber.\n  Mr. President, I ask consent that there be 15 minutes of debate prior \nto a vote in relation to the Wellstone amendment No. 1218, with the \ntime equally divided between Senators Wellstone, Mikulski, and Bond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I would ask my friend to \namend that to say there would be no second-degree amendments in order.\n  Mr. BOND. And there would be no second-degree amendments in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator would withhold just for a \nsecond, if I could just say, for the benefit of all Senators, there \nshould be a vote on this at around 6 o'clock if everyone uses all their \ntime. Senators should further be advised that following this vote, \nbecause of an order previously entered, there will be a vote on the Asa \nHutchinson nomination to head the Drug Enforcement Administration that \nwill immediately follow this vote. I should say, there is going to be \nsome time allowed to talk about the Asa Hutchinson nomination, but it \nwill be right after this vote.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, just to straighten this out, might I ask the \nChair: I understood there had been time set aside for debate on the \nHutchinson vote. So for my colleagues' edification, what is the time \nagreed to for debate on Hutchinson prior to the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty minutes evenly divided.\n  Mr. BOND. It is a vote on the confirmation of the nomination of Asa \nHutchinson?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BOND. I understand after this vote there will be 30 minutes \nequally divided on the nomination of Mr. Hutchinson prior to the \nconfirmation vote on the nomination; is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. I have just spoken to the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee. He said he doubts he will use all of his time. So we will \nhave a vote whenever they finish using whatever time they decide to \nuse. And we will come back to this bill.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, now that we are thoroughly edified, may I \nreturn to the Wellstone amendment?\n  What my colleague, the chairman, has said is quite true. Veterans, \nveterans health care particularly, has been the top priority, and will \nbe the top priority, of this committee. In a time of tight budgets, we \nprovided a $400 million increase over the President's request for VA \nmedical care. This is $1.1 billion over the current fiscal year.\n  This is why I say VA medical care is again our top priority in this \nbill. This continues our commitment to our Nation's veterans, to ensure \nthat they receive the health care they deserve.\n  We have heard about flat funding. I can say that in the past several \nyears this committee has worked very hard to increase, significantly \nover the President's budget request, the amount we apply for veterans \nhealth care. In the past 2 fiscal years, we added $3 billion to the \nPresident's request for medical care in order to ensure no veterans \nwould be turned away, no layoffs of critical medical staff would occur, \nand that funds needed for treating hepatitis C, the homeless, the \nmentally ill, and other critically important needs of veterans would be \nfully funded.\n  As a result, the VA has been treating more veterans in its medical \nprogram than ever. We intend to assure that they can continue to treat \nthose veterans with the highest degree of medical care.\n  This budget would provide for additional substantial increases for \nhepatitis C screening, treatment, new long-term care programs, and for \na continued increase in the number of veterans served by the VA medical \nsystem.\n  I believe everybody in this body wants to make sure we provide all of \nthe funds we can possibly find and that can be well used by the VA.\n  I question, however, two points: No. 1, busting the budget \nagreement--spending more money than has been allocated to this \ncommittee--but, secondly, why we would wish to provide additional \nscarce resources to the veterans medical care account when the VA has \nadvised us they will likely not be able to spend all those funds in \nfiscal year 2002--the funds we have just provided. In fact, according \nto VA's own budget, they already expect to have about $1 billion in \ncarryover funds in this current year going into the next fiscal year \nunder their budget request. They could not spend more than the funds \nthat are already provided in this bill for veterans health care, in \naddition to medical care funding, which we all agree is vitally \nimportant.\n\n  We have included a number of other significant funding items to \nimprove the condition of our veterans. For example, we provided an \nincrease of $30\n\n[[Page S8548]]\n\nmillion over the President's request to fund medical research. We want \nto make sure that the health care provided to our veterans is the \nfinest available and that we are doing research on the leading edge.\n  This places the VA medical research account at a record level of $390 \nmillion. That is how we attract and maintain top quality researchers \nand health care providers in the system. We have also restored cuts to \nthe State home construction program to increase the number of nursing \nhome care facilities for veterans. Our funding would also support the \nopening of 33 more community-based outpatient clinics to improve access \nand service delivery.\n  As one who travels around my State, I find the community-based \noutpatient clinics to be the best innovation we have developed in the \npast 10 years to make sure that health care is readily available, \nconvenient, accessible, and efficient for veterans.\n  When the time expires, I will raise a point of order. I will yield \nthe floor now for any comments my colleagues wish to make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me first say to both Senators, they \nhave done a superb job within the allocation they had. My quarrel is \nwith the allocation.\n  Again, the President's budget was about $1 billion over what we had. \nIt doesn't even deal with medical inflation which is over $1 billion, a \nlittle over 4 percent per year. Everybody knows that. Then we added \nanother $400 million. That is terribly important.\n  If you look at inflation, for long-term care, home-based care for \nelderly veterans, hepatitis C, homeless veterans, mental health \nservices, covering veterans now who were not covered before with \nemergency room care, we are nowhere near what we need to do. That is \nwhy every one of these veterans organizations supports this. That is \nwhy they did the independent budget.\n  My colleagues have done their best within this allocation. The \nproblem is with the allocation. Frankly, I would have had an \namendment--I say to both of my colleagues; I have such respect for \nthem--I would have had an amendment that would have offset this from \nthe tax cut. Then it would have been blue-slipped because it would not \nhave originated from the House. I didn't want to mess things up for \nthis bill. I couldn't do that.\n  Here is the only place of disagreement. All of what I have to say is \npraise. If I keep doing that, maybe I will even get your votes; you \ndeserve it.\n  Actually, the truth is two- or threefold. No. 1, there has not been \none appropriations bill signed by the President. So actually this isn't \nbusting the overall budget cap. We are early on in the process. It goes \nbeyond this allocation with which I quarrel and you quarrel because you \ndon't have the resources. If we are going to start saying that an \nadditional $600 million to help veterans health care all of a sudden is \na raid on Social Security and Medicare, then watch out, everybody, \nbecause come this fall, that is exactly what is going to happen with \nthe Pentagon budget. There is not one Senator here who does not know \nthat. That is exactly what is going to happen with the education \nbudget. I am talking about appropriations. There is not one Senator who \ndoesn't know that.\n\n  I would venture to say there is not one Senator who will come to the \nfloor right now and challenge me on this point. We all know we are \ngoing to bust the cap. We all know we are going to spend additional \nmoney. And we should. I am just being honest about this in my advocacy \nfor veterans.\n  I don't know why in the world right now we can't do this. There is \nnothing in the world that says you can't do it. As a matter of fact, \nagain, 99 Senators voted for $900 million in an amendment offered by \nSenator Bond--$900 million additional. There was no offset for that.\n  Two or three points: This is a vote that is a test of our priorities. \nWe should do the right thing for veterans, and we should do it now. At \nthe end of the game, come this fall, we know darn well we are going to \nbe investing additional resources in education and the Pentagon. We \nought to do it for veterans. That is what this is about.\n  I say to every Senator, you are on record supporting this. It is not \na game. It is to meet some very real needs. We all know we are going to \nhave to make additional investments anyway, so it goes a little bit \nabove the allocation.\n  Finally, what do we say to veterans who have waited a long time? What \ndo we say to veterans who are desperate for some care so they can stay \nat home and not be in nursing homes? What do we say to veterans who are \nhomeless veterans and we are not getting the care to them? I couldn't \nvote for it because it was in violation of an allocation? People don't \nunderstand that. We ought to do the right thing. I hope Senators will \nsupport this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I don't know what we are going to do in \nthe fall. I don't know what we are going to do in the Pentagon budget. \nI don't know what we are going to do on Labor-HHS appropriations \nrelated to busting the caps.\n  I do know what we have done on VA-HUD. We have met the needs of \nAmerica's veterans. We have done it in very important areas, from \nactual care to long-term care, to recruiting new personnel, to creating \neducational opportunities, to improving our cemeteries and also \nimproving both major and minor construction.\n  Make no mistake: When we vote on this bill, I need my colleagues to \nbe clear. It is not, are you for or against the veterans? That would \npass 100 to nothing. Of course we are for our veterans. It is not, are \nyou for or against veterans health care? We, of course, are for \nveterans health care. That is why we worked so hard on this committee \nto add $1 billion more, $400 million over what the President initially \nthought he needed.\n  This vote is, are you or are you not going to use the VA-HUD bill to \nbreak the budget caps. I don't want to get into geek-speak here about \nthis cap or a feather in your cap. I am talking about ceilings that \nwere placed on spending so that we could have fiscal responsibility, \nfiscal restraint, and at the same time move very important legislation \nand put much-needed funds in the Federal checkbook.\n  A vote for Wellstone is a vote to break the caps. People might want \nto do that, but I want them to be very clear that that is what that is. \nThe consequence of breaking the cap means it will put us into deficit. \nIt will also put us right smack up against having to dip into Social \nSecurity and Medicare trust funds.\n  I voted against the budget because I thought it was too tight. That \nwas several months ago.\n  I voted against the tax bill because I thought it was too lavish. But \nthis is the hand that was dealt to us. I voiced opposition, as I know \nthe excellent colleague from Minnesota has done. But we had an \nallocation. What does an allocation mean? It means we get a 302(b). \nThat is geek-speak for saying this is the amount of money you can \nspend. If you go over it, you plunge the Nation into deficit, and it is \ngoing to take 60 Senators to do that if we raise a point of order.\n  Let's be clear. This is not a vote about veterans health care. This \nis a vote about do we or do we not want to break the budget caps on \nthis bill when, in fact, we have added a billion dollars more for \nveterans health care?\n  I really oppose the Wellstone amendment, not because it doesn't meet \na need but because it will cause us to go into deficit and to dip into \nthese trust funds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I second the very thoughtful comments of the \nSenator from Maryland. This is a very important and significant area. \nWe have allocated as much as we can based on the needs as identified \nand the ability of the VA to spend money on medical care.\n  This amendment would spend money we do not have. We have to operate \nwithin guidelines. We do have a budget and we have an allocation that \nhas been accorded to this committee.\n  I, therefore, raise a point of order that this amendment violates \nsection 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act and provides spending in \nexcess of the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation.\n\n[[Page S8549]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in opposition to the \nmotion to waive the Budget Act with regard to the Wellstone amendment \nto provide additional resources for veterans health care. We all \nrecognize that the limits on discretionary spending contained in the \nbudget resolution are totally inadequate. However, the Senate \nAppropriations Committee is doing its best to produce responsible bills \nthat meet the needs of the American people. Senator Mikulski and \nSenator Bond have done an excellent job in bringing the VA/HUD bill to \nthe floor.\n  The pending bill provides $21,379,742,000 for Veterans Health Care, \nan increase of $1.1 billion or nearly 6 percent over fiscal year 2001 \nand $400 million over the President's request. Given the tight spending \nlimits in the budget resolution, this is a responsible level of \nfunding.\n  I voted against the budget resolution because it provided for an \nirresponsible tax cut and inadequate discretionary spending limits; but \nnow is not the time to break the budget. This bill meets the needs of \nAmerica's veterans. I urge Senators to oppose the motion to waive the \nBudget Act.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I move to waive the relevant section of \nthe Budget Act and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.

The clerk will report the nomination.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Asa \nHutchinson, of Arkansas, to be Administrator of Drug Enforcement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, is there a time agreement entered on this \nnomination?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are three Senators controlling 10 \nminutes each.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Normally as chairman of the authorizing committee I would \ngo first, but I see the distinguished Senator from Arkansas. I yield \nfirst to him as a matter of courtesy, and then I will speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I will be very brief. I have risen with great pride \nto speak in favor of the nomination of my brother, Asa, to head the \nDrug Enforcement Administration. I thank all of my colleagues.\n  I express my appreciation today to all my colleagues who have treated \nAsa with such courtesy, such respect, through the confirmation process. \nI especially express my appreciation to Senator Leahy, the chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee, and to Senator Hatch, for their willingness to \nbe prompt in the hearings and, more than that, their kind comments \nabout Asa and their support. I also express my appreciation to the \nleaders of the Senate: To Senator Daschle, for his support and for his \nwillingness to move the nomination before the August recess, and for \nhis cooperation, as well as Senator Lott and his support.\n  I know Asa would express great appreciation to the Judiciary \nCommittee. They voted 19-0, a unanimous vote. I have great pride in my \nbrother and in his accomplishments, the service he has rendered in the \nHouse of Representatives, his willingness to take on the greatest \nchallenge of his life in leading this effort in the war on drugs, and \nleading this very large and very important agency. He has gained great \nrespect for this institution, the Senate. He has gained great respect \nfor the Members of this institution, and in the cases of so many who \nknow him personally, he holds great affection and values those \nfriendships.\n  I have been asked many times the question, Why? Why does he want this \njob? Why would he leave what is regarded by many as a safe seat in the \nHouse of Representatives? I don't have all the answers to that, but I \nknow he has always wanted to take on a challenge. You could not have a \ngreater challenge than this. More than a challenge, I know Asa has a \nvery deep conviction on this issue. It goes back to his days as a U.S. \nattorney, and certainly it has been something in which he has been \ndeeply involved, the issue in the House of Representatives serving on \nthe Speaker's task force on the war on drugs.\n  I have great confidence that Asa will bring his abilities to bear \nwith tremendous focus on this new challenge and this new job. He is \ngoing to be able to inspire, he will be able to manage, and he will be \nable to motivate this agency in a new way. I know he will bring greater \nenergy to the task and a great vision for a drug-free America.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support for my brother and look \nforward to this vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator from Arkansas for his gracious \ncomments. I am pleased to vote in favor of the nomination of Asa \nHutchinson. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I noticed a hearing \nfor Representative Hutchinson only a very few days after the Senate was \nreorganized. I then held a hearing the following Tuesday, and scheduled \na committee vote for the first Thursday that it was possible to do so. \nWe were able to move so quickly because Representative Hutchinson has \nsubstantial bipartisan support, and because those of us on both sides \nof the aisle view our efforts to reduce drug abuse as a matter of great \nimportance.\n  Mr. Hutchinson was not only recommended by the Bush Administration, \nand, of course, by his Republican colleagues in the House, but also by \n14 of the Democrats whom he serves with on the House Judiciary \nCommittee, who wrote to me in his favor. The ranking member, a \nDemocrat, Representative Conyers from the home State of the Presiding \nOfficer, came and testified in favor of him.\n  Mr. Hutchinson's background is well-suited to his new position as DEA \nAdministrator. He has been deeply involved in drug issues as both a \nUnited States Attorney in Arkansas in the 1980s and as a House member. \nIn addition to serving on the House Judiciary Committee, he is a member \nof the Committee on Government Reform's\n\n[[Page S8550]]\n\nSubcommittee for Criminal Justice, Drug Policy, and Human Resources, \nhas served on the Speaker's Task Force for a Drug Free America, and has \nreviewed Plan Colombia as a member of the Permanent Select Committee on \nIntelligence.\n  The Senator from Arkansas mentioned that his brother learned a great \ndeal about the Senate during the number of days he spent on the Senate \nfloor on another matter, the impeachment trial of President Clinton. He \nand I were on opposite sides on that issue, but we spent a lot of time \ntogether during that process, including during the deposition phase of \nthe trial.\n  I heard a number of people say the Democratic Senators on the \nJudiciary Committee and this chairman would not approve a House manager \nfrom that impeachment trial, or that we might delay him for months and \nmonths and months, as was done over the last administration. Nothing \ncould be further from the truth. I had a great deal of respect for him \nevery time I dealt with him. He was absolutely truthful with me. He \nnever broke his word to me, never broke a commitment to me, or vice \nversa, I might say. It was the way Congress used to be and always \nshould be. Members always kept their word and a commitment with each \nother and were honest with each other. He was that way with me.\n  I was grateful for Representative Hutchinson's words at the hearing:\n\n       Chairman Leahy, if I might, it would have been easy for you \n     to yield to some of those who expected a critical view of my \n     nomination because of previous controversies, which found us \n     on different sides. But I want to thank you personally for \n     taking a different approach and for seeing my nomination as \n     an opportunity to demonstrate to the American people that, \n     despite any differences that might exist, we can be in \n     harmony on one of the most critical problems that faces our \n     nation.\n\n  Representative Hutchinson and I have similar views about some of the \ndrug issues facing the United States, and I am sure we will \noccasionally have differing views about others. But I appreciated the \ncandor with which he answered the questions of committee members at \nboth his hearing and in subsequent written questions. I know that he \nwill take to heart the matters that committee members raised, \nespecially the need to revisit our current use of mandatory minimum \nsentences for criminal drug offenses. A 1997 study by the RAND \nCorporation of mandatory minimum drug sentences found that ``mandatory \nminimums are not justifiable on the basis of cost-effectiveness at \nreducing cocaine consumption, cocaine expenditures, or drug-related \ncrime.'' Despite this study and the mounting evidence of prison \novercrowding we have seen in the ensuing years, legislators continue to \npropose additional mandatory minimums. I know that Representative \nHutchinson has expressed some hesitancy about expanding mandatory \nminimums, and I hope we can work together on this issue.\n\n  I was happy to hear the nominee offer his support in his oral and \nwritten testimony for drug treatment and prevention efforts. He and I \nagree that although law enforcement plays a vital role in stopping drug \nabuse, law enforcement alone cannot do the job. Both the Congress and \nthe Administration need to do more to reduce demand, and I hope that \nMr. Hutchinson will be a partner in that effort.\n  The nominee has also expressed concerns about the sentencing \ndisparity between those convicted of offenses involving crack and \npowder cocaine. Current Federal sentencing guidelines treat one gram of \ncrack cocaine and 100 grams of powder cocaine equally for purposes of \ndetermining sentences. The U.S. Sentencing Commission has previously \nrecommended equalizing these penalties by reducing the mandatory \nminimum penalties that currently apply to crack offenses. \nUnfortunately, Congress has not followed that recommendation. Finding a \nfair solution to this problem has been stalled by concerns that \naddressing this issue is too politically perilous--this Congress should \novercome those fears and solve this discrepancy.\n  In conclusion, Asa Hutchinson is an excellent nominee. I am glad that \nthe Judiciary Committee was able to work with him and with the \nAdministration to expedite his nomination, and I look forward to \nworking with him over the coming years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am pleased to support Asa Hutchinson to this position. \nIt is one of the most important positions in our country. I believe he \nis the right man for the right job and he will do a job that I think \nwill make everyone proud.\n  Asa Hutchinson is a giant in the House of Representatives. I agree \nwith his brother, I don't know why he is leaving the House of \nRepresentatives, but this is a very challenging, important job and he \nis up to that job. I have every confidence he will do a terrific job \nand have the support of Congress in doing so.\n  I was so impressed with Asa Hutchinson during the impeachment matter. \nHe always acted fairly, he acted in a measured, considered way, he was \ndecent throughout, and of course he was extremely talented as a lawyer, \nsomebody for whom I have the utmost respect, and I am very pleased to \nsupport him today.\n  I commend the Senate Democratic leadership for calling up the \nnomination of Congressman Asa Hutchinson, who will be the next \nAdministrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration. DEA needs a \ndynamic, innovative, and experienced leader, and I am confident that \nCongressman Hutchinson's past experiences prosecuting drug crimes as a \nUnited States Attorney and formulated drug policy as a Congressman have \nprepared him well to take the helm of the DEA. I applaud President Bush \nfor focusing intently on this crucial issue and for his excellent \nchoice of nominees to head America's two most important anti-drug \noffices, the DEA and the White House Office of National Drug Control \nPolicy (ONDCP).\n  The epidemic of illegal drug use in this country remains one of our \nmost urgent priorities. There is a growing consensus that we need a \ncomprehensive strategy embracing both demand and supply reduction in \nour struggle against drug abuse. I have said repeatedly that the time \nhas come to increase the resources we devote to preventing people from \nusing drugs in the first place and to breaking the cycle of addiction \nfor those whose lives are devastated by these substances. This is a \nbipartisan view, which I am pleased to say is shared by our President, \nCongressman Hutchinson, and by many of my Senate colleagues.\n  While we need to shore up the resources dedicated to prevention and \ntreatment, we must remain committed to the necessary and integral role \nlaw enforcement plays in combating drug use. The DEA has a long, \ndistinguished history of protecting America's citizens from the \ndestructive drugs sold by traffickers and the attendant violence. \nParticularly in today's world, where drug trafficking is an \ninternational, multibillion dollar business, DEA's cooperative working \nagreements with foreign source and transit countries are essential in \npreventing illegal drugs from being smuggled into the United States.\n  While I commend the Senate Democratic leadership for scheduling the \nvote on Congressman Hutchinson, I also urge them to schedule promptly a \nhearing and confirm John Walters, whose nomination to be Director of \nONDCP is being stalled. Almost three months have passed since the \nPresident announced his intent to nominate Mr. Walters to be the \ncountry's next drug czar, and yet he remains the only cabinet level \nnominee who has not been confirmed, much less granted a hearing.\n  There are many good reasons why we need a drug czar, but the most \nimportant one is that we owe it to our youth. Tragically, drug use by \nteens is again rising, particularly use of so-called ``club drugs'' \nsuch as Ecstasy and GHB. Over the past two years, use of ecstasy among \n12th graders increased dramatically by 140 percent. Predictably, during \nthis same period the number of emergency room visits associated with \nthe use of ecstasy also increased a shocking 295 percent. By the time \nthey graduate from high school, over 50 percent of our youth have used \nan illicit drug.\n  We cannot play politics with the drug czar position. We need to act \nimmediately to reverse these soaring numbers and to prevent our youth \nfrom endangering their lives. Mr. Walters is well-qualified to lead \nthis effort, and he has the support of law enforcement, prevention \ngroups, and public policy\n\n[[Page S8551]]\n\norganizations. I urge the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, my good \nfriend Senator Leahy, to schedule a hearing soon for Mr. Walters. Once \nthe top positions at both the DEA and ONDCP have been filled, we can \nall begin to work together to effect real change that will benefit all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I rise to make some remarks about Asa \nHutchinson. I had the pleasure of serving with him as U.S. attorney. We \nmet at a conference. I remember having breakfast with him. We had never \nmet before. I learned something about him, his character and his \ncommitment to public service.\n  He is going to be one of the finest DEA leaders we have ever had. He \nserved on the House Judiciary Committee. I worked with him on that \ncommittee, since I have been on the Senate Judiciary Committee. During \nthat time, I came to respect him terrifically.\n  During the impeachment hearings, he had the burden of stating the \ncase, basically the factual allegations involved, as one of the House \nmanagers. In my view, as a prosecutor of over 16 years, his was the \nmost comprehensive, most intelligent, most valuable statement that \noccurred during that entire hearing. If anybody would like to know what \nthe facts were and what the allegations were in that impeachment \nhearing, they should read his summary of the facts. It did exactly what \nhe was required to do: faithfully and fairly and honestly state the \nallegations that were there and the facts that backed them up. It was \ncomprehensive, honest, and complete. I respected him for it.\n  His brother Tim, of course, serves in this body. I serve with him on \ntwo committees. I respect Tim terrifically. They are both men of \nintegrity, deep personal faith, and a commitment to public service that \nis remarkable.\n  Asa Hutchinson will reflect well on President Bush as his nominee. I \nthink he will do an outstanding job. I look forward to working with \nhim, and I know he will effectively turn the tide against increasing \ndrug use in America.\n  Finally, let me say, with regard to the FBI and the DEA, now we have \nseen two of the finest nominees you can expect to have in Bob Mueller, \na professional's professional, a man who has received prominence in \nboth Democrat and Republican administrations, as the head of the FBI, \nand Asa Hutchinson at DEA, a man of commitment and integrity and \nability to head that important organization.\n  I am excited for both of them. I believe the President has done a \ngood job. I think America will be served well by their efforts.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object, would the distinguished leader be willing to amend that to \nallow me to speak before that for 4 minutes on judicial nominations?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to amend that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the majority leader has asked me to \nannounce to everyone that he wants to finish this bill tonight. We have \nexchanged lists with the minority. Hopefully, by the time we finish \nthis next debate, we will be in a posture to lock in whatever \namendments are in order and move forward on this bill.\n  As everyone knows, there are a lot of people interested in the \nAgriculture bill. That has been around for a day or two. So Senator \nDaschle wanted me to state that he wants to do everything he can to \nfinish this bill tonight. We hope people will understand there will be \nsome votes throughout the evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I thank the Senate for moving \nexpeditiously on the Hutchinson nomination. I note that on Monday and \nTuesday of this week the Judiciary Committee followed through on its \nconfirmation hearing for Robert Mueller III, the President's nominee to \nbe Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I mention this \nbecause this was the fifth confirmation hearing the Judiciary Committee \nheld in July for judicial and executive branch nominees, which is \npretty good because we were not allowed, under the reorganization, to \nhave Members assigned to our committee until July 10.\n  In fact, I cannot think of any time in the last 6 years where the \nJudiciary Committee held five confirmation hearings in 3 weeks. Two of \nthose hearings involved judicial nominees to the Courts of Appeals.\n  I appreciate the fact that the Senator from Montana, Mr. Baucus, \nnoted that we held the hearing on the two district court nominees for \nMontana ``in a very expeditious fashion.'' It was gracious of Senator \nHutchinson to offer his thanks for our scheduling the confirmation \nhearing of Asa Hutchinson to be head of the DEA ``so expeditiously'' \nafter Senate reorganization. I appreciate William Riley, the nominee to \nthe Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, thanking the Judiciary Committee \nfor ``holding a prompt hearing.'' It was gratifying when Senator \nCochran noted that he was ``very pleased with the dispatch'' with which \nwe held a\n\n[[Page S8552]]\n\nhearing on the nomination of Jim Ziglar to head the INS. And this week, \nMr. Mueller thanked us for holding his hearing as quickly as we did.\n  With respect to executive branch nominees, considering the fact that \nthe committee has only been able to hold hearings for 3 weeks, our work \nperiod has been outstanding. We held back-to-back days of hearings for \nthe President's nominees to head the Drug Enforcement Administration \nand the Immigration and Naturalization Service 2 weeks ago, and 2 days \nof hearings on the nominee to head the FBI this week. In addition, we \nhave held hearings on the Assistant Attorney General to head the Tax \nDivision, the Assistant Attorney General to head the Office of Justice \nPrograms, and the Director of the National Institute of Justice--all in \nJuly.\n  We would have done more if we had been allowed to do this, of course, \nduring the month of June. So the Senate has considered and confirmed \nthe Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, the Solicitor \nGeneral, the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal \nDivision, the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil Rights \nDivision, the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust \nDivision, the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Office of \nLegislative Affairs, the Assistant Attorney General in charge of Policy \nDevelopment, and other key officials within the Department of Justice, \nas well as the Commissioner of the INS and, today, the Administrator of \nthe Drug Enforcement Administration.\n  I hope we can move very quickly on the Director of the FBI.\n  We have not received the nomination yet for the No. 3 job at the \nDepartment of Justice, the Associate Attorney General. We have not yet \nreceived the nomination of someone to head the U.S. Marshals Service. \nEven though we are about to go into an August recess, we have not \nreceived a single nomination for any of the 94 U.S. marshals who serve \nin districts within our States. We have only received a handful of \nnominations for the 93 U.S. attorney positions that are in districts \nwithin our States.\n  So there is a lot to be done. And it will be done if we work \ntogether, and not if we have people come and give statements on the \nfloor, or elsewhere, that are not factual because, unfortunately, as \nsomebody once said, those pesky little facts get in the way. And these \nare the facts. There is no time, in the 25 years I have been in the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, that I have seen so many nominees move in a \n3-week period in the middle of the year.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/01/senate-section/article/S8552-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8552-S8562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDEPARTMENTS OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND \n        INDEPENDENT AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2002--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is an order for the recognition of the \nSenator from California at this time.\n  The Senator from California.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1219 To Amendment No. 1214\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself, Mr. \n     Nelson of Florida, and Mr. Biden, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1219 to amendment No. 1214.\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n       Sec.  . The Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency, pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act, shall \n     immediately put into effect a new national primary drinking \n     water regulation for arsenic that--\n       (1) establishes a standard for arsenic at a level providing \n     for the protection of the population in general, fully taking \n     into account those at greater risk, such as infants, \n     children, pregnant women, the elderly and those with a \n     history of serious illness; and\n       (2) lifts the suspension on the effective date for the \n     community right to know requirements included in the national \n     primary drinking water regulation for arsenic published on \n     January 22, 2001, in the Federal Register (66 Fed. Reg. \n     6976).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I have an amendment now pending before \nthe Senate. I am very proud of this amendment. I have offered it on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Nelson of Florida, and Senator Biden, and \nmany other Senators who are very supportive of this amendment.\n  The reason I had the clerk read the amendment in its entirety is \nbecause it is written in plain English and is very straightforward.\n  Essentially it says that the Administrator for the Environmental \nProtection Agency shall immediately put into effect a new standard, a \nnew primary drinking water regulation for arsenic that will, in \nessence, protect our people from arsenic in their drinking water. The \nsecond part says that we will lift the suspension on the effective date \nfor the community right-to-know mailers that were supposed to go out, \nletting people know how much arsenic is in their water.\n  I hope all of us will agree, people have a right to know that.\n  I want to talk a little bit about how this amendment came to be \ntoday, how we got on this road. Frankly, we should not be here. In the \nlast administration, they set a new level for arsenic in water at 10 \nparts per billion. It was going to go into effect, and then this \nadministration suspended it.\n  What we are doing in our amendment today is not even saying go back \nto 10. I certainly hope they go to 5. But notwithstanding that, we just \nsay: Put a new standard in place because the standard that is in place, \nas I talk to you tonight, is 50 parts per billion. We need to move this \nforward.\n  Let me explain why this happened. I know I have 30 minutes. Will the \nChair let me know when I have gone on for 15?\n  I thank the Chair.\n  What we see on this green chart is what this Senate passed last year \nin this very same bill. It said: The Administrator shall promulgate a \nnational primary drinking water regulation for arsenic not later than \nJune 22, 2001. What happened? It didn't happen. They repealed the \nClinton standard and went back to the 50 parts per billion standard \nwhich everyone agrees is way too high to drink our water in a safe \nfashion. This date slipped.\n  In essence, we have a situation where the Congress said to the \nPresident: You shall do this. The President signed this. This was \nPresident Clinton. This was the law of the land. And yet the date \nslipped.\n  I want to get into the reasons why this is so important, beyond the \nfact that we have gone back to the old standard and the President, in \nmy view, did not have the right to do that.\n  This is a chart I actually got from the House side where the House \nhas passed a very strong arsenic amendment, even stronger than what we \nhave before us. What you see on this chart is, the darker the red dot, \nthe more arsenic in the water. You can see that there is virtually \narsenic in almost all our States. There are some that are fortunate. \nThey don't have it. But there is a huge amount of arsenic around the \ncountry.\n  Why is this important? I know intuitively people would say arsenic is \nbad. We know that intuitively. But it is more than intuition. It is \nscience. It is lots and lots of science. I want to put that on the \nrecord tonight.\n  There is a Dartmouth study that came out in March of 2001: Arsenic \nDisrupts Critical Hormone Functions. That is what this study showed. It \ndoesn't say ``it may.'' It doesn't say ``it might.'' It says it does. \nIt disrupts critical hormone functions. What does this mean to us? It \nmeans increased risk of diabetes, increased risk of cardiovascular \ndisease, increased risk of cancer.\n\n  When we throw up our hands and we say, did you ever believe how much \ndiabetes there is, how much cancer there is, what are the answers? We \nare starting to get the answers. Science is giving us the answers. This \nis one of the answers.\n  Here is another one, another study, Chemical Research in Toxicology, \nan EPA study completed April 2001. They say: There is a direct link \nbetween arsenic and DNA damage. They didn't say there ``may be.'' They \ndidn't say ``perhaps.'' They said there is. What does this mean to us? \nIncreased risk of cancer, and no level of arsenic is completely safe.\n\n[[Page S8553]]\n\n  That is why the second part of our amendment is so crucial because it \nis the community's right to know. When you go to your mailbox under \nthis part of the amendment, you will find out once a year how much \narsenic is in your water.\n  Here is another scientific study, done in Taiwan, very well \nrespected, it appeared in the American Journal of Epidemiology. This is \nwhat they found: Compared to the general population, people who drink \nwater with arsenic levels between 10.1 parts per billion and 50 parents \nper billion are twice as likely to get certain urinary cancers. It \ndoesn't say ``maybe'' they are twice as likely. What does this mean? \nThe U.S. drinking water standard for arsenic must be immediately set at \nthe lowest possible level.\n  That is what the Boxer-Nelson-Biden-Corzine amendment et al does.\n  Let's look at the countries and the different levels they have of \narsenic in their water. This is very instructive.\n  This is an important chart because it shows where the countries of \nthe world are in terms of arsenic levels in their water. What we find \nis the one with the least arsenic allowed happens to be Australia. That \nis 7 parts per billion. Then we go to the European Union where it is 10 \nparts per billion. Japan is 10 parts per billion. The World Health \nOrganization is 10 parts per billion. Then you get up to where \nPresident Bush put us when he suspended the Clinton standard of 10. The \nClinton standard of 10 was with the European Union and Japan and the \nWHO. But now we are with Bangladesh, Bolivia, China, India, and \nIndonesia. This is not where we want to be, I say to my friends. This \nis an amazing place for us to be as a nation that is the leader in \nscience and technology and health care. So this is wrong on its face.\n\n  Let's look at the cancer numbers pretty specifically. I have saved \ntime for all my friends who are here. I said before that there is no \nsafe level of arsenic in drinking water. We know that to be the case. \nBut what we are trying to do is at least get a level that is achievable \nthat we can accomplish and we can take credit for and get it done.\n  If you look at this chart, it is kind of chilling. If you look at \nwhere we are on the Bush standard--50 parts per billion--1 in 100 of us \nwill get cancer if we drink out of that water supply at 50 parts per \nbillion. That is the Bush law right now. At 20 parts per billion, the \ncancer risk goes down to 1 in 250 people. At 10 parts per billion, it \nis 1 in 500. You are not altogether safe there either, but it is a lot \nbetter than the 50 parts per billion, which is 1 in 100. If you go to 3 \nparts per billion, the risk goes down more. I think this is very \nimportant.\n  Let me tell you what one of the water districts is saying about this. \nIt is the American Waterworks Association, the California-Nevada \nsection. These are people who, you would think, would be fighting us, \nwould not want to invest in getting the arsenic out of the water. They \nsay:\n\n       While the standard is in limbo--\n\n  By that they mean the Clinton standard was suspended and we have no \nnew standard; it went back to the old standard of 50.\n  They say:\n\n       the enforcement deadlines are not. Now the systems affected \n     are facing an unrealistic time line for compliance, which \n     creates a handicap in meeting this critical health goal.\n\n  They are upset that they have no number, they have no goal they have \nto reach. It makes it harder and harder for them to take action. By the \nway, they did endorse the 10 parts per billion level.\n  In closing this part before I save a little time at the end, let me \nagain say what happened when George Bush became President. A lot \nhappened, but on this issue this is what happened. He took this little \n``suspended'' stamp and suspended the 10 parts per billion standard \nthat President Clinton had put in place after lots of scientific study. \nHe also suspended--in some ways, to me, this is even worse. He \nsuspended the community right to know. So not only did he suspend the \nClinton standard at 10 parts per billion, but he suspended the Clinton \ncommunity right-to-know provision that said if you live in a \ncommunity--a rural community, an urban community, a farm community--you \nhave the right to know if you have arsenic in your water, because if \nyou have a baby in the house and that arsenic is up there at 30, 40, 50 \nparts per billion, watch out. If someone is sick with cancer, or AIDS, \nor has any type of heart condition, watch out. So he suspended \neverything good when it came to these rules.\n  It is time we do something very good tonight. I have some good \nfeelings about the response we are getting to this amendment. I am \nhoping for an overwhelming vote.\n  I ask the Chair how much time I have remaining on my side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 18\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. May I ask the Senator, would he like to take some time or \nare my colleagues under a rush?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If I might propose that we hear from Senator Nelson of \nFlorida for 3 minutes, and then we will go over to Senator Domenici for \nas much time as he wants to use. Is that fair?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, we have 30 minutes. The way I look at \nit, we don't need the entire 30 minutes. If you can do with less, we \ncan vote sooner.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I doubt it. I will try. Everybody here wishes to speak.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is fine. I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield to Senator Nelson for 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I may need another couple of \nminutes.\n  I thank you for this opportunity to support the Boxer amendment. This \nis just a lot of common sense. You have seen all of the technical and \nscientific statements that have been made about why it is important to \nreduce the level of arsenic in drinking water.\n  We have recently, in Florida, encountered another aspect of arsenic \npoisoning which has brought this particular element to the forefront of \nFloridians' minds. It is the fact of arsenic-treated wood--the wood \nbeing used for playground equipment. And now we are having so many of \nour cities and our counties closing the playgrounds because when the \nrains come, it leeches through the arsenic-treated wood onto the \nplayground soil, and in many cases local health departments have \ndetermined that that is unsafe for children. Yet everyone is really in \nconfusion as to what is safe and what is unsafe. The EPA was not even \ngoing to complete that study until 2003. We urged them to speed it up. \nThey promised that by this June they would have their study done, and \nnow they have delayed it on into the fall.\n  In the meantime, local governments have closed playgrounds. Some of \nthem have reopened the playgrounds, not knowing whether this poison, \nknown as arsenic, used in treating the wood--and it was never known \nthat it would be a problem--whether or not this is a hazard to our \nchildren's health in the soil of those playgrounds.\n  I tell you this story because this is on the minds of a lot of \nFloridians right now. As we come to a question of what is the safe \nlevel of arsenic in drinking water, as Senator Boxer has said over and \nover, EPA has stated that arsenic is dangerous. They have classified it \nas a known carcinogen. They have said over a long period of time that \nwe ought to be studying this. As a matter of fact, in 1962 the U.S. \nPublic Health Service recommended decreasing the 50 parts per billion \nstandard to 10 parts per billion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 3 minutes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. May I have an additional minute?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely. I yield an additional minute.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I can't say everything I want to say in 1 \nminute. Let me conclude by saying that if ever there was something \nhaving to do with common sense, and you have all of this scientific \nevidence behind you that says we ought to reduce the standard from 50 \nto 10 parts per billion, then we as stewards of the public trust ought \nto act on that. So, Madam President, that is why I stand and strongly \nadvocate that our colleagues vote for this amendment. I am pleased to \njoin Senator Boxer as a sponsor of the amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n\n[[Page S8554]]\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator from California. I will try not to \ntake the whole 3 minutes.\n  If there is one thing that got the attention of the American people, \nof everything that has happened in the last 7 months, it is this issue. \nWhy? The only thing I have ever seen that every Conservative, Liberal, \nDemocrat, Republican, Socialist, Communist, Fascist--anybody who has a \nwater tap in America--agrees upon, it is they fully expect, above all \nelse, when they turn on their water tap, the water they are about to \nconsume or give to their children is healthful, not harmful.\n  We can argue about 50 parts per billion, 10 parts per billion. This \nhas been a revelation to the vast majority of the American people who \ndo not already have water that is being held to the highest standard. \nWe do not have to say anything back to folks in Delaware other than \nthat our standards are the same as Bangladesh, lower than Europe.\n  This is not complicated. The science sustains the position that was \ntaken. This was not arrived at. We are not even dictating 10 parts per \nbillion in this amendment. We both wish we were, but we are not even \ndoing that.\n  I conclude my very brief comments by saying my State of Delaware is \nnot known as some liberal bastion. We are the corporate State of \nAmerica. The legislature in my State of Delaware passed a law which \nsays water coming out of the taps in Delaware can be no less than 10 \nparts per billion.\n  To those who do not like this amendment, get ready to explain it at \nhome.\n  I compliment the Senator. She is dead on. This is one issue that \nevery single constituent I know, unless they own a mining company, \nsupports.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise in support of Senator Boxer's \namendment to establish once and for all a protective standard for \narsenic in our Nation's drinking water.\n  As most of my colleagues know, I have had a longstanding interest in \ncancer. For me this fight is a personal one.\n  I lost my father and my husband to cancer. My current husband, \nRichard, lost both his parents to cancer. And I have lost a host of \ndear friends to this terrible disease.\n  With cancer, you're never the same after experiencing this with a \nloved one. You're determined to do something about it.\n  This is the major reason I was extremely disappointed when the \ncurrent administration, soon after taking office, postponed the \nimplementation of Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) new drinking \nwater standard for arsenic earlier this year.\n  Arsenic has long been know as a carcinogen, a substance that produces \ncancer, and yet the current administration shelved the new rule in 58 \ndays flat.\n  Administration officials explained that the reason for this \npostponement was to allow for additional scientific review. I find this \nposition difficult to comprehend when one considers how much scientific \nreview has gone into this ruling.\n  The Federal Government has studied arsenic for almost 40 years.\n  In fact, few government environmental decisions have been more \nthoroughly researched, over so many years, than the EPA's move to lower \nthe allowable level of arsenic in drinking water from 50 parts per \nbillion (ppb) to 10 ppb.\n  This standard was first proposed by the U.S. Public Health Service \nback in 1962. Over the next three decades, regulators weighed dozens of \nstudies on the issue as they struggled to balance the health risks, \nwhich mostly include increased risk of cancer, with the costs of \nextracting the metal from drinking water.\n  We should take note of a recent report by the National Academy of \nSciences. In this report the Academy concluded that the arsenic \nstandard for drinking water of 50 ppb, set in 1942 before arsenic was \nknown to cause cancer, ``does not achieve EPA's goal for public health \nprotection and, therefore, requires downward revision as promptly as \npossible.''\n  In fact, the Academy reported that drinking water at the current EPA \nstandard of 50 ppb ``could easily'' result in a total fatal cancer risk \nof 1 in 100 about 10,000 times higher than the cancer risk EPA allows \nfor carcinogens in food.\n  And we should remember that children's increased exposures to \nenvironmental carcinogens, such as arsenic, are potentially even more \nserious.\n  Children's higher risk results from the fact that they breath more \nair, drink more water and eat more food per pound than do adults; for \nexample, a child in the first six months of life consumes seven times \nas much water per pound of body weight as does the average American \nadult.\n  Therefore, a carcinogen has a much more significant impact on a \nchild.\n  There are over 70,000 chemicals in common use today in the United \nStates and several dozen known carcinogens, according to the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency.\n  Rachel Carson warned us in 1962, ``For the first time in the history \nof the world, every human being is now subjected to contact with \ndangerous chemicals, from the moment of conception until death.''\n  For those dangerous chemicals which we have the ability to limit from \nhuman exposure, such as arsenic in drinking water, we should absolutely \ntake the necessary steps to do so.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I rise today in support of this \namendment. The current standard for acceptable arsenic levels in \ndrinking water was established in 1942 and, as early as 1962, \nrecommendations were made by the U.S. Public Health Service that the 50 \nparts per billion standard should be changed. The science indicates \nthat at 50 parts per billion (ppb), the cancer risk from arsenic is 1-\nin-100. EPA regulations are supposed to regulate to a 1-in-10,000 \narsenic risk.\n  Today's amendment simply directs the administration to put a new \nstandard into effect immediately and gives communities the right to \nknow the arsenic levels in their drinking water.\n  However, I am concerned about the potential impacts that reducing the \nlevel of arsenic in drinking water might have on small or rural \ncommunities, like many in my home State of North Dakota. North Dakota \nhas approximately 35 communities that might be especially hard hit by a \nmore stringent arsenic in drinking water standard. That is why I am a \ncosponsor of legislation sponsored by Senator Reid that would increase \nfunding for small communities to help treat drinking water systems for \narsenic and other contaminants. I am pleased that Senator Jeffords has \ncommitted to examine these critical funding issues in conjunction with \nproviding his support for today's amendment.\n  The World Health Organization and the European Union have adopted a \n10 parts per billion standard. Even if the United States does not adopt \na 10 parts per billion, at 50 parts per billion, the United States' \narsenic standard is on par with that of Bahrain, Bolivia, Egypt, \nIndonesia, Oman, China, and India.\n  Countries who have adopted a 10 parts per billion standard include: \nthe entire European Union (in 1998), Laos (in 1999), Syria (in 1994), \nNamibia, Mongolia (in 1998), and Japan (in 1993). Australia has had a 7 \nparts per billion standard since 1996. As I said, it is time to move in \nthe direction of a safer, more protective, standard.\n  While arsenic levels may fluctuate over time, what is most \nsignificant from the standpoint of cancer risk is long-term exposure. \nStudies have linked long-term exposure to arsenic in drinking water to \ncancer of the bladder, lungs, skin, kidney, nasal passages, liver, and \nprostate. Noncancer effects of ingesting arsenic include \ncardiovascular, pulmonary, immunological, neurological, and endocrine \n(e.g., diabetes) effects. Short-term exposure to high doses of arsenic \ncan cause other adverse health effects, but such effects are unlikely \nto occur from U.S. public water supplies that are in compliance with \nthe existing arsenic standard of 50 ppb.\n  A March 1999 report by the National Academy of Sciences concluded \nthat the current standard does not achieve EPA's goal of protecting \npublic health and should be lowered as soon as possible, according to \nthe EPA.\n  So, we should act immediately to adopt a new standard, as this \namendment would require. We also must provide funding that is critical \nto accomplishing this goal.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I want to state for the record that I \nfully\n\n[[Page S8555]]\n\nrecognize the importance of ensuring that all Americans have safe and \nclean drinking water. As the ranking member of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, I helped author the 1996 Safe Drinking Water \nAct, I also understand the health hazards posed by unsafe levels of \narsenic in our drinking water supplies.\n  However, I also understand the difficulties faced by small water \nsystems as they struggle to pay for the infrastructure they need to \nmake sure their systems are in compliance with federal regulations. A \nlot of Montanans get their water from rural water systems. A lot of \nrural Montanans are struggling to make ends meet with low incomes. The \nlast thing we want is to put small systems in a position where they \nhave to charge their customers rates they just can't afford. We have a \nresponsibility to these people, to make sure that not only do they have \nclean, safe water, but that they can afford it.\n  I am glad that Senator Boxer and others have stated they recognize \nthis problem and that they are willing to help make sure the Federal \nGovernment steps up to the plate with the necessary funding. I am \npleased to hear that Senator Jeffords will take up in September Senator \nReid's bill to help small community drinking water systems pay for \ninfrastructure improvements. I pledge to do whatever I can to support \nSenator Reid's bill in the Environment and Public Works Committee and I \nwill become a cosponsor of that bill.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to provide some \nadditional materials to be printed in the Record regarding the debate \nover the drinking water standard for arsenic. These materials will \ninform our understanding of issues associated with the process used in \ndeveloping a new arsenic drinking water standard and the science behind \nthat process.\n  The first item is a letter sent by me, along with Senators Domenici, \nKyl, Hatch and Bennett, to Administrator Whitman, dated June 21, 2001.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a statement from \nthe National Rural Water Users Association on this same matter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 21, 2001.\n     Hon. Christine Todd Whitman,\n     Administrator, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Administrator Whitman: We are writing to reiterate our \n     strong interest in the development of a new arsenic drinking \n     water standard and to commend you for your decision to pull \n     back for further study the standard promulgated in the final \n     days of the Clinton Administration. Ensuring the safety of \n     our nation's water supply is essential, but it is also \n     important that decisions be based upon sound science and \n     consideration of the health benefits and costs that will \n     accrue to the American public. We applaud your pronouncement \n     that you are committed to such a principle, and as you \n     proceed, we encourage you to work closely with the states and \n     municipalities that will be most impacted by a new standard. \n     We are concerned, however, that you will be limiting your \n     review to a standard of between 3 parts per billion (ppb) to \n     20 ppb. This does appear to predetermine the outcome of your \n     scientific review and we would like to suggest that a more \n     appropriate approach would be to expand the review to \n     anything below the current standard of 50 ppb.\n       We are extremely troubled by the way the past \n     Administration developed the 10 ppb standard. Agency staff \n     ignored recommendations from the National Research Council \n     (NRC), the General Accounting Office (GAO) and its own \n     Science Advisory Board (SAB). The NRC suggested that the \n     Agency consider a non-linear or sublinear dose-response model \n     as it examined arsenic at low levels, rather than relying \n     solely on a linear model. The National Research Council also \n     suggested that the Agency factor in the known shortcomings of \n     a thirty-year old Taiwanese study, which the Agency was using \n     extensively.\n       In October, a GAO report questioned EPA's conservative \n     assumptions, its reliance on a conservative linear model and \n     its heavy reliance on the Taiwan study. The SAB added its \n     voice in December by criticizing the Agency for failing to \n     take the advice of the NRC and for not taking into account \n     the deficiencies in the Taiwan data in predicting U.S. risk. \n     Further, the Agency chose to ignore a study conducted in Utah \n     that found no bladder or lung cancer in individuals exposed \n     to arsenic at levels greater than 100 ppb because in order \n     for the linear model to determine a dose response \n     relationship, only studies that have documented cancer cases \n     can be incorporated.\n       The controversy surrounding the appropriate standard \n     extends beyond the health effects evaluation. EPA has \n     seriously underestimated the cost to community water systems \n     and ultimately, to private households. In fact, a recent \n     report published by the AIE-Brookings Joint Center for \n     Regulatory Studies finds that the costs of the final rule \n     will exceed the benefits by about $190 million annually and \n     may actually result in a net loss of about ten lives annually \n     by diverting scarce resources away from meeting other health \n     care needs. In addition, the SAB expressed concerns about \n     assumptions made in EPA's analysis about the disposal of \n     arsenic residuals. For example, removing arsenic from \n     drinking water will generate wastes that will in many cases \n     be considered hazardous under applicable regulations, e.g. \n     RCRA. Further, water systems will face considerable costs and \n     liabilities for on-site storage, transport to an approved \n     facility, and suitable disposal. EPA has not considered these \n     costs. The SAB also raised concern over treatment options EPA \n     set forth as best available treatment technologies, some of \n     which have not been applied to arsenic removal on such a \n     large scale.\n       The geological configurations in the West, combined with \n     dispersed population centers served by multiple, small water \n     systems, result in the Rocky Mountain States being \n     significantly impacted by imposition of any new arsenic \n     standard. For example, the State of New Mexico estimates the \n     cost of compliance with a 10 ppb standard to be approximately \n     $400 million in initial outlays, with a recurring annual cost \n     of $15 to $16 million. The State of Arizona's estimate is \n     $983 million in initial capital outlays, with a recurring \n     annual cost in excess of $26 million. Other western states \n     will be similarly impacted. Our states will be particularly \n     affected because the final rule includes non-community/non-\n     transient water systems under the standard, a departure from \n     the proposed standard. Because these systems were not part of \n     the proposed rule, compliance costs--which would be \n     significant--were not included in the cost-benefit analysis. \n     Further, according to the preamble of the final rule, EPA did \n     not even consider compliance costs for the State of Arizona. \n     It is our belief, therefore, that the Agency's cost estimates \n     are vastly underestimated.\n       In closing, let us again commend you for your commitment to \n     the use of the best science in establishing a new arsenic \n     drinking water standard and encourage you to continue to \n     stand above the attempts to politicize this important health \n     issue.\n           Sincerely,\n     Pete V. Domenici.\n     Jon Kyl.\n     Larry E. Craig.\n     Orrin G. Hatch.\n     Robert F. Bennett.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             National Rural Water Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 1, 2001.\n\nStatement on VA, HUD Appropriations Amendment To Limit EPA's Review of \n                    the Arsenic Drinking Water Rule\n\n       The National Rural Water Association (NRWA), representing \n     over 20,000 rural and small community members, urges Members \n     of the Senate not a legislatively limit EPA's review of the \n     arsenic drinking water rule in light of the rule's impact in \n     thousands of rural communities, especially their low income \n     populations.\n       In 1996, with the passage of the Safe Drinking Water Act, \n     we welcomed a new law with provisions to assist small \n     communities as described by Senator Baucus on the Senate \n     Floor, ``The bill provides special help to small systems that \n     cannot afford to comply with the drinking water regulations \n     and can benefit from technologies geared specifically to the \n     needs of small systems. Here is how it would work. Any system \n     serving 10,000 people or fewer may request a variance to \n     install special small system technology identified by EPA. \n     What this means is that if a small system cannot afford to \n     comply with current regulations through conventional \n     treatment, the system can comply with the act by installing \n     affordable small system technology.''\n       Since the 1996 amendments, the only variance we have seen \n     granted by EPA was for the City of Columbus, Ohio. We don't \n     feel that the 1996 Act is working the way it was intended and \n     this needs to the fixed if small communities are to comply \n     with EPA rules. The arsenic rule is a case in point. In the \n     January 22, 2001 rule, EPA chose not to allow small \n     communities to utilize the affordable variance authority by \n     finding it was not needed because the rule was \n     ``affordable.'' What has surfaced in the current EPA review \n     of the rule, by a panel which includes representatives from \n     the environmental groups, is that EPA did not adequately \n     consider the ability of low-income and rural communities to \n     afford the rule.\n       Currently, under the EPA review we are working with EPA to \n     correct this and enhance the small community provisions in \n     the rule. Also, the National Research Council is reviewing \n     new research that will allow a better evaluation of arsenic \n     health effects. New evidence suggests that these risks are \n     lower than indicated in the 199 NRC report. The NEW reviews \n     are almost complete. Why would we want to stop this progress?\n       The January 22, 2001 rule would likely require many small \n     towns to spend hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars \n     to make insignificant reductions in arsenic concentrations in \n     their drinking water. It would have more than tripled \n     water rates in many small communities. Such precipitous \n     rate increases can threaten consumers' and communities' \n     ability to pay for water service and\n\n[[Page S8556]]\n\n     other public health necessities. The unintended \n     consequence of over-regulating is that it takes away money \n     that people need to buy food, pay for a doctor, and keep \n     the house warm. Whenever we do anything to increase the \n     price of water, we are forcing millions of families to \n     make yet another tradeoff, which will directly affect \n     their health.\n       Please don't finalize a rule today (that directs EPA to \n     fine small communities who can't afford to comply) with the \n     intent of providing funds in the future. While we appreciate \n     the potential for future funding, our experience is that this \n     does not slow EPA enforcement.\n       We urge you to allow EPA to continue to review the rule \n     with the hope they will be more sensitive to our concerns. We \n     feel it is imperative that the final rule process is \n     deliberative and convincing to ensure that communities forced \n     to comply feel it is necessary. We feel all scientific \n     perspectives need to be thoroughly weighed in an overt public \n     process that convincingly explains the health risks of \n     arsenic.\n       Thank you for your consideration and please consider the \n     exceptional circumstances of small communities. Every \n     community wants to provide safe water and meet all drinking \n     water standards. After all, local water systems are operated \n     by people whose families drink the water every day and who \n     are locally elected by their community.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the \namendment to the pending measure offered by my distinguished colleague, \nSenator Boxer, that would prevent the administration from delaying \nimplementation of the EPA arsenic standards issued on January 22, or \nfrom weakening those standards in any fashion. I am pleased that a \nsimilar amendment was adopted by the House last week by a vote of 218 \nto 189.\n  One of the most important responsibilities of government is to \nprotect our citizens from threats to their health, safety or to their \nenvironment. Over the past two decades, the American public has reached \nagreement that government cannot and should not be the answer to every \nproblem that arises. But the public also agrees it is our duty to \ndefend the citizenry when it cannot defend itself and to protect \nAmerica's environment when it is threatened, because we are its \nstewards and trustees for all who will follow us as Americans.\n  The fact is, environmental protection has been one of the most \neffective government programs of recent decades. Although the public \nwholeheartedly supports a sensible, balanced approach to the \nenvironment, it is becoming increasingly clear that the Bush \nadministration does not.\n  As you know, last January, the Environmental Protection Agency issued \na new regulation that would reduce the acceptable level of arsenic in \ndrinking water from 50 parts per billion to 10 parts per billion. The \nannouncement was greeted with relief and appreciation by those of us \nwho thought the regulation long overdue. However, acting with seeming \ndisregard for science and regulatory procedure, the Bush administration \nalmost immediately announced that implementation of the regulation \nwould be delayed, citing the need for further review.\n  Like many of my colleagues, and I would venture to say most \nAmericans, I was puzzled and dismayed by the decision. What disturbed \nme about the decision was the administration's willingness to ignore 25 \nyears of comment, study, and debate, including a scientific review by \nour premier science organization, the National Academy of Sciences. For \nthis regulation was not feverishly put together in some back room at \nEPA or the White House in the closing days of the outgoing \nadministration, as some have charged. To the contrary, it was the \nproduct of a quarter century of public and scientific input, involving \nstakeholder consultations, peer review, and basic scientific research.\n  The chronology of this regulation is clear and illustrates the \nlegitimacy of the process by which the arsenic standard was developed. \nAs early as 1962, the Public Health Service had recognized the toxicity \nof arsenic and recommended a 10 ppb standard. In 1986 Congress directed \nEPA to update the arsenic standard, but EPA delayed action pending \nfurther study. Ten years later, as part of the 1996 Safe Drinking Water \nAct, Congress again directed EPA to take action, giving EPA a more than \ngenerous 6 years to develop an arsenic standard. In June of 2000, after \nexhaustive review, EPA proposed an arsenic rule--a standard of 5 parts \nper billion. And finally, last January, the agency issued its long-\nawaited final regulation--ultimately settling on a standard of 10 ppb.\n  EPA's regulation was clearly based on a National Academy of Sciences \nreport that found that drinking water containing 50 parts per billion \nof arsenic ``could easily'' cause a 1 percent risk of cancer. The NAS \nalso found that children are particularly susceptible to arsenic \npoisoning and recommended that the standard should be reduced ``as \npromptly as possible.'' This administration's decision to delay \nimplementation runs counter to the best scientific judgement available \nto us.\n  To put things in context, the current U.S. arsenic standard is \nequivalent to the standard employed by developing countries like \nBangladesh and China, which may not have the financial and technical \nresources to adopt stronger standards. In contrast, industrialized \ncountries like Australia or the European Union nations have adopted a 7 \nppb and 10 ppb standard, respectively. As the richest, most \ntechnologically advanced nation in the world, I would expect that we \nwould lead the world in clean water standards.\n  Beyond this decision to reconsider the new arsenic standards, I share \nthe concerns of many citizens about what appears to be a disturbing \npattern on the part of the Administration's regulatory policies. \nPresident Bush and his team have presided over the repeal, delay, or \nweakening of rules and regulations that would otherwise benefit the \nAmerican people, ranging from rules to protect wilderness areas in our \nnational forests from roadbuilding to regulations governing the toxic \neffects of mining on federal lands.\n  I have spoken out against this emerging pattern of ``government by \nrepeal.'' And I have questioned the process by which the decisions to \nrollback, weaken or delay these regulations, including the arsenic \nregulation, were reached. As Chairman of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, I have been conducting an in-depth examination of the \ndecisionmaking process on several rules. I want to know who the \nagencies consulted or relied on in making their decisions and what \nprocess the agencies went through to make their hasty decisions. \nDespite initial resistance, I am pleased that we have made progress in \nprotecting Congress's right to oversee the activities of the Executive \nBranch.\n  I commend Senator Boxer for her leadership on this matter. I join her \nin urging our colleagues to support this measure.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, how much time remains on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield 3 minutes to Senator Corzine and 3 minutes to \nSenator Clinton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, I will be shorter than 3 minutes.\n  Supporting Senator Boxer's amendment, on our side, is a statement to \ncommon sense. In the world I come from, people look at the facts; they \nanalyze them; and then they try to take actions consistent with them.\n  In science, if the people who provide water to us, as indicated by \nthe Senator from California and the Administrator of EPA, who comes \nfrom my home State, fought for a 10 parts per billion standard, one has \na hard time understanding why we don't think this is something in the \nbest safety interest and the stewardship interest which we are \nresponsible to represent in the Senate. This is one of those issues \nwhere I cannot understand why we cannot get together and make sure we \nhave 100-percent support because we are really protecting women and \nchildren and future generations of our society. This is as clear an \nissue, on a commonsense basis, as I have seen since coming to the \nSenate. I am happy to rise in support of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I thank Senator Boxer for bringing this amendment up \nfor debate and vote, and I want to add my words of strong support \nbecause it is clear we have a public health issue with respect to the \nlevel of arsenic in too many of our water supplies, particularly in the \nWest but not exclusively.\n  Unfortunately, the Bush administration has taken steps to delay \nrather\n\n[[Page S8557]]\n\nthan enforce new rules requiring less arsenic in America's drinking \nwater. That is a step in the wrong direction. It is wrong from a legal \nperspective since the new standard was required to be in place as of \nJune 22 of this year, and that was a statutory requirement put into \nplace by the Congress.\n  Perhaps most important, it is wrong from a public health perspective. \nThe administration says it needs to examine further arsenic in drinking \nwater, but while they continue to study arsenic, the American people \ncontinue to be exposed to this carcinogen.\n  Senator Boxer has already talked about the studies that have been \ndone affirming over and over again the public health issues relating to \narsenic in our drinking water. The National Academy of Sciences found \nchronic ingestion of arsenic causes bladder, lung, and skin cancer.\n  Another study released this past March, by researchers at Dartmouth \nUniversity, shows low concentrations of arsenic in drinking water can \nhave hormone-disrupting effects. In March, a report in the American \nJournal of Epidemiology revealed that compared to the general \npopulation, people who drink water with arsenic levels between 10.1 and \n50 parts per billion are twice as likely to get certain urinary tract \ncancers.\n  The science is clear, and do not take our word for it. I went and \nlooked on the EPA's Web site. On its Web site, right beside an April 18 \nnews release stating the Administrator wants to review the arsenic \nstandard, there is another report issued the very next day with this \nheadline: ``Arsenic Compounds May Cause Genetic Damage.''\n  Clearly, the EPA's own scientists have discovered a possible link \nbetween genetic damage and arsenic compounds. The science is not in \nquestion, but the safety and health of the American public have been \nput into question because of the delay this administration has brought \nabout.\n  The amendment being offered by Senator Boxer, which I strongly \nsupport, requires the EPA to immediately put a new standard in place \nthat will adequately protect public health, and it gives the American \npeople the right to know how much arsenic is in their water. The House \nof Representatives passed a similar amendment this last week.\n  I say to my good friend, the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, \nwho has done so much on so many issues that affect the quality of life \nof the people he represents, I understand Albuquerque is one of the \nlargest cities in our country that has this kind of arsenic issue.\n  I ask Senator Boxer for 1 more minute.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield an additional minute.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I want to make very clear to the Senator, and to \neveryone who represents large and small water systems, we need to give \nmore help to communities to comply with water standards. This is one of \nthose issues where the Federal Government must help our communities.\n  I certainly will work with the Senator from New Mexico and everyone \non both sides of the aisle to make sure a standard is put into place, \nto protect the public health and well-being of our people, that is \nmatched by funds from the revolving fund aimed at cleaning up drinking \nwater and any other resource available, so we do not leave people \nhanging on their own, not knowing what to do once the standard is set. \nI appreciate the financial challenge confronting some of our \ncommunities in meeting this standard.\n\n  I went to Fallon, NV, with my good friends Senator Reid and Senator \nEnsign, a community that has 100 parts per billion of arsenic in the \nwater. We know we have to deal with this. This amendment puts us on \nrecord to enforce a statutory requirement and does the right thing for \nthe public health, but then we have to come back and make sure we have \nthe resources to clean up the water supply so people can meet the \nstandard.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I thank my friend from New York for \nbringing up a good point.\n  I yield time to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nBoxer amendment. Senator Boxer's amendment would prevent the \nadministration from discarding the drinking water arsenic standard \npublished in the Federal Register on January 22 of this year. This rule \nwas designed by the Environment Protection Agency to protect Americans \nfrom dangerously high levels of arsenic--a known carcinogen--in their \ndrinking water. The arsenic standard we are debating today was not \ndreamed up by the EPA. In fact, Congress required EPA to set a new \narsenic standard when it passed the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments \nin 1996.\n  Congress asked EPA to set a new arsenic standard no later than \nJanuary 1, 2000. We extended that original deadline to June 22, 2001. \nClearly there is no rush to judgment in this case as some opponents \nwant the American people to believe. I did not advocate for a \nparticular arsenic standard during EPA's formal rulemaking on this \nissue. I believe that setting an arsenic drinking water standard is \nEPA's job. They did their job when they published the new standard in \nJanuary.\n  The administration has not convinced me that they have a good reason \nor really any reason, to spend taxpayer dollars restudying an issue \nthat has been studied to death. Instead of delaying our response to \narsenic danger, we should begin investing resources to improve \nAmerica's water infrastructure. We need to begin making this investment \nnow because the job is a big job, which will grow much more costly if \nwe wait to start. Americans expect and deserve safe tap water.\n  Due to high levels of naturally occurring arsenic in many of Nevada's \ngroundwater basins, the Silver State will be challenged by any new \narsenic drinking water standard. It will cost money to meet the \nchallenge. The Federal Government has a responsibility to help pay for \nthe necessary infrastructure improvements.\n\n  Earlier this year, Senator Ensign and I introduced the Small \nCommunity Drinking Water Funding Act, S. 503. We introduced this bill \nto help address the costs of providing safe drinking water to customers \nin small communities. This bill does not address the issue of arsenic \ncontamination directly because arsenic is only one of many impurities \nthat municipal water systems must control. However, S. 503 would \naddress the costs of 97 percent of the communities that would have to \nupgrade their water systems to meet the new arsenic standard.\n  I believe that every Nevadan, and all Americans for that matter, \nshould have access to clean, safe drinking water protected by a 21st \nCentury safety standard. The old U.S. drinking water arsenic standard \nwas established in 1942. That antique standard is still in China, \nBangladesh, India, and yes, the United States. On the other hand, the \nU.S. National Academy of Sciences concluded in a 1999 report that the \nold 50 ppb standard ``does not achieve EPA's goal for public health \nprotection and, therefore, requires downward revision as promptly as \npossible.''\n  Citizens of the European Union, Japan, and the World Health \nOrganization all enjoy 10 ppb drinking water arsenic standard. If our \nnew standard is allowed to stand, Americans will finally benefit from a \nlevel of protection from arsenic on par with the rest of the developed \nworld. I urge my colleagues to support the Boxer amendment because it \nwill help protect America's drinking water from arsenic.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to the Senator from Nevada, Senator Clinton raised \na crucial point addressing her remarks to the Senator from New Mexico. \nBoth Senators from New Mexico really worried about getting the funding \nto the local areas to do this infrastructure work. It is the Senator \nfrom Nevada who is pushing very hard, in a bipartisan way, for more \nfunding to clean up these water supplies.\n  When we take everything into consideration, I hope we will pass the \nBoxer amendment tonight. I know Senator Jeffords has spoken with \nSenator Reid about this, and we will be moving on this bill so we do \nauthorize, I say to the Senator from New York, more funding for water \ncompany infrastructure repairs.\n  I yield as much time as he would consume to the Senator from Nevada, \nretain the remainder of my time, and then I know the Senator from New \nMexico wants to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 4 minutes \nremaining.\n\n[[Page S8558]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I will not take all that time. I will take \na minute and say the Senator from California and the Senator from New \nYork understand clearly when people pick up a glass of water, whether \nthey live in Fallon, NV, or New York City, it should be clean, pure \nwater.\n  What Senator Ensign and I have done is introduce the Small Community \nDrinking Water Funding Act, S. 503, to allow communities such as Fallon \nand others around America that cannot afford the money to build these \nvery important water systems so the water they drink is pure.\n  Fallon cannot do it. Other small communities around America cannot do \nit. So Senator Ensign and I introduced this act to make sure we \naddressed the cost of providing safe drinking water to customers in \nsmall communities.\n  I appreciate very much the Senator from California focusing attention \non one of the real needs in America today: safe, pure drinking water.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I do not believe I will use the 30 \nminutes I have.\n  I thank Senator Clinton for the kind remarks with reference to this \nSenator.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Domenici pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1299 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I want to take the time of the Senate \nto explain the situation. Arsenic is a poison, but arsenic appears in \nthe western part of the United States in abundance in the geological \nstructure of the rocks and stones in New Mexico. When the Spaniards \ncame to that part of America 400 years ago, they obviously started \ndrinking water. They dug holes, drilled wells, they used the river \nwater, and guess what? They were drinking water that was not polluted, \nas some of the advertisements running today suggest.\n  If one goes out there now and checks the water, one will find there \nis arsenic in the water because there is arsenic in the rocks and the \ngeological formations.\n  Interestingly enough, and I do not want to argue about the \nproposition that arsenic is serious and arsenic can hurt you, but there \nis no evidence from those early Spanish days--absolutely no evidence \nthat any of the diseases we are talking about existed in that \npopulation. There is no evidence there was an increase in the ailments \nabout which we are now talking.\n  I would have liked to argue today or sometime that Southwestern \nAmerica deserves an opportunity to prove the people there are not \nharmed by the naturally occurring arsenic in the water. Tonight I \nchoose to say thank you to the Senator from California for the \namendment she offered. I will ask those Senators from the West on our \nside to vote for it because essentially it will give the Environmental \nProtection Agency an opportunity to take into consideration, as I read \nthe amendment, what I am talking about tonight. They will set a \nstandard, yes. It does not say precisely what, and clearly they are \ngoing to take some facts into consideration that are real and that \nshould be taken into consideration by a National Government imposing a \nstandard on a western part of America, be it Idaho, Arizona, Utah, \nAlaska, New Mexico, or Colorado.\n  Nobody is putting the arsenic in their water, as some of the \nenvironmental ads talk about. The arsenic is there because arsenic is \nin the ground, in the rocks, in the mountains, and therefore comes into \nour streams. When we drill wells, we get it, and in Albuquerque, they \npump hundreds of millions of gallons of water a day from the water \nunder the Rio Grande, and there is more arsenic than some think we \nought to have.\n  The bill I just introduced and the one Senator Reid introduced \nrecognizes that in some parts of America--I am sure it will be my \nState, Idaho, and some others, that if we have to fix up our water \nplants, some in villages of 100 people where they have a small water \nsystem and no other water, it will create a significant financial \nburden. Their water is going to cost, in one case, $91 a month for \neverybody on that system.\n  Obviously, we have to move in the direction of correcting the \nproblem. The Government should help us correct it. The VA-HUD \nappropriations bill is, in many respects, as far as this Senator is \nconcerned, a wonderful bill. EPA is treated in great fashion. There are \na number of things in New Mexico we have asked for that have been \ntreated wonderfully. When it comes to whether we should force a lower \nstandard on our cities and villages in the West, and if we do, when, \nand what should the standard really be, there is plenty of room for \nserious discussion among fairminded people who are not bent on \npolitics.\n  If one wants to make a big political issue out of the fact that \nperhaps somebody in the White House could have handled this a little \ndifferently--frankly, I wish they would have talked to me before they \nhandled it because they would not have had anybody mad at them and they \nwould have fixed it. Essentially, the Clinton regulation did not come \ninto effect until 2006. Does that surprise people? That is when it \nwould have been effective if we had not had all this commotion.\n\n  It is serious. We cannot put this into effect quickly in our part of \nthe country. Originally, the implementation was to occur in the year \n2006.\n  Tonight I urge everyone to vote for the amendment because it is a \nclear indication that something ought to be done. I do believe it is \ndifferent than the amendment the House passed. I thank the Senator from \nCalifornia because her amendment is different. It gives us an \nopportunity to go to conference, work with the Environmental Protection \nAgency and others, and do precisely what the Senator from California \nwants.\n  She wants the United States to move in harmony to get safe drinking \nwater with the lowest amount of arsenic possible and still have \naffordable drinking water. After all, we need drinking water. We cannot \npay $200 or $300 a month for it in New Mexico. One city is going to \nspend over $250 million to improve its water system because it has this \nnaturally occurring arsenic and yet, nobody has proven this arsenic is \nharmful to anybody.\n  That part of New Mexico and the areas around it have been inhabited \nby indigenous Indians longer than any of us know. The Spanish inhabited \nthe area for 450 years, and Albuquerqueans--made up from all kinds of \nAmericans--have been there for over 150 years. We want to give them a \nchance. We do not want the people to spend more than is necessary on \nthis problem.\n  Certainly, nobody is putting poison in the water. We are trying to \npurify natural water. The streams of New Mexico contain arsenic. No \nfish are dying that I have heard of and yet, there is arsenic in those \nrivers. In terms of its chemical makeup, it is the same arsenic as the \npoison and the arsenic used in mining activities.\n  For those who are interested in history, it is the same arsenic that \nsomebody gave to Napoleon. Those who dug up Napoleon's corpse found \nthat perhaps somebody gave him regular doses of arsenic. They believe \nthat is what happened to him. They think one of his best friends put \narsenic into his system slowly over a period of about 20 years.\n  I thank the Senator from California for the way we accomplished \nthings tonight. I am sure she is going to get a unanimous vote from the \nSenate saying: Let's move ahead and resolve this issue.\n  If there is no other Senator on our side who desires to speak----\n  Mr. BOND. I desire to speak.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time does the Senator want of my 30 minutes? \nFive minutes of my time? I only have 30 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I just need 1 minute of the remaining time. We have a \ncouple minutes left.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California still has 2 \nminutes 40 seconds.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. And the Senator from New Mexico?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 20 minutes 45 \nseconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What is the pleasure of the Senator?\n\n[[Page S8559]]\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Five minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator from Montana?\n  Mr. BURNS. If I could have 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask that be the order of my remaining time, and if \nany time remains beyond that, I reserve the remainder.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would ask for a minute or two after Senator Mikulski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I rise in support of Senator Boxer's amendment. I ask \nalso to be an original cosponsor of the Domenici amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The Boxer amendment is an excellent amendment. I \nacknowledge the validity of the concerns raised by the Senator from New \nMexico. When we arrive at this standard, and in southern Maryland on \nour Eastern Shore we face many of the same problems that the Senator \nfrom New Mexico faces, and the need to modernize infrastructure and to \ncome up with environmental regulations is almost teetering to a \nnational crisis. Each region of the country will have difficulty in \ncomplying, but we believe it will be a public investment with an \nincredible public health dividend.\n  I support Senator Boxer's amendment for three reasons. First, I was a \nmember of the conference on the VA-HUD bill last year when we required \nthe administration to develop a new standard by June 22 of this year to \nprotect our children and the elderly who are most at risk for high \nlevels of arsenic, and the administration did miss the deadline. It was \na congressionally mandated deadline, and the American people deserve a \nprotective standard.\n  The current standard for arsenic was developed in 1942. We know much \nmore today about the negative health effects of arsenic. We have the \nbenefit of five studies by the National Academy of Sciences that say \nthe current standard is not protective enough. Right now our current \nstandard is the same as Bangladesh and China. Nothing against those \ncountries, but I think we can do better than Bangladesh.\n  Third, many American communities are very concerned about how much it \nwill cost. Again, I acknowledge the cost of compliance is a factor to \nbe considered. I believe the Domenici bill we have all cosponsored will \naddress this. This is a national crisis. It deserves a national \nresponse. It deserves national responsibility sharing. This is why we \nwill need an authorizing bill.\n  The VA-HUD bill includes $850 million for the drinking water State \nrevolving loan fund. This should help, but it certainly is not enough \nto meet the enormous needs of our community to keep drinking water safe \nfrom arsenic and other issues. We could not address all of the issues \nin VA-HUD this year, but I believe the Boxer amendment is very \nimportant to establish a standard and the Domenici authorization will \nbe a very important way to move forward.\n  I note the Senator from Nevada is on the floor. I know he and the \njunior Senator from Nevada have introduced legislation to deal with our \nincredible shrinking water infrastructure, which is deteriorating by \nthe minute. We hope in the second session of the 107th Congress to make \na major initiative to hold hearings on the infrastructure needs facing \nour communities. We will be able to protect public health, generate \njobs, and modernize our country's water infrastructure the way we did \nat the turn of the century. We need a new turn of the wheel.\n  I am happy to support the Boxer amendment, and I look forward to \nworking with the Senator from New Mexico.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, most people who were raised in the \nsmaller towns around this country and have experienced arsenic in their \nwater, probably much less than the 50 parts, are kind of used to it. \nThere is no scientific evidence that water ever hurt anybody in our \ncountry. We have it naturally. But I tell you something we don't have \nnaturally, and that is enough money to build an infrastructure for a \nsmall town of, maybe, 300 people, some of them 200 people and some \n100--real people with real faces who are faced with bills that you \ncan't believe who have to live on the land and pry a living from the \nland, and then be told they have to spend everything they make to redo \na water system when there is no scientific evidence at all that their \nwater is bad in the first place and it has ever hurt them. That is what \nthis is about.\n  We should be sensitive to public health. We should be sensitive to \nwater systems. But don't take at issue a water system that is not that \nharmful or has any harm at all with the levels of arsenic we find \nnaturally in the waters of the West. I oppose this amendment on the \ngrounds that we do not have the money and the cost it would bring to \nthose small towns.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I thank my colleagues for their very \nthoughtful debate. I believe tonight if people are listening they \nunderstand some of the difficulties we face. Nobody wants to see \narsenic in drinking water. It has been so eloquently stated by the \nSenator from New Mexico and the Senator from Montana. There are parts \nof our country where arsenic occurs naturally. One of the actions we \nneed to take is to make sure we improve the quality of our drinking \nwater and lessen exposure to arsenic but do so in a way that does not \ncause greater dangers.\n  One of the greatest dangers that we face as we listen to our \ncolleagues from the States where there are small water systems which \nhave naturally occurring arsenic from geological formations in their \ndrinking water, we need to make sure the burdens of meeting a very low \nstandard are not so significant that a lack of resources forces those \npublic water systems to shut down. The result of imposing too great a \nfinancial burden on those small water systems could be they shut down \nand people have to go back to drinking well water or other untreated \nwater with potentially even higher levels of arsenic. That is a part of \nthis debate in the past that has not been fully set out.\n  I call the attention of my colleagues to an amendment offered last \nyear to strike the provision in the bill that delayed until June 22 of \nthis year the deadline for finalizing the rule on arsenic in drinking \nwater. I supported the inclusion of that measure in the VA-HUD bill \nbecause we noted in 1996 Congress set a schedule under which EPA was to \nupdate the arsenic standard for drinking water. At the time EPA told us \nthey were behind schedule and they would not be fully prepared. Last \nfall the EPA told us they would not be ready until April or May and \nthey had not had time to evaluate the concerns expressed about the \nproposed rule that had been issued on the delayed basis. Many small \ncommunities expressed their concern about the proposed rule because if \nit were implemented it would prove prohibitively expensive for their \ncustomers and they set out lots of specific examples.\n  For example, in Utah, the Heartland Mobile Home Park would have to \ncharge $230 per month per customer under the rule. So they said let us \ndelay the rule.\n\n  In the bill last year we said: Delay the implementation of the EPA \nstandard until you have had a chance to look at it.\n  I am pleased to say that 63 Members of this body agreed with us and \ntabled the amendment that would have stricken that provision. \nTherefore, 63 Members--45 Republicans, 18 Democrats--said: Yes, it \nmakes sense to delay the final issuance of this arsenic rule. It is not \nto be effective until 2006, not until 2006. So we said: EPA, get the \njob done right before you issue the regulation.\n  There has been so much misinformation about this rule that I thought \nwe ought to take a moment to set out what it does and does not do. We \nknow it will be 5 years, 2006, before the new standard is implemented. \nWhether the new standard was set last January or June or November or \nFebruary, the current year will not matter because we will still hit \nthe same implementation time deadline.\n  There is no greater danger for people living in areas with high \nnaturally occurring amounts of arsenic. I think the concerns of the \ncommunities in New Mexico, Michigan, Montana, and other States need to \nbe addressed. But I express my sincere thanks to the Senator\n\n[[Page S8560]]\n\nfrom California for having offered an amendment which says, in essence, \nwhat EPA needs to do, what they are committed to do, and what they are \non track to do, and that is to establish a new national primary \ndrinking water regulation that establishes a standard providing for the \nprotection of the population in general, taking fully into account the \nspecial needs population.\n  That is what this amendment does, and I think that is a happy \nresolution of this situation. We need to realize that the standard goes \ninto effect in 2006. Last year, 63 Members of this body said we ought \nto delay the issuance of that standard until June. When the new EPA \ncame in and delayed the standard, people said many things that were not \ntrue. They overlooked the fact that 18 Democrats had voted with 45 \nRepublicans to say it is time to delay it.\n  By the time this bill is enacted into law, the National Academy of \nSciences will tell us the standards necessary to protect our health, \nthe administration will complete the standard in a way that protects \nour health and does not impose unnecessary costs on our small towns or \nforce the closure of water systems in small towns whose absence would \nlead to a much higher level of arsenic in well water or other sources \nof drinking water for the inhabitants, and we will meet the original \nimplementation deadline.\n  I believe we have reached an appropriate accommodation. I thank the \nSenator from New Mexico particularly, who has been a very thoughtful \nparticipant in all of these discussions and has articulated well the \nserious problems faced in these small communities, for his agreement \nthat this amendment is appropriate and will allow the EPA flexibility \nto develop a safe, commonsense arsenic standard. It is my \nunderstanding, although I do not have a written copy of any approval, \nthat the administration believes this is an appropriate way to deal \nwith this question of arsenic in drinking water, particularly the \nnaturally occurring arsenic.\n  I thank all of my colleagues. I urge an overwhelming support of this \nrequirement that the EPA set a drinking water standard for arsenic.\n  I yield the floor. I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 2 minutes of my time to Senator Bingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I appreciate my colleague yielding me \ntime to speak, both on the amendment the Senator from California has \noffered and also on the bill he has just introduced. I support what the \nSenator from California is trying to do with her amendment. I think it \nis a good resolution. It calls attention to the fact that we need this \nissue resolved.\n  I also support what my colleague, Senator Domenici, is trying to do \nin the bill he has introduced, which I am pleased to cosponsor. It is \nsimilar to the bill that Senator Reid has earlier introduced. This \nmakes the case clearly that the Federal Government needs to help these \ncommunities meet whatever standard we establish as a safe standard. I \nam not persuaded, as is the Senator from Montana, that we know the \nextent of the health risks. I think we still are learning precisely \nwhat the health risks are and we need to continue studying that.\n  But in the meantime, we need to set a standard and we need to assist \nthese communities in meeting that standard. I am persuaded that the \ntechnology is being developed which will allow these communities to \nmeet that standard at a much lower cost than they have traditionally \nhad to consider for meeting this type of standard. But I think we need \nto support that research as well. I know some of it is going on in the \nNational Laboratories in our State, and I am encouraged that they are \nfinding new ways to eliminate arsenic entirely from drinking water for \na relatively small cost.\n  Again, I compliment my colleague and look forward to supporting this \namendment and also supporting his bill once it is called for a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent Senator Bingaman be added as an \noriginal cosponsor of S. 1299, and I thank the Senator for his kind \ncomments with reference to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I understand that Senator Domenici \nhas just introduced legislation providing grant funding for communities \nto improve their water systems and adhere to the new arsenic \nregulations. This program will be very important for communities across \nAmerica and also in my home State of Texas.\n  I ask unanimous consent to be added as an original cosponsor of S. \n1299.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, do I have 2 minutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleagues. I thank Senator Reid, Senator \nDaschle, my cosponsor, Senator Nelson, my other cosponsor, Senator \nDomenici, for his remarks, Senator Bingaman, and Senator Bond.\n  I want to make a point, building on what Senator Bond said when he \npointed out 63 Members voted to slip the date for the new standard \nuntil June 22, 2001. That is true. The problem is there was not a new \nstandard. That is why we have this amendment, which is not a sense of \nthe Senate. I want to express that point. I hope I do not jeopardize my \nvote, but it is a real law. It says the administration shall act \nimmediately, and that is a term of art. They must act immediately to \nset the new standard and take into consideration the vulnerability of \nkids and the rest.\n  This is real. It also says the community must have a right to know \nhow much arsenic is in their drinking water. That will happen \nimmediately.\n  So this is real, and I hope it will survive the conference. I say to \nmy friend, Senator Burns, who has left the floor, that I know it is \nmuch easier to say if it is naturally occurring it does not hurt us. \nRadiation from the Sun is naturally occurring and it hurts us. Arsenic \nhurts us. We have the latest, most prestigious Journal, the American \nJournal of Epidemiology, March 1, 2001. Based on a study in Taiwan \nfollowing real people, it says:\n\n       Compared to the general population, people who drink water \n     with arsenic levels between 10.1 ppb and 50 ppb are twice as \n     likely to get certain urinary cancers.\n\n  We have the science. We know the science. I have talked to Christie \nTodd Whitman about this many times. When she was Governor of New \nJersey, she suggested a 10-part-per-billion standard. Why would she do \nthat? Because she wants to be with those countries that have a 10-part-\nper-billion standard. I think we need to look at these countries one \nmore time.\n  We are at 50 parts per billion. That is where George Bush has put us. \nWe share that 50-parts-per-billion standard with Indonesia, India, \nChina, Bolivia, and that great leader of public health, Bangladesh.\n  We don't belong here. We belong in this tier: Australia, the European \nUnion, Japan, and the World Health Organization. They are 10 parts per \nbillion or less.\n  This is a debate that I think has been good. I am very pleased that \nwe have won some fine support from the other side of the aisle. I hope \nwe will send a rip-roaring message to the President: Set the standard, \nset it low, set it fast.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I compliment the distinguished Senator \nfrom California for the eloquent summary of this issue that she just \nmade, as well as for offering this amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I will propound a unanimous consent \nrequest. If we get this agreement at this time--in consultation with \nthe Republican leader and the two managers, and I compliment them--we \nwill make this the last vote of the evening.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list I will send to the desk be the \nonly first-degree amendments in order to H.R. 2620, that these \namendments be subject to relevant second-degree amendments; that upon \ndisposition of all amendments, the substitute amendment be agreed to, \nif not previously ordered; that the bill be read three times, and the \nSenate vote on passage of the bill;\n\n[[Page S8561]]\n\nthat upon passage of the bill, the Senate insist on its amendments and \nrequest a conference with the House, and that the Chair be authorized \nto appoint conferees, with the above occurring without any intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, it is acceptable on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            ORDER FOR RECESS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate completes its business today, it stand in recess until 9:30 a.m. \ntomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I especially thank our manager and the \nranking member, as well as our distinguished colleague from Nevada, who \nworks so ably on both sides of the aisle, for reaching this agreement.\n  We have a lot of work to do. But we know what the work is. I hope we \ncan work expeditiously tomorrow morning.\n  This will be the last vote of the evening.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from New Mexico yield back \nall his time?\n  Mr. BOND. What is the time remaining of the Senator from New Mexico?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes forty seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield that time to Senator Bond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I will yield that back. I only want to \ncorrect the Record. The administration has indicated they will \npromulgate, or intends to promulgate a new regulation based on science. \nThere was no intention of staying at the 50 parts per billion, which \nhad been the standard throughout the previous administration. They have \nsaid they needed to review the science and listen to the communities \nthat would be affected, and also take into account, as the Senator from \nNew Mexico has proposed, the extraordinary hardships that meeting this \nstandard would impose upon many small communities, with the possibility \nthat the shutdown of those small community water systems would impose a \nfar greater danger on the inhabitants.\n  Madam President, having corrected the Record and thanking all of our \nparticipants for helping shed some light on and remove some of the \npolitical misinterpretations that have been placed on this issue, I \nthank my colleagues and I urge a favorable vote on the amendment before \nus.\n  I yield such time as may be remaining on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1219. The yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call \nroll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) and the Senator from Mississippi (Mr. Lott) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold the suggestion?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise tonight to speak in support \nof the international space station in this VA-HUD appropriations bill. \nI urge my colleagues to pause and reflect on America's great \naccomplishments in space and the great successes that lie ahead with \nthe space station.\n  The House of Representatives has fully funded the President's request \nand has taken important steps to fund the space station's future needs \nsuch as a crew rescue vehicle and a six-person crew habitation module. \nThe Senate bill cuts the space station by $150 million.\n  I hope to work with my colleagues, Senators Mikulski and Bond, to \nrestore some of this into the program. It should be restored with \nstrict controls and standards to assure the station will be safe and \nproductive and on budget.\n  I am concerned, as I know many others are, about the recently \nprojected cost growth for the international space station. I do want it \nto be fully functioning. In order to achieve that goal, NASA must work \nwithin the budget that Congress has given it.\n  At the same time, I understand the difficulty in estimating the cost \nof such an amazing engineering feat. We are now within a year of the \nstation being ``core complete,'' and I believe Congress must adequately \nfund the station so we can begin to see the benefits of its unique \nscientific research.\n  NASA's projected 5-year cost growth of over $4 billion includes many \nprogram liens that reflect 2 years of actual operational experience for \nthe station. That on-orbit experience has eliminated many unknowns and \nhas significantly enhanced NASA's awareness of what it takes to operate \na space station. Unfortunately, the greater awareness has come with a \npricetag that threatens reaching the full capability of the space \nstation as originally planned in terms of research, a permanent crew of \nsix, and a crew rescue vehicle.\n  I believe NASA is dealing with the budgetary challenges and has \nproposed a ``core complete'' plan for the station to stay within budget \nconstraints. Importantly, NASA and OMB have put into place an \nindependent external review board to assess the space station's budget \nand to assure the station will provide maximum benefit to the U.S. \ntaxpayer. This external review board will evaluate the cost and \nbenefits for enhancing research, a habitation module for a crew of six, \nand a crew rescue vehicle.\n  It will be my goal in conference that we not preclude the full review \nof these potential enhancements by the independent external review \nboard and not obstruct the ability of NASA to undertake these \nenhancements in order to ensure the originally planned capability for \nthe space station.\n  I want to work with Senator Mikulski and Senator Bond to make sure we \ndo not cut off capabilities of the space station and thereby never see \nthe scientific contributions for which we have already made a \nsignificant investment.\n  The international space station is the greatest peaceful scientific \nproject ever undertaken. Since 1993, the United States has worked with \nour international allies, including Russia, forging relationships of \nmutual respect, on the space station.\n  The efforts and resources of 16 nations are involved in the \nconstruction and operation of the orbiting lab. Assembly of the space \nstation is nearing ``core complete'' and within a year we expect new \nand exciting scientific experiments to begin. Its successes will be \nfelt by all of us here on Earth.\n\n[[Page S8562]]\n\n  A project of this magnitude is certain to face a multitude of \nunknowns, and NASA has confronted many of them. As always in its \ncourageous history, NASA has and will continue to overcome these \nobstacles and we will reap the rewards. Simply, the space station will \nmaintain U.S. global leadership in space science and technology.\n  The unparalleled scientific research opportunities aboard the space \nstation will enable advances in medicine and engineering. Most \nimportant are the health benefits that we have in the microgravity \nconditions in the space station. You cannot--no matter what technology \nyou have--reproduce on Earth the gravity conditions that are in space. \nWe know those microgravity conditions will allow us to watch the \ndevelopment of breast cancer cells and osteoporosis in a weightless \nenvironment. Perhaps this will help us find the cure for breast cancer, \nor we will learn how to combat osteoporosis.\n  The absence of gravity in the space station will allow new insights \ninto human health and disease prevention and treatment, including \nheart, lung, and kidney function, cardiovascular disease, and immune \nsystem functions. The cool suit for Apollo missions now helps improve \nthe quality of life of patients with multiple sclerosis. In recent \nyears, NASA has obtained scientific data from space experiments that is \nfive times more accurate than that on Earth. None of these benefits \nwill be available in the future unless we have a space station on which \nwe can perform adequate research.\n\n  Some will say that similar research can be conducted on the space \nshuttle. Although I believe valuable research should continue to be \nperformed on the shuttle, the fact is, a longer period of time that can \nonly occur on the space station is absolutely necessary for many \nimportant experiments.\n  During his last year in the Senate, Senator John Glenn spoke \npassionately in defense of the space station. He quoted a friend of \nmine, Dr. Michael DeBakey, chancellor and chairman of the surgery \ndepartment at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, TX, who said:\n\n       The Space Station is not a luxury any more than a medical \n     research center at Baylor College of Medicine is a luxury. \n     Present technology on the Shuttle allows for stays of space \n     of only about 2 weeks. We do not limit medical researchers to \n     only a few hours in the laboratory and expect cures for \n     cancer. We need much longer missions in space--in months to \n     years--to obtain research results that may lead to the \n     development of new knowledge and breakthroughs.\n\n  So you take all these scientific wonders and ask: How does it make my \nlife better? It does make our lives better. It makes our health better. \nIt gives patients who have multiple sclerosis, osteoporosis, or cancer \na better chance for a quality of life. I reject the idea that we would \nwalk away from the space station and from the possibilities for the \nfuture for better health and better quality of life.\n  The international space station, along with the space shuttle \nprogram, is our future in one of the last unexplored regions of our \nuniverse. It will discover untold knowledge and could catapult us into \na greater understanding of our world and, yet, undiscovered worlds. The \nspace station will provide us with fantastic science, but that is only \none of the known successes. The unknown successes are limitless.\n  Madam President, if we do not continue funding of the international \nspace station at the anticipated cost levels, valuable experiments and \nprogress will be abandoned. The project is long underway and, for the \nsake of future generations, we should not leave it unfinished. I look \nforward to working with the chairman and ranking member of this \nsubcommittee to make sure we do fully fund the space station, but with \nstrict requirements for budgetary control and making sure we do \neverything to keep our costs in line. But let's not walk away from this \nimportant research for our future.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I will speak for a few minutes about a \nproblem that is hamstringing American foreign policy today, and that is \nthe stalled nomination of John Negroponte to be the American Ambassador \nto the United Nations.\n  Even the critics of American foreign policy would agree that America, \nand the world, are best served by having an outstanding, experienced, \nprofessional diplomat at our U.N. mission in New York. Indeed, such a \npersonal representative of the President would provide enlightened \nperspective to our friends and allies on occasions when we cannot \nsupport particular U.N. initiatives. He would also symbolize America's \nrobust commitment to international engagement, and work with like-\nminded nations whenever possible to advance our mutual interests and \nvalues, in the spirit of cooperation the United Nations was created to \nfoster.\n  Regrettably, the Senate has stalled ambassador Negroponte's \nnomination process. The President announced his intention to nominate \nthis 37-year veteran of the Foreign Service in March and sent his \nnomination to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in May. But his \nnomination has been held up due to concerns about human rights abuses \nin Honduras during his tenure as Ambassador there.\n  It is worth pointing out that Ambassador Negroponte has been \nconfirmed by the Senate five times--as recently as 1993, well after his \nassignment to Honduras, as President Clinton's Ambassador to the \nPhilippines. He did not then undergo anything like the ordeal he has \nbeen subjected to this year.\n  In the midst of the debate over Ambassador Negroponte's \nqualifications for the U.N. assignment, the United States got booted \noff the U.N. Human Rights Commission for the first time in its \nhistory--a defeat that raises credible doubts about the integrity of \nthat institution and its commitment to the very values it exists to \npromote. Sudan, Libya, Syria, Cuba, and China are now members of this \nbody, forged by the vision of Eleanor Roosevelt in the early post-World \nWar II era--and we are not.\n  Victims of persecution around the world, and advocates for their \ncause in our country, shall long rue the day the Commission was \ntarnished by this unfortunate vote. Many professionals agree that had \nwe had an ambassador in place early in this administration, we would \nnow be a member in good standing of the Human Rights Commission. We \nalso recently lost our seat on the International Narcotics Control \nBoard, another avoidable consequence of our vacant U.N. ambassadorship.\n  Ambassador Negroponte has the strong support of Ambassador Richard \nHolbrooke, his predecessor at the United Nations. Upon hearing the \nfirst reports of the President's intent to nominate Ambassador \nNegroponte, Ambassador Holbrooke said: The United States is lucky, the \nU.N. is lucky. . . . He is a real professional. . . . I would be \nthrilled.\n  Secretary of State Colin Powell recently called John Negroponte: one \nof the most distinguished foreign service officers and American public \nservants I have ever known.\n  The U.N. General Assembly convenes in mind-September for its annual \nsession. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee should immediately \nschedule a confirmation hearing for Ambassador Negroponte, to take \nplace in early September when the Senate reconvenes, in order to have \nhim confirmed and in place to represent our Nation in New York this \nfall.\n  Ambassador Negroponte has served Democratic and Republican Presidents \nwith distinction over the course of his diplomatic career. In the \nspirit of bipartisanship and the proud tradition of\n\n[[Page S8563]]\n\nAmerican internationalism at the United Nations, I urge my colleagues \nto move quickly to allow this good man to serve our country once again.\n  Madam President, I have had the opportunity of knowing Ambassador \nNegroponte when he was Ambassador to Mexico, Ambassador to Honduras, \nand Ambassador to the Philippines. The nomination is now stuck. \nUnfortunately, we need to act as quickly as possible.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have a letter from Mr. \nGeorge Shultz, former Secretary of State, printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 17, 2001.\n                                              Hoover Institution--\n\n\n                                 on War, Revolution and Peace,\n\n     Hon. Joseph R. Biden,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman, I am writing to support the nomination \n     of John Negroponte to be our Ambassador to the United \n     Nations. I know him well; I have worked with him closely. I \n     believe he will do an outstanding job at the UN.\n       While I was Secretary of State, John Negroponte served in \n     three different positions: (1) Ambassador to Honduras; (2) \n     Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International \n     Scientific and Environmental Affairs; and (3) Deputy National \n     Security Advisor in the last fourteen months of the Reagan \n     administration.\n       In Honduras, John did an outstanding job under especially \n     difficult circumstances. There was turmoil and instability \n     throughout Central America, and assisting Honduras to stay on \n     an even keel was an enormous challenge. Despite the \n     difficulties, Honduras managed to maintain relative calm and \n     peace compared to neighboring El Salvador, Guatemala and \n     Nicaragua and made the transition from military to civilian \n     rule during his time there. Honduras has had five free \n     elections for a civilian president since 1981, and there will \n     be another such election later this year. Much of the \n     groundwork for the return to democracy and rule of law in \n     Honduras was laid during John's tenure.\n       John's work as Assistant Secretary for Oceans and \n     International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, his next \n     assignment, is an excellent example of the richness and \n     diversity of his background and experience. As Assistant \n     Secretary for OES, John oversaw the negotiation of the \n     Montreal Protocol for the Protection of the Stratospheric \n     Ozone Layer on behalf of the United States. This was a \n     milestone multilateral environmental agreement at the time \n     and I well remember the conviction and skill with which John \n     worked to gain support within the U.S. government and to \n     conclude such an agreement with other countries. The Senate \n     vote to consent to ratification was 83 to 0. John's portfolio \n     in OES included addressing the issue of acid rain and its \n     impact on Canada, and dealing with fisheries in the South \n     Pacific. He personally negotiated and renewed a space \n     cooperation agreement with the Soviet Union, satisfying the \n     technology transfer concerns of a wary and skeptical DOD \n     along the way. And at my request, John worked with former \n     Citibank CEO Walter Wriston to organize a symposium at the \n     National Academy of Sciences about the impact of information \n     technology on foreign policy.\n       As Deputy National Security Advisor, John dealt with the \n     entire range of national security issues confronting the \n     President and the National Security Council. Among the \n     important issues with which he had to deal on a daily basis \n     at that time were the Iran-Iraq war, the end of Soviet \n     military involvement in Afghanistan, and two summits between \n     President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev.\n       Although it was after my tenure as Secretary of State, I \n     also had the opportunity to visit John both in Mexico City \n     and Manila where he subsequently served as Ambassador. I can \n     attest to the outstanding job he did at each of those posts. \n     John was instrumental in both the conception and negotiation \n     of the NAFTA, which has brought dramatic, positive changes to \n     the U.S./Mexico economic and political relationship.\n       John has had a broad and deep variety of foreign policy \n     experience at eight foreign postings and assignments in \n     Washington at both the State Department and the White House. \n     This experience is excellent preparation for the challenges \n     of a UN assignment.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                 George P. Shultz.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Finally, Madam President, we really need to have the \nUnited States represented at the United Nations. This has been a long \nprocess for Mr. Negroponte. I know my good friend and chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee, Joe Biden, shares my concern about the \nUnited Nations. He is a committed believer in the United Nations and \nthe importance of its functions. I hope we will move forward as quickly \nas possible with Mr. Negroponte's nomination to represent the United \nStates at the United Nations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/01/senate-section/article/S8563-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8563-S8565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nhosted a briefing for interested Senators by Dr. Condoleezza Rice on \nMonday afternoon in the Capitol during which she discussed with almost \n20 Senators who were present the recent meetings she had with Russian \nleaders in Moscow.\n  I was impressed with the steadfast resolve of the President during \nhis meetings with President Putin in Genoa in moving beyond the \nconfrontational relationship with Russia and replacing the doctrine of \nmutual assured destruction with a new framework that would be \nconsistent with our national defense interests as they now exist rather \nthan as they existed in 1972.\n  Two years ago, Congress debated and passed the National Missile \nDefense Act of 1999, which enunciated the policy of the United States \nto deploy as soon as technologically possible a system to defend the \nterritory of the United States against limited ballistic missile \nattack, whether accidental, unauthorized, or intentional. That bill was \npassed with overwhelming majorities in both Houses of Congress and \nsigned into law on July 23, 1999.\n  The National Missile Defense Act became necessary because of two \nunfortunate facts: The emergence of a new threat to our Nation and our \nlack of capability to defend against that threat. The threat stems from \nthe proliferation of the technology to build long-range ballistic \nmissiles.\n  Our inability to defend against that threat is tied to the ABM Treaty \nof 1972. The changes that have occurred in the world since the cold war \nhad not been reflected in our national policy until the enactment of \nthe National Missile Defense Act.\n  President Bush is moving ahead to fulfill both the letter and spirit \nof the National Missile Defense Act. He has restructured the Missile \nDefense Program from one that was carefully tailored not to conflict \nwith the 1972 ABM Treaty into one which will provide the best defense \npossible for our Nation in the shortest period of time. He has properly \nfocused the Missile Defense Program on the threat we face rather than \nthe ABM Treaty, and he has clearly stated he intends to move beyond the \ncold war ABM Treaty and into a new era in which the United States does \nnot base its security on pledges of mutual annihilation with a country \nwith which we are not at war.\n  The President has personally carried this message to our allies, \nfriends, and former adversaries, and his efforts have met with \nimpressive success. Not all critics have been persuaded and some never \nwill be, but many who were skeptical now support our efforts, and some, \nsuch as the Premier of Italy just last week in Genoa, have \nenthusiastically endorsed them.\n  Perhaps the most striking change has occurred in Russia. When the \nprevious administration proposed modifications to the ABM Treaty, the \nRussian Government refused even to entertain the notion, but in the \nface of the resolve demonstrated by President Bush, the Russian \nGovernment has agreed to his suggestion to enter into talks to \nestablish an entirely new strategic framework to guide the relationship \nbetween our countries. The developments of the past few months are \ntruly changing the international political world we have known for so \nlong.\n  At the same time, our Missile Defense Program, which for years had \nbeen underfunded, is continuing to recover and is making substantial \ntechnical progress. That program has faced formidable obstacles--\nbesides the technical challenge of reliably intercepting ballistic \nmissiles. It has faced the constraints of an old treaty that was \nintended specifically to impede and prohibit the development and \ndeployment of such missile defenses.\n  Congress has taken the lead over the past few years in helping to get \nthe Missile Defense Program back on its feet by increasing the funding \navailable for the work on defenses against both shorter range and \nlonger range ballistic missiles, and those programs have demonstrated \ngreat progress. The Patriot PAC-3 system has succeeded in 7 out of 8 \nintercept attempts against shorter range ballistic missiles, such as \nthe Scuds that caused such destruction\n\n[[Page S8564]]\n\nand took 28 American lives during the gulf war. After some early \ntesting failures attributed to quality control problems, the longer \nrange THAAD system finished its initial testing with consecutive \nsuccesses, and our defense against long-range ballistic missiles was \nsuccessful the very first time it was tested in October of 1999, and \nthat success was repeated in another intercept test just a few weeks \nago.\n  The Director of the Ballistic Missile Defense Program testified \nrecently that the ground-based missile defense system now in testing no \nlonger requires that anything be invented, only that it be correctly \nengineered. Clearly, the advanced technology required for reliable \nintercept of ballistic missiles is rapidly deteriorating.\n  But there is far more that we can and should be doing. Unfortunately, \ndespite the success that has been demonstrated, missile defense work \nhas been confined to the technology superficially permitted by the 1972 \nABM Treaty. That agreement prohibits some of the most promising \ntechnologies and basing modes available, including air-, space-, sea-, \nand mobile land-based systems, as well as those based on new \ncapabilities like lasers. The ABM Treaty impedes the development and \ndeployment of these missile defenses. This was its central purpose when \nit was crafted three decades ago as a reflection of the political \nrelationship between the Soviet Union and the United States known as \nthe cold war.\n  President Bush has declared his determination to leave the cold war \nbehind. He has backed up his declaration with concrete actions and his \nleadership has generated real progress, despite the sniping of some \ncritics.\n  I believe the rapid progress of the last few months is a result of \nleadership of President Bush and his determination to do what is \nnecessary in this modern world to defend our Nation. It is important to \nconsult with our allies, as he has done, and it will be helpful if we \ncan work out an agreement with the Russians to leave the cold war and \nits trappings behind. Our moving forward to defend ourselves against \nthese new threats cannot depend on the assent of others. President Bush \nhas made it clear that he believes this, and I think his resolve is \nexactly the reason we have seen attitudes change. But our determination \nto defend our Nation cannot be contingent on someone else's permission.\n  I suppose it was predictable that the more momentum is generated, the \nmore wild the claims of the critics would get, and we have seen that, \ntoo, in recent days. Those who would prefer America be vulnerable to \nmissile attack have taken a variety of approaches in their efforts to \nensure that remains the case. One is to say we should go slow, don't \nrush the technology, don't do anything diplomatically risky. But \ntimidity is a good part of the reason we face such an urgent situation \nnow, with a real and serious threat but nothing yet in the field to \ndefend against it. The ones who have always said ``go slow'' are the \nsame critics who will say that the slowness of the program's progress \nis evidence that missile defense is not yet mature. Our failure for \nyears to do enough to counter this problem is why we must work with \nurgency today.\n  The critics also assert that our long-range missile defense \ncapability will be easily defeated by simple countermeasures. These \nassertions are based on wild claims from people who would have us \nbelieve that building a missile defense is too difficult a task for the \nUnited States--which possesses the most sophisticated missile and \ncountermeasure capability in the world--but defeating a missile defense \nis a simple task for those who are just now acquiring the capability \nfor long-range missiles. Such arguments are unpersuasive.\n\n  The critics also tell us that deployment of missile defenses will \ncreate an arms race, even though the Russians have neither the \nresources nor a reason to engage in a buildup in strategic offensive \narms. Even if they did, with whom would they race? President Bush has \nannounced his intention to dramatically reduce the offensive nuclear \nforces of the United States, regardless of what the Russians do, and \nhas taken the first step toward doing so by announcing the deactivation \nof our multiple warhead Peacekeeper missiles. A situation in which one \nside builds up its missiles while the other reduces is certainly not an \narms race. I think the Russians understand this, too, and will \nrecognize the futility of spending scarce resources to counter a \nmissile defense system that does not threaten them.\n  As for China, while the previous administration was devoting itself \nto--in its words--``strengthening the ABM Treaty,'' China was \nmodernizing and expanding its nuclear forces. So China has already \ndemonstrated that assessments of its own national security interests \nare unlikely to be affected by what the United States does or doesn't \ndo with respect to missile defenses. Moreover, those who suggest we \nforgo defenses so as not to ``threaten'' China are implying that China \nhas some sort of right to threaten us with its missiles. I reject such \na suggestion. Defenses are not provocative, no nation has a right to \nthreaten the United States, and the United States has no obligation to \nguarantee any country's right to do so.\n  There are other criticisms of our missile defense efforts, most even \nless convincing than those I have just mentioned, and other arguments \nin its favor which I have not discussed. I'm sure other Senators will \naddress many of them in the course of the next few days. But the \ndiscussion has moved far beyond where it was 2 years ago when we stood \nhere and debated the National Missile Defense Act. Thanks to the \nactions of Congress, there is no longer any question about whether the \nUnited States will defend its citizens against missile attack, only \nabout the methods we use and how fast we will field them. And thanks to \nthe efforts of President Bush there is no longer any question about \nwhether we will continue to be held hostage by an obsolete agreement \nfrom another era. I welcome the progress that has been made on all \nfronts, and I look forward to supporting the achievement of genuine \nsecurity of the United States and its citizens.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I thank the Chair and my colleagues for \ngiving me an opportunity to speak for a few minutes this afternoon on a \npoint I want to make regarding missile defense and the budget and the \nABM Treaty compliance. I think this is going to be a very important \ndebate. It has already started in the Armed Services Committee on which \nI serve.\n  I thought my colleague from Mississippi, Mr. Thad Cochran, this \nmorning made some very cogent comments. I did want to follow up with \nsome further comments on that particular issue.\n  I have heard some reluctance by a few of my colleagues to approve the \nBallistic Missile Defense Organization budget without knowing for \ncertain now whether the testing activities planned comply with the ABM \nTreaty. They say the Senate cannot approve a budget if it is not \ncompliant.\n  As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, it is my \nunderstanding that compliance determinations are almost never--I \nemphasize never--made well in advance of a test or other activity. It \nis virtually impossible to do so because the plans often change right \nup to the time of the test. I would like to highlight a few examples of \nthis occurring.\n  In integrated flight test 1, what we commonly refer to as IFT-1, \nwhich was the first test of the exoatmospheric kill vehicle, which \noccurred on January 16, 1977, compliance itself was not certified until \nDecember 20 of 1996.\n  Here is another example, the Technical Critical Measurements Program, \nthe TCMP, flight 2A was not certified until February 14, 1997, just 8 \ndays before that actual test occurred.\n  The risk reduction flight test 1, for what was then the National \nMissile Defense Program, was certified just 3 days before it occurred \nin 1997, and the second risk reduction flight was certified just 2 days \nbefore it was conducted a month later.\n  A test for the NMD prototype radar was not certified until August 31, \n1998. That was less than 3 weeks before it occurred.\n  The first test of the Navy theater-wide missile was certified \nNovember 2, 1998, for a November 20 flight.\n  IFT-3 for the National Missile Defense system, which was the first--\nand successful--intercept attempt, was certified on September 28, 1999, \njust 4 days before the test.\n\n[[Page S8565]]\n\n  IFT-4 was certified 12 days before the test took place on January 18, \n2000.\n  The certification for IFT-5 was issued 8 days before that test last \nsummer, but the certification actually had to be modified on July 7, \nthe day before the test because of changes in the test plan.\n  I have a chart on my right. On this column, we talk about test \nevents. We talk about the day the test was performed. Then we talk \nabout the day that it was certified for compliance with the ABM Treaty.\n  As you can tell from the many times I mentioned earlier in several \nexamples, it was just a day before the actual test flight for compliant \ncertification.\n  My point is to expect us to have compliance during the budget \ndeliberations before the Senate hearing simply doesn't make any sense.\n  However, I will note that there are at least two exceptions to this \npractice. Last year, Congress approved a budget that included military \nconstruction funding for a radar in Alaska that Congress knew was non-\ncompliant with the ABM Treaty. And in January 1994, a compliance review \nof the proposed THAAD program determined that it was not in compliance \nwith the terms of the ABM Treaty. Yet in the fall of 1994, Congress \nvoted to approve the BMDO budget--one that included a program that was \ncertified to be non-compliant.\n  It is also interesting to note that THAAD program testing was \napproved in January of 1995 on the condition that its ability to accept \ndata from external sensors be substantially limited. Only in 1996 was \nTHAAD testing with external cuing data approved because the \ndetermination was finally made that THAAD did not have ABM \ncapabilities. I believe this stands as a good illustration of two \nsalient facts: first, that ABM Treaty compliance is in part a matter of \nboth legal and political judgment; second, that the United States has \nalways reserved for itself the authority to judge the compliance of its \nown programs.\n  Bearing these facts in mind, I would argue that this administration \nhas been very straightforward with Congress. The President, the \nSecretary of Defense, and the Deputy Secretary have all told us that \nthe United States and Russia need to move beyond the ABM Treaty. They \nhave told us that the President's commitment to deploy missile defenses \nand the missile defense program he has proposed are on a collision \ncourse with the ABM Treaty. They have told us that the BMDO test \nprogram was not designed either to violate or comply with the Treaty, \nbut that it was designed to proceed as efficiently as possible toward \nthe goal of developing effective missile defenses. They have told us \nthat, as a result, there will be serious issues concerning treaty \ncompliance that will arise in a matter of months.\n  My colleague from Mississippi, Senator Cochran, tried to make that \npoint--that we need to focus on what our needs are and shoot towards \nthose defensive needs.\n  Secretary Wolfowitz has even identified the key issues that he \nexpects will emerge. The Secretary, Deputy Secretary, and Lt. Gen. \nKadish have also told us that BMDO program activities have not been \nfully vetted through the certification process--as is typically the \ncase. Consequently, the legal and political judgements to resolve those \nissues have not been made yet.\n  I would further argue that statements by Secretary Wolfowitz, Lt. \nGen. Kadish, and others in the administration have been remarkably open \nand consistent in this area. Lt. Gen. Kadish indicated in a briefing \nseveral weeks ago his understanding that the BMDO program proposals for \nfiscal year 2002 would be compliant with the ABM Treaty, with the \nimportant caveat, that some issues needed to be clarified by the \ncompliance review process. Secretary Wolfowitz went into considerable \ndetail concerning areas in which the proposed program would ``bump \ninto'' treaty constraints. An administration document says that the \nproposed program would be ``in conflict'' with the treaty ``in the \nmatter of months, not years.''\n  Whether someone says the program is ``awaiting clarification'' or \n``that it may bump up against'' or ``come into conflict with'' the ABM \ntreaty, the point is that this is a serious issue that needs to be \nresolved. And that was precisely the Deputy Secretary's point--that \nseveral months ahead of time, the department would know what key \nprogram issues would need to be resolved through the established \ncompliance review processes, and that they would be resolved through \nthese processes in regular order.\n\n  In considering how we ought to handle these issues, we need to bear \nin mind that there is a wide range of opinion concerning the value of \nthe ABM Treaty. Some believe that the ABM Treaty is the foundation \nstone on which U.S. security is built. Others argue that the ABM Treaty \nis gone and has simply outlived its usefulness and some agree with the \nadministration that the Nation needs to move on to a new strategic \nframework to guide our relations with Russia.\n  Given this range of opinion, and the administration's view that the \ntreaty's value has been overtaken by events, the use of well-\nestablished processes and procedures to judge the treaty compliance of \nBMDO program activities hardly seems radical or unusual. Indeed, it \nseems a modest and conservative approach.\n  Secretary Wolfowitz outlined for us several possible outcomes of \nthese deliberations within the compliance review process. The nation \nmay have moved beyond the ABM Treaty to a new strategic framework with \nRussia and the program will not be constrained by the treaty. The \nprogram activities in question might be deemed to be compliant with the \ntreaty. Or on the other hand, the program activities might be deemed to \nbe inconsistent with the treaty.\n  In the absence of an alternative framework, according to the \nSecretary, the Nation will be faced with an unpalatable choice--either \nwe must alter the test program so that it is compliant with the treaty \nbut is less efficient and more costly, or we must face the prospect of \nexercising our rights under article XV that allows the nation to \nwithdraw from the treaty. Please note--and this cannot be stressed too \nmuch--in all of these cases, the United States will remain in \ncompliance with our obligations under domestic and international law.\n  Thus, the suggestion that Senators should not agree to the BMDO \nbudget because we don't have perfect visibility into the ABM Treaty \ncompliance of Ballistic Missile Defense program activities strikes me \nas, at best, odd. It is inconsistent with past practice. It is \ninconsistent with established processes and procedures used throughout \nthe Clinton administration and which the Bush administration intends to \ncontinue. And it is inconsistent with the simple fact that the United \nState will remain in compliance with our obligations under domestic and \ninternational law regardless of the conclusions of the established \nlegal and political authorities regarding specific BMD test activities.\n  It does strike me as a path that indicates a desire for confrontation \nwith the administration, not cooperation, and one that expresses \nphilosophical opposition to missile defense rather than practical \nprogrammatic concerns. For the Congress to take the position that \nabsolute adherence to the ABM Treaty is a prerequisite for approval of \na BMDO budget would, in one stroke, undermine both tracks of the \nPresident's policy: to proceed with expedited development of missile \ndefenses and to engage Russia in a constructive dialogue.\n  I urge all my colleagues to proceed in this matter in a calm, \nreasoned, and non-partisan manner that does not undermine the President \nor the flexibility to proceed in his discussions with Russia as he sees \nfit.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/01/senate-section/article/S8565-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8565-S8566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING KOREY STRINGER\n\n  Mr. DAYTON.

He died early this morning due to complications from heat \nstroke.\n  Korey Stringer joined the Vikings as a first-round draft pick out of \nOhio State University. He has been our starting right tackle ever \nsince. Last year, he was named for the first time\n\n[[Page S8566]]\n\nto the all-pro team. Korey was more than an all-pro football player; he \nwas an all-pro human being. He made Minnesota his year-round home, and \nhe was one of the Vikings' most active community members.\n  He established his ``Korey's crew'' community service program at \nseveral local schools and libraries. He served as an outstanding \nleader, mentor, and role model for many Minnesota youngsters and \nadults.\n  Minnesota has lost one of our best citizens at the tragically early \nage of 27. Our hearts and our deepest sympathies go out to his wife \nKelcie, his 3-year old son Kodie, and the rest of his family.\n  Korey, we will miss you.

BRIGITTE HANES\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I know that my colleagues are aware of \nthe excellent services provided by the military liaison offices of the \nSenate. For many years military and civilian liaison officers have \ngiven invaluable assistance in the areas of constituent services, \nmilitary issues, and fact-finding visits.\n  One of these liaison officers is Mrs. Brigitte Hanes. During the past \nnine years she has worked tirelessly solving the problems of soldiers \nand their families who have asked for help from their Senators.\n  The wife of an Army officer, Brigitte raised two daughters before \nembarking on her own career. First, she served on the staff of the \nCommander in Chief of the Joint Forces in Korea. Then she was the \nPersonal Affairs Coordinator for foreign military students at the \nCommand and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth. Brigitte and her \nhusband moved to Washington in 1991. It was December of that year that \nshe went to work in the Army Senate Liaison Office.\n  She gained a reputation around the Senate as a very reliable person. \nFew people are more widely known and respected than Brigitte. She is \nknown throughout the Senate as an expert in dealing with a range of \nconstituent issues relating to the Army and many other military \nmatters.\n  When I needed to get something done I would call Brigitte. For \nexample: she arranged for the shipment of a wheel chair from a \nSenator's office to the mayor of a town in Bosnia. In fact she \ndelivered it to Andrews Air Force Base herself to start it on its way. \nShe talked to a deserter and although he was afraid, she convinced him \nto turn himself in to Army authorities. She talked a soldier into \nboarding a plane for Korea. He had called his mother from the airport \nand told her he was not going to get on the plane. She called the \nSenator's aide who put in a conference call to Brigitte. She got two \nyears incapacitation pay for a Reservist whose unit administrator had \nbeen unable to get it for him.\n  In addition to her vast casework load she organized and escorted \nSenate staffers on very informative orientation visits to military \nposts where they could see the Army at work.\n  She has been honored repeatedly by her superiors who recognized what \na valuable resource they had in Brigitte.\n  We will miss her support in the Army Senate Liaison Office when she \nleaves at the end of August to accept a promotion in the office of the \nChief of Army Reserves' Legislative Liaison Office.\n  I would like to say thank you to Brigitte for her nine years of \ndevoted service to the Senate and to wish her success and happiness in \nher new endeavor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/01/senate-section/article/S8566-2", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8566-S8567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE NATIONAL YOUTH SCIENCE CAMP\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, every summer the senior Senator from West \nVirginia, Mr. Byrd, hosts a luncheon for the participants of the \nNational Youth Science Camp.\n  This is a distinguished collection of high school students from every \nState in the Nation who have demonstrated exceptional abilities in the \nfields of science and technology. They participate in a two-week \nscience camp in Green Bank, WV, and, afterwards, spend several days \ntouring Washington, D.C. Their time in the Nation's capital culminates \nin the luncheon hosted by Senator Byrd.\n  At this year's luncheon, held in the Russell Caucus Room on July 19, \nSenator Byrd was introduced by a member of the board of the National \nYouth Science Foundation, Mr. Charles McElwee.\n  When Mr. McElwee introduced Senator Byrd at the luncheon, I was \nimpressed. He recognized the remarkable accomplishments of the senior \nSenator from West Virginia: that Senator Byrd has served in the Senate \nfor more than 42 years, has been elected to 8 consecutive 6-year Senate \nterms, and has held more Senate leadership positions than any other \nSenator in history.\n  Next, he referred to Senator Byrd's knowledge of Senate Rules, the \nConstitution, and the Bible, and his prolific writings on the histories \nof the U.S. Senate and the Roman Senate.\n  Mr. McElwee then proceeded to challenge the young, budding scientists \n``to make the most of [their] natural minds, as has Senator Byrd.''\n  I consider this powerful introduction of Senator Byrd a touching \nexample of how one of Senator Byrd's constituents feels about him. It \nhighlights the esteem in which he is held by his fellow West \nVirginians, and I want to share it with my colleagues. Therefore, I ask \nthat Mr. McElwee's introduction of Senator Byrd be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nIntroduction of Hon. Robert C. Byrd, U.S. Senate Luncheon for National \n                         Youth Science Campers\n\n                          (By Charles McElwee)\n\n       How do I introduce a person before whom I stand in awe? How \n     do I introduce and pay tribute to West Virginia's most \n     respected and admired elected public official in the State's \n     history? How do I make the introduction and hold the \n     attention of youth, our guest science campers, when decades \n     separate us in age? I resolved to try by relating the mind \n     and accomplishments of our esteemed speaker to the minds and \n     aspirations of our youthful listeners.\n       I commence by way of a reference to a renowned \n     mathematician, John Forbes Nash, Jr. Nash was born and reared \n     in Bluefield, West Virginia. He is recognized as a genius in \n     mathematics, especially in game theory, for which he was \n     awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1994. His recent \n     biographer has described Nash as having ``A Beautiful Mind'' \n     and has given that title to her biography of him.\n       While I stand among a hundred, young, beautiful minds, I \n     introduce a man with a singularly beautiful mind who has \n     cultivated, developed and used his natural endowment to its \n     fullest potential. I speak of the Honorable Robert C. Byrd, \n     the senior United States Senator from your host state, the \n     State of West Virginia, and your host for this luncheon \n     today.\n       Senator Byrd has served in the United States Senate for \n     more than 42 years and was reelected in 2000 to an \n     unprecedented eighth consecutive six-year Senate term. He has \n     held more leadership positions in the Senate than any other \n     Senator in history, and presently serves as Chairman of the \n     powerful Senate Committee on Appropriations.\n       Senator Byrd is a lawyer, having obtained his J.D. degree \n     cum laude after ten years of study in night classes in law \n     school, making him the only sitting member of either House of \n     Congress to begin and complete law degree studies while \n     serving in Congress.\n       I have already told you enough to establish that Senator \n     Byrd is a man with a great mind and substantial achievements. \n     But I don't want to stop there because I want to use this \n     brief occasion of introduction to challenge you to make the \n     most of your natural gifts of beautiful minds, just as \n     Senator Byrd has done. Let me illustrate what a beautiful \n     mind can accomplish when it is disciplined and applied.\n       (Holding up a copy of the United States Constitution.) \n     Senator Byrd carries with him at all times when discharging \n     his public duties a copy of the United States Constitution. \n     His knowledge of this document is, in my opinion, unsurpassed \n     by any other member of the Senate. He qualifies as a \n     constitutional lawyer and scholar. In fact, Senator Byrd \n     shared with another the first ``We the People'' award \n     presented by the National Constitution Center to a \n     constitutional scholar, who had demonstrated his love of, and \n     concern for, the United States Constitution.\n       (Holding up a copy of the Bible.) Senator Byrd's knowledge \n     of the Bible, King James version, is stupendous. He can \n     recite from memory dozens of passages from both the Old and \n     New Testaments. But more importantly, he and Erma, his \n     beloved wife of sixty-four years, have shaped their lives to \n     conform with biblical precepts.\n       (Holding up a copy of one of Senator Byrd's favorite poems, \n     ``The Bridge Builder.'') Senator Byrd has an immense \n     knowledge of English and American literature and has \n     committed to memory a great store of verse. Two of his \n     favorite poems are ``The Bridge Builder'' and ``Fence or An \n     Ambulance.'' Both refer to youth like you. In the first, an \n     old man has\n\n[[Page S8567]]\n\n     crossed over a deep and perilous chasm. Although he would \n     never pass that way again, he stopped to build a bridge to \n     span the cleft. Upon being asked why, the old man explained:\n\n     There followeth after me today,\n     A youth whose feet must pass this way.\n     This chasm which was but naught to me\n     To that fair youth may a pitfall be.\n\n       The second of the poems has this wise counsel: ``Better \n     guide well the young than reclaim them when old.'' The \n     stewardship which Senator Byrd believes that adults have for \n     the welfare and development of the young is evident in his \n     most beloved verses.\n       (Holding up one volume of four volumes written by Senator \n     Byrd on ``The Senate, 1789-1989.'') These four volumes are a \n     virtual encyclopedia of Senate History. There is probably no \n     person alive who knows the history and parliamentary rules of \n     the United States Senate better than Senator Byrd.\n       (Holding up a copy of ``The Senate of the Roman \n     Republic.'') This volume is a compilation of fourteen \n     addresses delivered on the floor of the Senate by Senator \n     Byrd over five and a-half months on the History of Roman \n     Constitutionalism in opposition to the proposal for a line-\n     item presidential veto. The important point here is that he \n     delivered each of these fourteen speeches, which were packed \n     with names, dates, and complex narratives, entirely from \n     memory and without recourse to notes or consultations with \n     staff aides.\n       The author of the Foreword of ``The Senate of the Roman \n     Republic'' has described the book and the lectures compiled \n     these as displaying ``vast learning, prodigious memory, and \n     single-minded determination.  .  .  .'' And so it is that \n     Senator Byrd has used his beautiful mind to accumulate vast \n     learning, to develop a prodigious memory, and to challenge \n     himself at all times with a single-minded determination.\n       But it has not been his mind, or his learning, or his \n     memory that has endeared Senator Byrd to the people of West \n     Virginia. Their affection of him is attributable to his \n     public service and to his sincere interest in their lives and \n     concern for their welfare. No member of the United States \n     Congress or of the Senate of the Roman Republic has served \n     his other constituency with more distinction than has Senator \n     Byrd.\n       We have talked about Senator Byrd's great mind, his \n     learning, his memory, his discipline, his determination, his \n     public service, and his interest in people, all superb \n     attributes of which we stand in awe. Yet there is one trait \n     which I have not mentioned. Senator Byrd referred to it in a \n     speech he gave last week on the floor of the Senate.\n       After cajoling his colleagues that the business of the \n     Senate requires more than a three-day work week, Senator Byrd \n     said that he would just as soon be in the Senate ``as to be \n     at home on Saturday mopping the floor.'' ``Yes,'' Senator \n     Byrd said, ``I mop the bathroom. I mop the kitchen floor. I \n     mop the utility room. I vacuum. I dust. I even clean the \n     commodes around my house.'' Add then Senator Byrd added, ``It \n     is good for me. It keeps me humble.''\n       Humility is the eighth, and perhaps the finest, \n     characteristic of our Senator Byrd. And so I implore, you, \n     our guest science campers, to use your good minds with \n     humility. If mopping floors will help you to be humble, then \n     mop floors.\n       Senator Byrd has been a long-time supporter of the National \n     Youth Science Camp in West Virginia and has sponsored this \n     luncheon for many years. Will you please join with me in \n     applauding Senator Byrd as a way of expressing our gratitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/01/senate-section/article/S8567-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AGREEMENT TO PROCEED TO THE EXPORT ADMINISTRATION ACT ON OR AFTER \n                           SEPTEMBER 4, 2001\n\n  Mr. SHELBY.

Madam President, 125 years ago today, on August 1, \n1876, President Ulysses S. Grant issued a proclamation declaring \nColorado a state. Today, I want to honor that anniversary by \nhighlighting some thoughts about Colorado--the beauty of its landscape, \nthe pioneering spirit of its people, and the engines that fuel its \nprosperity.\n  My home State of Colorado is a very special place. We have a rich and \ncolorful history. We are blessed by geography and climate. We are \nculturally diverse, highly educated and highly motivated.\n  The movement to settle Colorado began in the late 1850's when \nprospectors found gold along Cherry Creek near Denver. Gold hunters \nrushed into the area and ``Pikes Peak or Bust'' became the slogan of \nthe day. The gold didn't last, but the potential for prosperity and an \nunmatched quality of life did.\n  It was not until about 20 years later, however, that Colorado, after \nseveral failed attempts, became a state. A new mining boom brought \nwealth and growth to Colorado again. This time it was silver, not gold, \nthat caused the growth.\n  In the 125 years since, Colorado has been marked by a series of \neconomic booms and busts. Right now, we have one of the most \ndiversified economies in the Nation. Colorado has grown from a \nprimarily agricultural and mining State to a hub of technological and \nindustrial development for the Nation. An increasing number of high-\ntech companies are choosing to locate in Colorado; the communications \nindustry is revolutionizing how we stay in touch with one another; and \nColorado's mild dry climate and colorful Old West history have made \ntourism the second largest industry in the State.\n  Colorado is one of the Nation's major outdoor recreation areas. Few \nStates offer as many sporting opportunities. We fish and camp along \npristine rivers and lakes. River-running and white-water rafting are \nimportant summer activities. And we in Colorado enjoy some of the best \nskiing in the world. We bike, we hike, and we run--and we use one of \nthe most extensive urban bikeways and trail systems in the Nation. One \nof the top 10k races in the United States--the Bolder Boulder--draws \nrecord crowds of world-class runners and area residents. And, the \n14,000 foot peaks in Colorado, all 54 of them, bring mountain climbers \nof all ages and skills to our State.\n  And, we in Colorado don't just participate in sports--we also play \nthe part of spectator. Our capital city of Denver is the home of five \nmajor professional sports teams--baseball, football, basketball, soccer \nand hockey--making it a major-league sports town.\n  Colorado's vibrant cultural scene rivals that of any in the world. We \nhave a variety of theatrical, musical and other cultural attractions. \nColorado is the home of the Aspen Institute, the Aspen Music Festival \nand the Central City Opera. Denver has three nationally known theaters \nand the State boasts a comprehensive network of public libraries, \nmuseums, community theaters and orchestras. Most towns and cities have \nlocal festivals to celebrate unique cultural traditions.\n  The cultural diversity of our population gives Colorado many of its \ngreatest traditions and treasures. Colorado is home to two Native \nAmerican tribes, the Southern Ute and the Ute Mountain Ute tribes. The \nland they inhabit covers the southwestern corner of Colorado, abutting \nthe borders with Utah, Arizona and New Mexico.\n  Some of our earliest settlers came to Colorado from Mexico and \nsettled in\n\n[[Page S8568]]\n\nthe San Luis Valley. In fact, the town of San Luis in that valley is \nColorado's oldest town, which just recently celebrated its 150th \nanniversary. The name of our State, Colorado, came from a Spanish word \nfor red, and our conversation is laced with Spanish words.\n  The traditions, artwork and music of these and many other cultures \nare a treasured part of Colorado's identity, and we respect and honor \nthe gifts they give us.\n  Colorado is known for its strong military presence. It is home to the \nUnited States Air Force Academy where the soaring structure of the \nAcademy's cathedral with Pikes Peak in the background dominates the \nlandscape. Peterson Air Force Base--home to the U.S. Space Command, Air \nForce Space Command and the Army Space Command--strengthens the \nmilitary presence in our state. And, the North American Aerospace \nDefense Command (NORAD) with its command center located deep inside \nCheyenne Mountain adds to Colorado's reputation as recently described \nby a high-ranking Air Force General as America's ``space mecca.''\n  While our ski industry, our world class airport, our sports teams, \nand our technology industry bring travelers from all over the world to \nour State, Colorado broke into the international scene in a new way \nwhen Denver was chosen as the site of the G-8 summit of world leaders \nin 1997.\n  Throughout the 125 years since Colorado became a State, its citizens \nhave had a common goal: to make the state a stronger, more vibrant \nplace. From the snow capped peaks of the Continental Divide to the \nfarms and ranches on the Front Range and the Western Slope, the \ncitizens of my home state have worked together to make Colorado a great \nplace to call home.\n  I want to thank you for allowing me to celebrate Colorado's 125th \nanniversary of statehood by recognizing just a few of the things that \nmake it such a great place to live.\n  To close, I ask my colleagues to join me in a Mile High salute to the \ncitizens of Colorado on the 125th anniversary of their great State.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of President Grant's proclamation \ndeclaring Colorado a State be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    A Proclamation by the President of the United States of America\n\n       Whereas the Congress of the United States do, by an Act \n     approved on the third day of March, one thousand eight \n     hundred and seventy-five authorize the inhabitants of the \n     Territory of Colorado to form for themselves out of said \n     Territory State Government with the name of the State of \n     Colorado, and for the admission of such State into the Union, \n     on an equal footing with the original States upon certain \n     conditions in said Act specified,\n       And whereas it was provided by said Act of Congress that \n     the Convention elected by the people of said Territory to \n     frame a State Constitution received by me,\n       Now, Therefore, I, Ulysses S.

Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to \na young woman, Deborah Vincent, who, in March of this year, began her \nwork with the city of Baltimore's Public Housing authority as its \nDeputy Executive Director. Sadly, however, Ms. Vincent was diagnosed \nwith leukemia in June and passed away on July 26. There is always a \ngreat sense of loss when a person dies in the prime of their life, in \nthis case, loss by those that knew her, her family, friends, colleagues \nand loved ones. However, I too want to express my loss and the loss to \nthe citizens of Baltimore and the residents of the city's public \nhousing with the passing of Deborah Vincent.\n  Ms. Vincent came to Baltimore after working at the U.S. Department of \nHousing and Urban Development, first as the General Deputy Assistant \nSecretary in the Office of Public and Indian Housing and then as Deputy \nChief of Staff to Secretary Andrew Cuomo. At HUD Ms. Vincent worked \ntirelessly for those in need in this country; for the homeless, for \nthose in need of a place to live, for those in need of assistance to \ndefeat substance abuse, and for those in need of a caring and friendly \nenvironment in which to raise their families. At HUD she not only \ndemonstrated her passion to get the job done, but also her compassion \nfor those that have the least in our society.\n  Although only 43-years-old when she died, Ms. Vincent had 20 years of \nexperience managing public housing. From 1981 until 1997, before coming \nto HUD, she managed the Clearwater Housing Authority in Clearwater, FL. \nAs its executive director, she took the Clearwater Housing Authority \nfrom what had been described as a ``shambles'' to one of the \noutstanding public housing authorities in the nation. Recognizing that \nthose most in need of safe and decent housing in the Clearwater \ncommunity were those in public housing she mustered her inner strength \nand began cleaning up Clearwater's public housing projects, getting rid \nof drug dealers, scofflaws, and improving the quality of life for the \nresidents that remained.\n  Ms. Vincent was also an innovator; under her leadership the Housing \nAuthority established homeownership programs by purchasing condominiums \nand selling them to qualified public housing residents. Later, \nrecognizing that there was a need for affordable housing for those \nClearwater residents that did not qualify for public housing \nassistance, the Housing Authority purchased a large apartment building \nand sold the units, at a discount, to those who could not afford to \npurchase a home at market rates. To this day, Clearwater's Housing \nAuthority is recognized for its innovative housing programs.\n  At the beginning of this statement I said that Ms. Vincent's death \nwas not only a loss to those who knew her, but also to those that were \njust beginning to know her, the residents of Baltimore and of \nBaltimore's public housing. Like them, I know all too well the need for \nthe expertise, spirit and compassion that Ms. Vincent brought to her \njob in just a few short months with the Baltimore Housing Authority. \nLet us hope that her example of caring will live on in all of us so \nthat we can achieve great things, as she did as a truly dedicated \npublic servant.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/01/senate-section/article/S8568-3", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8568-S8569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n[[Page S8569]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/01/senate-section/article/S8568-3", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8568-S8569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n[[Page S8569]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/01/senate-section/article/S8569-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/01/senate-section/article/S8569-2", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:21 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2505.

A bill to amend the Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933 \nto modify provisions relating to the Board of Directors of the \nTennessee Valley Authority, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nreform the board structure of the Tennessee Valley Authority. The \nlegislation that I am introducing with my colleague from Alabama would \ncreate a corporate structure to oversee TVA.\n  This legislation expands the board from the current three members to \n14 members, requiring the President to appoint two members from each of \nthe seven states in which TVA operates. In addition to expanding the \nboard, our legislation creates the position of a Chief Executive \nOfficer who will be responsible for daily management and operation \ndecisions. Under this new structure, board members would serve on a \npart-time basis, receiving a stipend for their services and the CEO \nwould become the only full-time, paid position.\n  It is no secret that TVA has suffered financial turmoil in the past \nand is still trying to work its way out of substantial debt. In my \nview, restructuring and reform are overdue. The goal of this \nlegislation is to provide the Authority with board members that have a \ndirect interest in the well-being of TVA and its rate payers and to \nplace at the helm a Chief Executive Officer to make the difficult \nbusiness decisions that will guide TVA through the impending challenges \nof an evolving energy industry.\n  TVA is a multi-billion dollar entity. However, it continues to \noperate under the same administrative structure it did when Congress \ncreated the Authority in 1933. Senator Sessions and I believe that it \nis time for that structure to change. It is time for the Tennessee \nValley Authority to step into the 21st Century and out of the \nbureaucratic stronghold that has guided its decision making process for \nso long. We believe that this new board structure will equip TVA to \nmeet the challenges of the future and better serve the people of \nAlabama and the other States in which it operates.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1288\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Navy to report \nchanges in budget and staffing that take place as a result of the \nregionalization program of the Navy; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  Mr. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Navy \nRegionalization Reporting Act, a bill that would benefit all Navy bases \nand their surrounding communities by providing ample notification of \nplanned, through regular reports, and unplanned, through the \nCongressional notifications, funding and employment level changes due \nto the Navy's regionalization process.\n  Earlier this year, it was brought to my attention that both funding \nand jobs at the Naval Air Station in Brunswick, ME, could be impacted \nby the Navy's reallocation of base operating functions as part of its \nregionalization program. The Navy's stated goal for the regionalization \nprogram is to consolidate functions by eliminating management and \nsupport redundancies with the end result being increased efficiency and \ndecreased overhead costs for shore installations. As such, for the \nNavy's program to be successful, funding, as well as jobs, must be \nreduced in some areas.\n  While I applaud Navy's intentions to increase efficiency and save \ntaxpayer dollars, I can not support efforts that may lead to reduced \nservice levels for our men and women in uniform. I am also concerned \nthat the Navy has not been able to produce detailed projections on the \nimpact regionalization will have on the Federal employees.\n  To date, the Navy has been unable to answer questions regarding \nfuture employment levels and has not established a method to track or \npredict changes in budget and job allocations at its bases that take \nplace as a result of the regionalization program.\n  This legislation would require the Navy to establish a tracking and \nplanning program to make these changes more transparent. The Navy would \nprovide an initial baseline or historical report that includes the pre-\nregionalization budgets and staffing levels at each base or station in \neach Navy region by July 2002. Subsequently, the Navy would submit \nsemi-annual reports with projected and actual losses, gains, or \nrestructuring of budgets and staff for each base. Any deviation from \nthe reported budget or staff projections would then require \nCongressional notification 30 days prior to implementation.\n  Finally, in an effort to prevent the degradation of operational \nreadiness and quality of life for our service members due to the \nredistribution of base support functions, this legislation includes a \nSense of the Senate that the Navy should ensure the job and dollar \ndistribution within each region is equitable and does not become \nconcentrated at one location.\n  To assure the benefits of the Navy's program are equitably realized \nat all bases and communities, I urge my colleagues to support the Navy \nRegionalization Reporting Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY.

A bill to amend the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act of 1996 to permit States to determine State \nresidency for higher education purposes and to authorize the \ncancellation of removal and adjustment of status of certain alien \ncollege-bound students who are long term United States residents; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today to introduce legislation \naimed at benefitting a very special group of persons--illegal alien \nchildren who are long-term residents of the United States. This \nlegislation, known as the ``DREAM Act,'' would allow children who have \nbeen brought to the United States through no volition of their own the \nopportunity to fulfill their dreams, to secure a college degree and \nlegal status. The purpose of the DREAM Act is to ensure that we leave \nno child behind, regardless of his or her legal status in the United \nStates or their parents' illegal status.\n  By law, undocumented alien children are entitled to a subsidized \neducation through high school. In fact, an estimated 50,000 to 70,000 \nsuch students graduate from high schools throughout the country each \nyear. Many of these students are thereafter interested in bettering \nthemselves and their families by securing higher education. Generally, \nadmittance to college is not a problem. However, the cost of attending \ncollege and the lack of any mechanism by which undocumented aliens \nstudents may obtain legal status in the United States prevents these \nchildren from having a meaningful opportunity to obtain a college \ndegree. The DREAM Act would 1. aid undocumented alien children in their \nfinancial efforts to attend college, and 2. provide adjustment of \nstatus to undocumented alien children who secure a degree of higher \neducation.\n  Presently, the law penalizes States that grant a post-secondary \nbenefit, such as in-state tuition, to an undocumented student unless \nthe state also provides that same benefit to out-of-state students. I \nbelieve that the decision of a State to grant any such benefit to an \nundocumented individual residing in the same rests with the State \nalone. Accordingly, I am opposed to that aforementioned provision of \nlaw. The bill I introduce today, the DREAM Act, proposes to repeal that \nsection of the law.\n  Second, I propose that we offer undocumented alien children the \nopportunity to earn permanent residency in the United States in \nconjunction with earning either a 4 or 2-year college degree. Under the \nDREAM Act, an alien who has continuously resided in the United States \nfor 5 years, is a person of good moral character, has not been \nconvicted of certain offenses, and has been admitted to a qualified \ninstitute of higher education may adjust his or her status to that of \nconditional permanent resident. Thereafter, the student has 6 or 4 \nyears to graduate from a qualified 4 or 2-year institution, \nrespectively. Upon graduation and a demonstration that the student has \nremained a person of good moral character, has maintained his or her \ncontinuous physical presence in the United States, and has not become \nremovable based on criminal convictions or security grounds, the \nconditions of the student's status are removed and that student becomes \na full-fledged permanent resident.\n  I recognize that there are significant differences between the DREAM \nAct and other legislation that has been recently introduced. However, I \nlook forward to working with members of this body to ensure that the \nAmerican dream is extended to these children. I therefore strongly urge \nmy colleagues to support this bill and thereby provide hope and \nopportunity to hundreds of thousands of deserving alien children \nnationwide.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be included \nfollowing my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1291\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

RESTORATION OF STATE OPTION TO DETERMINE RESIDENCY \n                   FOR PURPOSES OF HIGHER EDUCATION BENEFITS.\n\n       Section 505 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \n     Responsibility Act of 1996 (division C of Public Law 104-208; \n     110 Stat 3009-672; 8 U.S.C. 1623) is repealed.\n\n     SEC. 3. CANCELLATION OF REMOVAL AND ADJUSTMENT OF STATUS OF \n                   CERTAIN LONG-TERM RESIDENT STUDENTS.\n\n       (a) Special Rule for Children in Qualified Institutions of \n     Higher Education.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law \n     and subject to paragraph (2), the Attorney General may cancel \n     removal of, and adjust to the status of an alien lawfully \n     admitted for permanent residence, subject to the conditional \n     basis described in section 4, an alien who is inadmissible or \n     deportable from the United States, if the alien demonstrates \n     that--\n       (A) the alien has applied for relief under this subsection \n     not later than two years after the date of enactment of this \n     Act;\n       (B) the alien has not, at the time of application, attained \n     the age of 21;\n       (C) the alien, at the time of application, is attending an \n     institution of higher education in the United States (as \n     defined in section 101 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 \n     (20 U.S.C. 1001));\n       (D) the alien was physically present in the United States \n     on the date of the enactment of this Act and has been \n     physically present in the United States for a continuous \n     period of not less than five years immediately preceding the \n     date of enactment of this Act;\n       (E) the alien has been a person of good moral character \n     during such period; and\n       (F) the alien is not inadmissible under section 212(a)(2) \n     or 212(a)(3) or deportable under section 237(a)(2) or \n     237(a)(4).\n       (2) Procedures.--The Attorney General shall provide a \n     procedure by regulation allowing eligible individuals to \n     apply affirmatively for the relief available under this \n     paragraph without being placed in removal proceedings.\n       (b) Termination of Continuous Period.--For purposes of this \n     section, any period of continuous residence or continuous \n     physical presence in the United States of an alien who \n     applies for cancellation of removal under this section shall \n     not terminate when the alien is served a notice to appear \n     under section 239(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n       (c) Treatment of Certain Breaks in Presence.--An alien \n     shall be considered to have failed to maintain continuous \n     physical presence in the United States under subsection (a) \n     if the alien has departed from the United States for any \n     period in excess of 90 days or for any periods in the \n     aggregate exceeding 180 days.\n       (d) Statutory Construction.--Nothing in this section may be \n     construed to apply a numerical limitation on the number of \n     aliens who may be eligible for cancellation of removal or \n     adjustment of status under this section.\n       (e) Regulations.--\n       (1) Proposed regulations.--Not later than 90 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall \n     publish proposed regulations implementing this section.\n       (2) Interim, final regulations.--Not later than 180 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Attorney \n     General shall publish final regulations implementing this \n     section. Such regulations shall be effective immediately on \n     an interim basis, but are subject to change and revision \n     after public notice and opportunity for a period for public \n     comment.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Madam President, one of the great challenges we face \nas a society is to find ways to ease the burdens of our modern, hectic \nworld on working families. When I talk to Missouri parents who work \noutside the home, one of their top concerns, if not their top concern, \nis finding high-quality, affordable child care.\n  Every generation of my own family has struggled with this issue. My \nmother struggled with it. I struggled with it. My children struggle \nwith it now. It would be this grandmother's fondest wish that when my \ngrandchildren become parents themselves, finding affordable, quality \nchild care won't be a problem.\n  More and more, employers are finding that providing access to daycare \nis important in attracting and retaining a quality workforce. Parents \nwho know their children are happy, safe, and enriched in their day care \nsetting are more productive, less distracted, and more satisfied \nemployees. In an effort to support employers' efforts to offer this \nvaluable service to their employees, I have co-sponsored S. 99, a bill \nthat provides tax credits to employers who provide child care \nassistance to their employees.\n  Accessing affordable child care is an issue for federal employees, \ntoo. As the largest employer in the country, the Federal Government \nshall lead by example in supporting working families. For this reason, \ntoday I am introducing the ``Child Care Affordability for Federal \nEmployees Act.\n  Senator Barbara Mikulski is an original co-sponsor of the bill, and I \nwould like to thank her for the strong leadership she has shown on this \nissue. She has worked hard to make this initiative a permanent reality \nfor Federal employees in Maryland and across the United States.\n  This bill grants Federal agencies the flexibility to use a portion of \ntheir funds to provide child care assistance for their lower income \nemployees. Federal agencies can choose to allow the assistance to apply \ntowards the costs of its own-site Federal facility or an individual \nprovider in the area that is licensed and safe.\n  Being able to afford child care is a problem for all employees, but \nit is particularly difficult for low income employees. This bill will \nassist low income Federal employees to afford the safe, quality child \ncare that is available on-site. If the agency so chooses, it could also \nhelp low-income employees better afford safe, licensed child care that \nis available in the community.\n  I hope this legislation will also help the Federal Government compete \nwith the private sector in attracting employees. In January, the GAO \nplaced the Federal Government's human capital crisis on its ``High-\nRisk'' list of serious government problems. In three years, more than \nhalf of the federal workforce will be eligible for regular or early \nretirement. This bill is a strong, concrete action that Congress can \ntake to help the Federal Government compete with the private sector to \nattract the skilled Federal workforce it needs.\n  For the past two years, this initiative has been included in the \nannual Treasury-Postal Appropriations bill. This has been a critical \nfirst step. From its initial implementation, we now know that the \nprogram works and that families in Missouri and across the country have \nbenefit from it. However, because the program was only temporary, some \nFederal agencies elected not to participate. They were afraid to offer \nthe benefit for a year and then have to take it away from their \nemployees if it were not renewed. Other agencies have only implemented \nthe program at a small level for the same reason. Passing this \nlegislation and making the program permanent is essential to helping \nthis initiative reach its full potential and benefit the maximum number \nof families.\n  We know that child care is not simply about children having a place \nto go\n\n[[Page S8583]]\n\nwhere an adult is present. A child's environment has significant impact \non their well-being and development. This is particularly true for \nchildren during the first three years of life. Recent brain studies \nhave shown that those early brain influences matter more than we ever \nimagined. This bill seeks to ensure that more of our children spend \ntheir days in safe, nurturing environments. As the writer Gabriella \nMistral has said: ``Many things can wait, the child cannot ... To him \nwe cannot say tomorrow, his name is today.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. EDWARDS:\n  S. 1292. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ncredit against income tax for dry and wet cleaning equipment which uses \nnon-hazardous primary process solvents; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Small \nBusiness Pollution Prevention and Opportunity Act. This legislation \nwould help address a matter of great concern to all Americans who care \nabout water quality and the environment.\n  Toxic and flammable solvents are used in ninety-five percent of the \n35,000 small dry cleaning businesses in our country. Dry-cleaned \nclothes are the primary source of toxins entering our homes, \nendangering our health. These solvents often leak from storage tanks or \nspill onto the ground, contaminating the property on which dry cleaning \nbusinesses are located. This contamination has resulted in part in the \nlarge number of brownfields sites across our country. These dry \ncleaning solvents are regulated by numerous State and Federal agencies, \ncausing dry cleaners and neighboring businesses to be concerned about \nthe health of their workers and the dangers of property contamination.\n  An innovative scientist, Dr. Joseph M. DeSimone of North Carolina, \ndeveloped an environmentally-friendly alternative to these solvents. He \nand his graduate students have developed a process to clean clothes \nusing liquid carbon dioxide and special detergents. This safer dry \ncleaning method has been commercially available since February 1999, \nwith several machines in operation around the country that have \nsuccessfully cleaned half a million pounds of clothes in over 10,000 \ncleaning cycles at shops in various states across the Nation.\n  The Small Business Pollution Prevention and Opportunity Act would \nprovide new and existing dry cleaners a 20 percent tax credit as an \nincentive to switch to an environmentally-friendly and energy efficient \ntechnology. Dry cleaners in Enterprise Zones would receive a 40 percent \ntax credit. The tax credit would also be extended to wet cleaning \nfabric cleaners who use water-based systems to effectively clean 40 \npercent of ``dry clean only'' garments.\n  This new technology is becoming increasingly recognized as a safer, \ncleaner alternative to traditional dry cleaning. The U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency, EPA, has issued a case study declaring liquid carbon \ndioxide as a viable alternative to dry cleaning. R Magazine named Dr. \nDeSimone's technology one of the 100 most innovative technologies that \nwill change our everyday lives. For his innovation, Dr. DeSimone \nreceived the Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award in 1997. The \nEPA as well as the National Science Foundation, NSF, has funded Dr. \nDeSimone's research.\n  Now that environmentally beneficial technologies like liquid carbon \ndioxide and wet cleaning are commercially available, it makes sense to \nprovide a modest incentive to encourage dry cleaners to utilize them. \nThe benefits to small business dry cleaners, consumers, employees, and \nthe environment would be enormous. This bill's approach provides \nincentives, not additional regulations, for dry cleaners. The goal of \nthe bill is to protect and enhance the dry cleaning industry, not \nreinvent or harm it.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation. \nIt is the right thing to do for 35,000 small businesses, millions of \ndry cleaning consumers, and for our environment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself and Mr. Hagel):\n  S. 1293. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nincentives for the voluntary reduction, avoidance, and sequestration of \ngreenhouse gas emissions and to advance global climate science and \ntechnology development and deployment; to the Committee on Finance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Hagel, Mr. \n        Domenici, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. Bond):\n  S. 1294. A bill to establish a new national policy designed to manage \nthe risk of potential climate change, ensure long-term energy security, \nand to strengthen provisions in the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the \nFederal Nonnuclear Energy Research and Development Act of 1974 with \nrespect to potential climate change; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, let me first thank my colleagues, \nSenators Murkowski, Hagel, and Domenici, for their work on this very \nimportant legislation. I enjoyed working with them and their staffs on \nthis analytically complex issue. The results of our patience and hard \nwork are two companion pieces of legislation that will provide the \nunderpinning for a path forward on the climate change issue that will \nmeet the nation's and global needs for economic progress, while \nensuring our nation's energy and national security. In addition, it \nwill provide a sound basis for productive engagement with our friends \nand allies that share the same needs.\n  The first bill is the Climate Change Tax Amendments of 2001 which is \nessentially the same as S. 1777 that I introduced in the 106th \nCongress. This bill is an important element of the approach we should \ntake as a nation because current U.S. tax policy treats capital \nformation--including investments that can increase energy efficiency \nand reduce emissions--harshly compared with other industrialized \ncountries and our own recent past. Slower capital cost recovery means \nthat facilities deploying new advanced technology will not be put in \nplace as quickly, if at all.\n  Based on our current understanding of the science available on \nclimate change, I remain convinced that it is still premature for our \ngovernment to mandate stringent controls on carbon dioxide emissions \nand pick winners and losers in technology. This bill assures that there \nwill be a true partnership between tax policy and technology innovation \nin both research and deployment.\n  Although the science of climate change has progressed rather \ndramatically over the last five years, many trenchant questions remain \nabout what is happening to our climate system. However, the climate \nchange issue is at a crossroads. We can and must make decisions on how \nto proceed. The bills introduced today ensure a more focused and \ncoordinated effort to understand the outstanding and formidable \nscientific issues associated with climate change. While pursuing \nanswers to those questions, the bills also create a comprehensive and \nsystematic program to achieve the goals of reducing, avoiding, or \nsequesting greenhouse gas emissions. That program is manifest in both \nthe technological research and development effort authorized in the \nRisk Management bill and a comprehensive and systematic approach that \naggressively encourages voluntary actions to reduce, avoid, or \nsequester greenhouse gas emissions.\n  To bolster and strengthen the voluntary action program we have \nproposed tax incentives in the companion Tax Amendment bill that should \nalso stimulate the creative ways to reduce, avoid, or sequester \ngreenhouse gas emissions without creating drag on future economic \ngrowth. Although some special interest groups have criticized voluntary \nprograms as ineffective, my colleagues and I do not believe that past \nefforts were as clearly designed and planned or aggressively promoted \nas we have proposed in this legislation.\n  The companion bill is the Climate Change Risk Management Act of 2001. \nThis bill has as its roots in S. 1776 and S. 882, two bills that were \nintroduced in the 106th Congress with the expressed intent to forge \nconsensus on this issue. The principal objectives of the current \nlegislation are to encourage the research, development, and deployment \nof the technologies that can meet our needs and the needs of developing \nnations. A key focus are the technologies that can help us reduce, \navoid or sequester emissions of greenhouse gases.\n\n[[Page S8584]]\n\nIn addition the bill also encourages deployment of technologies that \ncan sequester greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This approach is \nessential to assure that we can fully use all of our domestic resources \nto their fullest. This must include coal and nuclear power.\n  An essential element in this legislation is the active engagement of \ndeveloping countries. Our policy must recognize the legitimate needs of \nour bilateral trading partners to use their resources and meet the \nneeds of their people. For too long the climate policy debate has been \nfixated on assigning blame and inflicting pain. This is harmful and \ncounterproductive. Our best technology must be made available and our \nresearch activities must focus on developing country needs as well as \nour own.\n  Moreover, we believe that the President has chosen the right path \nforward on this issue and we are committed to working with his Cabinet \nlevel task force on finding effective, technologically based approaches \nto attacking this important environmental and economic issue.\n  Although these bills are comprehensive, there are still more steps \nCongress can and will take in the immediate future to ensure we are \ndoing all that is reasonably and responsibly possible. For example, a \nkey piece of this puzzle is better government-wide coordination of \nscientific efforts to solve the remaining mysteries of climate change. \nA strong and consistent recommendation from the National Academy of \nSciences has been for us to solve this problem.\n  Because that issue includes Federal agency ``turf battles,'' \nlegislative committee jurisdictional constraints prevented us from \nfully addressing that issue in these bills. However, we will have this, \nand other key pieces (such as traffic congestion, agricultural, forest \nmanagement, and ocean sequestration) not currently getting sufficient \nattention, ready to complete a comprehensive package on climate change \nbefore the end of the 107th Congress.\n  But for now, the bills we introduce today are an important and \naggressive attempt to shape and implement policy on climate change. It \nis a responsible effort to work with our friends and allies to:\n  1. Develop better policy mechanisms for assessing the effects of \ngreenhouse gas emissions; 2. accelerate development and deployment of \nclimate response technology; 3. facilities international deployment of \nU.S. technology to mitigate climate change to the developing world; 4. \nadvance climate science to reduce uncertainties in key areas; and 5. \nimprove public access to government information on climate science.\n  All involved in this debate must stop politicizing science and help \nus get to the point where the issue is confidently understood. The \nAmerican people have a right to know the whole truth on this issue. The \nsuccess of any future government response to climate change depends on \nthat more than anything else.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill texts along with section-by-\nsection analyses be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                                S. 1293\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

For purposes of \n     this subsection, an expenditure shall be considered voluntary \n     and non recoupable if the expenditure is not recoupable--\n       (A) from revenues generated from the investment, determined \n     under generally accepted accounting standards (or under the \n     applicable rate-of-return regulation, in the case of a \n     taxpayer subject to such regulation), or\n       (B) from any tax or other financial incentive program \n     established under Federal, State, or local law.\n       (2) Report.--Within 6 months of the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of \n     Energy shall jointly report to Congress on the results of the \n     study described in paragraph (1), along with any \n     recommendations for legislative action.\n       (g) Scope and Impact.--\n       (1) Policy.--In order to achieve the broadest response for \n     reduction, avoidance, or sequestration of greenhouse gas \n     emissions and to ensure that the incentives established by or \n     pursuant to this Act do not advantage one segment of an \n     industry to the disadvantage of another, it is the sense of \n     Congress that such incentives should be available for \n     individuals, organizations, and entities, including both for-\n     profit and non-profit institutions.\n       (2) Level playing field study and report.--\n       (A) In general.--The Secretary of the Treasury and the \n     Secretary of Energy shall jointly study possible additional \n     measures that would provide non-profit entities (such as \n     municipal utilities and energy cooperatives) with economic \n     incentives for greenhouse gas emissions facilities comparable \n     to those incentives provided to taxpayers under the \n     amendments made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by this \n     Act.\n       (B) Report.--Within 6 months after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of \n     Energy shall jointly report to Congress on the results of the \n     study described in subparagraph (A), along with any \n     recommendations for legislative action.\n                                  ____\n\n\n The Climate Change Tax Amendments of 2001--Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \n     provide incentives for the voluntary reduction avoidance, and \n     sequestration of greenhouse gas emissions and to advance \n     global climate science and technology development.\n       Section 1 designates the short title as the ``Climate \n     Change Tax Amendments.''\n       Section 2 extends on a permanent basis the tax credit for \n     research and development in the case of R & D involving \n     climate change.\n       In order for a research expense to qualify for the credit, \n     it must; have as one of its purposes the reducing or \n     sequestering of greenhouse gases; and have been reported to \n     DOE under Sec. 1605(b) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992.\n       This tax credit applies with respect to amounts incurred \n     after the Act becomes law, and only if the Climate Change \n     Risk Management Act of 2001 also becomes law.\n       Section 3 provides for investment tax credits for \n     greenhouse-gas-emission reduction facilities.\n     Greenhouse Gas Emissions Facility Credit\n       The amount of the credit would be calculated based upon the \n     amount of greenhouse gas emission reductions reported and \n     certified under section 1605(b) of the Energy Policy Act. The \n     credit would be equal to one-half of the applicable \n     percentage of the qualified investment in a ``reduced \n     greenhouse gas emissions facility.''\n       For example, if a taxpayer replaces a coal-fired generator \n     with a more efficient one that reduced greenhouse gas \n     emissions by 18 percent, compared to the retired unit, the \n     taxpayer would be entitled to a tax credit of 9 percent of \n     qualified investment in that ``reduced greenhouse gas \n     emissions facility''. Such facility is defined as a facility \n     of the taxpayer: the construction, reconstruction; or \n     erection of which is completed by the taxpayer; or the \n     facility may be acquired by the taxpayer if the original use \n     of the facility commences with the taxpayer; which replaces \n     an existing facility of the taxpayer; which reduces \n     greenhouse gas emissions (on a per unit of output basis) as \n     compared to the facility it replaces; which uses the same \n     type of fuel as the facility it replaces; the depreciation \n     (or amortization in lieu of depreciation) of which is \n     allowable; which meets performance and quality standards (if \n     any) jointly prescribed by the Secretaries of Treasury and \n     Energy; and are consistent with regulations prescribed \n     under Sec. 1605 (b) of the Energy Policy Act (relating to \n     voluntary reporting of greenhouse gas emission \n     reductions).\n       Only that portion of the investment attributable to \n     providing production capacity not greater than the production \n     capacity of the facility being replaced qualifies for the \n     credit.\n       While unit efficiencies could be achieved if the credit \n     were allowed for replacing a unit with another that burned a \n     different fuel, such incentive for fuel shifting does not \n     directly stimulate efficiency technology development for each \n     fuel type. The objective is to improve efficiencies ``within \n     a fuel;'' not to encourage fuel shifting ``between fuels.''\n     Qualified Progress Expenditure Credit\n       With respect to qualified progress expenditures, the amount \n     of the qualified investment for the taxable year shall be \n     increased by the aggregate of each qualified progress \n     expenditure for the taxable year with respect to progress \n     expenditure property. Progress expenditure property is \n     defined as any property being constructed by or for the \n     taxpayer and which it is reasonable to believe will qualify \n     as a reduced greenhouse gas emission facility.\n     Election\n       A taxpayer may elect to take the tax credit in such a \n     manner (i.e. as an investment credit, or as qualified \n     progress expenditures) as the Secretary may be regulations \n     prescribe. The election will apply to the taxable year for \n     which it was made and to all subsequent taxable years. Such \n     an election, once made, may not be revoked except with the \n     consent of the Secretary.\n     Recapture Where Facility is Prematurely Disposed of\n       If the facility is disposed of before the end of the \n     facility's depreciation period (or ``useful life'' for tax \n     purposes) the taxpayer will be assessed an increase in tax \n     equal to the greenhouse gas emissions facility investment tax \n     credit allowed for all prior taxable years multiplied by a \n     fraction whose numerator is the number of years remaining to \n     fully depreciate the facility to be disposed of, and whose \n     denominator is the total number of years over which the \n     facility would otherwise have been subject to depreciation.\n       Similar rules apply in the case in which the taxpayer \n     elected credit for progress expenditures and the property \n     thereafter ceases to qualify for such credit.\n     Effective Date\n       Amendments made to the Internal Revenue Code apply to \n     property placed in service after the date of enactment of \n     this Act.\n\n[[Page S8586]]\n\n     Study of Additional Incentives for Voluntary Reduction of \n         Greenhouse Gas Emissions\n       The Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Transportation \n     are directed to study, and report upon to Congress along with \n     any recommendations for legislative action, possible \n     additional incentives for and removal of barriers to \n     voluntary non-recoupable expenditures on the reduction of \n     greenhouse gas emissions.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Climate Change Risk \n     Management Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) human activities, namely energy production and use, \n     contribute to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases \n     in the atmosphere, which may ultimately contribute to global \n     climate change beyond that resulting from natural \n     variability;\n       (2) although the science of global climate change has been \n     advanced in the past ten years, the timing and magnitude of \n     climate change-related impacts on the United States cannot \n     currently be predicted with any reasonable certainty;\n       (3) furthermore, a recent National Research Council review \n     of climate change science suggests that without an \n     understanding of the sources and degree of uncertainty \n     regarding climate change and its impacts, decision-makers \n     could fail to define the best ways to manage the risk of \n     climate change;\n       (4) despite this uncertainty, the potential impacts from \n     human-induced climate change pose a substantial risk that \n     should be managed in a responsible manner;\n       (5) given that the bulk of greenhouse gas emissions from \n     human activities result from energy production and use, \n     national and international energy policy decisions made now \n     and in the longer-term future will influence the extent and \n     timing of any climate change and resultant impacts from \n     climate change later this century;\n       (6) the characteristics of greenhouse gases and the \n     physical nature of the climate system require that \n     stabilization of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations at \n     any future level must be a long-term effort undertaken on a \n     global basis;\n       (7) the characteristics of existing energy-related \n     infrastructure and capital suggest that effective greenhouse \n     gas management efforts will depend on the development of \n     long-term, cost-effective technologies and practices that can \n     be demonstrated and deployed commercially in the United \n     States and around the world;\n       (8) environmental progress, energy security, economic \n     prosperity, and satisfaction of basic human needs are \n     interrelated, particularly in developing countries;\n       (9) developing countries will constitute the major source \n     of greenhouse gas emissions in the 21st century and the minor \n     source of increases in such emissions;\n       (10) any program to address the risks of climate change \n     that does not fully include developing nations as integral \n     participants will be ineffective; and\n       (11) a new long-term, technology-based, cost-effective, \n     flexible, and global strategy to ensure long-term energy \n     security and manage the risk of climate change is needed, and \n     should be promoted by the United States in its domestic and \n     international activities in this regard.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues Senators \nFrank Murkowski and Larry Craig today I introducing legislation that \ntakes a comprehensive approach to domestic efforts on climate change.\n  This legislation provides a forward-looking, balanced approach to \naddress the challenge of climate change. There's a lot we can do, and \nthis legislation lays out a comprehensive approach that will reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions without damaging the U.S. economy. It provides \nan incentive-based, market oriented framework that will produce \nresults. It focuses on developing advanced technologies to reduce, \nsequester or avoid greenhouse gas emissions. These technologies are the \nlong term answer to this challenge. And it focuses our scientific \nresearch in this area.\n  Specifically, the Climate Change Risk Management Act of 2001 provides \nfor: a national climate change strategy; new funding to advance the \nresearch, development and deployment of new technologies to reduce, \navoid or sequester greenhouse gas emissions $2 billion over 10 years; \nthe creation of a national registry of voluntary actions that have been \ntaken to reduce, avoid or sequester greenhouse gas emissions; a pilot \nprogram to assist in the exports of advanced technology to developing \ncountries, $1 billion over 10 years for a loan program; better \ncoordination of federal scientific research; an office in the \nDepartment of Energy to coordinate the R efforts for new \ntechnologies, that is accountable to the Secretary, the President and \nthe Congress.\n  This legislation is very consistent with the approach presented by \nPresident Bush and builds on the efforts that Senators Murkowski, \nCraig, and I--along with Senator Byrd and others--have pursued for some \ntime to advance our efforts in the area of climate change. I am pleased \nthat Senators Pete Domenici, Pat Roberts, and Christopher Bond are also \noriginal cosponsors of this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself and Mr. Thomas):\n  S. 1295. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to revise the \nrequirements for procurement of products of Federal Prison Industries \nto meet needs for Federal agencies, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nCraig Thomas in introducing the Federal Prison Industries Competition \nin Contracting Act. Our bill is based on a straightforward premise: it \nis unfair for Federal Prison Industries to deny citizens in the private \nsector an opportunity to compete for sales to their own government.\n  I repeat: the bill that we are introducing today, if enacted, would \ndo nothing more than permit private sector companies to compete for \nFederal contracts that are paid for with their tax dollars. It may seem \nincredible that they are denied this opportunity today, but that is the \nlaw, because if Federal Prison Industries says that it wants a \ncontract, it gets that contract, regardless whether a company in the \nprivate sector may offer to provide the product better, cheaper, and \nfaster.\n  This bill would not limit the ability of Federal Prison Industries to \nsell its products to Federal agencies. It would simply say that these \nsales should be made on a competitive, rather than a sole-source basis.\n  FPI also has a significant advantage in any competition with the \nprivate sector, since FPI pays inmates less than two dollars an hour, \nfar below the minimum wage and a small fraction of the wage paid to \nmost private sector workers in competing industries. And of course, the \ntaxpayers provide a direct subsidy to Federal Prison Industries \nproducts by picking up the cost of feeding, clothing, and housing the \ninmates who provide the labor. Given those advantages, there is no \nreason why we should still require Federal agencies to purchase \nproducts from FPI even when they are more expensive and of a lower \nquality than competing commercial items. I can think of no reason why \nprivate industry should be prohibited from competing for these Federal \nagency contracts.\n  We have made several changes to this bill since it was introduced in \nthe 106th Congress. The three new sections are intended to address new \nabuses by FPI that have arisen in the last few years: section 3 of the \nbill would prohibit FPI from granting prison workers access to \nclassified information or information that is protected under the \nPrivacy Act; section 4 of the bill would clarify that private sector \nbusinesses and their employees must be permitted to compete for federal \nsubcontracts as well as prime contracts; and section 5 of the bill \nwould clarify that the general prohibition on sales of prison-made \ngoods into private commerce is also intended to apply to sales of \nservices.\n  These changes should strengthen the bill and reinforce its underlying \nintent.\n  Federal Prison Industries has repeatedly claimed that it provides a \nquality product at a price that is competitive with current market \nprices. Indeed, the Federal Prison Industries statute requires them to \ndo so. That statute states that FPI may provide to Federal agencies \nproducts that ``meet their requirements'' at price that do not ``exceed \ncurrent market prices''.\n  Yet, FPI remains unwilling to compete with private sector businesses \nand their employees, or even to permit Federal agencies to compare \ntheir products and prices with those available in the private sector. \nIndeed, FPI has tried to prohibit Federal agencies from conducting \nmarket research, as they would ordinarily do, to determine whether the \nprice and quality or FPI products is comparable to what is available in \nthe commercial marketplace. Instead, Federal agencies are directed to \ncontact FPI, which acts as the sole arbiter of whether the product \nmeets the agency's requirements.\n\n  The reason for FPI's position is obvious: it is much easier to gain \nmarket share by fiat than it is to compete for business. Under FPI's \ncurrent interpretation of the law, it need not offer the best product \nat the best price; it is sufficient for it to offer an adequate product \nat an adequate price, and insist upon its right to make the sale. \nIndeed, FPI currently advertises that it offers Federal agencies ``ease \nin purchasing'' through ``a procurement with no bidding necessary.''\n  The result of the FPI's status as a mandatory source is not unlike \nthe result of other sole-source contracting: the taxpayers frequently \npay too much and receive an inferior product for their money. When FPI \nsets its prices, it does not even attempt to match the best price \navailable in the commercial sector; instead, it claims to have charged \na ``market price'' whenever it can show that at least some vendors in \nthe private sector charges as high a price. As GAO reported in August \n1998, ``The only limit the law imposes on FPI's price is that it may \nnot exceed the upper end of the current market price range.''\n  The result is frustrating to private sector businesses and their \nemployees who are denied an opportunity to complete for Federal \nbusiness, as well as to the Federal agencies who are forced to buy FPI \nproducts. One letter that I received from a frustrated vendor stated \nwith regard to UNICOR--the trade name used by Federal Prison \nIndustries:\n\n\n[[Page S8592]]\n\n\n       If the Air Force would purchase a completed unit as \n     described in UNICOR's solicitation directly from a . . . \n     manufacturer we estimate the cost will be approximately \n     $6,500. UNICOR is going to purchase a kit for $9,259 and add \n     their assembly and administrative costs to the unit. If \n     UNICOR only adds $1,500 to the total cost of the unit, it \n     will cost the Air Force $10,759. This is 66 percent higher \n     than the current market price. If the Air Force purchases \n     8,000 units over the next five years it will cost the \n     taxpayers an additional $34,072,000 over what it would cost \n     if they dealt directly with a manufacturer.\n\n  A letter from a second frustrated vendor stated, also with regard to \nUNICOR:\n\n       UNICOR bid on this item and simply because UNICOR did bid, \n     I was told that the award had to be given to UNICOR. UNICOR \n     won the bid at $45 per unit. My company bid $22 per unit. The \n     way I see it, the government just overspend my tax dollars to \n     the tune of $1,978. The total amount of my bid was less than \n     that. Do you seriously believe that this type or procurement \n     is cost-effective?\n       I lost business, and my tax dollars were misused because of \n     unfair procurement practices mandated by federal regulations. \n     This is a prime example, and I am certain not the only one, \n     of how the procurement system is being misused and small \n     businesses in this country are being excluded from \n     competition, with the full support of federal regulations and \n     the seeming approval of Congress. It is far past the time to \n     curtail this `company' known as Federal Prison Industries and \n     require them to be competitive for the benefit of all \n     taxpayers.\n\n  I am a strong supporter of the idea of putting federal inmates to \nwork. I understand that a strong prison work program not only reduces \ninmate idleness and prison disruption, but can also help build a work \nethic, provide job skills, and enable prisoners to return to product \nsociety upon their release.\n  However, I believe that a prison work program must be conducted in a \nmanner that is sensitive to the need not to unfairly eliminate the jobs \nof hard-working citizens who have not committed crimes. FPI will be \nable to achieve this result only if it diversifies its product lines \nand avoids the temptation to build its workforce by continuing to \ndisplace private sector jobs in its traditional lines of work. For this \nreason, I have been working since 1990 to try to help Federal Prison \nIndustries to identify new markets that it can expand into without \ndisplacing private sector jobs, with a particular emphasis on markets \nfor products that are currently imported.\n  Avoiding competition is the easy way out, but it isn't the right way \nfor FPI, it isn't the right way for the private sector workers whose \njobs FPI is taking, and it isn't the right way for the taxpayer, who \nwill continue to pay more and get less as a result of the mandatory \npreference for FPI goods. We need to have jobs for prisoners, but can \nno longer afford to allow FPI to designate whose jobs it will take, and \nwhen it will take them. Competition will be better for FPI, better for \nthe taxpayer, and better for working men and women around the country.\n  The fight to allow private industry to compete against Federal Prison \nIndustries is far from over, but I am optimistic that it can be won in \nthis Congress.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, today I am pleased to join Senator Levin \nin introducing a bill that will further my efforts to limit government \ncompetition with the private sector. Senator Levin and I propose to \neliminate the mandatory contracting requirement that Federal agencies \nare subject to when it comes to products made by the Federal Prison \nIndustries, FPI. Under law, all Federal agencies are required to \npurchase products made by the FPI. Simply put, this bill will require \nthe FPI to compete with the private sector for Federal contracts.\n  Currently, the FPI employs approximately 22,000 Federal prisoners or \nroughly 20 percent of all Federal prisoners. These prisoners are \nresponsible for producing a diverse range of products for the FPI, \nranging from office furniture to clothing. The remaining 80 percent of \nFederal prisoners, who work, do so in and around Federal prisons.\n  While Senator Levin and I believe that it is important to keep \nprisoners working, we do not believe that this effort should unduly \nharm or conflict with law-abiding businesses. This bill seeks to \nminimize the unfair competition that private sector companies face with \nthe FPI.\n  The FPI's mandatory source requirement not only undercuts private \nbusiness throughout America, but its mandatory source preference \noftentimes costs American tax payers more money. I believe American \ntaxpayers would be alarmed to learn of the preferential treatment that \nthe FPI enjoys when it comes to Federal contracts.\n  As I said before, Senator Levin and I support the goal of keeping \nprisoners busy while serving their time in prison. However, if we allow \ncompetition in Federal contracts, the FPI will be required to focus its \nefforts in product areas that don't unfairly compete with the private \nsector. Clearly, competitive bidding is a reasonable process that will \nensure taxpayer's dollars are being spent justly.\n  Of particular note, our bill allows contracting officers, within each \nFederal agency, the ability to select the FPI for contracts if he/she \nbelieves that the FPI can meet that particular agency's requirements \nand the product is offered at a fair and reasonable price. Currently, \nthe FPI prohibits Federal agencies from conducting market research to \ndetermine whether the price and quality of its products is comparable \nto those available in the private sector. The above outlined provision \nin our bill seeks to place the control of government procurement in the \nhands of contracting officers, rather than in the hands of the FPI.\n  In addition to establishing a competitive procedure for the \nprocurement of products, we include a provision that allows the \nAttorney General to grant a waiver to this process if a particular \ncontract is deemed essential to the safety and effective administration \nof a particular prison.\n  I am confident that by allowing competition for government contracts \nour bill will save tax dollars. As Congress looks for additional cost \nsaving practices, the elimination of the FPI's mandatory source \npreference will bring about numerous improvements, not just in cost \nsavings, but also a streamlining of the FPI's products.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 1296. A bill to provide for the protection of the due process \nrights of United States citizens (including United States \nservicemembers) before foreign tribunals, including the International \nCriminal Court, for the prosecution of war criminals, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, the Nuremberg Trial of the leading Nazi \nwar criminals following World War II was a landmark in the struggle to \ndeter and punish crimes of war and genocide, setting the stage for the \nGeneva and Genocide Conventions. It was also largely an American \ninitiative. Justice Robert Jackson's team drove the process of drafting \nthe indictments, gathering the evidence and conducting this \nextraordinary case.\n  My father, Thomas J. Dodd, served as Executive Trial Counsel at \nNuremberg, it was among his proudest accomplishments. But it was also \npart of a common theme that ran through a lifetime of public service. \nHe believed that America had a special role to help make the rule of \nlaw relevant in every corner of the globe. I believe that he would have \nendorsed President Clinton's decision to sign the Rome Statute last \nDecember on behalf of the United States. President Clinton did so \nknowing full well that much work remains to be done before the United \nStates can become a party to the U.N. convention establishing an \nInternational Criminal Court, ICC.\n  The Bush administration is currently reviewing its options with \nrespect to the Rome Statute and with respect to the ongoing preparatory \nwork that is necessary to make the court operational once sixty parties \nhave ratified. The so called American Service-\nmembers' Protection Act of 2001 sponsored by Senators Helms and \nCongressman DeLay in the Senate and House, respectively, if enacted \ninto law, will severely limit the Bush administration's options for \ninteracting with our friends and allies about issues directly related \nto the ICC, as well as have a major impact on possible United States \nparticipation in the ICC at some date in the future. Among other \nthings, their legislation would prevent the U.S. from helping to \nprosecute war criminals before the ICC even on a case-by-case basis. \nElie Wiesel has written that this legislation would erase America's \nNuremberg legacy ``by\n\n[[Page S8593]]\n\nensuring that the U.S. will never again join the community of nations \nto hold accountable those who commit war crimes and genocide. A vote \nfor this legislation would signal U.S. acceptance of impunity for the \nworld's worst atrocities.''\n  That is why I am introducing ``The American Citizens Protection and \nWar Criminal Prosecution Act of 2001.'' The American Citizens \nProtection Act, today in the Senate to both protect America's Nuremberg \nlegacy while at the same time safeguarding the rights of American \ncitizens brought before foreign tribunals. My friend and House \ncolleague, William Delahunt of Massachusetts is also introducing a \ncompanion bill in the House today. Our bill calls for active U.S. \ndiplomatic efforts to ensure that the ICC functions properly, mandates \nthe assertion of U.S. jurisdiction over American citizens and bars the \nsurrender of U.S. citizens to the ICC once the United States has acted. \nUnlike the American Servicemembers' Protection Act, however, The \nAmerican Citizens Protection Act allows the United States to help \nprosecute war criminals and it does not effectively end U.S. \nparticipation in U.N. peacekeeping or authorize going to war to obtain \nthe release of certain persons detained by the ICC.\n  I believe that the bill that has been introduced today in the House \nand Senate strikes the right balance between protecting our citizens \nand our men and women in the armed forces who may be traveling or \ndeployed abroad, and preserving United States leadership and advocacy \nof universal adherence to principles of international justice and the \nrule of law. I hope that the Bush administration will review carefully \nprovisions of this bill, because I believe taken together they address \nthe administration's concerns about the Rome Statute without doing \ndamage to our national interest or future foreign policy objectives. I \nlook forward to working with Administration officials and with my \ncolleagues on this important issue in the coming weeks.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Reed):\n  S. 1297. A bill to require comprehensive health insurance coverage \nfor childhood immunization; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise today to kick off National \nImmunization Awareness Month by introducing legislation to expand \naccess to affordable childhood and adolescent immunizations. I am \npleased that my colleague, Senator Reed, joins me in this initiative.\n  Immunization against vaccine-preventable disease is perhaps the most \npowerful health care and public health achievement of the 20th Century. \nRemarkable advances in the science of vaccine development and \nwidespread immunization efforts have led to a substantial reduction in \nthe incidence of infectious disease. Today, vaccination coverage is at \nrecord high levels. Smallpox has been eradicated; polio has been \neliminated from the Western Hemisphere; and measles, pertussis and Hib \ninvasive disease have been reduced to record lows.\n  The bill I introduce today builds on these successes. ``The \nComprehensive Insurance Coverage of Childhood Immunization Act of \n2001,'' ensures that all health plans cover the recommended childhood \nand adolescent immunizations. This improvement is simple, it is cost \neffective, and it is long overdue.\n  More than 3.6 million children currently insured in the private \nsector are not covered for the recommended immunizations. Millions more \nhave partial insurance for some of the recommended vaccines, but not \nall. Even if private coverage is complete, cost-sharing may be a \nsignificant barrier for many families.\n  A number of reputable studies confirm these statistics. The Institute \nof Medicine found in its report of last year that ``While most private \nhealth plans provide some form of immunization coverage, this coverage \nvaries by type of plan, as well as by vaccine. Enrollment in a private \nplan does not guarantee that immunizations will be provided as a plan \nbenefit.'' Results from a 1999 William M. Mercer/Partnership for \nPrevention survey of employer sponsored health plans found that about \none of five employer-sponsored plans does not cover childhood \nimmunizations, and out of four does not cover adolescent immunizations. \nAnd researchers at the George Washington University recently collected \ndata on the immunization coverage policies of five health care \ncompanies, four national and one regional, that suggest significant \nvariation by type of plan, as well as by vaccine.\n  The States have enacted some requirements to address these gaps in \ncoverage, albeit limited. Only about 28 states have laws requiring that \ninsurers cover childhood immunizations to some degree. Coverage \nstandards vary considerably from state to state. And, as we know, \nemployers that self-insure are generally exempt from state insurance \nregulation under the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act. \nApproximately 50 million private-insured individuals are covered by \nself-insured plans.\n  These gaps are not insignificant. The private sector is a critical \npartner in vaccine delivery. Almost half, 45 percent, of all vaccine is \ndelivered in the private sector. Certainly most health plans do provide \nsome immunization coverage, but there is a just no reason why every \nchild who has private insurance should not have access to such a basic, \nessential benefit. This is not only a flaw in our health system, it is \nsimply illogical and irresponsible.\n  This is the 21st Century. We have long since learned how important \nimmunizations are to the health of children and adolescents and to \nentire communities. At the beginning of the 20th century, infectious \ndiseases were widely prevalent in the United States and exacted an \nenormous toll on the population. For example, in 1900, 21,064 smallpox \ncases were reported, and 894 patients died. In 1920, 469,924 measles \ncases were reported, and 7,575 patients died; 147,991 diphtheria cases \nwere reported, and 13,170 patients died. In 1922, 107,473 pertussis \ncases were reported, and 5,099 patients died. Today these numbers are \nunheard of, and overall U.S. vaccination coverage is at record high \nlevels.\n  But despite the dramatic declines in vaccine-preventable diseases, \nsuch diseases persist, particularly in developing countries but also in \nour own.\n  Just this past June, the Chicago Sun Times reported that a new study \nfound ``distressingly low'' vaccination rates in a South Side Chicago \nneighborhood of Englewood. Twenty-six percent of children under the age \nof three have not been vaccinated for measles in this community. In \n1999, the measles preschool vaccination rate for all of Chicago was 86 \npercent, down from 90 percent in 1996. In many pockets of the city, \nsuch as Englewood, rates are much lower than average. It was just a \nlittle over a decade ago that such low vaccination rates led to an \nepidemic of the highly contagious disease. In 1990 there were more than \n4,200 cases of measles and 15 deaths in the Chicago area.\n  It is also important to keep in mind that an estimated 11,000 \nchildren are born each day in the United States. Every year, \napproximately 170,000 of these babies are born into families with \nprivate health insurance that does not cover immunizations. Each one of \nthese children needs up to 20 doses of vaccine by age two to be \nprotected against childhood diseases.\n  We must remain vigilant. Insuring universal age-appropriate vaccine \ncoverage requires a strong and consistent partnership among State, \nlocal and Federal Governments, vaccine industry leaders, private and \npublic health insurers and policymakers. From the beginning, \nimmunization financing was explicitly structured to be a Federal/State/\nprivate-sector partnership. In 1955, under President Eisenhower, the \nFederal Government began Federal funding for immunization when he \nsigned the Poliomyelitis Vaccination Assistance Act. This support was \nexpanded in the 1960's under Kennedy when the Vaccination Assistance \nAct created the National Immunization Program at CDC. Over the years, \nFederal support for vaccine purchase and assistance to states for \nimmunization activities has grown.\n  Today, Federal and State grants, the State Children's Health \nInsurance Program, the Vaccines for Children's Program and private-\nsector health plans and providers together provide a comprehensive \napproach to get our Nation's children immunized. This system\n\n[[Page S8594]]\n\nis the result of a concerted effort to fill in the gaps in coverage. \nBut the system must adapt to new science and new social conditions. \nShifting finance patterns require all partners to adapt to minimize \nsystem instability. For example, last year, after the Institute of \nMedicine reported that Federal funding has waned and that the public \nsystem was becoming increasingly unstable, Congress increased the \nappropriation for immunization infrastructure and vaccine purchase \ngrants.\n  The public system cannot do it alone. Maintaining high immunization \nrates is a public health responsibility that must be shared by both the \npublic and private sector. Most Americans rely on a system of insurance \nfor their care. Most children today receive their immunization services \nfrom private-sector providers.\n\n  The National Vaccine Advisory Committee, the Institute of Medicine \nand the American Academy of Pediatrics have recommended that all health \nplans should offer first-dollar coverage for recommended childhood \nvaccines. The provisions of this bill have been supported by a broad \ncoalition of groups for many years, including Every Child by Two, the \nChildren's Defense Fund, the American Public Health Association and \nPartnership for Prevention. Yet still today, many health plans and \ninsurers do not cover all immunizations fully as a covered benefit.\n  The Comprehensive Insurance Coverage of Childhood Immunization Act \nimplements these long-standing recommendations by requiring all health \nplans--including groups, individual, and ERISA--cover all vaccines for \nchildren and adolescents that are recommended by the Advisory Committee \non Immunization Practices. The Advisory Committee on Immunization \nPractices' recommendations are the standard of care. It is the \nCommittee's Congressionally-mandated job to provide advice and guidance \nto the Secretary, the Assistant Secretary for Health, and the Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, on the most effective means to \nprevent vaccine-preventable diseases.\n  The Act also directs that health plans cover immunizations without a \ncopayment or deductible. Out-of-pocket costs have been identified as a \nbarrier to proper immunization. In 2001, the cost of fully immunizing \none child is approximately $627, with almost half of that cost \nresulting from the newly-recommended pneumococcal conjugate vaccine \nseries. New vaccines and new combination vaccines currently under \ndevelopment will significantly increase this cost in the future. The \nU.S. Task Force on Community Preventive Services found that reducing \nout-of-pocket costs can result in increases in vaccination coverage by \nimproving availability of vaccines and increasing demand for \nvaccinations. More than a dozen studies have documented the \neffectiveness of reducing out-of-pocket costs and the resulting \nimprovement in vaccination outcomes.\n  Another obvious barrier to appropriate immunization is the lack of \nprivate coverage itself. Studies have shown that providers are more \nlikely to refer children with less private insurance coverage to other \nsites for vaccination, and referral practices are known to have an \nadverse effect on both the timing and the rate of immunization. Service \nutilization studies within public health clinics indicate that some \nlow-income parents use public clinics because of the reduced cost, even \nthough they might prefer to receive immunizations from regular private \nproviders. This certainly places an unfair burden on parents who have \nto take their children to different sites for care. It makes it even \nharder for families to keep track of their children's complicated \nimmunization schedule. And it may result in missed opportunities to \nimmunize children who are lacking needed shots. Studies of the \nimplementation of the Vaccines for Children Program have indicated that \nreferrals to health departments decrease when free vaccines are \nprovided to private providers, suggesting that both parents and \nproviders take advantage of the free vaccines. The Comprehensive \nInsurance Coverage of Childhood Immunization Act will help parents \navoid unnecessary referrals due to lack of coverage or financial \nbarriers and retain their child's medical home.\n  This practice of referral to public clinics also shifts the cost of \nvaccinating children from the private sector to taxpayers. Through the \nFederal Vaccines for Children Program, children with health insurance \nthat does not cover immunization may receive vaccines at a Federally \nQualified Health Center or a Rural Health Clinic. Vaccines at these \nclinics are also supported by federal grants to states for vaccine \npurchase through the Federal discretionary National Immunization \nprogram. States also fund the purchase and distribution of vaccines. \nWhen the private sector fails--the public sector picks up the tab.\n\n  For this reason, the Congressional Budget Office found that this \nlegislation will increase the budget surplus by $70 million dollars \nover five years and $150 million dollars over 10 years. This savings is \nsomewhat offset by the reduction in Federal tax receipts, but still \nsaves $20 million over five years and costs less than $35 million over \n10 years. There is no doubt that the States would see similar savings. \nMany States contribute up to 30 percent of the public sector vaccine \npurchase bill. This means that State funds, like Federal funds, are \npicking up the tab for kids with private insurance. And the CBO found \nthat the new requirement would have a negligible effect on health \ninsurance premiums, increasing premium costs, if at all, by no more \nthan 0.1 percent.\n  Private providers should find comprehensive childhood vaccination \ncost-effective as well. Immunizations are one of the rare health \nservices that have been proven to save money. The Measles-Mumps \nRubella, MMR, vaccine saves $10.30 in direct medical costs for every $1 \ndollar invested. The diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis DTP \nvaccine saves $8.50 for every $1 dollar spent. The Haemophilus \ninfluenzae type b (Hib) vaccine saves $1.40 per dollar. The Inactivated \nPolio Vaccine, IPV, saves $3.03 for every $1 dollar investment. These \nfigure are all direct medical savings.\n  It is rare that we have policy decisions that are this easy to make. \nThe Comprehensive Insurance Coverage of Childhood Immunization Act will \nhelp millions of working families afford the immunization they need to \nprotect their children. It represents a shared responsibility that we \nall have to our communities. Like safe food and clean water, high \nimmunization rates safeguard all of us. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation and to act promptly to pass it on behalf of American \nfamilies.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Biden \n        and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 1298. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide individuals with disabilities and older Americans with equal \naccess to community-based attendant services and supports, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, just a few days ago, the Nation \ncelebrated the 11th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, \nADA. When we passed the ADA, we told Americans with disabilities that \nthe door to equal opportunity was finally open.\n  And the ADA has opened doors of opportunity, plenty of them. \nAmericans with disabilities now expect to be treated as full citizens, \nwith all the rights and responsibilities that entails. And they are \nparticipating in American life like never before in our Nation's \nhistory.\n  Indeed, eleven years after the passing of the ADA we have a lot to \ncelebrate.\n  But we also have a lot of work to do. We need to make sure our \nFederal policies further the principle of independence for all that we \nagreed on eleven ago. For example, a few years ago Congress recognized \nthat in order for people with disabilities to join the workforce, we \nwould need to remove the disincentives to work embedded in our Medicaid \nand Social Security statutes. After passage of the Ticket to Work and \nWork Incentives bill, people with disabilities should no longer have to \nchoose between going to work and receiving necessary health care \nservices.\n  Today, Senator Specter and I introduce a bill that reflects another \npolicy I am sure we can all agree on. In order to go work or live in \ntheir own homes, Americans with disabilities and older Americans need \naccess to community-based services and supports. Unfortunately, under \ncurrent Federal Medicaid\n\n[[Page S8595]]\n\npolicy, the deck is stacked against community living. The purpose of \nour bill is to level the playing field and give eligible individuals \nequal access to community-based services and supports.\n  The Medicaid Community-Based Attendant Services and Supports Act does \nthree things. First, the bill amends Title XIX of the Social Security \nAct to provide a new Medicaid plan benefit that would give individuals \nwho are eligible for nursing home and ICF-MR services equal access to \ncommunity-based attendant services and supports.\n  Second, for a limited time, States would have the opportunity to \nreceive an enhanced match rate for community attendant services and \nsupports and for certain administrative activities to help them reform \ntheir long term care systems.\n  Third, the bill provides State with financial assistance to support \n``real choice systems change initiatives'' that include specific action \nsteps for the provision of community-based long term community services \nand supports.\n  Finally, the bill establishes a demonstration project to evaluate \nservice coordination and cost sharing approaches with respect to the \nprovision of services and supports to daily eligible individuals with \ndisabilities under the age of 65.\n  States are already out ahead of us here in Washington on this issue. \nSpending under the Medicaid home and community based waiver program has \ngrown tenfold in the past ten years. Every State offers certain \nservices under home and community based waivers. Almost 30 States are \nnow providing the personal care optional benefit through their Medicaid \nprograms. More than 2\\1/2\\ times more people are served in home and \ncommunity-based settings than in institutional settings.\n  The States have realized that community based care is both popular \nand cost effective, and community-based attendant services and supports \nare a key component of a successful program.\n  However, despite this marked progress, home and community based \nservices are unevenly distributed within and across States and only \nreach a small percentage of eligible individuals.\n  The numbers speak volumes. Only about 27 percent of long term care \nfunds expended under Medicaid, and only about 9 percent of all funds \nexpended under the program, pay for services and supports in home and \ncommunity-based settings. That means that right low a large majority of \nMedicaid long term care funding is not being used to further \nindependence. In fiscal year 2000, only 3 States spent 50 percent or \nmore of their long term care funds under the Medicaid program on home \nand community-based care. And that means that individuals do not have \nequal access to community based care.\n\n  Of course, numbers only tell a part of the story. This bill is about \nreal people in real communities. Take the example of a friend of mine \nin Iowa. Dan Piper works at a hardware store. He has his own apartment \nand just bought a VCR. He also has Down's syndrome and diabetes. For \nyears Dan has received services through a community waiver program. \nBut, last year, his community-based supports were threatened because he \nwasn't sure he'd be able to find a provider to deliver the optional \nwaiver service. The result? He almost had to sacrifice his independence \njust to get services. Today, Dan works and contributes to the economy \nas both a wage earner and a consumer. But, tomorrow, he could be forced \ninto a nursing home, far from his roommate, his job and his family. \nThat's why our Federal policy must foster comprehensive and consistent \naccess to community-based services and supports in the most integrated \nsetting appropriate.\n  Federal Medicaid policy should reflect the consensus that Americans \nwith disabilities should have the equal opportunity to contribute to \nour communities and participate in our society as full citizens. That \nmeans people should have access to certain types of services in the \ncommunity so that they don't have to sacrifice their full participation \nin society simply because they need a catheter or help getting out of \nthe house in the morning or assistance with medication, or some other \nbasic service.\n  So, where do we begin? To start, States need time and money to reform \ntheir long term care systems. Last year, Senator Specter and I worked \nhard to fund the systems change grants included in Title II of MiCASSA \nthrough the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. We included $70 million in \ngrant money to help States reform their long term care programs through \nsystems change initiatives and nursing home transition.\n  I am very pleased that Secretary Thompson has supported the \ndevelopment and implementation of these grants and included them as \npart of the President's New Freedom Initiative for people with \ndisabilities. As I understand it, all but two of the eligible States \nand territories have submitted application to HCFA. This is a great \nstart. And it shows the need for a Federal commitment to this issue. \nSenator Specter and I will work with the Administration and others to \nensure that another round of these grants will be available in FY 2002.\n  Over the past several months, we have also spent some time revising \nthe bill we introduced last Congress. The new version of MiCASSA allows \nStates to phase in the new Medicaid plan benefit over a period of 5 \nyears and provides enhanced math dollars to encourage States to start \ntheir reforms as soon as possible. As anyone in the private business \nworld well knows, in order to deliver a better service in a more \nefficient manner there has to be a strong initial investment. Our bill \ndoes just that. We also include a new program to help States pay for \npeople with severe disabilities who are more expensive to serve in the \ncommunity than the average eligible individual. And, we require a \ndemonstration project to look at cost-sharing between dually Medicaid \nand Medicare recipients.\n  The rest of the bill looks a lot like last year. Community-based \nservices and supports help people do tasks that they would do \nthemselves, if they did not have a disability. Our bill would allow any \nperson eligible for nursing home services to use the money for \ncommunity attendant services and supports. Those services and supports \ninclude help with things like eating, bathing, grooming, toileting, and \ntransferring in and out of a wheelchair.\n  Community-based services and supports are the lowest-cost and most \nconsumer friendly services in the long-term care spectrum. They can be \nprovided by a variety of people, including friends and neighbors of the \nrecipient. In many instances, with supervision, the consumer can direct \nhis or her own care and manage his or her own attendants. This cuts \ndown on expensive administrative overhead and the current practice of \nrelying on medical personnel such as nurses to coordinate a person's \ncare. States can save money and redirect medically-oriented care to \nthose who need it most.\n  Not only is home and community-based care what people want, it can \nalso be far less expensive. There is a wide variation in the cost of \nsupporting people with disabilities in the community because \nindividuals have different levels of need. But, for the average person, \nthe annual cost of home and community based services is less than one-\nhalf the average cost of institutional care.\n  And, I would be remiss not to mention the importance of quality \nservices and supports. Wherever a person receives Medicaid services and \nsupports, health and safety should be guaranteed. We should build a \nsystem that has strong quality controls. The bill includes the same \nquality protections as last year, but also emphasizes the importance of \ndeveloping a strong and able workforce in the grants section.\n  As I said, States have made a great deal of progress in this area. \nBut there is much more to do. The enthusiastic response to the systems \nchange grants shows just how much States need help to reform their long \nterm care systems to implement the principles of independence, \ncommunity living, and economic opportunity. The Supreme Court found \nthat, to the extent Medicaid dollars are used to pay for a person's \nlong term care, that person has a right to receive those services in \nthe most integrated setting appropriate. We in Congress have a \nresponsibility to help States meet their obligations under Olmstead. \nIt's up to the Federal Government to provide national leadership and \nadequate resources.\n\n[[Page S8596]]\n\n  Community-based attendant services and supports allow people with \ndisabilities to lead independent lives, have jobs, and participate in \nthe community. Some will become taxpayers, some will do volunteer work, \nsome will get an education, some will participate in recreational and \nother community activities. All will experience a better quality of \nlife, and a better chance to take part in the American dream.\n  I urge my colleagues and their staff to study our proposal over the \nbreak. I hope there will be hearings and action on this bill in the \nnext year.\n  This bill will open the door to full participation by people with \ndisabilities in our workplaces, our economy, and our American Dream, \nand I urge all my colleagues to support us on this issue. I thank the \ncosponsors of this bill. Senator Kennedy and Senator Specter have been \nleaders on disability issues for a long time. And I also thank Senator \nClinton and Senator Biden for joining me on this very important issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Reid, Mrs. Boxer, \n        Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Bingaman, and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 1299. A bill to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to establish a \nprogram to provide assistance to small communities for use in carrying \nout projects and activities necessary to achieve or maintain compliance \nwith drinking water standards; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I stand before you today to introduce \na piece of legislation that will help move many States forward toward \ncompliance with the arsenic drinking water standards the EPA \nAdministrator intends to finalize in February. It has been said that \n``a government must not waiver once it has chosen its course. It must \nnot look to the left or to the right, but instead must go forward.'' \nThis is the situation we find ourselves in today, our government has \nchosen a course and now we have no choice but to move forward.\n  My bill, the Community Drinking Water Assistance Act, authorizes $1.9 \nbillion dollars to be made directly available to local communities and \nTribes through the EPA. EPA would award grants to communities and \nTribes needing assistance for projects, activities, technical \nassistance, or for training and certifying system operators. The \ncriteria for awarding grants would be directly based on financial need \nand per capita costs of complying with the drinking water standards.\n  A new arsenic standard was promulgated in the waning hours of the \nClinton Administration. While I do not fault the Bush administration \nfor what they inherited, I must admit that I was disappointed when \nAdministrator Whitman set a maximum standard without further scientific \nbasis. It seemed illogical for Ms. Whitman to announce that the \nNational Academy of Sciences would further review the health effects \nassociated with arsenic, while simultaneously placing herself in a box \nthat would set the maximum standard at 20 parts per billion. It would \nhave been more logical to have waited for the studies to be completed \nbefore announcing what the standard would or would not be.\n  The course has been set and I would just like to take a moment to \nhighlight what this course will mean for New Mexicans. First and \nforemost, Arsenic is naturally occurring in New Mexico. In fact, New \nMexico has some of the highest levels of arsenic in the Nation, yet has \na lower than average incidence of the diseases associated with arsenic. \nNonetheless, for all systems in New Mexico to be in compliance with a \nstandard of 20 parts per billion, we are looking at a minimum price tag \nof $127 million. What this means to small community water users is more \nstaggering. The average cost to water users, in small systems serving \nless than 1,000 people, is $57.46, and this is for a standard of 20 \nparts per billion! The numbers are even more staggering for a 10 part \nper billion standard.\n  The New Mexico Environment Department estimates that if the standard \nis set at 10 parts per billion, approximately 25 percent of New \nMexico's water systems will be affected. The price tag for compliance \ncould fall between $400 million and $500 million in initial capital \nexpenditures. Annual operating costs will easily fall anywhere between \n$16 and $21 million. Additionally, large water system users will see an \naverage monthly water bill increase between $38 and $42 and small \nsystem users will see an average water bill increase of $91.\n  The costs of complying with either of these standards could well put \nsmall rural systems out of business, which is the exact opposite of \nwhat we should be trying to accomplish, providing a safe and reliable \nsupply of drinking water to rural America. Many New Mexicans cannot \nafford a minimum $57.46 rate increase in their monthly water bill.\n  We live in a society that is dedicated to the removal of risk. \nGenerally, when we get unintended consequences associated with risk \naverse decisions, the government stands ready with band-aids in every \nsize. We still do not have a sound scientific basis suggesting what the \nactual arsenic standard should be. Therefore, to be ``on the safe \nside'' and remove risk, the government has chosen to set an arbitrary \nstandard that will increase costs to water users, particularly in the \nWest, by extreme proportions. Therefore, I do not assume that it is \nunfair to also ask that the government put itself in a position to \noffer financial assistance to these communities so that they can make \nthe necessary repairs in their water systems to comply with this law. \nThis is the only way to move forward on the course that has been set.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Will the Senator yield? I would be honored to be an \noriginal cosponsor of that legislation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent Senator Clinton and Senator \nReid be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. And Senator Boxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. See all this great bipartisanship.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1299\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Community Drinking Water \n     Assistance Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) drinking water standards proposed and in effect as of \n     the date of enactment of this Act will place a large \n     financial burden on many public water systems, especially \n     those public water systems in rural communities serving small \n     populations;\n       (2) the limited scientific, technical, and professional \n     resources available in small communities complicate the \n     implementation of regulatory requirements;\n       (3) small communities often cannot afford to meet water \n     quality standards because of the expenses associated with \n     upgrading public water systems and training personnel to \n     operate and maintain the public water systems;\n       (4) small communities do not have a tax base for dealing \n     with the costs of upgrading their public water systems;\n       (5) small communities face high per capita costs in \n     improving drinking water quality;\n       (6) small communities would greatly benefit from a grant \n     program designed to provide funding for water quality \n     projects;\n       (7) as of the date of enactment of this Act, there is no \n     Federal program in effect that adequately meets the needs of \n     small, primarily rural communities with respect to public \n     water systems; and\n       (8) since new, more protective arsenic drinking water \n     standards proposed by the Clinton and Bush administrations, \n     respectively, are expected to be implemented in 2006, the \n     grant program established by the amendment made by this Act \n     should be implemented in a manner that ensures that the \n     implementation of those new standards is not delayed.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nimprove the safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals for children; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I rise today to introduce a bill I call \nthe ``Better Medicine for Children Act.''\n  This legislation deals with a problem that pediatricians have been \nconfronted with for years, while doctors have a huge variety and choice \nof medicines to prescribe for different medical conditions, they don't \nalways have enough specific information on how well these drugs work in \nchildren.\n  The Food and Drug Administration tells us that for about 70 to 80 \npercent of all drugs on the market, we do not have sufficient pediatric \ninformation. The FDA has identified more than 400 drugs which are used \nin children for whom we need more data.\n  Without pediatric testing for a specific drug, we may now know the \nproper dose to give to children of different ages or sizes. Without \ntesting, we may not know if the drug is as effective as it is in \nadults, or even if it works in children at all. Almost all health care \npractitioners have faced difficult issues because of this scarcity of \npediatric drug information.\n  I want to share a story I have been told that points out exactly how \nimportant this pediatric information can be. This real story involves \nan 18-month-old little boy who was in an intensive care unit following \nsome serious surgery. He was under sedation from a drug known as \npropofol. At that time, we did not have much specific information on \nhow this drug affected children, but some doctors prescribed the drug \nfor children anyway because they honestly thought it was the best \noption. For this infant, it clearly was not, because of an adverse \nreaction to the drug, that baby developed acidosis and had a heart \nrhythm disturbance, causing a truly life-threatening incident. \nFortunately, this little boy did recover. But this was by no means a \nsure thing.\n  Back in 1997, Congress decided to deal with this problem. We passed a \nlaw that gave pharmaceutical companies a strong incentive to do more \npediatric testing so we can get this crucial information. If the \ncompany agreed to perform needed pediatric studies on a drug, and did \nthe study exactly as requested by the Food and Drug Administration, the \ncompany would get a six-month extension on that drug's patent.\n  The results have been amazing. Hundreds of pediatric drug studies are \nunderway and are producing huge amounts of new drug information for \nkids.\n  One example of new information is the drug propofol, the very drug I \nmentioned earlier that caused a serious\n\n[[Page S8598]]\n\nproblem for the 18-month-old boy in the ICU. What they found in \nextensive pediatric studies done on propofol as a result of the new \nincentive is that the drug is more dangerous than other alternatives \nthat could be used to sedate pediatric ICU patients.\n  So because of this testing, propofol would not be used in the same \nsituation today. And that little boy wouldn't have had a life-\nthreatening incident.\n  So if this incentive exists, and all of this new pediatric testing is \nbeing done, what's the problem?\n  Well, there are actually at least three problems. My legislation will \ndeal with each of them.\n  First, the incentives expire at the end of this year. My ``Better \nMedicine for Children Act'' will extend this important and successful \nprogram for five more years.\n  Second, because the incentive used to encourage pediatric testing is \nan extended patent life, there's actually no incentive to do pediatric \nstudies in drugs whose patent or patents have already expired. My \nlegislation will authorize $200 million in funding so that tests can be \nperformed on these off-patent drugs. The need here is great, of the \n400-plus drugs the FDA has singled out for further pediatric study, \nmore than one-third are off-patent.\n  With regard to these first two pieces of my bill, I should note my \ndebt to legislation introduced by Senators Dodd and DeWine, from which \nI have based some of my bill. Senators Dodd and DeWine were the \noriginal authors of this critical legislation back in 1997. They had a \ngood idea and a good bill then, and they have a good idea and good \nlegislation now. In fact, as a cosponsor of their bill I am pleased to \nreport that the Dodd-DeWine bill was approved earlier today by the \nSenate HELP Committee.\n  But my legislation goes beyond other approaches and has a new and \nunique provision which is not in the Dodd-DeWine bill, and which \naddresses a third critical problem. This problem is that the new wave \nof pediatric testing has actually given us relatively little \ninformation about how pharmaceuticals affect the youngest children, \nparticularly neonates. This is true because neonates aren't usually \nincluded in initial pediatric drug studies for medical or ethical \nreasons.\n  You would think that as we are talking about legislation to help \n``children'' or ``kids,'' that would be helping all children. This \ncertainly should be our expectation, but it is not the case. \nUnfortunately, the huge success this legislation has had in a broad \nsense masks the fact that the law doesn't help neonates, those babies \nless than one month old, and other younger children nearly as much.\n  An excerpt from testimony the American Academy of Pediatrics provided \nin a HELP Committee hearing last March puts it simply: ``. . . this \npopulation'', and here they are talking about neonates, ``has not \nbenefitted significantly from the pediatric studies provision . . .''\n  Why is this the case? At times, I believe the FDA actually may not \nhave asked for enough information in neonates or younger age groups--in \nother words, the agency may have just gotten lazy. That problem should \nbe correctable, and in fact it is addressed by the Dodd-DeWine bill. \nThe Dodd-DeWine legislation tries to make sure the FDA always asks for \nstudies in neonates when it is appropriate to do so.\n  But as important as that step is, I don't believe it is enough. \nBecause there are other reasons, beyond simply FDA not asking, why \nneonates cannot, at times, be included in initial pediatric studies.\n  There may be scientific reasons why the FDA may not always be able to \nask for neonate studies. For example, as part of a drug test you may \nneed to take regular blood samples from a test subject.\n  But a neonate only has so much blood, and at some point, too many \nblood tests could actually create a health problem. However, at some \ntime in the future, the technology may well be developed enough to \nenable us to do this testing with smaller amounts of blood.\n  At other times, the FDA may not request studies that include the \nyoungest children because of ethical concerns. If we are lacking \ninformation that gives us some clue how a neonate might react to a \nparticular drug, perhaps drug information in a nearby age-group, for \nexample, it may actually be dangerous to test a drug in young children. \nIn a report released January that evaluated the entire pediatric \nincentive provision, the FDA uses the example of neurotropic drugs as \nones we may not want to test in the youngest children without more \ninformation. But once this other information is developed, these \nstudies may be possible.\n  The end result of all this is that we simply do not perform drug \ntests in the youngest kids as much. And because of that, we simply \ndon't get as much useful information for younger children that can be \nput on a drug's label.\n  The drug I discussed earlier today, propofol, is a great example. I \nspoke about an 18-month-old little boy who, several years ago, had a \nserious problem when given the drug propofol. Today, a similar 18-\nmonth-old boy would not be given propofol under the same circumstances \nbecause of what we have learned from the pediatric studies performed in \nthe interim. But propofol is a example of a drug that has now been \ntested in some children, about which we have learned some very \nimportant things, but has not yet been fully tested in the youngest \nchildren. Propofol is nonetheless used in younger children, even in \nneonates, but it has only been labeled far enough to include 2-month-\nolds.\n  Now, will these companies go back and actually do the studies in the \nyounger kids? Almost certainly not.\n  Under current law, you only get one incentive period, one bite at the \napple. That's it. If the last few decades have taught us anything, it \nis that pediatric studies just do not get done unless there is an \neconomic incentive. Yet with the pediatric incentive already used for \nthese drugs, the younger kids are out of luck.\n  What makes it worse for these younger kids is that there is almost no \ncommercial incentive to study drugs in these age-groups. The raw size \nof this young population is so small, obviously even smaller than the \npopulation of children as a whole, that there is hardly ever sufficient \nmarket incentive for a drug company to perform the studies needed to \nhelp the youngest children.\n  Again, the FDA reports says it well: ``Once pediatric exclusivity is \ngranted for studies in older pediatric age groups, section 505A does \nnot provide an adequate incentive to conduct later studies in the \nyounger age groups . . . This has left some age groups, especially \nneonates, unstudied, even where the need for the drug in those age \ngroups is great.''\n  Children this young are almost certainly facing less-than-optimal \nhealth care outcomes--and perhaps even health risks--because they are \nstill being prescribed propofol and similar drugs that haven't been \ntested in their age group. Of course, we may never know for sure what's \nhappening with some of these drugs. Because, unless we find a way to \nproduce a study in this age group, we will never know for sure how this \ndrug works for the youngest children.\n\n  My legislation contains a provision that--in limited circumstances--\nwould provide drug companies with a second patent extension to serve as \nan incentive to study drugs in the youngest groups of children. I \nbelieve this could serve as the incentive to make sure these younger \nchildren share fully in the positive results of this legislation.\n  However, understanding the various concerns about possible abuse of a \nsecond incentive, increased prices, and high profits, my second \nincentive is carefully limited.\n  First, the patent extension that serves as the incentive to perform \nstudies in neonates and other young children is three months rather \nthan six. While neonates and infants are extremely important age \ngroups, it is an inescapable fact that there simply aren't as many of \nthese young children running around as there are kids in general. Given \nthis, and the legitimate concerns about marginally raising drug prices \nby keeping generic drugs off the market longer, I believe that limiting \nthe neonatal incentive to three months is reasonable.\n  Second, unlike the existing pediatric incentives, my proposed second \nincentive period would not be available to drugs going through the FDA \napproval\n\n[[Page S8599]]\n\nprocess. If a drug company is doing pediatric studies prior to a drug's \napproval, it should be able to plan a sequential set of studies as part \nof the first set of pediatric tests.\n  Finally, the possibility of a second incentive period is restricted \nto drugs that fit one of two categories. First, drugs which cannot \ninitially be studied in neonates or other young children because it is \nnecessary to pursue sequential studies for scientific, medical, or \nethical reasons. Second, drugs for which new uses have been discovered \nand for which drug studies in young children were not originally \nexpected to be useful could qualify for a second incentive period.\n  Given these limits, my expectation is that the majority of drugs \nwould not qualify for a second patent extension if my legislation were \nto pass. A significant enough amount to make a difference in young \nchildren's lives, yes. Enough to produce a tidal wave of additional \npatent extensions, no.\n  The FDA, from their January report, actually recommended that \nCongress consider the general idea I am talking about: ``When there is \na need to proceed in a sequential manner for the development of \npediatric information, FDA should have the option of issuing a second \nWritten Request for the conduct of studies in the relevant younger age \ngroup(s). For this option to be meaningful, the second Written Request, \nafter receiving the studies to an initial Written Request and pediatric \nexclusivity awarded, would be linked with a meaningful incentive to \nsponsors.''\n  Before 1997, we had a serious lack of information for children \ngenerally, so we provided an incentive to study drugs in children. We \nnow have a lack of information for the youngest children, why not \napprove a second patent extension period to provide a new incentive for \nthis age group? To me, this simply makes sense.\n  Separately, my bill also contains some provisions to improve the \ngovernment, institutional, and human infrastructure needed to support \npediatric drug testing. This includes a Dodd-DeWine provision to create \na new Office of Pediatric Therapeutics within the Food and Drug \nAdministration to monitor and facilitate the new pediatric drug \ntesting. Furthermore, my bill will direct the National Institutes of \nHealth to use programs that support young pediatric researchers to \nensure there is an adequate supply of pediatric pharmacology experts to \nsupport the revolution in pediatric drug research.\n\n  Finally, this bill modifies some specific language in the Dodd-DeWine \nlegislation to ensure that the $200 million fund designed to study \ndrugs that have lost all patent life, and thus are not helped by the \npatent extension incentives--truly focuses on the highest-priority \ndrugs.\n  Even with limited information, we have good medicine for children \nright now. But with more studies and information, we can, and must, \nproduce better medicine for children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/01/senate-section/article/S8599-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 145--RECOGNIZING THE 4,500,000 IMMIGRANTS HELPED BY \n                    THE HEBREW IMMIGRANT AID SOCIETY\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY (for himself and Mr. Brownback) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, as we prepare to go into our August recess, \nI suggest we go out on a good note: I am today introducing a resolution \ndesignating this Saturday, August 4, 2001 as ``Louis Armstrong Day.''\n  Louis Armstrong always said he was born on the Fourth of July, 1900. \nFriends and fans alike accepted this without question. It was, after \nall, a perfect birthday for an American musical legend; it was a \nperfect day for a man who created a music that was, in my opinion, \nthoroughly American.\n  But then, years after that great jazzman's death in New York City in \n1971, a researcher discovered Louis Armstrong's baptismal certificate, \nthe standard notice of birth in New Orleans, that showed that Louis \nArmstrong actually was born on August 4, 1901. That means, that this \nSaturday is the centennial of the birth of one of America's greatest \nartistic icons.\n  All across the country this week and this summer there have been \nLouis Armstrong celebrations. Generations of Americans, of all races \nand backgrounds and from all walks of life, have loved and continue to \nlove the music of Louis Armstrong, and I am happy to consider myself \none of his millions of fans. Louis Armstrong's art is deep from the \nroots of America's musical traditions, at the same time as being one of \nthe most innovative styles in the history of music. In my opinion, his \nmusic is transcendent, brilliant and, above all, joyful.\n  Music encompasses many mysteries, and, like art in general, one of \nthose mysteries is how joy can be created in circumstances that are \nless than joyful. Louis Armstrong was born very poor, in New Orleans in \n1901. The man who would be honored by presidents and kings around the \nworld scrounged in garbage cans for food when he was a youth. He was an \nAfrican-American whose life spanned the 20th century, with all of its \ndegradations, discriminations and poverty that so many African-\nAmericans suffered. It is always inexcusable that such circumstances \ncould exist and do still exist in American society. It is nothing short \nof inspirational when human dignity survives these circumstances and \ntranscends them. That was the life of Louis Armstrong.\n  It was an American life. I would like to quote the social and music \ncritic Stanley Crouch, who wrote earlier this month in the New York \nDaily News:\n\n       As an improviser who worked in the collective context of \n     the jazz band, Armstrong represented the freedom of the \n     individual to make decisions that enhance the collective \n     effort, which is the democratic ideal.\n       Our country is built on the belief that we can be free and \n     empathetic enough for both the individual and the mass to \n     make decisions that improve our circumstances. Just as the \n     improvising jazz musician can dramatically reinterpret a song \n     he or she once recorded another way, we Americans revisit \n     issues and remake our policies when we think we can improve \n     on our previous interpretations.\n       So when Armstrong revolutionized American music in the \n     1920s, he was giving our political system a sound that \n     transcended politics, color, sex, region, religion and class. \n     Instrumentalists, singers, composers and dancers all \n     understood that there was something\n\n[[Page S8600]]\n\n     in what Armstrong did with the music that could apply to \n     them. Like the Wright Brothers, he opened up the sky, and \n     anybody who developed the skill to fly was welcome to take \n     the risk of leaving the safety of the ground.\n       The propulsion Armstrong used to lift the music became \n     known as swing. It was a particularly American lilt in the \n     rhythm. That lilt had no precedent in all world music. It was \n     a new way of phrasing the endless potential for individual \n     interpretation. One could call it the sound of the pursuit of \n     happiness. That is why it was so charismatic and why it \n     influenced so many, in and out of jazz--from Duke Ellington \n     to Bing Crosby to Charlie Parker to Elvis Presley to Wynton \n     Marsalis.\n\n  Mr. President, Stanley Crouch says it better than I ever could: ``One \ncould call it the sound of the pursuit of happiness.''\n  In recent years, some have viewed Louis Armstrong from a fairly \nsimplistic perspective. Some suggested he was too acquiescent to \nracism, a charge many of his fans find unwarranted. He was famous for \ncriticizing President Eisenhower for his delays in desegregating the \nschools of Little Rock, Arkansas, in the 1950s. Hundreds of hours of \naudiotaped recordings of conversations of Louis Armstrong have recently \nbeen opened at the Louis Armstrong Archives at Queens College in \nFlushing, New York, and researchers who have heard them indicate that \nLouis Armstrong was indignant and enraged at the shame of racism in \nthis country.\n  Others suggest that his music was also simplistic, referring to songs \ntitled ``Jeepers, Creepers,'' ``Gone Fishin','' ``When You're \nSmiling,'' ``That Lucky Old Sun,'' ``Rockin' Chair,'' did not have the \nsophistication of serious music. Those critics, just aren't listening, \nin my opinion. They don't hear a trumpet sound that was honed over \ndecades and has not been replicated. They don't hear a voice tempered \nby years of performance and musically tuned and timed to perfection.\n  I am certainly not a serious music critic. I'll just quote Louis \nArmstrong, when he was asked what kind of music he listened to: ``There \nare two kinds of music,'' he said. ``Good music and bad music--I listen \nto the good music!'' I agree with Louis Armstrong!\n  As most of my colleagues know, I also grew up in modest \ncircumstances. But in addition to love, support and faith my parents \ngave me, which could not have a price put on them, they gave me \nsomething else intangible: A love of music. When we were young, my \nparents scraped together money for piano lessons for my siblings and \nme, and later even for violin lessons. As you can see, I became a \nSenator!\n  My parents also sacrificed to save what was then a phenomenal sum: \n$18.75 for a student season pass in the cheap seats for the Pittsburgh \nSymphony Orchestra. I went to every concert I could, and it was there \nthat I first learned of the uplifting experience of music, an \nappreciation I am grateful to have had all of my life.\n  Louis Armstrong's music uplifted people. Is it no coincidence that \nhis music was adored on the other side of the Iron Curtain? That \nmillions around the world, on all continents, would flock to hear him \non his tours? No, that is no coincidence. That is the power of music in \ngeneral, and the genius of Louis Armstrong in particular.\n  Louis Armstrong's music remains loved today by millions around the \nworld, and I think virtually every jazz performer has credited Louis \nArmstrong for some level of inspiration. One of America's greatest \ncontemporary jazz trumpeters, Mr. Wynton Marsalis, was quoted in last \nSunday's Deseret News saying that Louis Armstrong ``is the one who \ntaught all of us how to play. He taught the whole world about jazz.''\n  My resolution today, which I am pleased to have co-sponsored by \nSenators Schumer, Breaux and Lieberman, recognizes the brilliance of \nthis great American's artistic contribution. This Saturday, on the \noccasion of the centennial of his birth, I hope we all have a moment to \npause in joy and gratitude for the uplifting experience of Louis \nArmstrong's music. I know that, for me, when I think of the life and \nwork of Louis Armstrong, I say to myself: What a Wonderful World.\n\n                              S. Res. 146\n\n       Whereas Louis Armstrong's artistic contribution as an \n     instrumentalist, vocalist, arranger, and bandleader is one of \n     the most significant contributions in 20th century American \n     music;\n       Whereas Louis Armstrong's thousands of performances and \n     hundreds of recordings created a permanent body of musical \n     work defining American music in the 20th century, from which \n     musicians continue to draw inspiration;\n       Whereas Louis Armstrong and his bandmates served as \n     international ambassadors of goodwill for the United States, \n     entertaining and uplifting millions of people of all races \n     around the world;\n       Whereas Louis Armstrong is one of the most well-known, \n     respected, and beloved African-Americans of the 20th century;\n       Whereas Louis Armstrong was born to a poor family in New \n     Orleans on August 4, 1901 and died in New York City on July \n     6, 1971 having been feted by kings and presidents throughout \n     the world as one of our Nation's greatest musicians; and\n       Whereas August 4, 2001 is the centennial of Louis \n     Armstrong's birth: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates August 4, 2001, as ``Louis Armstrong Day''; \n     and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe the \n     day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/01/senate-section/article/S8600-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1213.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 90, S. 494.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 494) to provide for a transition to democracy \n     and to promote economic recovery in Zimbabwe.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill \nwhich had been reported from the Committee on Foreign Relations with an \namendment to strike all after the enacting clause and insert in lieu \nthereof the following:\n  [Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert the part printed \nin black italic.]\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Zimbabwe Democracy and \n     Economic Recovery Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to support the people \n     of Zimbabwe in their struggle to effect peaceful, democratic \n     change, achieve broad-based and equitable economic growth, \n     and restore the rule of law.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) International financial institutions.--The term \n     ``international financial institutions'' means the \n     multilateral development banks and the International Monetary \n     Fund.\n       (2) Multilateral development banks.--The term \n     ``multilateral development banks'' means the International \n     Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International \n     Development Association, the International Finance \n     Corporation, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Asian \n     Development Bank, the Inter-American Investment Corporation, \n     the African Development Bank, the African Development Fund, \n     the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the \n     Multilateral Investment Guaranty Agency.\n\n     SEC. 4. SUPPORT FOR DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION AND ECONOMIC \n                   RECOVERY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Through economic mismanagement, undemocratic practices, \n     and the costly deployment of troops to the Democratic \n     Republic of the Congo, the Government of Zimbabwe has \n     rendered itself ineligible to participate in International \n     Bank for Reconstruction and Development and International \n     Monetary Fund programs, which would otherwise be providing \n     substantial resources to assist in the recovery and \n     modernization of Zimbabwe's economy. The people of Zimbabwe \n     have thus been denied the economic and democratic benefits \n     envisioned by the donors to such programs, including the \n     United States.\n       (2) In September 1999 the IMF suspended its support under a \n     ``Stand By Arrangement'', approved the previous month, for \n     economic adjustment and reform in Zimbabwe.\n       (3) In October 1999, the International Development \n     Association (in this section referred to as the ``IDA'') \n     suspended all structural adjustment loans, credits, and \n     guarantees to the Government of Zimbabwe.\n       (4) In May 2000, the IDA suspended all other new lending to \n     the Government of Zimbabwe.\n       (5) In September 2000, the IDA suspended disbursement of \n     funds for ongoing projects under previously-approved loans, \n     credits, and guarantees to the Government of Zimbabwe.\n       (b) Support for Democratic Transition and Economic \n     Recovery.--Upon receipt by the appropriate congressional \n     committees of a certification described in subsection (d), \n     the following shall apply:\n       (1) Debt relief and other financial assistance.--The \n     Secretary of the Treasury shall--\n       (A) undertake a review of the feasibility of restructuring, \n     rescheduling, or eliminating the sovereign debt of Zimbabwe \n     held by any agency of the United States Government;\n       (B) direct the United States executive director of each \n     multilateral development bank to propose that the bank should \n     undertake a review of the feasibility of restructuring, \n     rescheduling, or eliminating the sovereign debt of Zimbabwe \n     held by that bank; and\n       (C) direct the United States executive director of each \n     international financial institution to which the United \n     States is a member to propose to undertake financial and \n     technical support for Zimbabwe, especially support that is \n     intended to promote Zimbabwe's economic recovery and \n     development, the stabilization of the Zimbabwean dollar, and \n     the viability of Zimbabwe's democratic institutions.\n       (2) Establishment of a southern africa finance center.--The \n     President should direct the establishment of a Southern \n     Africa Finance Center located in Zimbabwe that will include \n     regional offices of the Overseas Private Investment \n     Corporation, the Export-Import Bank of the United States, and \n     the Trade and Development Agency for the purpose of \n     facilitating the development of commercial projects in \n     Zimbabwe and the southern Africa region.\n       (c) Multilateral Financing Restriction.--Until the \n     President makes the certification described in subsection \n     (d), and except as may be required to meet basic human needs \n     or for good governance, the Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     instruct the United States executive director to each \n     international financial institution to oppose and vote \n     against--\n       (1) any extension by the respective institution of any \n     loan, credit, or guarantee to the Government of Zimbabwe; or\n       (2) any cancellation or reduction of indebtedness owed by \n     the Government of Zimbabwe to the United States or any \n     international financial institution.\n       (d) Presidential Certification That Certain Conditions Are \n     Satisfied.--A certification under this subsection is a \n     certification transmitted to the appropriate congressional \n     committees of a determination made by the President that the \n     following conditions are satisfied:\n       (1) Restoration of the rule of law.--The rule of law has \n     been restored in Zimbabwe, including respect for ownership \n     and title to property, freedom of speech and association, and \n     an end to the lawlessness, violence, and intimidation \n     sponsored, condoned, or tolerated by the Government of \n     Zimbabwe, the ruling party, and their supporters or entities.\n       (2) Election or pre-election conditions.--Either of the \n     following two conditions is satisfied:\n       (A) Presidential election.--Zimbabwe has held a \n     presidential election that is widely accepted as free and \n     fair by independent international monitors, and the \n     president-elect is free to assume the duties of the office.\n       (B) Pre-election conditions.--In the event the \n     certification is made before the presidential election takes \n     place, the Government of Zimbabwe has sufficiently improved \n     the pre-election environment to a degree consistent with \n     accepted international standards for security and freedom \n     of movement and association.\n       (3) Commitment to equitable, legal, and transparent land \n     reform.--The Government of Zimbabwe has demonstrated a \n     commitment to an equitable, legal, and transparent land \n     reform program consistent with agreements reached at the \n     International Donors' Conference on Land Reform and \n     Resettlement in Zimbabwe held in Harare, Zimbabwe, in \n     September 1998.\n       (4) Fulfillment of agreement ending war in democratic \n     republic of congo.--The Government of Zimbabwe is making a \n     good faith effort to fulfill the terms of the Lusaka, Zambia, \n     agreement on ending the war in the Democratic Republic of \n     Congo.\n       (5) Military and national police subordinate to civilian \n     government.--The Zimbabwean Armed Forces, the National Police \n     of Zimbabwe, and other state security forces are responsible \n     to and serve the elected civilian government.\n       (e) Waiver.--The President may waive the provisions of \n     subsection (b) or subsection (c), if the President determines \n     that it is in the national interest of the United States to \n     do so.\n\n[[Page S8628]]\n\n     SEC. 5.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN AGAINST \n                   INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR VIOLENCE AND THE \n                   BREAKDOWN OF THE RULE OF LAW IN ZIMBABWE.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the President should begin \n     immediate consultation with the governments of European Union \n     member states, Canada, and other appropriate foreign \n     countries on ways in which to--\n       (1) identify and share information regarding individuals \n     responsible for the deliberate breakdown of the rule of law, \n     politically motivated violence, and intimidation in Zimbabwe;\n       (2) identify assets of those individuals held outside \n     Zimbabwe;\n       (3) implement travel and economic sanctions against those \n     individuals and their associates and families; and\n       (4) provide for the eventual removal or amendment of those \n     sanctions.\n\n  Mr. REID.
