Madam President, I would like to address the Senate on \nan issue of continuing importance and consequence to families all over \nthis country, and that is what is happening in the schools of our \ncountry and what\n\n[[Page S6516]]\n\nwe can look forward to as we are approaching the return to school in \nlate August and September.\n  This has not been a good summer for many families who have children \nstruggling in the high schools of this country. Not long ago, we made a \nbipartisan commitment to the children of this country. We committed \nthat no child would be left behind. I think we have a continuing \nresponsibility to families in this country to give them an idea about \nthe progress we are making in meeting that commitment.\n  When we all supported the No Child Left Behind Act, it was a \ncommitment that no child would be left behind. However, we are finding \nout that because of state budget shortfalls and declining local \nrevenues, school districts around the country have cancelled or \nseverely cut summer school. Hundreds of thousands of students will not \ngraduate, will not be promoted, or worse--will be socially promoted, \nunprepared academically, because of the cancellation of summer \nschool. For example, the New York Times reported on July 4 that because \nof budget cuts, this year the number of students attending summer \nschool for enrichment rather than promotion will be reduced to 60,000 \nfrom 140,000 last year. Summer school provides students with a second \nchance to improve their reading and math. A math teacher stated, ``What \nis good about the summer school is that there are fewer kids.'' A \nreduced budget means fewer teachers and bigger classes in summer \nschool. That has been true, Madam President, in schools across the \ncountry. And I'll include in the Record the various summer school \nreductions and cuts which have occurred since the end of the school \nyear.\n\n  On June 2, 2002, the Orlando Sentinel reported that due to state \nbudget cuts, schools in Volusia, Orange and Seminole counties in \nFlorida have slashed summer offerings to the bare bones. Other schools \nstatewide, such as those in the Tampa Bay region, have cancelled \ntraditional summer-school programs. Schools in Volusia County tapped \nfederal funds to tutor struggling elementary-school students over the \nsummer. This year, the district dramatically scaled back high school \nofferings due to nearly $1 million in state cuts over the past two \nyears. Orange County reduced its summer-school budget by $8 million, \nscaling back high-school offerings and eliminating classes for \nstruggling middle-schoolers. Seminole County cut summer school funding \nby about $600,000 this year and will hold SAT prep course classes at \nonly four high schools, instead of at all high schools.\n  On May 31, 2002, the Associated Press reported that state budget cuts \nin Indiana are forcing school systems to pay more for summer school \nprograms or eliminate some programs. Last year, the state reimbursed \nschool systems for about eighty percent of the costs of all summer \nclasses. This year, they will pay no more than sixty-nine percent or \nless. School districts will now have to pick up more costs, and some \nteachers who planned on a summer job will have to look elsewhere \nbecause their classes have been canceled. Superintendents across the \nstate were notified of the reductions in a May 15 letter from the \nIndiana Department of Education. The plan cut the summer school \nappropriation by $3.2 million, from $21.6 million to $18.4 million. \nAdministrators in the Greater Clark schools in southern Indiana \nnotified parents about ten days ago that no enrichment classes would be \noffered to elementary school students. The district director of \ninstructional services stated, ``I know the teachers, the parents and \nthe students were disappointed . . . but we just could not afford to \noffer classes without state support.''\n  According to the May 29, 2002 edition of The Herald in Rock Creek, \nSouth Carolina, due to state budget cuts freezing thousands of dollars, \nthe Rock Hill school district will have to limit enrollment in summer \nclasses. On June 3rd, only 630 students began the summer sessions--220 \nless than last year's 850 students. The number of instructors and the \nsites for the classes will be downsized because of fewer students. Cuts \ntotaling $2.4 million will also come from teacher training stipends, \nschool and department allocations and library book spending.\n  On May 29, 2002, the Associated Press reported that Enid, Oklahoma \nschool officials canceled a federal summer school program because of \nreductions in state funding to the district. The district will have \nproblems paying the costs of the program due to a cut of $672,000 from \nthe state for the 2001-02 school year. Enid's free, month-long summer \nprogram was scheduled to start June 3rd. 400 students would have \nreceived assistance, up from 366 last year. Fifty-five employees were \nto have worked in the program.\n\n  We have also found out that in the fall schools and universities will \nface great challenges--and I will include in the Record a series of \narticles from the last few weeks. Overall, states are being forced to \neliminate programs and positions in public schools in order to deal \nwith growing budget cuts. As school budgets are being cut back, there \nis an increase in the number of students in the classes, there's a \nreduction in the number of teachers, and a reduction in the number of \nprofessional development programs. All of the indicators are going the \nwrong way.\n  On June 27, 2002 The Contra Costa Times reported that the West Contra \nCosta school district will cut department budgets by ten percent and \nwill eliminate twenty-seven jobs and two after-school programs. The \nbudget also includes $4.2 million in cutbacks, with savings found in \nthe elimination of school clerks, administrators, library assistants \nand professional development workers.\n  On June 25, 2002, The Kansas City Star reported that Johnson County, \nKansas plans to vote on a quarter-cent sales tax meant to generate \nrevenue for schools and cities. Across Kansas, school districts are \nfacing tight budgets because of the state's $700 million budget \nshortfall. If approved, the tax would provide $45.3 million in three \nyears for the county's six school districts. Educators are worried \nbecause the passage of the sales tax is the difference between adequate \nand excellent schools. The proposed $20 per student increased state aid \nto schools is not even guaranteed, nor would it even total costs.\n  On June 19, 2002, The St. Petersburg Times reported that Pinellas \nCounty School Board (Florida) members are committed to raising teacher \nsalaries over the next three to five years up to the national average. \nCurrently, teachers in Pinellas are earning on average $39,000 a year \ncompared to the national average of $45,800. Low salaries only feed the \ndwindling morale of teachers disheartened by recent budget cuts and \nincreased responsibilities. Unfortunately, no one knows how salary \nincreases will be funded, and the only option appears to be a tax hike \nfor voters who may be unwilling to pay.\n  On May 29, 2002, The Salt Lake Tribune reported that the Jordan \nSchool District in Utah could be forced to layoff 250 teachers if \nlawmakers force public schools to absorb half of the state's tax \nrevenue shortfall. The school board has already raised the district's \naverage class size to balance next year's budget following the \nLegislature's March decision to cut statewide public education funding \nby $20 million. That cut reduced sixty teaching positions in Jordan. \nJordan and the state's other thirty-nine districts have already sliced \ntheir budget proposals for the 2003 fiscal year, which starts July 1. \nBut, districts fear they will face additional reductions after \nlawmakers meet in July to adjust the state's budget to accommodate \nanother shortfall, projected at $173 million. If public education were \ncut in proportion to its share of the state budget, it would be reduced \nby $83 million, and Jordan's share of that would be $13 million, which \nwould cause at least an additional two-student increase in class size. \nGranite will drop 157 teaching positions. Davis is considering cutting \ntwenty-one teachers.\n  When we passed the No Child Left Behind Act, we said we were going to \nensure accountability, we were going to make sure we had well-qualified \nteachers, afterschool programs, and supplementary services. And all the \nindicators are now going in the wrong direction.\n\n  State universities are also experiencing huge budget cuts, as \ndecreasing financial aid and increased tuition make college less \naffordable. According to recent reports in Illinois, college tuition is \nincreasing while the state's college financial aid program is facing \nsevere cutbacks. Under the state budget that took effect on July 1, \n2002, funding for the state's need-based Monetary\n\n[[Page S6517]]\n\nAward Program will be cut by $38 million. Just several days earlier, on \nJune 27, 2002, the University of Illinois Board of Trustees decided to \nincrease tuition by ten percent to fill a $90 million budget hole.\n  State officials estimate that as many as 12,000 students across the \nstate will not be eligible for the Monetary Award Program this year, \nand thousands more will learn that the grant aid they will receive \nunder the program this year will be less than the grants that they \nreceived in previous years.\n  Of the 12,000 fewer students receiving the grants, about 7,000 are \nfifth-year students. Those students would lose their grants altogether, \nunder a plan proposed by state lawmakers and Governor George Ryan to \nsave the state $20 million.\n  An estimated 5,000 students at Illinois State University and another \n550 students at Illinois Wesleyan University could be forced to take \nout more loans, work extra jobs, or forego attending school. Cutbacks \nwill hurt students like Kimberly Williams, 21, a Columbia College \nbusiness management student. She said the assistance commission is \nstill trying to determine if she is eligible for an award, even though \nshe has received them in the past. If her award is less, ``I'll either \ndrop classes or I'll take out more loans.'' She is already $10,000 in \ndebt.\n  In Indiana, The Indianapolis Star reported on July 4, 2002, that at \nstate-supported universities this upcoming year the average tuition \nbill will jump 14.2%. Last year the tuition increased by an average of \n7.1%--still more than twice the rate of overall inflation. Tuition \nhikes were forced to make up for tighter state spending on higher \neducation.\n  In Florida, The Bradenton Herald reported on July 4, 2002, that \nFlorida State University trustees raised tuition for the fall semester \nto reflect: five percent for in-state undergraduate students and twenty \npercent for out-of-state students. The University of Florida and \nFlorida A University have approved similar increases. The tuition \nincrease is expected to bring in $10.5 million in additional revenue \nfor FSU.\n  What we are also seeing is an excellent report that was released last \nweek by the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Aid. Its findings \nfollow--they are enormously alarming.\n  More children are and will be attending college. Enrollment in higher \neducation institutions was over fifteen million last year, and is \nexpected to increase to nearly 17.5 million by 2010. The number of high \nschool students qualified to attend college is also expected to grow by \ntwenty percent over the next decade, and most of that increase will be \namong low-income and minority students.\n  The demand for college-educated workers has grown, and today's high-\nskilled job environment demands a college degree. In 1950, eighty \npercent of jobs were classified as ``unskilled''; today eighty-five \npercent of all jobs are classified as ``skilled.''\n  Financial barriers to attending college are on the rise for low- and \nmoderate- income students. Too many students are being forced to borrow \ntoo much--and work too much--to finance the rising costs of college. \nDebt levels are sky-rocketing for low-income college students and their \nfamilies, causing financial hardships in repaying student loans. At the \nsame time, state budget crunches continue to drive up college tuition \nat public universities, forcing shut the doors of college opportunity \nfor too many.\n\n  Due to the cost of college, this year more than 400,000 students from \nfamilies who make less than $50,000 a year will graduate from high \nschool, qualified and prepared to attend 4-year colleges, but will not \nbe able to fulfill that dream.\n  Half of low- and moderate-income students who do attend college will \nhave to live at home while attending school to lower the cost of \ncollege. Sixty-five percent of students will have to work part-time--an \naverage of twenty-four hours a week--while attending college to cover \ncosts. Excessive student work takes a heavy toll on academic \nperformance, often delaying graduation by two years or more.\n  The college attendance gap between affluent and poor students is \nwidening. In 1979, the most affluent students in the nation were four \ntimes more likely to have a bachelor's degree than poor students. \nToday, the most affluent students are ten times more likely to have a \ndegree.\n  We must not sell students short. We must do all we can to increase \naid to college students to ensure that more students can afford to go \nto college.\n  I believe, as others do, that education is a national security issue. \nIn many respects, it is as basic and as fundamental as the defense of \nthis country. If we are not going to have well-qualified recruits, if \nwe are not going to have men and women in the service who are going to \nbe able to take advantage of the new technologies in terms of defending \nour country, we will not be able to preserve the values and the systems \nthat we hold so dear. Education is a national security issue. That is \nwhy it is obviously key to our position in terms of global competition.\n  From the Advisory Committee Report, we can see that looking at the \nstudents coming out of our high schools, we find in so many instances \nthat many of these students are coming from very moderate, limited \neconomic means. We find their opportunities to continue on to higher \neducation and to get the skills they need are being vastly diminished.\n  What do we see in the future? We see that those families--\nparticularly low income families--have not benefitted much from the \neconomic expansion of the 1990s. They are barely holding on. Those in \nthe lower income are actually falling further behind because we have \nhad no increase in the minimum wage for the last six years. They have \nbeen falling further and further behind. Now, what is happening to \nthese families?\n  What has happened to the kids who are going on? We are finding \nincreases in tuition for colleges and universities all across this \ncountry, ranging from nine percent, ten percent, twelve percent, \nfifteen percent. And looking into the future years, they will continue \nto go up.\n  We find that student aid has remained absolutely the same. The \nchildren are working more jobs. They are working minimum wage jobs. And \nthey are working longer hours with less time for their schoolwork. They \nare now forced to borrow more and more resources in order to be able to \ncontinue.\n  One of the interesting ironies is that as they earn more money, it \ncounts against their ability to get loans and grants in the future. It \nis an extraordinary circumstance. Children take one job, two jobs, and \nthey get additional earnings which they will have to reflect on their \nfinancial statements in their ability to get additional income, which \nmay very well reflect a lowering in terms of their scholarship \nassistance. It is a no-win situation. That is happening.\n  We find that hundreds of thousands and millions of American children \nare being left behind. That is what this Advisory Committee report has \nstated. We have a basic and fundamental responsibility. If we are \nconcerned about our national security, if we are concerned about our \neconomy, if we are concerned about our democracy, then we have to \nensure that children are going to be able to continue to develop their \nskills and academic backgrounds.\n  They make a series of recommendations in terms of the enhanced Pell \nprograms. Those programs have been evaluated, attested to, tried, and \ndemonstrated as being effective. We shouldn't have to fight that fight \nevery year in the Senate.\n  There is not an American, I believe, who doesn't understand that the \nGI bill paid back anywhere from six percent to eight percent more in \ndollars to the Federal Treasury for every dollar invested in America. \nThat is true in terms of education investment today.\n  That is something we hear in this institution, and in terms of the \nadministration refusing support. The fact that the administration has \nrequested virtually zero in terms of Pell grant increases last year is \na failure and an abdication of leadership in terms of meeting the \nresponsibility for educating the children in this country.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Senator Kennedy and I are delighted to join in a \nresolution paying tribute to a unique American who passed away last \nFriday at the age of 83--a fighter to the end, and really a rather \nremarkable and fascinating individual--Ted Williams.\n  Over the span of 21 amazing years with the Boston Red Sox, Ted \nWilliams redefined baseball's greatness. Everyone knows about his .406 \nbatting average in 1941. Not everyone knows that he had an option to \nsettle that year for a less than .400, or that he would have been \nrounded up to a .400 batting average. It was about .399.\n  In the last day of season, with the doubleheader, a day that he was \noffered the opportunity to sit it out so he wouldn't lose his .400 if \nhe had a bad day, there was no way he would do that. It was not his \nstyle. He stepped up to bat, and hit 6 for 8 and took his average up to \nthe .406, which now stands as a memorable and unequaled batting average \nsince that period of time. He had 521 career home runs; a .344 lifetime \nbatting average; 2 of the 4 Red Sox Triple Crown Awards, twice the \nAmerican League's Most Valuable Player; 6-time American League Batting \nChampion, 18 American League All-Star appearances; and a member of the \nBaseball Hall of Fame.\n  He was quite literally the father of the Red Sox nation, and, for \nmillions of us, he came to live out what was his greatest wish--that if \npeople ever saw him walk down the street they would say, There goes the \ngreatest hitter who ever lived. Indeed, that is what people would have \nsaid.\n\n  Beyond the statistics and awards, which speak volumes about what he \naccomplished in a Red Sox uniform, so many of us in this country have \nan even deeper respect for the individuality he expressed in almost \neverything he did: His uniqueness as a fisherman; his uniqueness in his \ncontributions to the Jimmy Fund to raise funds for fighting cancer to \nhelp others; but especially what he did in the 5 years he spent wearing \nthe uniform of his country, reminding each of us of what it means to be \na citizen soldier, to leave a citizen's life to go out and fight for \nyour country and then come back to resume what you did before.\n  No one knows, but lots of people have speculated about what kind of \ncareer numbers this man might have posted, what records he would have \nbroken, if it had not been for those 5 years during the prime of his \nbaseball career while he served as a pilot and a member of the greatest \ngeneration.\n  All of us would wonder. He walked away from the major leagues to \nserve his country as a fighter pilot. He flew as a wingman beside our \ncolleague, Senator John Glenn, during Korea, performing a memorable \nemergency landing in a damaged plane that was on fire. And when he was \nlater asked why he didn't just bail out, he told people he was fearing \nthe fact that he might injure his knees--as you punch the button to \nbail out and you pull out of the cockpit. If you were tall, your knees \noften would be broken hitting the edge of the cockpit itself. He would \nsooner have died than not have been able to play baseball because of \nthat potential injury. It was a conscious choice. Another time, he \nescaped to safety after being hit with anti-aircraft fire.\n  Ted Williams was a courageous person, bigger than life, tough as \nnails, and he had that rare ability to sum up perfectly in his \ncharacter so many things that speak about a generation, about our \ncountry, and about a game that is known as our national pastime.\n  We all hope we will find citizens such as him and ballplayers such as \nhim again. We join in mourning his loss and reflect on all that he gave \nto his country.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Massachusetts yield for a unanimous \nconsent request? I would consider it an honor if the two Senators would \nallow me to be a cosponsor of this resolution dealing with one of my \nheroes, Ted Williams.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, we thank our leaders and we thank our \ncolleagues for giving Senator Kerry and me a moment to bring to the \nattention of the Senate and to the American people once again the \nextraordinary sense of loss that the Williams family feels, the \nincredible sense of loss that people in Boston feel, the incredible \nloss that those who love baseball feel and those who served in the \nMarine Corps feel at the loss of Ted Williams.\n  His stories on the baseball field have been well documented, although \nthey bear repeating. For example, his extraordinary lifetime average of \nover .406: When we think today of all the various baseball records that \nare being broken, every single one is being broken almost annually in \nso many different areas, but no one has even coming close to his. We \nknow he was on a level of excellence in terms of that sport that I \ndon't think will be replicated again.\n  His service in the military was, as my colleague pointed out, \nexemplary service to our country. Then the service as well to the Jimmy \nFund, the Dana-Farber program--the Jimmy Fund that was just getting \nstarted. People didn't give a great deal of attention to the fact of \nchildren's cancer, but now you can't travel anyplace in this country, \nor probably in the world, and not find people who haven't heard of the \nJimmy Fund or the Dana-Farber Center as an extraordinary place of \nexcellence that has given great focus and attention and, most \nimportantly, hope and life to hundreds of thousands of children, \nincluding one of my own who had serious cancer, osteocarcinoma, and was \nable to benefit from the extraordinary research and the gift of life \nthat that center provides. The time Ted Williams would spend down in \nthat center without any kind of fanfare, greeting and welcoming \nchildren, giving them a new sense of hope, was a real reflection of his \nhumanity.\n  This is an extraordinary American, someone of whom baseball is proud, \nBoston is proud, all of Massachusetts is proud. We salute his family, \nwe salute him, and we thank our Ted Williams for all the good things he \nhas done for baseball and for our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent that an equal time for my speech be \ngiven to the Republican side because they were to control half the time \nin this morning business hour.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator from West Virginia yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I have been told by the Republican staff that Senator \nDomenici and Senator Brownback wish to speak. How long does Senator \nDomenici wish to speak?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thought I was speaking earlier. I \nwould like 10 to 15 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Brownback wants 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Did we not have a certain amount that some of our \nSenators--\n  Mr. REID. The Republican time was to start around 10 o'clock.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Wellstone is here also.\n  Following Senator Byrd, Senator Domenici will be recognized for 15 \nminutes, Senator Brownback will be recognized for 15 minutes, and then \nwe will be on the bill. Senator Wellstone, being the timely person he \nis, came to speak at 10:30. He will not be able to do that now unless \nSenator Brownback is late; we will be on the bill at that time.\n  I ask unanimous consent--the two managers are not here, but I do not \nthink I am doing anything untoward--that he speak on the bill--he is \nnot offering an amendment--that he be recognized as soon as the bill is \ncalled up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I, too, am proud of Ted Williams. I hope the \ntwo Senators will allow me to cosponsor the resolution.\n  As one who grew up in the Great Depression, I liked baseball. It was \n1927.\n\n[[Page S6519]]\n\nMay I say to my two Senators from Massachusetts, it was 1927 when Babe \nRuth, the Sultan of Swat, beat his own home run record when he swatted \n60 home runs. I can remember those days when I watched for the baseball \nscores. I watched for Babe Ruth. I watched for Lou Gehrig. I watched \nfor the Murderous Four on the New York Yankees team. That was the year \nin which Jack Dempsey fought Gene Tunney to regain the title.\n  May I say to my dear friend, Ted Kennedy, Jack Dempsey was a hero of \nthe coal miners. He mined coal in Logan County, WV. So my foster father \ntold me we would go down to the community grill, which was a place \nwhere one could buy Coca-Colas or a soda. I mean they were good Coca-\nColas in those days, and you got them for 5 cents, a bottle of Coke for \n5 cents. So he said we would go down to the community grill and listen \nto that fight.\n  Well, we went on that night. And there were fully 30 or 40 coal \nminers around that radio. I went home a disappointed lad because Jack \nDempsey was my hero at that point as far as sports figures were \nconcerned, as well as Babe Ruth. And I went home a disappointed lad \nbecause Jack Dempsey did not win the fight.\n  I did not hear the fight. There was only one set of earphones, and \nJulius Sleboda, who was the manager of the grill--that was 75 years \nago, he was the manager of the grill--he listened to the fight, but he \ndidn't tell the rest of us anything about what was going on.\n  So, lo and behold, Mr. C.R. Stahl, a Scotsman who was the general \nmanager of the coal mining operation, came into that room and took the \nearphones from Julius, put them on, and gave to those of us who were \nstanding around with open eyes, open ears, and open mouths, a blow-by-\nblow account of the greatest prize fight, as far as I am concerned, \nthat ever occurred in the United States--Jack Dempsey. And he lost the \nfight. That was 1927.\n  May I say to the distinguished Senator from Illinois, something \nhappened in 1927. I can see the bulletins that were tacked up on the \nwall of the company store, the coal company store: ``Lindbergh Crosses \nthe Atlantic.'' He flew across the Atlantic in the Spirit of St. Louis. \nHe started out, I believe it was May 9, 1927. The New York Times had a \nheadline which said that he flew over Nova Scotia at the tremendous \nspeed of 100 miles per hour in the Spirit of St. Louis. That was \nLindbergh. He had a plane that had a load of 5,500 pounds. He had five \nsandwiches. He ate one-half of a sandwich on the way. Part of the time, \nhe flew 10 feet above the water; part of the time, 10,000 feet above \nthe water. He flew across the Atlantic in a single-engine plane, the \nSpirit of St. Louis. That was 1927.\n  That was the year Ford brought out the Model A Ford. It was also the \nyear in which Sacco and Vanzetti were executed--1927, a great year.\n\n  Let me switch now to 2002. Congress had been requested to appropriate \nmore than $10 billion in fiscal year 2003 funds for a reserve fund from \nwhich the Department of Defense will draw to pay for its operations in \nthe war against terrorism. Now, watch out. This war against terrorism \nis a terrible war, but watch out. Many things are being done under the \nrubric of the war on terrorism. We had better watch out. Let me tell \nyou about this one. The President requested this huge amount of money, \nfree of any restrictions.\n  Now, Senators, we have to watch this stampede to legislate a new \nDepartment--and I am for a new Department--but in this so-called \nreorganization plan that the President sent up to the Senate and the \nHouse, watch out, this is a reorganization plan. Let's be careful we \ndon't reorganize the checks and balances in our constitutional system. \nI have seen a fair number of requests for blank checks in my time, but \nthis one takes the cake.\n  The President's request for a large reserve fund for the military is \nnot unprecedented. Just within the last decade, Congress established \nreserve funds for military operations in Kosovo, Bosnia, and the \nPersian Gulf region. From 1996 to 2001, Congress appropriated funds to \nthe overseas contingency operations transfer fund to pay for our \npeacekeeping missions in the Balkans and the enforcement of no-fly \nzones over Iraq. The result was an accounting nightmare.\n  As the General Accounting Office reported on May 22, 2002, the \nreserve fund for operations in the Balkans and the Persian Gulf was \nused for ``questionable expenditures.'' That is an understatement. The \nGAO report details how this reserve fund was used in 2000 and 2001 to \nbuy cappuccino machines--there are three Appropriations Committee \nmembers on the floor right now on this side of the aisle, and another \none is coming in on the other side of the aisle. The GAO report details \nhow this reserve fund was used in 2000 and 2001 to buy cappuccino \nmachines, golf club memberships, decorator furniture, and even a bingo \nconsole. President Bush says he needs the reserve fund to move money \naround quickly with a minimum of congressional intrusion. But would \nsome congressional oversight have stopped the purchase of a bingo \nconsole with defense funds? How about that?\n  That is your money, I say to the taxpayers who are watching this \nSenate floor right through those cameras there. That is your money.\n  How did these funds, intended for important military missions, become \ndiverted to Government waste? As the GAO report says:\n\n       There is limited oversight--\n\n  We don't give enough time to oversight, and we have an administration \nthat doesn't want us to give much time to oversight. That is my view of \nit.\n  There is limited oversight and a corresponding lack of visibility \nover how contingency operations funds are used that has also \ncontributed to questionable uses of contingency funds.\n  That is not Robert Byrd talking, that is the GAO report, the General \nAccounting Office, an arm of the Congress. It is no wonder Congress \nrefused to put any more money into this reserve fund in the Fiscal Year \n2002 Appropriations Act.\n  We should also put this in the proper context of how the Department \nof Defense manages and accounts for the money that is appropriated to \nit. It is a miserable record. Twelve years after the enactment of the \nChief Financial Officers Act of 1990, the Pentagon is unable to produce \nannual audited financial statements. It is a financial scandal that \ngoes beyond the accounting chicanery perpetrated by the fallen giants \nof corporate America. In January 2001, the General Accounting Office \nreported that the Pentagon was unable to reconcile a $7 billion \ndifference--not $7 million, but $7 billion--the Pentagon was unable to \nreconcile a $7 billion difference between its available fund balances \nand the balances kept by the Department of the Treasury; that the \nDepartment made $2.3 trillion--this is still the General Accounting \nOffice report talking--that the Department made $2.3 trillion in \nunsupported accounting entries in fiscal year 1999, and that the \nPentagon was not able to keep track of all of their weapons systems and \nsupport equipment. Now, get that. Simply put, if the Pentagon were a \ncorporation, its stock would be crashing and the Dow Jones would be in \nreally serious trouble.\n\n  We should all know by now that the Pentagon's accounting mess \nrequires closer oversight. It is a massive operation, and the Secretary \nof Defense has indicated it is a massive operation. Not all of this \nhappened on his watch. He wants to try to get control over it, but how \ncan he? It is so massive: Establishing a $10 billion reserve fund for \nthe war on terrorism, with no restrictions, no limitations, no controls \non how the money can be spent. We are talking about $10 billion; that \nis $10 for every minute since Jesus Christ was born. It would be \nthrowing gasoline on a fire that is already raging out of control. With \nthe Government ledgers filling up with red ink, we need not only fiscal \nresponsibility, but also accounting responsibility.\n  My concern with the reserve fund proposed by the President is not \nlimited to its gross invitation for waste, fraud, and abuse, to use a \nhackneyed term.\n  As a Member of the Senate and chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, I want to know how this money will be used because $10 \nbillion is a lot of money, looking at it from the standpoint of my \nbackground and my State. It is a lot of money. Will it be used for \nrooting out the terrorists who remain in Afghanistan? Will it be used \nfor the creation of an Afghan national army? Will it be used to \nincrease our military presence in the Philippines, Georgia, or Yemen? \nWhat about an invasion of Iraq? Is that what it is going to be used \nfor? We don't know.\n\n[[Page S6520]]\n\n  On July 3, 2002, President Bush sent a letter to congressional \nleaders to provide further details on how the $10 billion fund might be \nused. This supposed explanation left me scratching my head. I bet it \nleft the Senator from New Mexico scratching his head. Nobody in this \nSenate understands this budget and the appropriations process any \nbetter than he does, if as well as he does. But it left me scratching \nmy head--even more than I had scratched it before. The letter from the \nPresident talks about $10 billion being requested for a reserve fund \nwith no controls and no oversight. But get this:\n\n       This request will improve collection, analysis, \n     coordination, and execution of intelligence priorities and \n     plans, as we expand into new theaters--\n\n  Oh, oh--\n\n     of operation and build new relationships.\n\n  That is not my quote. That is the quote in the message from the \nPresident.\n  Let me say that again. Hear me, Senators. The letter from the \nPresident states:\n\n       This request--\n\n  For $10 billion of your money; your money; your money--\n\n       This request will improve collection analysis, \n     coordination, and execution of intelligence priorities and \n     plans as we expand into new theaters of operation and build \n     new relationships.\n\n  Mr. President, there is no clarification on what is meant by \n``expanding into new theaters of operation.'' Our imaginations are left \nto run wild. Are we talking about Iraq? If so, Mr. President, let's \nhear it. Tell us. The American people are entitled to know where their \nmoney is going to be spent, where their boys and girls, the young men \nand women of this country, are going to be sent. Tell us.\n  Our imaginations are left to run wild. An accompanying letter from \nthe Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mitch Daniels, \nproposes to elaborate, he is going to explain, explain a bit more, on \nhow the $10 billion is going to be used. He is a favorite of us Members \non the Appropriations Committee in both Houses. Mitch Daniels, the OMB \nDirector, is a great favorite of ours.\n  According to Mr. Daniels' letter, the reserve fund would contain--\nlisten to this--the reserve fund would contain ``up to $2.550 billion \nfor military personnel accounts; up to $5.570 billion for operation and \nmaintenance accounts, as well as military construction on working \ncapital funds; and up to $1.880 billion for procurement or research, \ndevelopment, test, and evaluation account.''\n  While this may be seen by some as making some progress in specifying \nhow the requested funds might be used, the devil is still in the \ndetails, and we do not have them.\n  Under the President's proposal, the allocations could be changed by \nthe Secretary of Defense, after consultation with the Director of the \nOMB. Now get that, get that, pay close attention: Under the President's \nproposal, the allocations could be changed by the Secretary of Defense, \nafter consultation--get that--after consultation with the Director of \nOMB and 15 days after providing notification--not a request--but \nnotification to the congressional defense committees. Ha, ha, ha. What \nare we going to do next?\n  It is not hard to see how that $10 billion reserve fund could start \nout for a legitimate purpose, such as paying the Guardsmen who have \nbeen mobilized for homeland security missions, but then be reallocated \nto fund any program that could be twisted around and redefined to \nencompass a defense against terrorism.\n  I suppose that additional missile defense spending could fall within \nthat rubric, as would military action against Iraq. Watch out; be \ncareful while you are back home in August. Be careful.\n  I could not imagine that a $10 billion reserve fund would be \nconsidered for any other agency in our Government but the Department of \nDefense. I doubt that any of us would seriously consider a $10 billion \nreserve fund that could be spent on health care, prescription drugs, or \nhighway construction. The fiscal conservatives in Congress would hit \nthe roof. ``Where is the accountability?'' they would say. If any \nMember of this body proposed on an appropriations bill a $10 billion \nreserve funds for education, with no limits on how those funds would be \nused, I have no doubt that the President would assail that Member for \nfiscal irresponsibility and ready his veto pen.\n  It is true that we are engaged in a war on terrorism, and that war is \nexpensive. At the height of our military operations in Afghanistan, we \nwere spending more than $1 billion a month. But there is already a \nwell-established means of providing that money without resorting to \nblank checks and reserve funds. Congress passes supplemental \nappropriations bills to provide additional funds to address \ncontingencies that were not anticipated in the regular appropriations \nprocess.\n  The Senate passed a supplemental appropriations bill on June 7 of \nthis year that fully funds the President's request for additional funds \nfor the military to pay for the war on terrorism. At his news \nconference earlier this week, President Bush criticized the Congress \nfor delays in final action on the supplemental bill, but he failed to \nmention that his administration is greatly responsible for at least \npartially delaying the legislation.\n  The administration slowed the supplemental bill down months ago by \nrepeatedly refusing to allow Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge to \ntestify about the funding request. Most recently, the administration, \nclaiming that the supplemental bill invests too much in homeland \nsecurity, has threatened to veto the legislation, despite its \noverwhelming 71 to 22 vote in the Senate. What our country needs is \nresponsible leadership, and Presidential threats about a veto of \nhomeland security funding is nothing short of irresponsible.\n  This supplemental appropriations bill does not include a reserve fund \nthat will subvert government accountability for how taxpayer money is \nspent. But the administration continues to seek such a fund for the \nfiscal year 2003 Defense appropriations bill. I deeply regret this \nindication that the administration continues to view Congress as an \nimpediment to the national interest, rather than a coequal branch of \nour Government with its own, non-delegable authorities and \nresponsibilities under the Constitution.\n  The Founding Fathers granted Congress the power of the purse and the \nresponsibility to provide for our national defense.\n  Accountability for how the funds are spent must be demanded by \nCongress as the directly elected representatives of the people. We were \nnot sent here by an electoral college. We are directly accountable to \nour constituents. If this $10 billion defense reserve fund is misused, \nwho will have to answer to the letters and the phone calls from John Q. \nPublic? It will not be the Secretary of Defense. It will not be the \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget. It will be us, the \nMembers of Congress. We have a responsibility to see that funds we \nappropriate are well spent. We cannot allow ourselves to shirk that \nresponsibility. It is the people's tax dollars.\n  If the people are being told these dollars are to go to fight global \nterrorism, this Congress must never allow these funds to buy cappuccino \nmachines instead.\n  I again thank all the Senators, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/10/senate-section/article/S6520-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6520-S6522]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE SENATE NEEDS A BUDGET\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I might say to the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia, since I like cappuccinos, it would be better than \nsome other things we might buy.\n  In any event, the Senator from Kansas is going to speak shortly, and \nI will try not to go too long. The Senator from West Virginia, Mr. \nByrd, I have been listening, and not to your entire speech, but I say \nthe Senator from New Mexico agrees with some of what you said. But I \nwould not expect you to lay the blame in Congress where the blame lies \nin Congress. I believe much of the delay on everything is attributable \nto the fact that the majority party has not yet as of this day produced \na budget. So if we want to talk about delays, as chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, my good friend, you do not know what number to mark to. \nNobody has yet told you how many dollars you have to spend. If the \nbudget does anything, it starts with that.\n\n[[Page S6521]]\n\n  It also ropes in, in some good and major way, the entitlements that \nare supposed to come up the remainder of this year and next year. We do \nnot have that around either. That is one of the reasons we keep getting \n60 votes for every proposal that might be something that we ought to be \nconsidering for the American people.\n  It is given an added burden because we do not have a budget. So I \nhave said this, not as many times as some have urged me to say it, but \nI have said we need a budget. I do not know if we need it now--it is \nalmost August--but I do believe we have to remind ourselves that \nwhether we like the budget process or not, whether it will be in \nexistence next year, we will know in advance. But as part of the \nprocess we go through, clearly it is not good for the American people \nthat it not be done. It causes an awful lot of problems. It can cause \nus to spend an awful lot of money. It might indeed cause us to be \nbehind schedule on things and we ought not be, especially in an \nelection year when we have to tear ourselves away from an election, a \nnumber of the Senators do, plus the rest of the elections in our \ncountry.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Inasmuch as he addressed some of his remarks to me, I share \nthe Senator's concern that there is no budget. I was also concerned the \nprevious year when there was no markup in the Budget Committee of the \nbudget bill. I was a member of that committee.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, indeed.\n  Mr. BYRD. There was no markup. So each side, of course, can find some \nfault with the other. The point is, we are at the present moment, and \nCongress is being blamed by the administration for not passing a \nsupplemental bill quickly. I have pointed out that the administration \ncould be more helpful in this regard. Senator Stevens and I, and other \nMembers of the Appropriations Committee, have been working with a \nRepublican House and we stand ready and have stood ready all along to \nmeet to try and work out these differences.\n  The administration could be more helpful to us if it would urge the \nRepublican House to move faster. We ought to get that supplemental \nback--that conference back to both Houses this week. We ought not to be \nany longer than that.\n  I am glad to say the distinguished chairman of the House side of the \nAppropriations Committee is calling me, I believe today, and he is \nworking with Senator Stevens and Mr. Obey.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is that the House or the budget chairman?\n  Mr. BYRD. I beg your pardon?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is that the House or the Budget Committee chairman?\n  Mr. BYRD. I am glad the Senator pointed to my inadvertence. It is the \nHouse Appropriations Committee chairman, Mr. Young. He is working with \nMr. Stevens, Mr. Obey, and myself. So we hope to get a supplemental \nconference report this week.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator for his courtesy in yielding.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I did not intend to get into a debate about the 27 \nyears of budgets that I have been part of in the Senate. I merely call \nto the attention that right now, this year--we did get a budget last \nyear. We did not get it out of committee, but the statute did not \nrequire that.\n  I do not want to debate that issue. I merely mentioned that my good \nfriend was producing a litany of things that were causing the delay, \nand I thought it was a little bit lopsided toward blaming the \nadministration for the delays. A lot of them are our fault, starting \nwith the fact that we do not have a budget.\n  Yes, the President has a different approach to what he wants to use \nthe money for than we do, but we better get on with it. It is not too \nmuch different than most Presidents in sending us their budgets, and \nthe sooner we get on with facing up to our responsibility the better we \nare.\n  We have been sitting around waiting for somebody else--and it was not \nthe President--for a long time in the Senate, as time ran buy and the \nappropriations were needed. We are going to get them done just like we \ndo every other year. I used to think because it got late and because I \nwas worried we were not in session, that we would not get it done. We \nwill get it some way or another. We always have. We have been late. We \nhave had partial passages of supplementals and then we have had other \nways of putting two or three bills together, all of which should not \nhappen. But if you need to do them, you need to do them. That will be \nthe case this year, too, I hope. I hope it will be done expeditiously.\n\n  Now, I want to move to the subject I came to the floor about.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask that the time for this colloquy not be taken out of \nthe time allotted to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. This colloquy will not come off of my time.\n  Mr. BYRD. I hope the Senator will have all the time he wants.\n  It is too bad we get into these little kinds of colloquies, but I \nbelieve the candidate who said he was going to change the tone in \nWashington would go a long way towards helping to change that tone if \nhe would stop beating Congress over the head in his public speeches. \nJust the other day, he complained about the Congress not passing his \nsupplemental bill and the chairman of that committee. I am not at fault \nfor not getting it passed. The Republicans on that committee are not at \nfault. We voted it out of the committee solidly, 29 to 0. So we work in \na bipartisan fashion in that committee.\n  Senator Stevens and I are working in a bipartisan fashion, and the \nadministration does not help things when it lambastes the Congress \npublicly and talks about the supplemental bill, the delays in getting \nthat bill down to the President.\n  We put every dollar in that bill that the President asked for for \ndefense, and part of that delay is caused by the administration itself. \nI cannot help but respond to that kind of partisanship when it is sent \nout over the public airwaves by the one man in this country who \ncommands the attention of the press. Nobody else can compete with a \nPresident when it comes to that, but we all are going to have to answer \nto voters. I will stand at the judgment bar as well, but we on the \nAppropriations Committee are doing everything we can to move the bill.\n  We are scheduled to take up the remaining appropriations bills before \nthis month is out. Senator Stevens is working with me in that regard, \nand so is Senator Domenici and the others. Let us call it 50/50, a \ndraw, like the All-Americans did last night?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Well, you just added another one. You went to the 60. \nSo I have to go to the 60.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator says ``you.'' Under the Senate rules, we are \nnot supposed to address another Senator in the second person.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am not here as much as the Senator and \nI slip every now and then.\n  Mr. BYRD. We all slip.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It is pretty hard to get that out of your head, but I \nthink I have the floor now. Is that correct?\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator does.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, Senator McConnell, if he were \nhere, wished to speak on his amendment, which is the pending matter on \nthe bill that will be before the Senate in a few minutes. I ask \nunanimous consent that following the statement of the Senator from \nMinnesota, which is for debate only on the bill, the Senator from \nKentucky, Mr. McConnell, be recognized for debate only on his amendment \nfor up to 30 minutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Reserving the right to object, if I could inquire, I \nbelieve in the former unanimous consent I was to be recognized after \nSenator Domenici. If that is not impacted by the unanimous consent \nrequest, I will have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. It would not be affected by \nthe unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I remove my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, am I limited by a certain amount of \ntime?\n\n[[Page S6522]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for a couple of weeks, every time \nAmericans look at their TV screen, they see a huge fire, a piece of \nAmerica burning. Forests in our Southwest and West are on fire. We have \nseen huge fires in the State of Arizona, small but significant fires in \nNew Mexico, and very large fires in the State of Colorado.\n  I do not want to discuss the why of the fires today, but I am very \nhopeful that another year will not pass in the Congress, at least the \nSenate, without a thorough analysis and research by a committee of \nCongress on why our forests are burning. Some say it is natural. Others \nsay it is a terrible management mistake. They claim that we have gone \nalong without pruning, thinning, or taking care of forests and are \ninviting either manmade fires, lightning, or some kind of natural fire \nstarter.\n  We have a very serious problem with reference to our national forests \nand these fires. So far this year, over 3 million acres have burned, \nand the fire season is not yet over. This is 1 million acres more than \nthe devastating 2000 fire season and twice the 10-year average. So far, \ntwice the 10-year fire average has already occurred in our forests! \nThis fire season has had a detrimental impact on communities throughout \nthe West and Southwest, disrupting thousands of people's lives, hurting \nthe economies in ways we cannot measure, and destroying homes and \nproperty. We must act in each instance to put out the fires, to contain \nthem, and, yes, after that, provide whatever help we can to those \nsuffering.\n\n  While the fires burn, there are people who need help. There are \npeople in both the BLM and the Agriculture Department who are busy, day \nby day, using millions and millions of dollars, which we have provided.\n  I suggest today that the Department of the Interior and the \nDepartment of Agriculture indicate they will have to move resources \nfrom all kinds of activities that are supposed to occur during the rest \nof this year over into fire accounts because nobody expected such a \nhuge, onerous, and costly fire season. The Department of the Interior \nand Department of Agriculture are about $850 million short for 2002.\n  Those managing the bills, and the White House, should know it is a \nvery difficult situation to let a supplemental catch up with the \nproblem. That is what happened here. We have a supplemental \nappropriations bill waiting around. Now we have a new problem that did \nnot exist when the supplemental started--reimbursement to the \nDepartments of our Government that have used their money to pay for the \nforest fires that are burning down America.\n  We ought to either find a place for that amendment on the \nsupplemental or in some way accommodate it. We always say if it is an \nAmerican problem, we will pay for it. If it is an earthquake, we pay \nfor it. If it is a tornado, we pay for it. That is the collective \ninsurance of America that we will pay for those emergencies, either on \nthe supplemental or on the Interior appropriations bill, neither of \nwhich at this moment has money for these forest fires--neither bill, \nneither the supplemental nor the full yearly appropriation bill.\n  The whole of next year is ready to be appropriated without the fire \nmoney in it. So we need to provide the money the way I see it. It has \nbeen waiting long enough. I know the President does not want the \nsupplemental over a certain amount. I will accommodate to arrange the \nadditional funding, however he and others in the appropriations process \nand the Congress desire.\n  I repeat, the money that has been used to fight the forest fires has \ncome out of various and sundry accounts, including the accounts for \nrehabilitation and restoration of burned lands. For those in the West \nwho are suffering from these fires, we will get a bill ready.\n  I close by saying there is also a growing problem in Texas and other \nStates regarding excessive water. The floods have caught up with this \nsupplemental. I have been discussing the issue with the Senator from \nTexas, Kay Bailey Hutchison. I have also talked to Senator Gramm. We \nwill be asking that they present their water issues, and maybe we can \nprovide funding on one emergency supplemental bill to the extent it is \nnecessary to accommodate the emergencies of our people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nKansas is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a unanimous \nconsent to be placed in the queue to speak?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that at the appropriate time, \nwhich I believe is following Senator McConnell, I be allowed 15 minutes \nto speak in support of the Leahy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/10/senate-section/article/S6522-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6522-S6523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  COMMISSION ON THE ACCOUNTABILITY AND REVIEW OF FEDERAL AGENCIES ACT\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to spend a few minutes talking \nabout a growing fiscal and budgetary problem we have in the Senate, \nsomething I am not joyous about bringing up, but we have a problem. We \nare quickly sliding into it, if not falling into it, and we need to get \nit addressed. We need to address it before we get completely caught up \nin the fiscal and budgetary track.\n  Time is growing short. This body has yet to pass a budget resolution. \nWe have not passed a single 1 of the 13 annual appropriations bills \nyet. Here we are in the middle of July; no budget resolution, not 1 of \nthe 13 annual appropriations bills. We are quietly moving into position \nfor a fiscal train wreck. Many Members of the body expressed grave \nconcern and doubt in 1998 when we did an omnibus appropriations bill. \nThe course currently being charted by the Senate leadership will make \nthat train wreck look like a fender bender.\n  We need to first consider the budget resolution created by the Budget \nAct of 1974. The budget resolution, which the Senate is legally \nrequired to pass by April 15--nearly 3 months ago--established caps on \ntotal annual discretionary spending. To waive the limits requires a 60-\nvote point of order. Without the mechanism in place, amendments to \nincrease spending can be passed in the appropriations bills, regardless \nof their impact on Social Security, by a simple majority. So we are \nsubjecting the Social Security surplus to simple majority movement by \nthis body.\n  It is astounding, but despite the legal requirements for passage of \nthe budget resolution by April 15, the leadership of the Senate has \nfailed to even bring up the measure for consideration. And in the 27 \nyears since the Budget Act of 1974, the Senate has had a budget.\n  To further put our current situation in perspective, consider the \nfact that just a year ago this body was composed of the exact 100 \npeople here today, and we passed a budget resolution offered by Senator \nDomenici with the support of 65 Members.\n  Regardless of how the votes stack up, at the least, the Senate should \npass a budget resolution so we have the fiscal caps in place that would \ntake 60 votes--not just a majority, but 60 votes--to be able to raid \nthe Social Security surplus. That is just prudence on our part that we \nought to put the budget mechanisms in place.\n  I think we are sliding quickly into a situation where we are going to \nbe spending ourselves into a bigger hole and not have any of these \nrestraints or the mechanisms in place to help hold us back.\n  On the appropriations bills I mentioned at first, when the Senate \nshould have passed 4 or 5 of these at least by this point in time, of \nthe 13, we have passed none. These bills can take weeks to debate and \npass. Then there are conference committees to work out the differences \nbetween the House and the Senate bills.\n  When considering these factors, coupled with the finite time \nremaining on the legislative calendar, it seems evident that a super-\nomnibus bill, larger than the 1998 omnibus, may very well be necessary \nto break the inevitable logjam.\n  Most of us in this Chamber have been privileged enough to serve \nduring the recent period of historic, large federal surpluses. While \nlarge surpluses can be\n\n[[Page S6523]]\n\nan indicator of a robust economy, they are not necessarily an indicator \nof good fiscal management. Large surpluses, as I think we have seen, \ncan lead to complacency with, and in some instances even misuse of, \ntaxpayer dollars. While we should always be dedicated to ensuring the \nmaximum benefit of every tax dollar that comes to Washington, we are \nnow faced with the real possibility of a $100 billion deficit in fiscal \nyear 2002--a $100 billion deficit.\n  Between increased funding for both the War on Terrorism and other \ndomestic programs, our federal surpluses have vanished, and we are \nreentering the realm of deficit spending. We need to exercise fiscal \nrestraint in our spending, and yet we appear to be headed for another \nomnibus appropriations bill at the end of this congressional session. \nSurely, Members on both sides of the aisle can understand that if this \nis the case, it means that there will be even more pork-laden measures \ntucked inside of these bills. Whether you are conservative or liberal, \nsurely, it is an unacceptable strain on hard working Americans and our \neconomy to have that type of pork barrel spending. The bottom line is \nthat an omnibus appropriations bill prevents the proper individual \nconsideration of spending measures, and it is bad for America.\n  Now more than ever, we should take steps to assure taxpayers that \ntheir hard-earned tax dollars are being well spent. Two months ago, I \nintroduced the bipartisan Commission on the Accountability and Review \nof Federal Agencies Act--or CARFA Act for short. As in any bureaucracy, \ninefficient or low priority use of taxpayer's dollars are often serious \nthreats to the credibility of an agency or program. We must be certain \nthat the money we spend is not just allocated that way because we have \nhistorically spent it this way. Priorities change and our spending must \nchange with it.\n  The CARFA Act would create a commission that is modeled on the \nsuccessful Base Realignment and Closure BRAC Commission. Whereas the \nBRAC Commission examined military bases and the Department of Defense, \nCARFA would review Federal domestic agencies, and programs within \nagencies using a narrow set of criteria, which should produce \nsignificant results. The three areas of review are duplicative \nprograms, wasteful or inefficient spending, outdated, irrelevant or \nfailed programs.\n  If this legislation is enacted, the Commission, upon completion of \nits two-year review, would submit to Congress both its recommendations \nfor the realignment and elimination of domestic agencies and programs, \nand proposed legislation to implement these recommendations. The \nCongress would then consider the Commission's proposed legislation in \nan expedited manner, with input from the committees under who's \njurisdiction the affected agencies or programs fall. Following the \ncommittee's comment period, the proposed legislation would be brought \nto the floor of each Chamber for debate and a vote. Like BRAC, the \nCommission's proposed legislation would be voted up-or-down without \namendment.\n  The Commission on the Accountability and Review of Federal Agencies \nAct is about maximizing the benefit of Federal funds. Like BRAC, which \ndirected that all funds saved be placed back into the DOD budget, any \nfunds saved by implementation of CARFA's recommendations would be \ndirected to support other more efficient domestic programs and \nagencies. In other words, any money saved would be put right back into \nother, higher priority domestic programs. That would be the best way we \ncould spend the money.\n  The CARFA Act is about fiscal responsibility, and the Federal \nGovernment is accountable to the hard-working Americans who foot the \nbill. Personally, I think it would be wonderful if we were able to \nfurther increase the research budget for the National Institutes of \nHealth, or IDEA--Individuals w/Disabilities Education Act--because \nfunds saved through the work of the CARFA commission would be more \nmoney available there. Priority spending would be done. This Commission \nhas the potential to help us truly root out inefficiency, in the \nFederal Government in such a way that we can more fully realize the \nbenefit of all Federal funds.\n  The CARFA Act is a good measure, and its enactment would send a \npositive signal to the American people that the Senate is attempting to \nexercise sound fiscal policy. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to look at the fiscal situation we are setting \nup right now with the spending and the lack of a budget bill, the lack \nof passing any appropriations bill, the $100 billion fiscal deficit we \nare looking at for this fiscal year. We cannot afford this train wreck, \nand it is not wise at all for us to allow ourselves to slip into it. We \nreally need to show the leadership to pass a budget resolution, to pass \nappropriations bills, to put caps in place, and to pass this CARFA \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. My colleague from Indiana wanted to speak for 5 \nminutes, so I ask unanimous consent he be allowed to speak for 5 \nminutes, after which I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the Senator from \nMinnesota, for his courtesy.\n  Mr. President, it is good to see you in the chair again. You have had \nthe misfortune of being in the chair the last few times I took the \nfloor, and I appreciate your forbearance as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/10/senate-section/article/S6523-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6523-S6524]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ACCOUNTING REFORM ACT\n\n  Mr. BAYH. I come to the floor of this august body to call for the \nswift enactment of the accounting reform measure, including the Leahy \namendment. I do so because I believe very strongly that it is in the \nbest interests of America at this critical time in our history. I \nbelieve it goes way beyond mere accounting issues.\n  What we are debating today deals with the financial security of \nmillions of individual investors across this country, the security of \ntheir pensions, their 401(k) programs, and their other investments for \nthe future of their children and their grandchildren.\n  What we are talking about today involves the very vitality of our \neconomy, for those who have invested and not invested alike, the amount \nof investment that will take place in the economy, the number of jobs \nthat will be created, the vitality of farms. What we are debating today \ninvolves the standing of America in the international economy; whether \nwe will continue to be a safe haven for investments from those abroad, \nattracting the capital that helps us build a strong foundation for \nAmerica's economy.\n  More than anything else, what we are debating today is nothing less \nthan the basic values upon which this country has been based; whether \nwe will continue to encourage those virtues that have always \ncharacterized America, whether we will continue to be the land of \nopportunity based upon hard work, ability, thrift, honesty, and playing \nby the rules or, instead, whether we will be perceived as the land of \nopportunity based upon artifice, avarice, and financial deceit. I \nbelieve the choice is clear and that the right thing, based upon \ntraditional values and virtues, is embodied in the Sarbanes bill, \nincluding the Leahy amendment.\n\n  I congratulate our colleague, Senator Sarbanes. He has demonstrated \nleadership and foresight in this issue. I believe the record will show \nthat Senator Sarbanes was a leader in this issue a long time before it \nbecame popular. It is wonderful when events combine with leadership to \ngive us an opportunity to truly make historic progress in this body. I \nthink Senator Sarbanes has seized the moment.\n  I congratulate Senator Leahy for his protection of whistleblowers and \nstrong penalties against document shredding and financial fraud. He has \nmade this a better bill.\n  Mr. President, as you know, we serve on the Intelligence Committee \ntogether, and since the tragedies of 9/11, our country has been \ninvolved in twin struggles: One, the physical national security of this \ncountry; and, second, getting this economy moving again to ensure the \neconomic security of Americans across this country. There are parallels \nbetween these two challenges. Both occurred as a result of unexpected \ntragedies but have presented us with opportunities to make this an even \nbetter, stronger, more secure Nation. Both involve breaking the \npolitical gridlock and the bureaucratic inertia that all too often make \nprogress in this Capitol\n\n[[Page S6524]]\n\ndifficult. And both involve striking the right balance between \nindividual freedom and liberty on the one hand, that we cherish, and \ncollective security, which makes individual liberty meaningful, on the \nother.\n  I believe this bill strikes the right balance. It insists upon \ncredibility and transparency of information provided to the \nmarketplace, the very foundation upon which capitalism is built, but it \ndoes so with flexibility to ensure that the regulatory hand is as light \nas possible, and that the information provided, that transparency and \ncredibility provided to the marketplace, is done in a manner that is \nleast burdensome to shareholders and investors as possible.\n  For example, the prohibitions against auditors providing consulting \nservices: We have seen, as the chairman would note, in recent years a \nvast expansion of expenses and consulting services which create an \nappearance of a conflict of interest.\n  We need to deal with this transparency to reassure the marketplace, \nbut we need to do so in a way that imposes less regulation, burden, and \ncost upon existing shareholders as is humanly possible. This bill takes \nthat approach by creating a presumption that certain consulting \nservices will not be allowed, but by also providing flexibility to the \nnew independent oversight board to waive that presumption, or the \ncompany and its auditors can go to the oversight board and say in this \ninstance, under these facts, the presumption should be waived because \nwe can provide the transparent data to the marketplace in a less costly \nmanner by allowing our auditors to provide these consulting services.\n  Basically, the bottom line is where it makes sense to provide the \nconsulting services, or the presumption or the appearance of conflict \nis not a conflict in fact, it can be waived, and the consulting \nservices can be provided. That is the right balance for transparency \nand credibility provided in the marketplace in the less costly manner \nto shareholders.\n  I congratulate the chairman for incorporating that into the bill.\n  I have heard some of our colleagues and commentators talk about \noverburdensome regulations. I don't have the reflexive reaction to \nregulate. I am well aware that one of the few laws that we count on in \nWashington is the law of unintended consequences. But the fact that an \nerror may be made is no excuse for doing nothing.\n  The right answer is not no action to address the inadequacies that we \nhave seen, just as it is not an overburdensome action. The right \nanswer, my friends, is a well-considered, thoughtful, well-balanced \naction to protect the interests of American investors, and to ensure \nthe integrity of our economy. That is the balance which is struck in \nthe Sarbanes bill.\n  That is why I compliment the chairman for all the work he has done.\n  Let me conclude. My colleague from Minnesota has been so gracious for \nallowing me to continue.\n  I am pleased to see the chairman in the Chamber. I hope he will have \na chance to read the complimentary remarks I made about his leadership \nand his farsightedness.\n  I said he is the leader on this issue, and I congratulate him for \nthat.\n  Let me conclude where I began.\n  This issue goes a long way beyond mere accounting issues. It goes a \nlong way beyond economic policy. It goes to the very heart of who we \nare, what we stand for as a people, and the kind of values we cherish \nin United States of America. This will protect individual investors. It \nwill help to ensure the integrity of our economy. But more than \nanything else, it will ensure that those Americans who have embraced \nour tradition with virtues, who have worked hard and saved their money, \nwho have played by the rules, and are honest are able to get ahead in \nthis society.\n  It will send a loud and clear signal to those who practice financial \ndeceit and financial chicanery that they do not have an avenue to \nsuccess in this country. That does not embody the best values of \nAmerica.\n  That is why I strongly support the Sarbanes bill and the Leahy \namendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to enact this important legislation.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I say to my good friend, the \ndistinguished Senator from Indiana, that he said I should read his \ngracious comments. I actually saw them on one of the monitors. That is \none of the reasons I came to the floor. I wanted to express my personal \nappreciation to the Senator for his very kind remarks.\n  But even more, I wanted to underscore the constructive contributions \nwhich the Senator made to this legislation in the course of its \nconsideration by the committee. I know how closely he followed what we \nwere trying to do. He came forward with a number of ideas that were \nmost helpful to us in shaping this legislation. I think the statement \nhe just made reflects his own deep appreciation of the seriousness of \nthe issue with which we are trying to deal, the import it has for the \nfunctioning of the American economy, and how he understands that they \nare very important issues.\n  If we don't move to restore confidence in the U.S. capital markets, \nthere will be a negative impact on our economy. We are seeing some of \nthat now. We have already seen this tremendous loss in the value of the \nretirement plans. People have just been wiped out. Tens of thousands of \npeople are being laid off. The impact on the economy is beginning to \nspread. We need to move in order to counter that and start ascending in \na different direction.\n  I particularly want to thank the Senator for his consistent help in \nthe committee as we marked up this legislation.\n  Mr. BAYH. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/10/senate-section/article/S6524-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6524]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 2673, which the clerk will report by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2673) to improve quality and transparency in \n     financial reporting and independent audits and accounting \n     services for public companies, to create a Public Company \n     Accounting Oversight Board, to enhance the standard setting \n     process for accounting practices, to strengthen the \n     independence of firms that audit public companies, to \n     increase corporate responsibility and the usefulness of \n     corporate financial disclosure, to protect the objectivity \n     and independence of securities analysts, to improve \n     Securities and Exchange Commission resources and oversight, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Daschle (for Leahy) amendment No. 4174, to provide for \n     criminal prosecution of persons who alter or destroy evidence \n     in certain Federal investigations or defraud investors of \n     publicly traded securities.\n       Gramm (for McConnell) amendment No. 4175 (to amendment No. \n     4174), to provide for certification of financial reports by \n     labor organizations to improve quality and transparency in \n     financial reporting and independent audits and accounting \n     services for labor organizations.\n       Miller amendment 4176, to amend the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 to require the signing of corporate tax returns by \n     the chief executive officer of the corporation.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as \na cosponsor of the Leahy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I wanted to come out here on the floor \nand thank Senator Sarbanes for his leadership in putting together a \npiece of legislation that deals with structural reform of corporate \ngovernance and auditing independence.\n  I also think what the chairman didn't do is very important. Senator \nSarbanes didn't just call for a roundup of the usual suspects but for \nthe prosecution of the worst offenders who deliberately have enriched \nthemselves at the expense of the employees, investors, and creditors, \nand then try to claim that it is the end of the matter. This bill does \nhold bad actors accountable for their fraud and deception. And it is \nprobably going to be stronger by the time it leaves the Senate Chamber.\n  The legislation goes much further, and it should because the problem \ngoes\n\n[[Page S6525]]\n\nmuch deeper. We are faced with much more than just the wrongdoing of \nindividual executives. We are faced with a crisis in confidence in \nAmerica's capital markets and in American business.\n  These corporate insider scandals are threatening the economic \nsecurity of families all across Minnesota, North Dakota, New Jersey, \nMaryland, and all across the country. It is heartbreaking. You have \npeople who have taken their savings and put them into stock. This is \nwhat was going to be their resources to help send their kids to college \nor to meet other family needs. The value of that has eroded.\n  Other people have 401(k) plans and are counting on that for \nretirement security. The value of that has eroded.\n  But I think the other big issue is really important, which is above \nand beyond hundreds of billions of dollars wiped out. That is what has \nhappened already. You do not have investor confidence. Without investor \nconfidence, we will not have the economic recovery that we need. Jobs \naren't being created. Frankly, this affects all of us.\n\n  It is this last problem on which I want to focus. I see my colleague \nfrom New Jersey who knows much more about finance than I do.\n  There is a business cycle. Some years are good and some years are \nbad. Sometimes companies do well and sometimes companies don't do well. \nSometimes people invest more and sometimes they invest less. That is \nthe risk they take.\n  If the only problem was that executives at Enron were corrupt and \ntheir business failed--all of which is true--or WorldCom officers were \nfudging the books and the company really wasn't all that profitable--\nwhich is true--and that a lot of businesses, such as Global Crossing--\nwhat they were doing, to be blunt, was just fake--which is true--even \nwith all of that, I don't think we would be out here on the floor with \nthis legislation.\n  In other words, if the story was only that a bunch of companies did \nbadly, lost money, went bankrupt, and a whole lot of other people were \nhurt, frankly, I still don't think we would feel this sense of urgency. \nBut that is not the end of the story.\n  The reason we need this legislation goes way beyond Enron and \nWorldCom. It is not just because of Global Crossing. It is not just \nbecause of MicroStrategy. We need this legislation, and it ought not be \ncluttered with extraneous amendments, or with delay, because the \nAmerican investing public has lost its confidence in this corporate \nsystem.\n  I want to emphasize this point because I think some colleagues--some, \nnot all of my colleagues--on the other side of the aisle don't seem to \nget it. I hate to say it, but I don't think the President or the \nadministration gets what this is really about.\n  Again, the President yesterday basically focused on a handful of \ncorporate executives who deliberately misled investors. He talked about \na few bad apples. It goes much deeper than that.\n  Listen to the words of some other members of the administration, such \nas Donald Evans, Secretary of Commerce, who 2 days ago said:\n\n       The system has not failed us, but a few have failed the \n     system.\n\n  The President said the same thing yesterday.\n  Treasury Secretary O'Neil said last year that Enron's collapse was \n``capitalism working.'' Now, if these individuals didn't have \nsubstantial responsibility for the economy, then their comments would \nbe comical. I guess if we asked these guys about Watergate, they would \nsay it was just a burglary. But we are dealing with more structural and \ndeeper issues.\n  The crisis is a crisis in faith. Investors who thought that if a \ncorporation was doing badly and making poor decisions it would show up \non their financial reports now have found out that is not the case. By \nthe way, we should not be shocked by this. In fact, this should be old \nnews to us.\n  Almost 2 years ago, the then-Chairman of the SEC, Arthur Levitt, \napproached many of us--I remember the discussion with him in my \noffice--and he said: ``Paul, we are on the brink of a crisis in \naccounting.''\n  What Levitt was saying is, I want to put into effect a rule which is \nbasically going to say that the Andersens of this world cannot be \npulling in all these luxurious contracts and money for their internal \nauditing and all the rest, because once they get all the money, they \nare going to be reluctant to bite the hand that feeds them. Secondly, \nthey will be put in a position of auditing their own auditing. That is \na conflict of interest, and the consequences of it could be tragic for \na lot of innocent people.\n  Arthur Levitt was right. Of the decisions I have made in the Senate, \none of the best decisions I ever made was 2 years ago in writing a \nstrong letter of support for the then-Chair of the SEC for what he was \ntrying to do. The auditors haven't done a good job because they have \nbeen too close to the firms that they were supposed to be auditing. \nThat is what Arthur Levitt was talking about. He fought for greater \nauditor independence. His solution looked a lot like what is in this \nbill.\n  I am glad I supported his reform. That was a pretty lonely position \nback then for Chairman Levitt. I am glad the Sarbanes bill is going to \nget a lot more support. I believe it is going to pass overwhelmingly.\n  The Sarbanes bill does a number of different things. No. 1, at the \ncore of this crisis is the need to have auditor independence. That is \npart of what the Sarbanes bill is all about. One hundred years ago, we \nhad politicians and business leaders who were willing to take on \nentrenched corporate interests that were stifling competition--sound \nfamiliar--that were bilking customers and bilking consumers and that \nbasically were enslaving their workers. We are dealing with similar \nkinds of issues now.\n  We are now in a new century. This is going to be a real interesting \ncase study--I was a political science teacher--as to whether or not the \nSenate and the Congress and this administration will, in fact, be there \nfor strong reform.\n  The other part of this legislation which is also important is to hold \nthe corporate insiders accountable for their abusive actions. That is \nwhy I am so supportive of the Leahy amendment.\n\n  If you ask people in any coffee shop in Minnesota, should there be \ncriminal penalties for altering the documents, such as a 10-year \nfelony, they will say, absolutely. If you ask people in Minnesota, \nshould there be whistleblower protection for employees of public \ncompanies who actually blow the whistle on these kinds of abuses of \npower and corruption, people in Minnesota say, absolutely. If you ask, \nshould there be criminal penalties for securities fraud, create a new \n10-year felony for defrauding shareholders of a publicly traded \ncompany, people in Minnesota will answer, absolutely.\n  The President spoke yesterday, and the problem is, he did not call \nfor enough resources. He has a lot of tough rhetoric, but then when you \nlook at what is behind the rhetoric you don't see the resources the SEC \nneeds for the oversight. You don't see an oversight board that is set \nup, as the Sarbanes bill does, with authority and independence. Most \nimportantly, from the President we don't get any proposals that insist \non auditor independence.\n  If we have learned one thing, it is that Chairman Levitt was right. \nTwo years ago, Arthur Levitt tried to warn all of us. All of these big \ncompanies, accounting companies and all these other people who are tied \ninto this finance, some of the biggest investors, frankly, in politics \nin the country--I know of no other way to say it--all lobbied hard. \nArthur Levitt was clobbered by a whole bunch of people, but he was \nright. Now we have a chance to do the right thing.\n  If you were to go back over the last decade, we have passed too much \nlegislation that has taken away some of the individual investor rights, \nthat has made it harder for us to have Government oversight, that \nrefused to look at these blatant conflict of interest situations. As a \nresult of that, we have these corporate insider scandals.\n  I will say one more time, it is heartbreaking, hundreds of billions \nof dollars have been lost. It is heartbreaking to see what this has \ndone to people's savings who invested in stock. It is heartbreaking to \nsee what it has done to 401(k) plans, heartbreaking to see the ways in \nwhich families are terrified in Minnesota and around the country. Most \nfundamental of all is, we don't have investor confidence any longer.\n  I say to my colleague from Maryland, the best thing he did, above and \nbeyond\n\n[[Page S6526]]\n\nthis bill, is he didn't just say, let's go after a few bad apples. He \ndidn't just say that. That would be the end of it. He has dealt with \nthe underlying structural issues so we can prevent this from happening \nagain.\n  I am extremely proud to support this bill. I can think of some zinger \namendments. When I think of these guys who got the golden parachutes, I \nam amazed. Look at WorldCom.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will just finish one quick point.\n  With WorldCom, you are looking at a situation where at the very \ntime--the same old story--they are getting employees to do away with \ndefined benefit packages and then they put their employees in 401(k)s, \ncheerleading the 401(k)s, while they are doing that, they are dumping \ntheir stock. They got out with golden parachutes, all this money. It is \noutrageous what has happened at the individual abuse level.\n  It is much deeper than the wrongdoing of these individual corporate \nchieftains and governance. It gets to the structural issues. That is \nwhat is so important about this bill.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, I thank him for that \nobservation because he is absolutely on point. The bad apples ought to \nbe punished. There is no question about it. They ought to be punished \nseverely. But it is very clear, as this issue has unfolded, that we \nneed to make structural changes. We need to change the system so that \nthe so-called gatekeepers are doing the job they are supposed to be \ndoing. That has not been happening. That is why we need to remove these \nconflicts of interest on the part of auditors who are also consultants \nfor the same company, collecting huge fees. And they are supposed to \ncome in as outside auditors and be very tough on the company, which at \nthe same time is giving them large fees for consultancy.\n  The Senator is absolutely on point. We have to put in place a \nframework, a system which tightens up and begins to screen out these \nthings.\n  Furthermore, if you go after the bad apples, fine; but the damage has \nalready been done, as the Senator just observed, for instance, WorldCom \nand the collapse of the whole pension program and pension provisions.\n  Punishing a bad apple may have something of a deterrent effect, but \nthere is nothing like putting a system into place that gives a \nheightened assurance that you are going to be accountable. That is what \ninvestors are looking for.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. One more minute. What I said earlier, the problem with \nrounding up the usual suspects is quite often you then say that is the \nend of the matter. That is why the President's proposals yesterday come \nin for strong constructive criticism.\n  The story in the Post today in the business section is another \noutrageous example of what happened. WorldCom swallows MCI and tells \nthe MCI employees they don't have a defined benefit any longer and puts \nthem on the 401(k), cheerleads them on to put the investment into the \ncompany, cooks the books, and doesn't give them any accurate \ninformation on what happened to them. Now what happens to all these MCI \nemployees? They don't have any of the savings any longer.\n  So do you know what. We have to hold these people accountable, \nabsolutely, but at the same time don't let anybody--people in \nMinnesota--get away with saying it is a few bad apples and that is all \nwe are going to deal with. No. We are going to deal with the conflict \nof interest and we are going to have structural reforms. We are going \nto have oversight. We are going to protect consumers, the little \npeople, and give the business community more confidence so they do the \ninvesting in the economy. That is what is at stake with this \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nSenator McCain, who will speak later, Senator Corzine be recognized to \nspeak for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4175\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Kentucky is recognized for up to 30 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to take the opportunity now to \ndescribe in detail the amendment currently pending before us, that \nwhich I was unable to do yesterday.\n  There are two fundamental points to the amendment. What it seeks to \ndo is require independent audits of union funds which, of course, are \nraised from union members in the vast majority of our States. You don't \nhave a choice; you must belong to a union, and those dues are taken. So \nwe have mandatory auditing of those funds to ensure they are being \naccurately accounted for, civil penalties for violating those auditing \nrequirements, and, third--this is all the amendment is about, these \nthree points--the president and the secretary of the union must certify \nas to the accuracy of the audit.\n  We are talking about guaranteeing the integrity of the funds raised \nfrom union members. The reason we require corporations to file \nfinancial statements is so corporate shareholders know how their money \nis being spent. As a second layer of protection for shareholders, we \nalso require those financial statements to be independently audited. \nWhy? So investors know that information filed is actually correct, so \nthey know it is not just the creative writing of a crooked bookkeeper \nor a corrupt executive.\n  We take this independent audit requirement, or this second layer, \nvery seriously--so seriously, in fact, that we are creating a third \nlayer in the Sarbanes bill, an entirely new audit oversight board to \nbetter police these required audits for the benefit of corporate \nshareholders.\n  This third layer is a good idea, especially given today's stories of \ncorporate fraud, deception, and outright theft that we all cite as the \nreal motivation behind the underlying bill. My colleagues have cited \nthe well-publicized financial failures and the endless corporate \nscandals and the need to hold corporate crooks accountable. I could not \nagree more. But we also have union corruption, union greed, union \nscandals.\n  My amendment will give American workers the assurances that their \nlabor unions' books have been independently audited--the same second \nlayer of protection we have given to corporate shareholders since 1933.\n  Unions already have to file financial statements. They do so with the \nDepartment of Labor on a form called the LM-2. Why? For the same reason \ncorporations do: So American workers, the card-carrying, dues-paying \nunion workers can see where their money goes. But we don't currently \nrequire independent audits of union financial statements. Unlike the \ncorporate shareholder, the rank-and-file American worker has no earthly \nidea if the financial information they rely on is correct--no idea at \nall. So why shouldn't the American steelworker or longshoreman be \nentitled to the same assurances as the corporate shareholder who has \nrecklessly overinvested in a bundle of Internet stocks? Isn't the \nworkers' money just as hard earned and deserving of protection--maybe \neven more so?\n  I cannot imagine that anyone in this body would argue that American \nworkers do not suffer from the same type of greed and corruption that \nplagues our corporate and accounting culture, nor can I imagine that as \na result of these scandals anybody in this body believes that American \nworkers do not deserve the very same assurances that their unions' \nfinancial statements are correct.\n  But just in case, let me read for my colleagues a few recent accounts \nof union corruption. I am going to read quite a few, and I will do so \nfor a specific reason--so nobody can stand up and say that greed and \ncorruption only affects corporate shareholders, so no one can say the \nonly stories here are Enron and WorldCom, and so no one can stand up \nand say we are wasting time by trying to protect the American workers \nfrom being cheated out of their money.\n\n  We have all heard of Arthur Andersen, but has anybody heard of Thomas \nHavey? That is the accounting firm where a partner confessed last month \nto helping a bookkeeper conceal her embezzlement of hundreds of \nthousands of dollars from a worker training fund of the International \nAssociation of Iron Workers.\n  Yesterday, a colleague of mine said that the problem at Global \nCrossing\n\n[[Page S6527]]\n\nhad nothing to do with labor unions. Maybe he hasn't heard of ULLICO. \nThat is the multibillion-dollar insurance company owned primarily by \nunions and their members' pension funds that invested $7.6 million in \nGlobal Crossing. Apparently, ULLICO directors received a sweetheart \nstock investment deal that allowed them to make millions on the sale of \nthe stock. All the while, union pension funds, however, suffered the \nfate of Global Crossing.\n  There is plenty more, beginning with a couple of stories I briefly \nmentioned yesterday. An accountant with the National Association of \nLetter Carriers embezzled more than $3.2 million from union funds over \nan 8-year period to buy 8 cars, 2 boats, 3 jet skis, a riding mower, \nand 105 collectible dolls.\n  A former official of the Laborers' Union District Council in Oregon, \nIdaho, and Wyoming is in jail for accepting hundreds of thousands of \ndollars in kickbacks for directing money into a Ponzi-like investment \nscheme that defrauded Oregon labor unions of $355 million.\n  A former business manager and financial secretary of the \nInternational Association of Heat and Frost Insulators and Asbestos \nWorkers Local 87 was indicted by the U.S. attorney for the Western \nDistrict of Texas for embezzling tens of thousands of dollars in union \nfunds.\n  Mr. President, a comptroller of the American Federation of State, \nCounty and Municipal Employees, Council 71 of New Jersey, was sentenced \nto 13 months in prison and fined for embezzling tens of thousands of \ndollars from the union.\n  A trustee of Glass, Molders, Pottery, Plastics & Allied Workers \nInternational Union Local 63B, headquartered in Minneapolis, was \ncharged with forgery and embezzlement in connection with the theft of \nthousands of dollars from the union.\n  Fourteen officers and members of Local 91 of the Laborers \nInternational Union in Niagara Falls were arrested on charges of labor \nracketeering, extortion, assault, vandalism, and bombing a dissenting \nunion member's home and stabbing a worker.\n  A former business manager of IBEW Local 16 in Evansville, IN, was \nindicted for diverting union dues checks to his personal bank account.\n  A Federal grand jury recently indicted an ex-business manager of the \nUnited Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters Local 15 in Minneapolis \nin connection with the theft of tens of thousands of dollars from the \nunion.\n  A former officer of United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1288, in \nFresno, CA, was sentenced to 18 months in prison for embezzling almost \n$300,000 from the union's credit union.\n  An ex-business manager and financial secretary of the United Union of \nRoofers, Waterproofers and Allied Workers Local 86, in Columbus, OH, \nwas sentenced to 21 months in prison for embezzling $130,000 from the \nunion to pay his gambling debts.\n  An ex-president of the American Postal Workers Union Local 1616, in \nRoanoke Rapids, NC, was indicted for embezzling thousands in union \nfunds and making false entries in union records.\n  Laborers International Union of North America Local 2, in Chicago, \nwhich recently came out of Federal trusteeship imposed because of its \nclose ties to organized crime, failed an oversight audit and is again \nhaving significant accounting and bookkeeping problems.\n  An ex-secretary-treasurer of the American Postal Workers Union Local \n761 in Las Vegas and ex-treasurer of the Postal Workers Nevada State \nAssociation pled guilty to embezzling $200,000 in union funds.\n  Two former officers of Steelworkers Local 9339 in Virginia and a \nformer administrator of the local union's disaster relief fund were \nindicted for conspiracy to embezzle union funds and make false \nrecordkeeping entries.\n  A grand jury is investigating claims that a local United Auto Workers \nUnion ended an 87-day strike against General Motors only after union \nofficials received phony overtime payments and jobs for their \nrelatives. Union members have also filed civil suits to recover over \nhalf a billion dollars--half a billion dollars--from alleged self-\ndealers.\n  My good friend, the senior Senator from Texas, always says you cannot \nargue about facts. Facts are a powerful thing. These are the cold hard \nfacts of union corruption. Just like Enron, just like WorldCom, just \nlike Global Crossing, these are the cold hard facts, and there are \nplenty more of these facts.\n  I have a stack of papers filled with what is called a union \ncorruption update. If you look at this stack, this is just for the year \n2002. This stack is just for the year 2002--this whole stack--and 2002 \nis only half over. It is compiled by the National Legal Policy Center. \nThe Department of Labor's Office of Labor Management Standards reports \n12 new indictments and 11 convictions of union fraud per month over the \nlast 4 years.\n  Let's go over that one more time. DOL's Office of Labor Management \nStandards reports 12 new indictments and 11 convictions of union fraud \nper month over the last 4 years. This is a serious problem, and the \nSenate should not let whatever allegiance some Members may have to the \nleaders of organized labor affect their concern about the workers \nthemselves, and that is what this amendment is about: Providing the \nsame protection for union members that we insist on providing for \ninvestors in corporations.\n  We have a choice before us. Who should bear the cost of union \ncorruption against the rank-and-file, dues-paying American workers? The \nunions, the perpetrators of much of this fraud, by bearing an \nincremental cost of an audit that will help prevent future workers from \nbeing cheated out of their money? Or the workers, whose money will \ncontinue to be embezzled, concealed? And if we do not provide them with \nminimal assurances of an independent audit, it will go on and on.\n  To me, this choice is identical--absolutely identical--to the choice \nin the Sarbanes bill. Who should bear the cost of the corporate and \naccounting corruption against shareholders, the corporations and \naccountants, obviously, through improved oversight, enforcement, and \ncorporate responsibility or the investing public whose stock holdings \nwill continue to be embezzled, concealed, if we do not provide them a \nnew accounting oversight board?\n  Choosing the unions over the workers in this case is no different \nthan siding with the accountants and corporate executives who quietly \noppose the Sarbanes bill.\n  Mr. President, about the complaints I have heard of the burdens and \ncosts associated with this bill. It would not surprise me if the \nleaders of organized labor have been on the phone calling particularly \nour Democratic colleagues over the last 24 hours concerned about the \nburdens and costs associated with this bill.\n\n  First of all, I find it absolutely astounding, given the \npervasiveness of union corruption, that some of our colleagues are \nworried about the incremental cost of stopping that corruption, the \ncost of giving union workers the same quality assurance answers that we \nare prepared to give corporate shareholders in the underlying bill.\n  I do not hear any complaints about the cost of a new accounting \noversight board or the cost of corporate responsibility or enhanced \ndisclosure requirements in the Sarbanes bill. Why not? Because the \naccountants and executives are the ones responsible for the fraud and \ndeception of investors. But for some reason, when it comes to unions, \nsome of our colleagues speak less about the cost to the workers being \nripped off and more about the burdens this amendment will place on \nunions whose officials are responsible for the greed and corruption \ndocumented in the binder I just held up a few minutes ago which \nrepresented only half of the year 2002.\n  We hear that unions are saddled with too many requirements on their \nfinancial statements. I am not concerned with the quantity of \ndisclosure requirements. I am only concerned about the quality of that \ndisclosure, specifically whether the information is accurate and \ncertified as such for the benefit of the dues-paying American union \nworkers.\n  We hear that we do not need audits. Some have said we do not need \naudits because the Department of Labor can conduct enforcement audits, \nif necessary. Well, let's play with that logic a little. If that is the \ncase, we do not need public corporations to be audited either. Let's \nget the SEC to conduct\n\n[[Page S6528]]\n\nenforcement audits. Could you imagine the uproar if someone suggested \nthat? And no one has.\n  Think about the message this would send to American workers that it \nis not worth requiring your union to assure you that your money is \ngoing where they say it is; just take a number and hope the Department \nconducts an audit of your union.\n  At any rate, the Department, as most Federal agencies, needs more \nmoney to conduct the few enforcement audits that they conduct. The \nDeputy Secretary of the Department of Labor testified recently that the \nnumber of departmental audits has fallen from 1,583 in 1984 to a mere \n238 last year, and the President has requested an additional $3.4 \nmillion and 40 new staff positions to combat union fraud.\n  We hear that audits will be too expensive. Here is an easy tip for \nunion officials to save money: Stop stealing it. That is a good way to \nsave money. My amendment only requires audits to any union that already \nbears the cost of filing financial disclosure statements. In other \nwords, this would apply only to unions that already have to file \nfinancial disclosure statements. That is unions with receipts topping \n$200,000 annually. It goes to my original point. If you have to file an \nannual report, it ought to be verified as accurate.\n  We hear that smaller unions will be hit hardest by having to conduct \nan audit. Well, there is no national one-rate plan for audits of which \nI am aware. As any professional service, the rates are proportional to \nthe size and scope of the client. Obviously, a union with $500,000 is \nnot going to pay in audit fees what a $60 million corporation pays for \nan audit.\n\n  Let me close this part of my remarks with a simple suggestion for my \ncolleagues who have been tricked into worrying about the cost this \namendment would impose on unions. Just imagine this: the cost to \nAmerican workers of not requiring audits. Let us think about the cost \nto American workers of not requiring audits: More embezzlement, more \ncrooked bookkeeping, more abuse and concealment of workers' hard-earned \nmoney.\n  We do not need more embezzlement, more crooked bookkeeping, and more \nconcealment of workers' hard-earned money. We have a choice. We can \nextend to American workers the same financial protection afforded \ncorporate shareholders, or we can extend to unions the ability to \ncontinue to pilfer and profit off the workers' money. That is the \nchoice.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has 8 minutes 30 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I know the Senator from Arizona has been waiting \npatiently. I would like to reserve my 8 minutes because I am not clear \nhow long this debate is going to go on. We do not have a time agreement \nyet for a vote. Is that correct? I guess I am asking my friend from \nMaryland what his plans are for the disposition of the McConnell \namendment.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, we have people lined up to \nspeak once the Senator has concluded, Senator McCain and then Senator \nCorzine. After that, I anticipate then dealing with the McConnell \namendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So is it the plan of the Senator from Maryland to have \na vote sometime in the next hour or so?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I would anticipate a vote in relation to the McConnell \namendment--well, we have 30 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Could we do this, then? I ask unanimous consent that I \nhave 2 minutes prior to the vote to sum up what I think this amendment \nis about.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I certainly think that could be done. I intend to speak \nto it for a few minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Therefore, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4174\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nArizona is recognized for up to 15 minutes.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, for the benefit of the managers, I do not \nintend to consume all 15 minutes.\n  I rise in strong support of the underlying Leahy amendment, and I \nhope we can dispose of that amendment within a reasonable length of \ntime and move on to other changes that need to be made to this very \nimportant legislation.\n  Our publicly owned companies are an essential component to the \neconomic health of our country. As we have seen over the past few \nmonths, the continued lapses of our corporate leaders, whether they are \nethical, criminal or just plain ignorant, have a significant, sometimes \ncrippling, effect on the welfare of our nation. We must make some \nfundamental changes in the current system of corporate oversight to \nprotect Americans from avarice, greed, ignorance and criminal behavior. \nNow is the time for Congress to restore investor confidence and take \nthe necessary action to protect the interests of the public \nshareholders and place those interests above the personal interests of \nthose entrusted with managing and advising those companies. The \ndeterioration of the checks and balances that safeguard the public \nagainst corporate abuses must be reversed.\n  We have to address the shortcomings in Federal law and send the \nmessage that prosecutors now have the tools to incarcerate persons who \ndefraud investors or alter or destroy evidence in certain Federal \ninvestigations. This amendment is a step in the right direction. It \ncreates two new criminal states that would clarify current criminal \nlaws relating to the destruction or fabrication of evidence and the \npreservation of financial and audit records. The Enron debacle clearly \nindicated that there were gaping holes in the current framework. There \nwill be a 10 year criminal penalty for the destruction or creation of \nevidence with the intent to obstruct a federal investigation. There \nwill be a new 5 year criminal penalty for the willful failure to \npreserve, for a minimum of five years, audit papers of companies that \nissue securities.\n  The amendment also provides for the review and enhancement of \ncriminal penalties in cases involving obstruction of justice and \nserious fraud cases. All of these actions are necessary to deter future \ncriminal action. Until somebody responsible goes to jail for a \nsignificant amount of time, I am not sure that these people are going \nto get the message. Defrauding the shareholder has to carry a \nmeaningful penalty. Corporate decision-makers can make millions, tens \nof millions, even hundreds of millions of dollars by cheating \ninvestors. A relatively small fine or short prison term is not a \ndeterrent; it's a slap on the wrist. The threat of real time in jail is \na deterrent that will make people pay attention.\n  This amendment also creates a new securities fraud offense. The \nprovision makes it easier, in a limited class of cases, to prove \nsecurities fraud. Currently prosecutors are forced to resort to a \npatchwork of technical offenses and regulations that criminalize \nparticular violations of securities law, or to treat the cases as \ngeneric mail or wire fraud that results in a five-year maximum penalty. \nThis new provision would criminalize any scheme or artifice to defraud \npersons in connection with securities of publicly traded companies or \nto obtain their money or property. This new ten-year felony is \ncomparable to existing bank and health care fraud statutes. To those \nwho would say that it's hard to define a scheme or artifice to defraud, \nI would say that full and honest disclosure of material dealings and \naccounting treatments is the best way for the officers who run \nAmerica's corporations to protect themselves and those who invest in \ntheir companies. There are plenty of felony laws on the books that \nprovide long prison terms for crimes that cause less damage than the \nlosses to shareholders in Enron or WorldCom.\n  It is important to emphasize that when criminal charges are pursued, \nit is not necessarily the firm that should be charged but the \nindividuals at the helm of the corporate ship who should be prosecuted. \nIf they are the ones making the decisions out of self-interest, they \nare the ones that should be held accountable. I also believe that we \nmust protect the ``corporate whistleblower'' from being punished for \nhaving the moral courage to break the corporate code of silence. This \namendment does that.\n  This amendment also extends the current statute of limitations for \nmatters concerning securities fraud, deceit or manipulation. The \ncurrent statute\n\n[[Page S6529]]\n\nof limitations for securities fraud cases is short given the complexity \nof many of these matters, and defrauded investors may be wrongly \nstopped short in their attempts to recoup their losses under current \nlaw. The existing statute of limitations for most securities fraud \ncases is one year after he fraud was discovered but no more than three \nyears from the date of the fraud regardless of when it was discovered. \nBecause this statute of limitations is so short, the worst offenders \nmay avoid accountability and be rewarded if they can successfully cover \nup their misconduct for merely three years. The more complex the case, \nthe easier it will be for these wrongdoers to get away with fraud. \nAccording to at least one state Attorney General, the current short \nstatute of limitations has forced some states to forgo claims against \nEnron based on alleged securities fraud in 1997 and 1998.\n  This situation essentially encourages offenders to attempt to cover \nup their misdeeds however they can, including by using questionable \naccounting procedures and financial shell games. Furthermore, in some \ncases, the facts of a case simply do not come to light until years \nafter the fraud. If a person does not and cannot know they have been \ndefrauded, it is unfair to bar them from the courthouse. We need to \nrecognize the sophistication and complexity of modern-day schemes \ndesigned to defraud investors. The Leahy amendment does this.\n  Finally, this provision amends the federal bankruptcy code to prevent \nthe corporate wrongdoer, the CEO or CFO, from sheltering their assets \nunder the umbrella of bankruptcy and protecting them from judgments and \nsettlements arising from federal and state securities law violations. \nToo many of these highly paid corporate officers are using bankruptcy \nlaws to protect their assets while maintaining their high-rise \npenthouses and ski chalets. It is time to force accountability and \npunish the person, not the institution, who is not willing to abide by \nthe moral and legal codes that accompany leadership and public trust.\n  I hope we will have an early and overwhelming vote in favor of the \nLeahy amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, so Members may have a sense of what the \nprogram is in the short term, I will propound a unanimous consent \nrequest and I hope it will be accepted and then we can move forward.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following Senator Corzine, there be 15 \nminutes allotted to Senator Gramm, 5 minutes allotted to Senator \nMcConnell, 10 minutes to myself as the manager of the bill--or up to \nthese amounts of time; hopefully, they won't all be used--and at the \nconclusion thereof, there be a vote on or in relation to the McConnell \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from New Jersey is recognized \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today I rise to speak on both the \namendment proposed by Senator Leahy and also to the underlying bill \nwhich I feel quite strongly about.\n  I am quite pleased to support Senator Leahy's amendment. It creates \ntough new securities fraud penalties and punishes corporate wrongdoers \nwe have just heard the Senator from Arizona speak to. It is a \nmeaningful and appropriate response to the kind of corruption we have \nseen and makes sure that punishment meets the nature of the act. It \nalso protects corporate whistleblowers, prohibits corporate executives \nwho violate securities laws from hiding behind the bankruptcy code.\n  In summary, this is more than mere lip service with regard to \nenforcement and punishment of corporate fraud. It is real reform. It is \nreal response as a methodology to deter criminal conduct. It will go a \nlong way toward providing incentives that are necessary to protect \ninvestors and pensioners and others who operate in the marketplace, in \ncontrast to strong rhetoric from some with regard to what we need to do \nabout punishment but not putting reality into place to deal with the \nissues. I am proud to cosponsor the Leahy amendment, and I urge all \ncolleagues to do so as well.\n  Mr. President, we need to speak clearly and directly in the Senate \nabout restoring and sustaining the trust in America's capital markets, \ntrust in America's economic security going forward. For several days \nleading up to yesterday morning's Presidential speech on Wall Street, \nthere was a buzz of anticipation that we would see a real embracing of \nchange. Some went so far as to suggest the President's speech might \nlead to a Roosevelt moment, an embrace, a change in policy, a change in \ndirection, maybe counterintuitive to the history of the man because it \nwas in the Nation's best interests.\n  In retrospect, it is safe to say, while the President's speech was \ngood with respect to rhetoric, it was hardly Rooseveltian or a Ruthian \nmoment in the home of the New York Yankees. Unfortunately, it was far \nfrom a home run, in my view, and did emphasize rhetoric as a substitute \nfor reform. Its lack of specifics or detail I found unfortunate.\n  It is not to say that the President's speech did not include some \nimportant themes, or, by the way, embrace an initiative that is quite \nimportant; that is, the corporate fraud task force in the Justice \nDepartment which will be a strong step in carrying out pursuit of \nwrongdoers.\n  However, stating the commitment of his administration pursuing these \nfolks, while an important message, needs to be more substantive. We \nneed specific undertakings to protect investors and shareholders. It \nwas what the President did not say in terms of offering specifics, \nparticularly specifics with regard to structural changes that will \nsolve the problems, deal with the problems, provide checks and balances \nto the problems that we have seen from the Enrons, WorldComs, Global \nCrossings, et cetera. That is why the speech fell short of what many \nexpected.\n  The best way, in my view, the President could have accomplished that \nsimple important message would have been to acknowledge the \ncomprehensive structural reform that needs to be put in place and is \nexpressed most clearly, most effectively, by the legislation we are \nconsidering on this floor right now, the Public Company Accounting \nReform and Investor Protection Act.\n  The Sarbanes bill, the bill we are talking about on this floor, \ncomprehensively reforms our accounting profession. It is detailed, it \nis specific, and it is quite a strong element with regard to accounting \nprofessionals' responsibilities. It enhances corporate accountability, \nimproves transparency of corporate financial statements, truly \nstrengthens the ability of the SEC to operate as an enforcement agency, \nand as a regulatory agency to a significant degree. In combination, all \nthose factors together will go a long way to restore investor \nconfidence in American capital markets and, more importantly, restore \nfaith in our economic system.\n\n  I think this is the direction it should take. But before I discuss \nthe merits of the legislation in specific, I take a moment to pay \ntribute to the leadership of the distinguished chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, Senator Sarbanes. In shepherding this bipartisan legislation \nto the floor of the Senate, he has really done an outstanding job of \nbringing together a lot of disparate views on a very difficult and \ncomplex problem, synthesized into a terrific response to a real \nproblem.\n  I see Senator Enzi in the Chamber. I also congratulate him for his \nhelp in making sure we have a bipartisan effort in this process. His \ncontributions have been enormous. There are a number of people on staff \nwho I think have done a terrific job to make sure this happens.\n  But Paul Sarbanes, chairman of the Banking Committee, has done an \nincredible job, a thorough job, making sure we have measured, balanced, \ndeliberate steps to be taken to meet a crisis of confidence. I think \nthe American people will be grateful that we have responded in a proper \nway. It has been a privilege for me to work with all my colleagues in \nthe Banking Committee, but particularly the chairman. Particularly as a \nfreshman, I learned so much of how this legislative process works.\n  I must say, after 30 years in business, working my way up, the 10 \ndays of hearings we had with respect to this particular subject, with \nexhaustive testimony, thoughtful testimony provided from a large range \nof perspectives, was\n\n[[Page S6530]]\n\none of the best graduate seminars I have ever had in business. I hope \nactually somebody will take the time to try to publish these, and they \nwill be used as an example both of how the legislative process should \nwork but also how the structure and nature of public policy debates \nwith regard to business policy will occur. It is extraordinary. I think \nit forms an enormously positive foundation for the kind of thoughtful \nlegislation the chairman has brought to bear.\n  With that as backdrop, we all know that there are serious problems in \nour system. The list of companies involved is way too long and way too \nimportant--many of them supposed models of the new economy. But I want \nto move a little bit away from just some of the simple concepts we talk \nabout, the most headlined, the name concepts or companies, to focus on \nthe fact that we are going to have almost 300 restatements of earnings \nthis year, this year in our economy--300 restatements. There have been \nalmost 1,100 restatements since 1997 of company earnings reports. This \nis a problem.\n  It is not just the individual headline companies, it is the fact that \nthis is going on every day in our marketplace. It is no wonder that \ninvestors--institutional, retail, foreign, pensioners--do not have a \nsense of where we should be or how they should make their commitments \nto markets. That is because they cannot trust the numbers. There have \nbeen broken retirement dreams, lost jobs, and companies shut down. This \nreally needs to change.\n  Roughly 10 percent of major companies--of the 12,000 actively traded \ncompanies, almost 10 percent of them have had statements of change in \nthe last 4 years. That is just bad. That is why investors worldwide \nhave developed some skepticism about our markets. Some might even say \nthat is why our dollar has depreciated as sharply as it has in the last \n2 or 3 months. Confidence is shaken--it is real.\n\n  American financial markets have been a tremendous engine for economic \ngrowth. We have had a highly efficient capital market, and that has \nfueled our economy. We need to act.\n  While the depth and breadth of efficiency of our markets is still \nsubstantial, if we continue to have this kind of erosion of confidence, \nwe are going to be missing one of the important drivers of America's \ngreat success in leadership in the world. While I will not go through \nevery detail of this bill, if we do not come up with a strong oversight \nof our accounting industry, make sure the information that people make \ntheir decisions and take their decisions to the marketplace with is \nsound and secure, then we will not have those strong capital markets \nand strong economy. I think we can all agree upon that, in the nature \nof a bipartisan initiative, to make sure we are moving in the right \ndirection.\n  I hope we can focus on the reality that some of the conflicts of \ninterest that exist in our practices in the accounting world have been \npart of the cause and the focus. Some of the conflicts of interest in \nthe investment banking business, the world I came from, with regard to \nour analysts, have undermined our security with regard to how people \nanalyze and understand where companies fit.\n  Other issues that need to be dealt with are the ``revolving doors''--\nexecutives from accounting firms going to companies they worked for--\nand the lack of independence of audit committees. All of these factors \nunderlie a growing public distrust in the corporate financial \ninformation. It really needs to be acted upon.\n  While these things are real, I think we need structural response. We \ncannot just identify a few bad apples. This is more than that. \nRemember: 1,100 corporate restatements in the last 4 years. There is a \nstructural problem, a systemic problem that is undermining the health \nsecurity of our economy. I hope people will realize that in the context \nof the kind of debates we are going to have with regard to this bill--\nbut maybe even more important, when we get into a conference and try to \nput it together with the House response, and get it to the President.\n  Unfortunately, I think the other elements of proposals on the table \njust do not meet the kind of standards that the Sarbanes proposal, the \nBanking Committee proposal, brings to bear. I hope we will be able to \ndeal with that going forward.\n  I would be happy to talk about the specifics as we go forward. I know \nothers need to get into this aspect. Other than we need to have a real \nreform of the accounting industry, we need a strong oversight board. We \nneed to really deal with the corporate accountability issues, which I \nthink the Leahy amendment goes a long way to strengthen in this bill. \nThere are many elements inside it.\n  We need to give the SEC the kinds of resources so it can actually do \nthe job it is expected to do. The President talked about giving them \n$100 million additional resources. Even the House has talked about $300 \nmillion increments. We do not provide for pay parity. There are just so \nmany weaknesses in some of the proposals that are watered down relative \nto what we have on the table before the Senate.\n  I can only say I hope we can keep this bipartisan effort together \nbecause I think what we need is a final product that will deal with the \nreality of the undermining of confidence we have across the board, in a \nwhole host of ways with regard to our financial markets, with regard to \nour accounting statements and with regard to the economy itself. This \nis too important to make a political issue. This is one to make sure we \nmove forward in a way that we secure America's economic future.\n\n  The continued vitality of America's markets is at stake. We need to \nmake this a priority. We need to move quickly. We need to understand it \nis systemic, it is not just anecdotal, it is not just a few bad apples. \nI think the bill we have on this floor will go a long way. Some of the \namendments that are brought forward can strengthen it.\n  We need real reform. We need it now. We do not need rhetoric. We need \nto be able to restore the confidence the American people want to see, \nmove away from the era of Enron and WorldCom, and get to an era where \nwe have markets that are balanced and fair, where they have the checks \nand balances in them to give people the confidence that when they make \nan investment, that investment is what they thought it was when they \nentered into it.\n  I thank the chairman for an extraordinary effort in bringing together \nan exceptional bill. I am proud to be part of this effort. I look \nforward to continued debate and hopefully bringing it to the \nPresident's desk as soon as possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 30 \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I thank the able Senator for his very \nkind comments.\n  I underscore, as I said last night on the floor when Senator Dodd was \nhere, my deep appreciation for the very positive and constructive \ncontribution which Senator Dodd and Senator Corzine have made to this \nlegislation. Early on, they introduced S. 2004, the Dodd-Corzine bill \nthat formed the basis of a great deal of what is now before the Senate. \nI really appreciate the tremendous effort on the part of the two \nSenators.\n  I think it is very important that I make it very clear how much I \nappreciate the Senator's continuing, very strong contributions in the \ncommittee and now as we consider this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I think under the agreement there are 15 \nminutes allotted to Senator Gramm, 5 minutes to Senator McConnell, and \nI have reserved 10 minutes before we go to a vote on or in relation to \nthe McConnell amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 30 \nseconds without taking the time reserved for my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nArizona, Mr. McCain, for his kind words earlier this morning. He is the \nsupporter of the Leahy-McCain-Daschle, et al, amendment pending before \nthe\n\n[[Page S6531]]\n\nbody. I will speak further at an appropriate time when I am not \nimposing on the time reserved by our colleagues. I wanted to thank \nSenator McCain for his support of the amendment and for his kind \nremarks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Texas is on \nthe way. He is not here yet, so I will go ahead with my closing \nremarks.\n  Let me describe again what the McConnell amendment does. It is really \nquite simple. I think the first thing to remember is that it doesn't \nchange in any way the Leahy proposal. It doesn't change in any way the \nSarbanes proposal. It does not alter either of those. This is an \naddition to the underlying Sarbanes bill, and to the Leahy amendment, \nwhich I assume is going to be adopted sometime today. This doesn't in \nany way detract from the efforts underway to get greater accountability \nin corporate America.\n  The McConnell amendment is about adding to that union accountability \nso that rank-and-file union members can be assured--just as \nshareholders will now be assured in the underlying bill--that \nindependent audits are being done. They can be assured that there will \nbe civil penalties for violating these new auditing standards. They \nwill be further assured by the fact that the president and the \nsecretary-treasurers of the unions will have to certify as to the \naccuracy of the financial reports for unions just as we are requiring \nthat for corporate CEOs and CFOs for publicly traded corporations.\n  We are simply completing the circle of protection for Americans, \nwhether they be investors in corporations or union members whose dues \nare being paid every payday and who have a right to expect that those \nfunds are going to be treated carefully and correctly.\n  It has been suggested--I expect it will be suggested again--that this \nis going to be expensive for the unions. My amendment has been \ncarefully crafted to ensure that it does not impose any egregious new \ncosts, especially on labor. And it only applies to unions with annual \nreceipts over $200,000.\n  Why did I pick that number for unions that already file financial \ninformation with the Department of Labor? They are already having to \nfile. This amendment simply requires that labor organizations with over \n$200,000 in annual receipts incur the incremental costs of running \ntheir financial statement and pass an independent audit, and abide by \ngenerally accepted accounting principles. This is a cost borne by any \npublic company with as little as $1 million in total assets.\n  The additional costs here only apply to the larger unions that \nalready have to file with the Department of Labor in any event.\n  I want to say again that this is the union corruption update. This \nmassive stack is just for the first half of 2002. There are numerous \nexamples of the problems about which I have been talking. This stack \nhere represents just the first half of 2002.\n  Some will suggest that the examples I have given show how well DOL is \ncatching and prosecuting union fraud. Unfortunately, that is not the \ncase. The Department of Labor auditing of unions accounts for just 9 \npercent of all embezzlement cases. The other 91 percent of embezzlement \ncomes from other sources. Without a required audit, union officials do \nnot have to contend with the threat of an annual independent audit \nhanging over their heads.\n  The stories speak for themselves. Union corruption is rampant. It is \nabsolutely rampant on the local, national, and pension fund levels all \nacross our country. In the last 2 years, there has been a union \nembezzlement or closely related case in 40 out of our 50 States. This \nis a huge problem.\n\n  With regard to the financial information already required to be \nfiled, it is not verified by an independent auditor. The current union \nfilings are not verified by an independent auditor. The independent \naudits required in the McConnell amendment will help verify that the \ninformation is indeed accurate. Unions in many instances have not been \ncomplying with the filing requirement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent for a couple of more minutes \nof Senator Gramm's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Unions have not been complying with the filing \nrequirements. Up to 40 percent of unions required to file LM-2 reports \nfiled late or not at all. The Department of Labor, under current law, \ncan't even fine these organizations for noncompliance. My amendment \nwould at least give them the ability to fine these organizations for \nnoncompliance.\n  Let me summarize what this is about. We have decided in the Sarbanes \nbill and in the Leahy amendment that we want accountability in \ncorporate America. We want to hold the CEOs and the CFOs responsible. \nWe want the auditing done accurately. If it is not done accurately, \nsomebody needs to be held responsible.\n  Why are we doing that? We are doing that because we want to reassure \nthe shareholders that somebody is not cooking the books, that we don't \nhave more WorldComs and Enrons and Global Crossings and the like.\n  The McConnell amendment seeks to provide those very same protections \nto rank-and-file citizens who may or may not be big enough to invest in \nthe market. But they are investing their dues every week in the \nmajority of our States where they do not have a choice to not pay their \ndues. And they have every right to expect independent audits of their \nfunds to make sure they are not being stolen and not being misused. \nThey have every right to expect the presidents of those unions and the \nsecretary-treasurers of those unions to certify as to the accuracy of \nthose audits.\n  That is what this amendment is about. It is about providing the same \nfairness to the union member as we provide to the shareholder. Simple \njustice. I urge that the McConnell amendment be adopted.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirteen minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, first, I thank Senator McConnell. I do not \nthink anybody who listened to Senator McConnell is going to believe the \nassertion that somehow this amendment has nothing to do with the logic \nof this bill. You can take a view that business is for real and that \nstandards should apply there, but organized labor is a different kind \nof institution and they should not apply there; but if you are making \nthat argument, you have to argue it on the basis of politics. You \ncannot argue it on the basis of logic. You cannot argue it on the basis \nof justice or fairness.\n  What Senator McConnell has done, it seems to me--and I think it is a \nservice to the process that he has done it--is that his amendment in no \nway changes Senator Leahy's amendment. So whether you are for or \nagainst the Leahy amendment is not a relevant factor in whether you are \nfor or against Senator McConnell's amendment because he does not change \nthe Leahy amendment. He simply says, at that moment in history where we \nare trying to enhance the quality of financial reporting in corporate \nAmerica, to protect the investor and to strengthen the economy, that we \nshould make the same changes with regard to financial reporting by \nlabor unions.\n  There have been several arguments made against this amendment, but I \ndo not believe any of them hold water, at least in terms of my ability \nto understand the amendment and the arguments.\n  The first argument that has been made is: There are already \nrequirements that apply to unions, that they have this vast array of \nreporting requirements.\n  The same thing is true with corporate America. If you accept that \nargument that there already is a body of law, and if that means that it \nshould not be improved or strengthened, then what are we doing here?\n  There are differences over this bill, differences about how the board \nshould be structured, differences about what the board should decide \nand what Congress should decide, but there is no difference over the \nissue that we need\n\n[[Page S6532]]\n\nhigher standards in accounting. There is no difference over the issue \nthat people who knowingly violate the law ought to be held accountable.\n  So to say that unions are subject to requirements is not an argument \nthat we should not have better requirements, because if it were an \nargument, that would be an argument against the bill; and not one \nMember of the Senate has bought that argument or made it or believes \nit.\n  The fact that there are requirements today does not mean, in a time \nwhen we are enhancing transparency and efficiency and honesty in \nreporting, that we should not improve it for both corporate America and \nfor organized labor.\n  The second argument that is made is: Companies are public and unions \nare private. Not only is that argument invalid, but unions are more \npublic than private investments, more public than public companies. \nNobody made anybody invest in WorldCom. Nobody made them do that. But \nin some 40 States of the Union you have to pay union dues in order to \nwork.\n  I do not think that is right. I think that is fundamentally wrong. I \nthank God every day that in Texas we have right-to-work laws that say I \ndo not have to join a union to earn a livelihood. But in some 40 States \nyou do.\n  I think the case is even stronger than the Senator from Kentucky made \nbecause nobody made anybody buy WorldCom, but in some 40 States you \nhave to pay union dues. Surely, there is a public interest, in a \nmandatory institution, in seeing that it keeps straight books.\n\n  So this argument that we are talking about, public companies and \nprivate unions, what is private about a union that I have to join in \norder to have a job? Nothing is private about that union. It is as \npublic as something can be public.\n  It seems to me--and Senator McConnell made the point--nobody made \npeople invest in WorldCom, but people are forced every day to pay union \ndues. Every day they are forced to pay them. So they are as public as \npublic companies are, I would argue more public, and we have a stronger \ninterest in protecting that money which was involuntarily taken, it \nseems to me, or just as strong an interest in protecting that money \nthat was involuntarily taken versus money that was voluntarily \ninvested.\n  The strongest argument of this amendment--and something that is \nabsolutely breathtaking to me--is that the annual report that is \nrequired of unions does not have to be certified and prepared by a CPA.\n  We are going to great lengths in every bill that has been proposed to \nset up an independent body to proctor high standards in accounting for \nCPAs. Shouldn't a union that is handling my money that they took from \nme involuntarily have its books audited by a CPA?\n  Why is that important? In fact, why do we care about accounting \nethics? We care about them because there is no way the Government has \nenough resources to spot audit every company in America. So we have to \nrely on the integrity of the CPA. And it is the problem we have with \nthat today that brings us to the floor of the Senate.\n  While we are enhancing that integrity through this oversight board, \nshouldn't we require organized labor that is taking people's money \ninvoluntarily to have their annual report certified and prepared by a \ncertified public accountant? How can anybody--how can anybody--argue \nagainst requiring a CPA to do these audits?\n  You could say the Labor Department ought to go out and audit every \none of these unions. Clearly, they do not have the resources to do it. \nThe President has asked for more money to do it. I would guess this \nCongress will not provide that money. I will be watching the \nappropriations to see if they do. But even if they provide it, it is \nnot enough money to audit every union in America.\n  What we have to do to bring honesty to union financial reports, as we \nbring honesty to corporate reports, is to require a CPA to do the \naudit. I can see no logic whatsoever to opposing requiring a CPA to \ncertify.\n  Finally, we have gone to great lengths--and I think appropriately--to \nrequire the guy who is drawing the big check, the head man or head \nwoman, to sign this annual financial statement to put their credibility \non the line and give them nobody to hide behind. Should we not require \nthe president of the union sign this audited report? And shouldn't the \nannual report be done by a certified public accountant?\n  Now, it is astounding to me--and, boy, it shows you the different \nlevel of enforcement of the law. If anybody does not believe that \npolitics play a part in law enforcement in America, look at the fact \nthat was given to us by the Senator from Kentucky, that 34 percent of \nunions are out of compliance in terms of filing these reports. Some of \nthem just don't file the report.\n\n  It seems to me if 34 percent of the companies in America didn't file \nreports, we would be outraged, and rightly so. In fact, you couldn't \ntrade your stock on the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock \nExchange or the Nasdaq because of the enforcement that exists in \nprivate entities.\n  The McConnell requirement that the reports be filed is \nstraightforward and reasonable.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time by simply saying, what harm can \ncome from requiring unions to have CPAs do these reports? I see good \ncan come. I can see no possible harm that could come.\n  Secondly, why not have the union president certify the veracity of \nthat report just as the corporate president does? Some people say this \nis punitive. Some people say this is political. If this were being used \nto try to kill the Leahy amendment, you might be able to make that \nargument. But this amendment in no way takes away any part of the Leahy \namendment. It simply adds to it that the high standards we set for \ncorporate America should apply likewise to unions.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Could I ask what the time situation is?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. And how much time is left to the Senator from Texas?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has a minute and a \nhalf.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, it is important, in considering this \namendment, to realize there exists now, under the labor management \nreporting and disclosure procedure, extensive and intensive provisions \nfor reporting by labor organizations, officers, and employees of labor \norganizations.\n  If all of these provisions are not being carried out fully, the \nresponsibility rests with the Secretary of Labor. The Secretary of \nLabor ought to be doing her job. If the Congress is not providing \nsufficient resources for that, that is an issue for the Congress. We \nought to address that issue.\n  This supposed parallelism that is being argued completely misses the \nmark in the sense that there is already an existing statutory scheme \ncovering reporting and disclosure by labor organizations.\n  I want to go through some of those provisions so Members appreciate \nhow extensive they are and the amount of review and oversight that now \nexists.\n  I am now reading from the statute:\n\n       Every labor organization shall file annually with the \n     secretary a financial report signed by its president and \n     treasurer--\n\n  So much for this argument about they ought to sign, put their \nsignature on the report--\n\n     or corresponding principal officers containing the following \n     information in such detail as may be necessary accurately to \n     disclose its financial condition and operations for its \n     preceding fiscal year.\n\n  Listen to what they have to set out: Assets and liabilities at the \nbeginning and end of the fiscal year; receipts of any kind and the \nsources thereof; salaries, allowances, and other direct or indirect \ndisbursements, including reimbursed expenses to each officer and also \nto each employee who, during the fiscal year, received more than \n$10,000 in the aggregate from such labor organization and any other \nlabor organization.\n  Ten thousand dollars? Ken Lay of Enron got $177 million. Twenty \nexecutives of Enron got over $3 million in salary. Here we are talking \nabout a $10,000 figure which they have to report.\n  I am reading from the statute that governs labor organizations on \ntheir\n\n[[Page S6533]]\n\nreporting and disclosure: Direct and indirect loans made to any \nofficer, employee, or member which aggregated more than $250 during the \nfiscal year, together with a statement of the purpose, security, if \nany, and arrangement for repayment. A $250 loan, $250. Bernard Ebbers \nof WorldCom got a $366 million loan. This is just to underscore in a \nsense the tightness of this framework governing the labor \norganizations--a $250 loan. WorldCom executive Ebbers, $366 million? \nThe Adelphia situation with the Rigas family, $3 billion in loans.\n  Let's look at the power of the Secretary of Labor to enforce these \nrequirements: Any person who willfully violates this subchapter shall \nbe fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than 1 year. \nAny person who makes a false statement or representation of a material \nfact or who knowingly fails to disclose a material fact in any \ndocument, report required under the provisions of this subchapter shall \nbe fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than 1 year. \nAny person who makes a false entry or willfully conceals, withholds or \ndestroys books, records, reports shall be fined not more than $10,000 \nor imprisoned for not more than 1 year.\n  ``Personal responsibility of individuals required to sign report,'' I \nearlier said the president and the treasurer of the labor organization \nhad to sign the reports. Listen to this:\n\n       Each individual required to sign reports under sections 431 \n     and 433 of this title shall be personally responsible for the \n     filing of such reports and for any statement contained \n     therein which he knows to be false.\n\n  Of course, we have just noted from the previous provisions, that is a \nfine and possible imprisonment for up to 1 year. So we have a statutory \nscheme in place to control the labor organizations. If it is not fully \nadequate, it needs to be addressed in that context. But clearly, it \ngoes well beyond many of the provisions that apply to corporate \nofficers. It has been carefully worked out over the years. The Labor-\nManagement Reporting and Disclosure Act dates from 1959 originally, \nwith subsequent modifications and adjustments, as we have proceeded.\n  There is a system in place to govern labor organizations. It has been \nasserted: well, the Labor Department has not been able to do everything \nit needs to do. That burden is on the Labor Department. In a sense, \nwhat has been raised represents a challenge to the Secretary of Labor.\n  If, in fact, the Congress hasn't given her adequate resources, that \npoint needs to be made to the Congress and we need to address that.\n  But we have established a well-thought-out, comprehensive scheme with \nrespect to the reporting and disclosure of the labor organizations, and \nif they are falling short of the statutory requirements, that needs to \nbe addressed in the context of the statute.\n  The Labor Department has enormous authority over the labor \norganizations. Make no mistake about it, the powers and the authorities \nthat reside in the Secretary of Labor and the Department are quite \nextensive to deal with the labor organizations. I mentioned only some \nof them, including these imprisonment for 1-year provisions.\n  So I am in opposition to the amendment. I think any shortcomings that \none might perceive need to be addressed in the context of the reporting \nand disclosure provisions applicable to labor organizations; and I must \nsay to you--and the Senator from Kentucky has outlined some of the \nproblems--the Department needs to come to grips with them and come to \nthe Congress, if it deems that necessary, to seek an appropriate \ncongressional response in order to deal with them.\n  I very much hope my colleagues, when the time comes, will not be \nsupportive of this amendment. When all time is used, I am prepared to \nmake a motion with respect to the amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am voting against the McConnell \namendment because existing law already accomplishes what he seeks to \ndo. There exists now under the Labor Management Reporting and \nDisclosure Act of 1959 extensive and intensive provisions for reporting \nby the President and Treasurer of labor organizations.\n  Furthermore, the audit requirements of this amendment, which apply to \nunion filers with receipts of $200,000 or more, impose under regulation \nof small entities. Public corporations subject to the SEC typically \nhave many more assets with initial public offerings are customarily in \nthe range of $40 million. The annual costs of compliance might exceed \nthe annual receipts of many filers who would be subjected to these \nrequirements. To require audits of all unions regardless of size or \ncomplexity of financial reports would cause an unreasonable burden on \nmany smaller locals who already must file LM-2 reports. Unions with \nannual receipts of $200,000 or more covered by the McConnell amendment \ncome in an extremely wide range of types, sizes, and of performing \nservices. Of the more than 5,000 labor organizations that currently \nmeet this criterion and file LM-2 reports, only about 70 are national \nor international unions. The rest are locals--largely voluntary \norganizations, many with no or few full-time employees. The current \nDepartment of Labor reporting requirements take this ``no one-size-\nfits-all'' approach into account and build in some flexibility that the \nMcConnell amendment does not allow. For example, many smaller locals do \nnot need to retain outside CPAs because their financial statements are \nvery simple and consistent from year to year.\n  The amendment's certification requirements are also redundant. For \nmore than 40 years, union officers have been required to sign annual \nfinancial reports under penalty of perjury, attesting that the report's \ninformation accurately describes the union's financial condition and \noperations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me paraphrase our colleague from \nMaryland. The SEC already has power. Let them do their job. We are not \nsaying that. We are saying they need more power and they need help \ndoing their job because the job is not getting done.\n  The same is true for unions. The Senator from Maryland said there is \nalready a regulatory scheme. There is already a regulatory scheme for \ncorporate America, but we are saying it is not good enough, not tough \nenough, it is not working, and we need to improve it.\n  The same is true for unions. The president of a corporation already \nhas to sign an annual report. We are trying to expand that in this \nbill. Why not require the president--not other officers, but the \npresident--to sign the report? I submit that illegality, whether it is \n$100 million or $10,000, is still theft. The President has asked us to \nbar loans.\n  The issue here is, should we have the same integrity standards for \nunions? I believe the answer is yes.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has 17 seconds and the \nSenator from Maryland has 50 seconds.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is true that unions file a lot of \npapers. The problem is that accuracy is not required. This requires \ncertified records--certified by a CPA--and it requires the presidents \nand secretaries of their treasuries to certify that the records are \naccurate.\n  Union corruption is a serious problem. This will help correct it. I \nurge colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I only observe that if they file a false \nstatement of representation, they can be fined and sent to jail for up \nto 1 year. That is a pretty heavy remedy if you stop and think about \nit.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, is any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No time remains.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I move to table the McConnell amendment, \nand I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) and the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Voinovich), are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from North \nCarolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n\n[[Page S6534]]\n\n  The result was announced--yeas 55, nays 43, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 168 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--55\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith (OR)\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--43\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Helms\n     Voinovich\n       \n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. SARBANES.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                       Division of Amendment 4174\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask for a division of the amendment with \nsections 801, 802, and 803 in division 1, section 804 in division 2, \nand the remainder of the amendment in division 3.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The amendment is divisible and \nis so divided.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I would like to put forward a couple \nof inquiries. Could the Senator outline what his division of the \namendment does?\n  Mr. GRAMM. The amendment was divisible, and my division divided it \ninto three amendments. The amendment having to do with statute of \nlimitations in filing a lawsuit is now division 2. So division 1 would \nbe the pending business, as I understand it. Then division 2, and then \ndivision 3, seriatim, unless there was some other agreement that took \nus to another order or other amendments.\n  Mr. SARBANES. What does division 3 provide for?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I sent the division to the desk. Basically, division 1 was \neverything up to section 804. Then division 2 is 804. And then division \n3 is 805 through the end of the bill.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Did the Senator consider dividing it only for section \n804?\n  Mr. GRAMM. The way it was done, the easiest division was to do it in \nthree parts.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is that division you want a separate vote on, I take \nit?\n  Mr. GRAMM. It is that division on which I want an opportunity for the \nSenate to work its will, as well as the others.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, if the Senator will yield, there is \nanother way, of course, for the Senate to work its will. The reason I \nmention it, this is a critical part of the legislation. It is nice to \nsay, and we should say, my cosponsor of the Sarbanes bill, which I \nthink is superb--we should say we should have better accounting \nmethods, we should say we should have more accountability, but we have \na lot of these executives who have proven by their past behavior they \nare not going to do squat unless they think they are going to go to \njail for what they do.\n  The Leahy-McCain, et al, amendment makes it very clear that these \npeople are going to face jail terms if they loot the pension funds, if \nthey defraud their investors, if they defraud the people of their own \ncompany. And I might suggest if the Senator from Texas agrees, there \nought to be real penalties; let's vote on Leahy-McCain. Let's vote on \nit, not divide it up. If he believes there is something he may want to \ndo better--such as shield some of these people with a shorter statute \nof limitations or with a more restrictive statute of limitations--he \nhas every right to do whatever he wants to shield these people. But \nbring it up as a separate amendment and let the Senate vote up or down \non that.\n  When I look at places such as Washington State alone where the \npension funds of firefighters and police lost $50 million because of \nthe fraud of the leaders of Enron, I don't feel too sympathetic. We \nalready have a very short statute of limitations in here anyway. We \nought to at least have that so people might be able to recover some of \nthe money they have lost, if it is at all possible, instead of just a \nfew executives going up and building their $50 million mansions and \nhiding it there.\n  There ought to be some way for the people who lost their pensions, \nlost their live savings, to get it back. We ought to have criminal \npenalties for those who did this in the first place so they end up in \nthe slammer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, a wonderful speech, and it might be \nappropriate for another occasion, but what has happened is that a \ncomprehensive bill has been offered as an amendment to the pending \nbill. All I asked for, which every Senator has the right to ask for, \nwas a division of the question so that the Senate could work its will \non individual parts.\n  I know of no living person, at least anyone who is in the Senate or \nthe executive branch of Government--I don't know about the judicial \nbranch of Government--who is not for the provision related to putting \npeople in jail for knowing and willful behavior where they violate the \nlaw.\n  This bill which has been offered, however, has many different \nsections. The part I am concerned about has to do with statute of \nlimitations and the security reform legislation we adopted in 1995.\n  I remind my colleagues that in 1995 we had these massive strike \nlawsuits. One firm filed 80 percent of them. Almost all were settled \nout of court. It created an abuse that generated a bipartisan consensus \nthat something should be done about it.\n  We passed a law, and then, incredibly, with Democrat support, we \noverrode President Clinton's veto of the bill. The only veto override \nof the Clinton administration was on this issue.\n  One of the reforms had to do with shortening the statute of \nlimitations. I remind my colleagues, this has nothing to do with the \nSEC or the Justice Department. We are not shortening their statute of \nlimitations. In 1995, when we passed this bill with a strong bipartisan \nvote, we said: If I want to sue Senator Sarbanes, I have to file the \nsuit within a year of discovering that I believe I have been wronged, \nor I have to file it within 3 years of when I was wronged. That was the \ndecision we made then.\n  Now, hidden away in this bill, which has been offered as an \namendment, is a provision that effectively extends that to 5 years.\n  All my division of the amendment did was to say this ought to be \ndealt with separately so that those who are for mandatory prison \nsentences for knowing and willful behavior that violates the law can be \nfor that without being for repealing our Private Securities Litigation \nReform Act. The reason behind the rules of the Senate that give Members \nthe ability to divide bills goes to exactly the heart of this point; \nthat is, if someone could take a bill--if someone could take----\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me just finish my point and I will be happy to yield, \nas I try to always do.\n  Someone could take the securities bill of 1933 and they could put in \nit all kinds of things that the vast majority of Members of the Senate \nare for, and then they could put one little provision in one line in \nthat virtually nobody is for, and they could send it as an amendment to \nthe desk and then we would have no recourse except to vote\n\n[[Page S6535]]\n\nagainst all the things that we are for in order to vote against the one \nlittle thing that we are against.\n  It seems to me there is nothing worse in public life than to have \nsomeone attack you for voting against a great big old bill and say: \nWell, you were against. It says here motherhood and the flag and \nChristmas and Easter--you were against that because you voted against a \nbill that busted the budget and bankrupt the public.\n  So in writing the rules of the Senate, we wrote the rules in such a \nway that when someone offered such a bill as an amendment that had \ndifferent parts, any Member could ask for a division so it could be \ndealt with separately. All I have done is exercise that right.\n  We now have three amendments pending before the Senate--I guess four, \ncounting the Miller amendment--but that is all I have done. Two of \nthese amendments I am supportive of, one of them I am not supportive \nof, but that is where we are.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, let me say, first of all, the Senator \nis obviously within his rights to divide the amendment. The Senator \ncould have offered an amendment striking section 804, which is the \nsection to which he objects. As I understand it, he approves of the \nremainder of the bill. By dividing it, he gains a one-vote advantage \nbecause if he moved to strike and we had a tie vote, he would lose. By \ndividing the bill, if there is a tie vote on section 804 the proponents \nof that provision lose. So by the division the Senator from Texas has \ngained a one-vote step up. I recognize that. That is permitted under \nthe rules. I am not complaining about it.\n  I think it is inaccurate to use an example of the whole bill and say \nI either have to vote for all of the amendment or none of it because \ncertainly he hasn't been in that position.\n  He could have offered an amendment to strike the section--am I right; \n804 is the section on which the Senator is focused?\n  I make the following suggestion in order to try to move matters \nforward, if I could have the attention of my colleague.\n  Why don't we proceed and adopt the two divisions other than 804 right \nnow and get those taken care of. Then we can address 804, which is the \ndivision to which the Senator objects. We can have an appropriate \ndebate with respect to that division.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, we do have someone who wishes to speak. I \nam not sure whether it is on one of these sections or not. I am not \nready to do that right now. We may reach a point where I will be ready \nto do that, but I am not ready to do that at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, given that the Senator has indicated \nhe is supportive of the Leahy amendment--I think he said that on more \nthan one occasion--except for section 804, what is it that would have \nto transpire?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, if I might step in for just a moment, if \nthe Senator from Maryland will not mind?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I keep hearing this discussion by the senior Senator from \nTexas that my bill somehow changed the Securities Litigation Reform \nAct. It does not. It does not do that at all. It changes no provision \nin it at all.\n  The PSLRA did not establish the current statute of limitations. It \ndid not deal with that issue at all. The Leahy bill does not impact on \nthese provisions. It was a 5-to-4 Supreme Court case that overturned \nyears of established law to set the current limitation periods in Lampf \nv. Gilbertson.\n  In fact, interestingly enough, former Secretary General Kenneth Starr \nand I take the same position on these statutes of limitations. In the \ndissent in that case, two of the dissenters, Justices Kennedy and \nO'Connor, said the one in three statute of limitation makes the \npossibility of injured investors recovering basically a dead letter.\n  Here are some numbers. Florida lost $335 million because of Enron; \nthe University of California, $144 million--all the way down to \nVermont; we lost millions of dollars. These are people who would like, \nin these kinds of cases, at least to have a statute of limitations such \nthat we can go after them.\n  We are not suggesting changing in any way--I want everybody to be \nclear on this--we are not suggesting changing the basic standards of \nthe law on a statute of limitation. We are talking about extending the \ntime. We are talking about extending the time so it will not be, as the \nSupreme Court said, with a short statute of limitations, a dead letter. \nWe are saying we want enough of a statute of limitation--still very \nshort but a long enough one so people can recover. We are perfectly \nwilling to have exactly the same words as the law says now, with the \nexception the statute is slightly longer.\n  I cannot speak for an activist Supreme Court that seems to be \nmeddling in most of our laws, but their case law, their stare decisis \nimpacts on every single Federal court in this country--district level, \ncourt of appeals level. So there, with the exact same law, the stare \ndecisis is Lampf v. Gilbertson. That would be controlling except it \nwould be a longer statute of limitations.\n  The Senator from Texas, or anybody else, if they think that statute \nof limitations is too long, fine, vote against it. But I am here to try \nto protect people and give them an opportunity--when there has been \nsuch enormous fraud and all the pension funds have been lost, and all \nthe people who have lost their life savings--give them at least some \nchance to recover something, especially as the executives of these \ncompanies walk off with tens of millions of dollars. We go two-five \ninstead of one-three.\n  It makes sense to me. That was negotiated and voted on in the \nJudiciary Committee, and the final bill was passed unanimously.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I want to resume my discussion with \nthe Senator from Texas. I am not going to engage in a substantive \ndebate with respect to section 804 of the Leahy amendment, which is \ndivision 1 of the divisions the Senator has made.\n  I want to go back to the prospects of getting division 1 and division \n3 accepted, to which the Senator has repeatedly indicated he has no \nobjection. In fact, as I understand it, he is supportive of it.\n  I renew my inquiry as to whether we could move ahead and accomplish \nthat, since in our previous discussions the Senator has indicated \nconcurrence with the notion that we need to move this legislation \nalong. I don't understand what the objection would be to doing that. \nThe Senator has divided the amendments. He has improved his holding \nposition by doing so with respect to section 804. He has accomplished \nthat objective under the rules. But as I understood it, he does not \nobject to all of the matters in division 1 and division 3. I think it \nwould help move the work along if we could adopt those two divisions, \nand then we could address division 2.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, first of all, let me say as the ranking \nmember of the committee that I have yet to have an opportunity to offer \nan amendment. I only have two amendments I want to offer. No one is \nmore eager to get this bill to conference where we might come up with \nsomething for which there would be virtually unanimous support. But I \nassume at some point during the deliberations we will have votes on \ndivision 1 and division 3. But I would like to have an opportunity to \noffer amendments myself.\n  All I want to do is follow the rules of the Senate.\n  Let me say that I am concerned, as I listen to colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle, that we are going to have a literal blizzard of \namendments not directly related to this bill. I continue to believe \nthat at some point, in order to finish the bill, we are going to have \nto file cloture.\n  I intend, as I said at the beginning of the debate, to support that \ncloture motion. I think someone would have a hard time portraying me as \nsomeone who is slowing down the process when I am ready to vote to \nbring debate on this bill to an end and force amendments to be germane \nto the bill itself.\n  My proposal is that we simply go on with the business of the Senate. \nI am\n\n[[Page S6536]]\n\nready to offer an amendment. I am ready to deal with the amendment of \nthe Senator from Georgia. That amendment is amendable. All of these \namendments are amendable. I suggest we simply proceed, let Members be \nrecognized, and have those Members move forward.\n  In light of that, I send an amendment to the desk in the form of a \nsecond-degree amendment to division 1. It is a very short amendment. I \nthink the best thing to do is to have it read.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have spoken to the manager of the bill. \nHe has indicated he has no problem with someone speaking on the bill as \nlong as there is no effort to do anything in a parliamentary fashion \nbecause there are negotiations pending at the present time. We \nunderstand that. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Illinois \nbe recognized to speak for purposes of debate only.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Following his remarks, the quorum call will be \nreinstituted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague from Nevada as well as the Senator \nfrom Wyoming for allowing me to speak to the bill.\n  I am happy to be an original cosponsor of this amendment with \nSenators Leahy and Daschle. The Public Company Accounting Reform and \nInvestor Protection Act is a long title, but what it basically seeks to \ndo is to address what most Americans view as one of the most dangerous \ndevelopments in our Nation's economy in the last several years, if not \nlonger.\n  When you ask the average American what they think of all this \ncorporate corruption, all of the disclosures about corporations that \nhave literally lied to the public, to their shareholders, to their \nemployees, and to pensioners, people across America say it does not \ngive them much hope for recovery for our economy. It does not give them \nmuch confidence in terms of investing in the stock market. And it makes \nthem feel very sad and worried about their own pension and retirement.\n  We were proud to announce several years ago that almost half of \nAmericans owned stock. We had developed to that point where the average \nperson thought owning stock was a normal thing to do.\n  I grew up in a family with a mother and father who never once \npurchased a share of stock until my mother in her later years decided \n``to gamble,'' as she called it. But it was unthinkable in their \nworking years to buy stock. They were working people. They worked for a \nrailroad. Workers didn't buy stock.\n  That has changed. More and more people across America buy mutual \nfunds and stocks, 401(k)s, retirement plans. And why wouldn't they? \nLook at what happened over the last 10 years. If you were smart enough \nto buy yourself a dart board and put the Wall Street Journal up on it \nand throw the dart, just about any stock you hit was going to give you \nmore money.\n  People came to realize that. They bought their mutual funds and \nstocks and sat back and relaxed and said: This is easy. I will be able \nto retire a lot sooner than I ever dreamed, and we have more financial \nsecurity in our family than ever before.\n  Boy, have things changed in the last 2 or 3 years. We have seen a \nrecession, the economy slow down, and then we watch as day after \npainful day reports come of the Dow Jones and the Nasdaq, all the rest \nof them, hitting new lows every single day.\n  It has to do with the state of the economy, the recession, but it has \nto do as much with consumer confidence, the belief that you just can't \ntrust the corporate big boys.\n  There are too many instances where they decided to cash in with big \nstock options and walk away with millions--sometimes hundreds of \nmillions--of dollars and leave a floundering corporation. They call it \n``restatement.'' When I went to grade school, if I tried to tell the \nnuns I wanted to restate something I had said, I never got by with it. \nI got slapped on the back of the hand with a ruler. They knew it was an \nadmission that you lied, misrepresented something. Now that is \ncommonplace when you deal with corporations across America. Every week, \nthere is some new disclosure.\n  Senator Leahy, Senator Daschle, and I sat down to say we have to get \nto the heart of this issue and try to resolve it, in terms of making \ncertain there are penalties in place for those who are deceitful, \nmisleading, lying to the American people about the status of \ncorporations. From Wall Street to Main Street, confidence has been \nshaken. It started off with Enron, the poster child of runaway \ncorporate greed. Isn't it curious that today, as we debate corporate \ncorruption, and isn't it an oddity that there is an actress in \nHollywood who is facing possible jail time for shoplifting and she is \nfacing more time in jail than any officer of the Enron Corporation? \nWhat is wrong with this picture? Somebody who shoplifts might go to \njail, but not the first person has been indicted at Enron, the seventh \nlargest corporation in America, which goes bankrupt.\n  We had a series of hearings, and everybody on Capitol Hill was \nwringing their hands and calling in the cameras, saying we have to do \nsomething about it. Yet the Department of Justice has yet to indict the \nfirst person at Enron.\n  So what we are saying with this amendment is that we want to \nestablish standards and practices so that those who violate the law, \nwho are guilty of corporate corruption, will pay a price for it, not \njust a fine that may be ignored or paid off by the corporation but \nmore.\n  In our criminal code, we establish mandatory minimum sentences for \npeople who are caught with a thimbleful of cocaine. We will put them in \njail, and we won't give the judge any flexibility. They go to jail for \nx number of years, no ifs, ands, or buts. But if a person is engaged in \nripping off stockholders of a major corporation, lying about their \nbooks, causing tens of thousands of people to lose their jobs, \njeopardizing the retirement plans of millions of Americans, then, \nfrankly, we say to them that yours is going to be a much easier \npunishment.\n  What is wrong with this picture? Where are the scales of justice? We \nshould have known, when you have executives and board members who stand \nto gain millions of dollars from acting on insider information in the \ncorporations they serve, that many would be tempted to do exactly \nthat--especially when they knew there weren't any cops on the beat to \nkeep an eye on them--no auditors, accountants, or government agencies.\n  In the Gingrich revolution that occurred a few years ago, we passed \nsomething called the ``Contract on America.'' One of its provisions \nsaid, we are going to take away the power of individuals to sue \ncorporations when there has been securities fraud. The argument was \nmade that there were too many litigious people and greedy lawyers who \nwere meddling in the corporate business and that we had to really close \nthe door to that opportunity. Well, that law was enacted. I voted \nagainst it because it took away one more safeguard, one more protection \nfor the public.\n  Isn't it coincidental that now we stand here and talk about the \ndisintegration of corporate confidence? There were fewer people \nwatching then, and some of these corporate leaders were reaching into \nthe cookie jar and pulling out with both hands. It happened over and \nover again. We should have known that when you condition the salary of \nexecutives on potential gains from how the company's stock prices will \nrise--known as options--that would be a temptation to raise the stock \nprices artificially, especially when those on the inside knew that, as \nthe prices would fall, they would already have their money.\n\n  We should have known that when you have auditors and accountants \nshifting numbers to come up with the right set of bottom-line figures \nthey need to produce for Wall Street, they would be tempted to do that \neven when the audited numbers didn't add up. We should have known that \nwhen you have the smartest lawyers and bankers in the country scheming \nall night to come up\n\n[[Page S6537]]\n\nwith borderline legal ways to avoid paying taxes through a maze of \nfictitious straw companies, they would be tempted to do just that, \nespecially when they knew Congress wrote the laws with plenty of \nloopholes for which their lobbyists paid.\n  We stand in the Senate and reflect upon the sad state of business in \nAmerica, and we have to wonder who is really at fault.\n  Let me add that the vast majority of business leaders in America are \nhonest, hard-working people who have taken a risk in our free \nenterprise system to produce goods and services of value to our country \nand to the world, to create jobs and wealth. They deserve our \nadmiration and respect. But, clearly, day after day, week after week, \nmonth after month, we read on the front pages of our major newspapers \nabout the exceptions to what I just said.\n  Is it the executives who are responsible as the bad actors, or their \naccountants, their auditors, their bankers? The answer is all of the \nabove. Every one of these must face up to their responsibilities.\n  In due course, I hope we will enact stricter rules for these \ncorporate players. But we have to accept our responsibility; Government \nand Congress has a responsibility.\n  I salute Senator Sarbanes of Maryland for what he has done with \nSenator Enzi in bringing this bill to the floor. There is an effort to \ndivide up this bill in the hopes of changing a statute of limitations.\n  Why is a statute of limitations of importance in this debate? It \nreally defines the reach of the law. If you tell me there is a statute \nof limitations that limits the liability of these corporate bad actors, \nI can tell you some people are going to get off the hook. The Leahy \namendment to Senator Sarbanes' bill broadens the statute of limitations \nso that more wrongdoers will be held accountable; those who have lied, \ncheated, and stolen will be held accountable.\n  The opponents of this approach are now suggesting we need to shorten \nthe statute of limitations, limit the inquiry and investigation of the \nGovernment, and limit the liability of the bad actors. This is an \nanswer to the prayers of many corporate big wigs who have ripped off \ntheir stockholders, employees, and pensioners across America.\n  This suggestion that we would lessen and shorten the statute of \nlimitations is what they want to hear. Some will now be able to retire \nto their mansions, and they will be able to live in the lap of luxury \nwith the hundreds of millions of dollars they have taken from these \ncorporations and never be called to answer for their violations of the \nlaw. That is what happens when you shorten a statute of limitations. It \nis an answer to the prayer of the corporate big wigs' defense \nattorneys. Why in the world would we be doing that?\n\n  Why do we want to insulate from liability the very people who are \nguilty of wrongdoing? Why would we not support Senator Leahy's \namendment to say that those who have violated the public trust, those \nwho have lied, misled, and been deceitful should be held accountable \nboth on a criminal and civil standard?\n  So I certainly hope that at the end of this debate the Senate, on a \nbipartisan basis, will stand by Senator Sarbanes and his bill. I also \nhope that when it is all said and done, the underlying amendment I have \noffered with Senator Leahy and Senator Daschle will be accepted.\n  Let me tell you what the amendment does, in brief. It punishes \ncorporate criminals and creates a 10-year securities fraud felony for \nany ``scheme or artifice'' to defraud shareholders, and directs the \nU.S. Sentencing Commission to raise penalties in obstruction of justice \ncases.\n  Two, it preserves evidence of fraud, establishes a new felony for \ndestroying evidence when records are under subpoena. It requires key \nfinancial audit documents to be retained for 5 years, and it creates a \nnew 5-year felony for intentional destruction of documents.\n  Do you know what happened? As soon as Enron got in trouble, they \ncalled some of their buddies at Arthur Andersen, and the next thing you \nknow, the documents are being shredded, evidence is disappearing. This \nunderlying amendment, the Leahy-Daschle-Durbin amendment, addresses \nthat specifically.\n  The third thing is that it protects victims. It creates protections \nfor corporate whistleblowers. We need them. If insiders don't come \nforward, many times you don't know what is happening in large \ncorporations. It lengthens the statute of limitations to 5 years from \nthe date of fraud and 2 years from the date of discovery for victims to \nbring claims against the corporations. It prevents securities laws \nviolators from using bankruptcy to shield debts based on fraud \njudgments.\n  What they are trying to do--I see Senator Leahy in the Chamber; he is \nthe major sponsor of this amendment--is to gut the provision that \nextends the statute of limitations and say that these people will not \nhave to be held accountable for their wrongdoing.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to resist this effort. We have to \nhold these corporate wrongdoers accountable. We should not be party to \nany kind of effort to reduce their liability; otherwise, what message \nare we sending? Mandatory minimum sentences for a thimbleful of \ncocaine, but allowing those guilty of corporate wrongdoing to get off \nthe hook. What is wrong with this picture of justice?\n\n  I urge my colleagues to resist the change in the statute of \nlimitations, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, was I recognized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas was recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, let me answer what has just been said and \nstraighten out the facts. In 1995, we had a major problem in America in \nthat we had strike lawsuits being filed against high-tech industries \nwhere one firm filed 80 percent of the cases and settled almost all the \ncases out of court.\n  We had a bipartisan consensus that this represented abuse. So under \nthe leadership of Senator Dodd, Senator Domenici, and others, we passed \na bill which President Clinton vetoed. We then overrode the veto. An \nimportant part of that reform was to say--and let me make it clear, \nthis does not have anything to do with committing a crime where you can \nbe put in jail. It has nothing to do with the SEC's jurisdiction. It \nhas nothing to do with the Justice Department's jurisdiction. It simply \nhas to do with my right to file a lawsuit against you and anybody \nelse's right to file a lawsuit against anybody else.\n  We had a lot of reforms in that bill. You had to actually have a \nclient. The lawyer who was the lead lawyer in 80 percent of these cases \nsaid he loved these type lawsuits because he did not have to fool with \na client. In essence, he was suing on behalf of himself. Virtually a \nhuge percent of the money went to the lawyer filing the suit, not to \nthe people who supposedly had been harmed.\n  Part of the reform was to set a statute of limitation that if you \nbelieve I have done something wrong, and you want to sue me for it, you \nhave 1 year from the time you find it out, or 3 years from when it \nhappens to file a lawsuit.\n  When the Senator was talking about letting people off the hook, \nsurely everybody understands that our system has no ex post facto laws. \nSo if the provision raising that statute of limitation to 5 years \nbecame law, it would have no effect on anybody who has committed one of \nthese violations about which we are talking.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 4184 to Division 1 of Amendment No. 4174\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, having straightened that out, that is not \neven the subject about which we are talking. We now have three \namendments pending, and I send a second-degree amendment to the first \namendment and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  This is a very short amendment and I ask it be read because the \nlanguage of it is so clear that a lot of times we have an amendment, \nand what we say does not have much to do with the amendment. I want \npeople to read the language.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm], for himself and Mr. \n     Santorum, proposes an amendment numbered 4184 to division 1 \n     of amendment No. 4174:\n\n[[Page S6538]]\n\n(Purpose: To provide the Board with appropriate flexibility in applying \n          non-audit services restrictions to small businesses)\n\n       At the end of the division, insert the following new \n     section:\n\n     ``SEC.   .

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle], for Mr. Leahy, \n     for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Harkin, \n     Mr. Cleland, Mr. Levin, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Biden, Mr. Feingold, \n     Mr. Miller, Mr. Edwards, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Corzine, and Mr. \n     Kerry, proposes an amendment numbered 4185.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, first, let me say that we have had a very \nproductive period over the last several minutes, and I think we now are \nin a position to move to a vote on the Leahy amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a vote occur on the Leahy \namendment at 3:15 this afternoon, and that there be no amendments \noffered prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, first, let me say, I am pleased we have \nreached an agreement on the Leahy amendment. This is one of these \nlittle technical things that does not mean much to many people, and it \nis one where, in fact, there is a dispute, but we have reached an \nagreement that will allow the Leahy amendment to go forward with \ncertainty on our part that the 2-year statute of limitation is a real \nstatute of limitation, that we simply change the number and that in the \nprocess, by the way we do it, we do not do anything that would \nchallenge the current court ruling.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time from \nnow until 3:15 be divided equally between the two managers of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for helping us \nwork this out. I think this will give us the ability now to move \nforward. As part of this agreement, we will have cloture filed on the \nbill. While that cloture is ripening, we will continue to consider \namendments.\n  I think this agreement guarantees we will have an opportunity, if not \nto finish the bill this week, the opportunity to assure that it would \nbe finished early next week.\n  Let me also say, for the record, I would not object to a unanimous \nconsent request to have the cloture vote today or tomorrow. From my \npoint of view, we do not need to wait until Friday to have the cloture \nvote. I would be willing to ask unanimous consent that it be moved up, \nif that were appropriate. I think that is up to the majority leader, \nobviously. But from my point of view, we are ready to move and head to \nconference with this bill.\n  This one small part of the Leahy amendment I do not think is prudent \npolicy, but there is greater certainty about what it means in terms of \nthe statute of limitations. So I am more satisfied at least in terms of \ncertainty.\n  I thank Senator Leahy for working this out. There is no doubt about \nthe fact that he had the votes if we could have brought it all to a \nvote, but I think what we are doing, by working out this simple \ncompromise, is guaranteeing that we are going to pass this bill in \nshort order.\n  I am hopeful in conference we will be able to bring in the changes \nthe President has proposed. I understand the Republican leader will \noffer them as an amendment. I will support them. I hope they are \nadopted unanimously.\n  But in any case, I think this agreement paves the way to guarantee we \nwill pass this bill, hopefully, this week if not early next week.\n  Let me say to my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle, I \nintend to vote for cloture. I think this is an important piece of \nlegislation. I would do important parts of it differently than Senator \nSarbanes, but he is chairman and I am ranking member; and we have been \nin the different positions. There is a difference between the two, but \nwe cannot get a bill which I want unless we go to conference.\n  The House bill is very different. I think we have an opportunity to \nwork out a compromise, just as we did on financial services \nmodernization. Senator Sarbanes opposed it when we dealt with it on the \nfloor of the Senate, but by the time we came back from conference, we \ngot 90 votes. My guess is, we will do as well or better on this bill \nafter going to conference.\n  So I think we have taken a major step toward moving on. I think it is \nimportant. I think the American people want this bill passed. If we \nwere willing to move up the cloture vote, which I am willing to do, we \ncould pass\n\n[[Page S6539]]\n\nit this week. If not, we will pass it next week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, would the distinguished senior Senator from \nMaryland yield me, say, 5 minutes?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Would the Senator mind if I made a very short \nstatement?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would be delighted if the distinguished chairman did.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise to commend the distinguished \nSenator from Vermont for the excellent work that he and the Committee \non the Judiciary did with respect to the amendment that is now pending \nat the desk.\n  This amendment will create tough new penalties to punish corporate \nfraud. It has very important provisions to protect corporate \nwhistleblowers. Previously, they have been acting under wire and mail \nfraud provisions. And those are not adequate to deal with securities \nfraud. The committee recognized that and dealt directly with that \nquestion.\n  The President is talking about doubling the penalties for wire and \nmail fraud, as I understand it, but did not have a proposal to actually \nhave a securities fraud offense. And that is very important because it \nwould have been very difficult under those other statutes because they \nare not directly focused on securities fraud.\n  I think the committee has stepped into what was clearly a vacuum and \nhas filled it in an exceedingly effective and craftsmanlike way.\n  There are also important provisions in this amendment to prohibit \nindividuals from destroying documents or falsifying records with the \nintent to obstruct or influence a Federal investigation or a matter in \nbankruptcy. That is also very important. We have some provisions of \nthat sort but, once again, they are not fully developed or fully \nfocused. The committee, again, has applied itself in order to do that \nand obviously made a very substantial contribution in that regard.\n  I also want to touch, very briefly, on the provisions for \nwhistleblower protection for employees of public companies. The \nlegislation, as reported out of the Banking Committee, requires audit \ncommittees to have in place procedures to receive and address \ncomplaints regarding accounting and internal control or auditing issues \nand to establish procedures for employees' anonymous submissions of \nconcerns regarding accounting or auditing matters. That was a provision \nchampioned by Senator Stabenow. We were very pleased to adopt it.\n  But Senator Leahy and his colleagues on the Judiciary Committee have \nmoved ahead to provide additional protections and remedies for \ncorporate whistleblowers that I think will help to ensure that \nemployees will not be punished for taking steps to prevent corporate \nmalfeasance.\n  There are a number of other very important provisions in this \nlegislation of which I am very strongly supportive, but I, in deference \nto the limitation on time, will withhold with respect to those.\n  But, again, I thank the able chairman of the Judiciary Committee and \nhis colleagues for this very important contribution to the legislation \nwe are trying to develop.\n  Let me simply say it is a pleasure, once again, as we did back in the \nfall when we did money laundering, to be able to work closely with the \ncommittee in furthering the public interest.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirteen minutes remain for the majority. The \nSenator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Senator from Maryland. I \nappreciate his comments also about last fall after the tragedies of \nSeptember 11. He and I and our committees worked closely on the \nterrorism legislation. Realizing it was more than simply having a \npenalty against terrorism, we had to have the tools against terrorism, \nand the distinguished senior Senator from Maryland was very helpful in \nputting together the money-laundering legislation so we could come out \nwith a counterterrorism package on which the Senate could vote for 99-\n1.\n  That is what we are trying to do today. I am a proud cosponsor of \nSenator Sarbanes' legislation before the body. After years of \nexperience in this body, I know how helpful it is if you have bills \nwhere the jurisdiction of various aspects may be in different \ncommittees. And considering having turf battles, when you work \ntogether, as we have in the Banking and Judiciary Committees, and \nothers worked, you usually end up with a better package for the Senate.\n  The final product becomes better and more complete because of our \njoint work. Having served here for a quarter of a century with the \nSenator from Maryland, I know such things can be done.\n  With the members of his committee, he has had to craft a very \ncomplex, worthwhile bill on the issue of how do you account, how do you \nkeep records, of all the various things to come under the SEC, to come \nunder the jurisdiction of his committee.\n  What I am concerned about, from the Judiciary Committee, is, if you \nget these people, you get them; that if you have somebody who has gone \nand spent all their efforts to defraud their own company and the \npension holders in their company and the investors in their company, \nthat they not walk off scot-free with their mansions in protected \nStates and their offshore money.\n  When you look at what has happened, when you look at the out-and-out \nfraud of some of these executives as they have ruined their own \ncompany, actually damaged their own country as well, at the same time \nlining their pockets as if anybody could even have pockets as huge as \nthe amounts of money they have put in, and they walk away scot-free and \nthey say: This is such a tragedy. I hate to see my company collapse \nlike that and tens of thousands of people out of work and all those \npensioners gone and all those States defrauded. And I am just going to \nhave to comfort myself for the rest of my life with my $100 or $200 or \n$300 million I have absconded with.\n  Their comfort might be a little bit less if they find that those same \npension holders and stockholders have the ability to go after the money \nthey are walking away with, and their comfort might be a little bit \nless if instead of a very large mansion they are in a 12-by-12 cell \nbehind steel doors. Instead of a complacent board of directors, they \nmay have to be dealing with their fellow inmates who may not take very \nkindly to them.\n  Why do we have to have that kind of a tough law, and why do we have \nto have the statute of limitations? Just take a look at this chart. \nThis is what Enron did. Does this look like a company that wants to be \ntransparent in their dealings? Does this look like a company that wants \nto be on the up and up? These are their off-the-book transactions, \nhidden debt, fake profits, inflated stock.\n  What were some of the companies they were hiding this behind? Here is \none named Ponderosa. If you look at that, you do not know it belongs to \nEnron. Or Jedi Capital or Big Doe--that is not D-O-U-G-H--or Sundance \nor Little River or Yosemite or OB-1 Holdings or Peregrine or Kenobe. I \nguess Kenobe is a different company than OB-1. And we have Braveheart \nand Mojave and Chewco and Condor. It seems the only time they had free \nbetween trying to hide the money was going to movies, when you look at \nsome of the secret partnerships they created here, Jedi II, OB-1, \nKenobe.\n\n  My point is, do you think if anybody stumbled across one of these \ncompanies they would think for even 1 minute that it belonged to Enron? \nOf course not. If you were the person who was to protect the pension \nrights of the employees, do you think if you found Ospry or Zenith or \nEgret or Cactus or Big River or Raptor you would think the money that \nwas being tucked away and hidden in there could actually belong to the \nemployees of Enron?\n  But Kenneth Lay comes up here, sidles up to the table where he is \ngoing to be called to testify and says: I wish you could know the whole \nstory, but not from me. I am taking the fifth.\n  Well, he has that constitutional right. But he doesn't have a \nconstitutional right to steal and defraud, and other people like him \ndon't have the constitutional right to steal and defraud and hide the \nmoney.\n  This isn't a question of whether they walk away with only $100 \nmillion instead of $200 million. It is a question of a middle-age \ncouple reaching retirement time and having virtually all\n\n[[Page S6540]]\n\ntheir retirement save Social Security tied up in a pension fund such as \nthis and seeing it wiped out that day. They are not facing a question \nof whether they will have $200 million or $100 million. They are going \nto face the question of whether they can even keep their home, whether \nthey will have the money to visit their grandchildren, or have the \nmoney to take care of their medical needs in their old age. That is \nwhat we are talking about. Or the people who work so hard, show up for \nwork every single day, help make the fortune for the Ken Lays of the \nworld, but they suddenly find they can't make the mortgage payment, \nthey can't make the car payment, they can't pay for their children's \nbraces. They can't do any of these other things because the big guys \nhave walked off with all the money.\n  That is why I wrote the legislation I did. I wrote legislation that \nis going to punish criminals. I wrote legislation that will preserve \nthe evidence of fraud and protect victims.\n  As one who has prosecuted people, I know nothing focuses their \nattention more than knowing they will not go to jail. Suddenly that \noverlooked ethics course when they were getting their MBA, or that \noverlooked ethics course in the accounting school or law school, they \nare going to start looking at it again. If they think, because they can \nwalk away from this, they will go to jail, they are going to go to \njail. It is not going to be a complacent board of directors they will \ndeal with. It will be a criminal in the cell next door. That is what \nthey have to worry about.\n  These people deserve to go to jail. They have ruined the lives of \nthousands of people, good people, hard-working people, honest people. \nThey have destroyed much of the confidence in Wall Street. They have \ndestroyed the confidence in people who should be investing.\n  I am proud to be an American and proud to be in a country such as \nours where you can invest, where people can grow companies, where they \ncan make money if they do the right thing. But I am not proud of these \nkinds of people who destroy that sort of American dream.\n  The President says he is outraged. I suspect he is. But I am also \noutraged. I would hope the President's outrage will go to the point of \nsupporting this kind of legislation, this kind of legislation which \ndoesn't just say it is wrong for you to do that, but if you do it, you \nare going to go to jail. Those iron bars are going to close.\n  We have worked hard on this legislation. That is why I compliment the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Maryland. He and the members of his \ncommittee worked very hard. The people of my staff, including Ed \nPagano, Steve Dettelbach, Jessica Berry, and Bruce Cohen worked so \nhard. They brought in people from across the political spectrum, \nRepublicans and Democrats alike, to join us. I think all of those who \njoined it joined in one basic thing. They set aside their philosophical \nor partisan differences. They set aside their feelings of party and \nsaid they were overwhelmed with feelings of outrage.\n\n  Even in my own little State of Vermont, pension funds were damaged \nbecause of the excesses of Enron. And then we see WorldCom and Tyco and \nXerox, and we say we had better look back 5 years.\n  That is not the American way. That is the way of some of the most \narrogant, self-centered, spoiled criminals. That is what they are; they \nare criminals. They cooked the books in California during an energy \ncrisis, so millions of people in California paid more for their \nelectricity. Their arrogance was such that they did not care because \nall of those offshore corporations were hiding the money. Lord knows \nhow much money is still there. You are not going to find out from these \nexecutives because they will take the fifth. They have the \nconstitutional right to do that, and I will defend that right, as I \nwill the rights of everybody else. But let us not shed tears for them. \nJust as Democrats and Republicans will join in voting for this, I call \non the President and the Attorney General to step forward and say they \nsupport it. And I call on our Justice Department to go forward and find \nsome of these people not just to say maybe we will find a corporation \nguilty of a crime; let's send some of these people to jail for what \nthey have done. Let's send them to jail, and let's do everything we can \nto let the people defrauded by them recover some of their ill-gotten \ngains.\n  I see the Senator from Michigan has taken over the chair. Madam \nPresident, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I note that the Senator from Michigan is a cosponsor of \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I think all time has expired on the \nmajority side. I think I have about 13 minutes. I have said all I \nintended to say. I think we have cleared the way for this bill to be \npassed. I want to reiterate that when cloture is filed in a few \nminutes, I will be supportive of having that cloture vote earlier than \nFriday, which would be the normal time it would ripen. Maybe others \nwould not be supportive of having the vote, and they are perfectly \nwithin their rights. I think the agreement we worked out has guaranteed \nwe are going to pass this bill either this week or very early next \nweek.\n  The net result is that we can go to conference with the House, and we \nwill have an opportunity, I believe, to come back with a strong \nbipartisan bill. I have to say that I think we have sort of reached the \npoint where a lot of debate on this issue is more about the next \nelection than it is about corporate integrity. I wonder if the debate \nhas not reached the point where we are hurting equity values by making \npeople fear not only the disease, but the absurd prescription of the \ndoctor that might come from the Government.\n  I think the sooner we can finish this bill and go to conference and \ncome out with a final product so that people know with certainty what \nthe new rules are and how we are going to go about them, everybody will \nbenefit. I think the only thing that will be lost by invoking cloture \nis that we will have fewer speeches, we will have fewer opportunities \nto denounce evil, however we define it, and we will be less likely to \nget on the 6 o'clock news; but we will also be less likely to spook the \nmarkets and more likely to get our job done; we will be more likely to \nproduce a good bill we can all be proud of, not just when we read the \neditorial in the Washington Post, but when we submit it all to the \nfront-porch-of-the-nursing-home test, as to how we feel about it \nsomeday when we are sitting on the front porch of the nursing home.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, our economic system is based on \ntransparency. Investors need accurate financial information about a \ncompany so that they can make informed investment decisions. They need \ninformation they can trust. Getting honest information requires \naccountability and honesty from three entities: corporate executives, \nstock brokers, and public auditors. Clearly, we are seeing breakdowns, \nif not outright criminality, at all three levels. And it requires \nadditional accountability at all three levels in order to restore \ninvestor confidence.\n  First, we must expect that corporations present an honest portrait of \nthe companies economic health and well-being. Corporate executives who \ncooks the books are no different than used car salesmen who roll back \nthe car odometers, both are engaged in a fraud. They must be held \naccountable for their actions and severely punished.\n  Second, we must expect brokers provide their investors with honest, \naccurate, and unbiased advice. I stress unbiased. Unfortunately, many \nbrokerage firms have a conflict of interest because they bring in \nbusinesses and increase their own profits by pushing bad stocks. One \nrecent report indicated that 94 percent of Wall Street firms continued \nto recommend stocks for companies that went bankrupt this year up to \nthe very day that companies filed for Chapter 11.\n  Third, we have to expect that public accounting firms are acting as \nwatchdogs over corporate financial statements. Yet many of the auditing \nfirms, not just Arthur Andersen, have had major failures.\n  Accounting firms gave a clean bill of health to over 93 percent of \npublicly traded companies that were subsequently involved in accounting \nproblems within the year. And 42 percent of publicly traded companies \nthat filed\n\n[[Page S6541]]\n\nfor bankruptcy were given a clean bill of health. Clearly, we need \nfundamental reform at all three levels to restore investor confidence \nand punish criminal behavior. Some say may say that Enron, Worldcom and \nthe others are a few bad apples. That ignores the much wider, systemic \nproblems that now plague corporate America.\n  Advocating half measures or saying that we do not need to strengthen \nthe law is like saying that bank robbery should not be severely \npunished and banks should not have vaults because most people do not \nrob banks. Well, some people do rob banks. And some corporate \nexecutives rip off investors. But they are both criminals and both \nshould be punished accordingly.\n  I commend Chairman Sarbanes for his accounting reform bill, S. 2673, \nwhich is an excellent start at providing for stronger rules regarding \naccounting procedures. I am also pleased to be an original cosponsor of \nSenator Leahy's ``Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability Act,'' \nthat is now being offered as an amendment. Will some key executives go \nto jail if this amendment passes? If they are guilty of fraud or \ndestroying evidence of wrong doing, I certainly hope so.\n\n  First, the amendment creates a new crime for security fraud and helps \nprosecutors punish corporate criminality. This amendment is a lot like \nthe ``Go to Jail'' card in the board game ``Monopoly.'' It says to \ncorporate criminals ``go to jail, do not pass go and do not collect \n$200.'' The amendment also increases penalties for obstruction of \njustice. The people who would shred documents to cover up criminal \nbehavior are not better than the ``wheel man'' in a robbery. They may \nnot have pulled the robbery, but the crook cannot getaway without them. \nThis amendment would make sure the shredders are held accountable as \nwell.\n  Incidentally, the amendment also lengthens the statute of limitations \non these crimes and protects corporate whistleblowers. Corporate \ncriminals should not be allowed to run out the clock and avoid \nprosecution. And workers who discover corporate fraud should be \nprotected just as we protect government whistleblowers. I believe this \namendment will go a long way toward preventing corporate crime and \nprosecuting those who would rip off their stock holders and employees. \nRestoring confidence and punishing criminal behavior is in everyone's \nbest interest--honest corporate executives, their employees, investors, \nand the public at large. I urge adoption of the amendment and look \nforward to seeing it become law.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Under the previous order, the question is on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 4185. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms), the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Voinovich), and the Senator from \nIdaho (Mr. Crapo), are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from North \nCarolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I think Senator Lott \nwould like very much to offer an amendment as well. What I would like \nto do is to propound a unanimous consent request involving a number of \nSenators who have amendments to be offered so they will know the \nsequence. I know Senator Edwards has been waiting a long time to offer \nan amendment, as well as Senator Levin, Senator Schumer, Senator Gramm, \nand Senator McCain. Perhaps in the next couple of minutes we can put \ntogether a unanimous consent request which will sequence these \namendments so Senators will know they are protected and have the \nopportunity to then have their amendments called up. I ask that all of \nour colleagues work with us over the course of the next few minutes.\n  I yield the floor to accommodate Senator Lott's interest in offering \nhis amendment. We will lay aside the Biden amendment temporarily as \nthat amendment is considered as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, first, I thank Senators Sarbanes, Gramm, \nand Leahy for the work they have put into moving through the amendment \non which we just voted. That allows us to move on to other germane or \nimportant amendments that will be offered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4188\n\n  Madam President, I understand the Biden amendment will be set aside. \nSo I send to the desk my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Failure of corporate officers to certify financial reports.''.\n\n       This section shall take effect one day after date of this \n     bill's enactment.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I yield the floor. It is my \nunderstanding Senator Biden and Senator Lott would both like to address \ntheir amendments. I yield for that purpose now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4188\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, if I could describe my amendment briefly. \nI understand Senator Biden is prepared to do the same thing.\n  First, I should note, in at least one area they overlap in what they \npropose. In some other areas, there are some differences. But I don't \nsee there are major problems.\n  Senator Biden's amendment, as I understand it, just from looking at \nit quickly, would increase penalties in some areas that are not \nincluded in my amendment. What this amendment would do, though, is \nincrease penalties for corporate fraud.\n  Section 1 would increase maximum sentences for fraud. Mail fraud and \nwire fraud statutes are often used in criminal cases involving \ncorporate wrongdoing. So obviously this is an area that is of concern \nand needs to be addressed. This section proposes doubling the maximum \nprison term for these crimes from 5 years to 10 years by amending 18 \nU.S.C. sections 1341 and 1343.\n  The second section would enact stronger laws against document \nshredding. Current law prohibits obstruction of justice by a defendant \nacting alone, but only if a proceeding is pending and a subpoena has \nbeen issued for the evidence that has been destroyed or altered. Timing \nis very important.\n  Most people understand that shredding documents is a very bad thing \nto do. Obviously, you cannot do it if there is something pending or if \nthere is a subpoena. But as was the case recently, they knew that an \ninvestigation was underway and a subpoena was likely, and the shredding \nof documents went forward.\n  So this section would allow the Government to charge obstruction \nagainst individuals who acted alone, even if the tampering took place \nprior to the issuance of a grand jury subpoena. I think this is \nsomething we need to make clear so we do not have a repeat of what we \nsaw with the Enron matter earlier this year.\n  Section 3 freezes payments of potential wrongdoers. This section \nwould allow the SEC, during an investigation, to seek an order in \nFederal court imposing a 45-day freeze on extraordinary payments to \ncorporate executives.\n  Again, this year we have seen just that sort of thing happening. \nWhile an investigation is underway, basically rewards were given to \nthese corporate executives. While it would require a court order, there \nwould be this 45-day freeze.\n  The targeted payments would be placed in escrow, ensuring that \ncorporate assets are not improperly taken from an executive's personal \nbenefit.\n  If an executive is charged with violations of Federal securities laws \nprior to the expiration of the court order, the escrow would continue \nuntil the conclusion of legal proceedings, again, with court approval.\n  Section 4 involves sentencing guideline enhancements for crimes \ncommitted by corporate officers and directors. This section would \nimplement President Bush's call on the Sentencing Commission to quickly \nadopt the new ``aggravating factor'' to provide stronger penalties for \nfraud when the crime is committed by a corporate officer or director. \nThis ``aggravating factor'' is a term of art used in the law. It would \nprovide, under this section, stronger penalties for such fraud.\n  Section 5 would bar corporate officers and directors who engage in \nserious misconduct. Under current law, only a Federal court can issue \nan order prohibiting a person from acting as an officer or director of \na public company.\n  The SEC cannot order this remedy in its own administrative cease-and-\ndesist proceedings, even in a case of securities fraud where the \nperson's conduct would otherwise meet the standards for imposing such a \nbar. This section would grant the SEC the authority to issue such \norders if a person had committed securities law violation and his or \nher conduct demonstrated unfitness to serve as an officer or a \ndirector.\n  These points are all points that were made by the President, asking \nthat legislation be provided to provide for these additional increases \nand strengthening of the law. We have found clearly that in recent \nevents there has been improper conduct. There have been questionable \naccounting procedures, and there has probably been some illegal \nconduct. So you can put all the laws in the world on the books, but if \npeople act in bad faith, violate the law, you can never legislate \nmorality.\n  We have also seen that there are some cases where the law had some \nloopholes or where it was not timely or where it was not strong enough. \nOne example, of course, is where there has been shredding. Another \nexample is the very bad image of corporate executives taking increased \npayments, extraordinary payments, while they are being investigated. \nYou can't have that sort of thing.\n  I think these are basic things that should be added to this bill. It \nwould strengthen the bill. I have checked with a number of Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle. There is general support for this legislation.\n  I thank Senator Biden for allowing me to make this brief statement \nabout the amendment. Again, I emphasize that there are some \nsimilarities between this amendment and his amendment, but he does add \nadditional penalties beyond what is in this proposal. But I did want to \nput into the bill what the President specifically recommended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, this amendment is from Senator Hatch and\n\n[[Page S6546]]\n\nme. He had as much input in this as I had. Let me respond in the spirit \nin which I was asked to do this and explain what the Biden-Hatch \namendment does and then yield to my colleague to make any additional \nstatements.\n  Based on what Senator Lott has just pointed out, he has indicated \nthat there are four basic sections to his amendment. On the first one, \ndoubling the penalties for title 18, sections 1341 and 1343, that is \nexactly the same provision that is in the Biden-Hatch bill.\n  Secondly, making it a crime for document shredding: If I am not \nmistaken, that is in the Leahy amendment we just passed and that I \ncosponsored, as well as many others.\n  The third part of the amendment discussed by the Republican leader is \nsomething with which I happen to agree. It is not in either the Leahy \nbill just passed or in the Biden-Hatch amendment. That is the 45-day \nfreeze on corporate executives' extraordinary income based upon the SEC \nbeing able to hold that in escrow and freeze it for 45 days while they \nlook at it. I, for one, would be willing--I will yield to my colleague \nfrom Utah at the appropriate time--to accept that or join that in our \namendment.\n  Fourth, the Sentencing Commission provisions that were referred to by \nmy friend from Mississippi are in the Biden-Hatch bill. There is only \none piece of the legislation of the Senator from Mississippi, as I \nunderstand it, based on the summary, that is not either already passed \nor included in Biden-Hatch.\n  But there are three areas that are not included which we think are \nvery important. One is in section 2 of our legislation, which relates \nto conspiracy. Under title 18, section 371, the maximum penalty for \ngeneral conspiracy to commit a crime is 5 years in prison regardless of \nwhether the penalty for the predicate offense--that is, the thing they \nare conspiring to do--is considerably more than 5 years. So what \nSenator Hatch and I do is we allow the penalty for conspiracy to be \nconsistent with what the penalty would be for the underlying crime; \nthat is, the predicate crime. That is not included in the amendment of \nthe Senator from Mississippi.\n  Also, a very important provision of Biden-Hatch is that right now, \nunder ERISA, the Employment Retirement Security Act of 1974--we were \nboth here to vote for that--under current law, a violation for \nessentially squandering someone's pension to the tune of tens of \nmillions, maybe billions, of dollars is a misdemeanor with a maximum \npenalty of 1 year. If you were to steal an automobile from my driveway, \nwhich is about 2 miles from the Pennsylvania line, drive it across the \nPennsylvania line, under Federal law, it is a 10-year sentence. There \nis obviously a bizarre disparity.\n  What we do is we increase the penalty for criminal violation of ERISA \nto 1 to 10 years, based upon the value of what is stolen in ERISA. If \nthe loss in ERISA is a $20,000 pension versus several billion dollars' \nworth, the Sentencing Commission can make that judgment, as they do \nnow, to have the penalty be from 1 but up to 10 years. That is not in \nSenator Lott's amendment.\n  Lastly, section 6 of Biden-Hatch. Currently, the Securities and \nExchange Commission requires regulated companies to file periodic \nfinancial reports with the SEC. This section of Biden-Hatch creates a \nnew section in title 18 of the United States Code to require \ncertification, signed by the top officials of that corporation, that \nthe financial reports being filed accurately reflect the financial \ncondition of the company. Criminal penalties are created for failure to \ncomply with this section. Reckless failure to certify--you have to be \nable to prove it; it is a high standard--requires a penalty of up to 5 \nyears, while a willful failure to certify on the part of these \nexecutives includes a maximum penalty of up to 10 years.\n\n  The point is, A, everything but one provision of Senator Lott's \namendment either has been passed or is in Biden-Hatch. I will yield to \nmy colleague, but I am willing to accept the one provision that is not \nincluded. That is the provision relating to freezing payments for up to \n45 days under the authority of the SEC of compensation packages that \nare excessive so there is time to look at it. I am willing to accept \nthat.\n  It does not include three sections: Conspiracy, the ERISA increased \npenalties, and the requirement of certification that the financial \nreports accurately reflect the financial condition of the company, with \npenalties to prevail if in fact they either recklessly or willfully do \nnot sign such a document or they recklessly or willfully signed it and \nit does not reflect what in fact they say it reflects.\n  That is a response to the majority leader's request of what the \ndifference is. That is the difference.\n  I now yield, with the permission of my colleagues, to the Senator \nfrom Utah, and I might add, this is not original stuff of Joe Biden; \nthis was Hatch and Biden, Biden and Hatch. He takes equal \nresponsibility for this. If we are wrong, we are equally wrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am proud to stand here with my colleague \nfrom Delaware, who is one of the truly remarkable Senators who knows as \nmuch about criminal law as anybody in this body or in the Congress \nitself.\n  I also rise today and applaud President Bush and Senator Lott, as \nwell as Senator Biden, for offering what really, combined, will be a \ncomprehensive legislative proposal that calls for harsh, swift \npunishment of corporate executives who exploited the trust of their \nshareholders and employees while enriching themselves.\n  Senator Biden and I have worked together for years now on many \nimportant pieces of legislation. This is not new for us. I always feel \ngood when I can work with my colleagues on the other side. It is always \na pleasure to work with him. I commend him for the care and attention \nhe has given to the subject of white-collar penalties, as well as for \nhis leadership in this area. Just in the past 4 weeks, Senator Biden \nscheduled two hearings to review the adequacy of current penalties for \nwhite-collar criminal offenses. I am thankful that he did so for I \nthink this is a critically important area for us to focus on, \nespecially in today's unprecedented climate of market turmoil and \ncorporate responsibility--or should I say irresponsibility.\n  All of us well know that the past few months have been painful ones \nfor our Nation's financial markets. At least some of the blame can be \nlaid at the doors of some multibillion-dollar corporations, their \nhighly paid executives, and the accounting firms that were supposed to \nassure the public's trust. We learn--each week it seems--of more and \nmore accounting and corporate fraud and irregularities that have caused \nbillions of dollars of losses to innocent investors. I am personally \noutraged by these scandals.\n  The amendment I cosponsor today is a product of much thoughtful \nattention and scrutiny. No Member feels more strongly than I do about \nthe importance of our criminal laws. They must be fair, and they must \nbe just. If our criminal laws are to bear credibility and provide \ndeterrence, they must adequately reflect the severity of the offenses. \nBut right now they do not do so in the context of so-called white \ncollar crimes. They are, to put it bluntly, out of whack.\n  A person who steals, defrauds, or otherwise deprives unsuspecting \nAmericans of their life savings--no less than any other criminal--\nshould be held accountable under our system of justice for the full \nweight of the harm he or she has caused. Innocent lives have been \ndevastated by the crook who cooks the books of a publicly traded \ncompany, the charlatan who sells phony bonds, and the confidence man \nwho runs a Ponzi scheme out there. These sorts of white-collar \ncriminals should find no soft spots in our laws or in their ultimate \nsentences, but all too often they have done so.\n  It is time for us to get tough with these offenders. We need to make \ncrystal clear that we will not tolerate this sort of outrageous \ncriminal conduct, conduct that not only devastates the savings of \ncitizens, but also has lasting effects on the entire world's confidence \nin our American financial markets. This amendment will take away the \nsoft landings these criminals have expected and obtained for far too \nlong.\n  The amendment Senator Biden and I propose--with the acceptance of the \nadditional language of the President and\n\n[[Page S6547]]\n\nSenator Lott--makes several notable improvements to current law. As \nSenator Biden said, and I will reiterate, first, our amendment \nincreases the maximum penalties for those who commit mail fraud, wire \nfraud, and ERISA offenses, as well as those who conspire to violate \nFederal criminal laws. These changes are long overdue. The maximum \npenalty under current law for most of these offenses is 5 years, which \nis the same as the maximum penalty that could be handed down for \nmutilating a coin produced by the U.S. Mint. The current maximum \npenalty for ERISA fraud violations is just 1 year. In other words, a \nfraud committed in connection with employment retirement plans, no \nmatter how severe or wide, is punishable now only as a misdemeanor. \nUnder current law, one could get 5 years for scratching George \nWashington's face off a quarter but only 1 year for defrauding an \nentire company's pension plan. It goes without saying that we need to \nfix this problem.\n\n  Think about it. Pension plans go down the drain because of dishonest \nbusiness people, which is sometimes hundreds of millions of dollars. \nThink of all the people who lose as a result of that.\n  Second, our amendment would make corporate officials criminally \nresponsible for their public filings with the SEC. Make no mistake, \nthese filings are critically important to investors who rely upon them \nto make decisions affecting how they should invest billions and \nbillions of dollars. They need to be accurate. Our amendment makes it \npossible to hold somebody criminally accountable if they are not \naccurate.\n  Third, our amendment directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to review \nthe adequacy of current guidelines for white-collar offenders. We heard \njust a few weeks ago from the Department of Justice that these types of \ncriminals often get off with a slap on the wrist and that judges too \noften do contortions to avoid handing down terms of imprisonment. This \nsimply is not good and will not do. It undermines the deterrent effect \nof our criminal laws, makes a mockery of our system of fair and \nevenhanded justice, and ultimately sends the wrong message to all \nAmericans. Our amendment will ensure that the Sentencing Commission \nwill take steps designed to ensure that our system of justice no longer \ncoddles criminals simply because they ``just'' steal.\n  It is time for the Senate to act on this important matter of fraud \nand responsibility. I think these amendments are a big step in the \nright direction. I compliment the President, Senator Lott, and, of \ncourse, my dear friend and colleague from Delaware, Senator Biden, for \nthe work they have all done on these two amendments. I agree with \nSenator Biden that we are willing to accept that part of the preference \npackage.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I object for the moment. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4190, As Modified\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify the \nHatch-Biden amendment by changing on page 6 of our amendment, under the \ntitle ``Failure of corporate officers to certify financial reports,'' \nline 19--it presently reads:\n\n       (1) any person who recklessly violates any provision of \n     this section. . . .\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to amend it to say on line 19, subsection 1:\n\n       Any person who recklessly--\n\n  And add the words ``and knowingly''--\n     recklessly and knowingly.\n\n  Page 6, line 19, fourth word in, add as a fifth word ``and'' and the \nsixth word ``knowingly.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, reads as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the first word and insert the following:\n\n             VIII--WHITE-COLLAR CRIME PENALTY ENHANCEMENTS\n\n     SEC. 801 SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``White-Collar Crime Penalty \n     Enhancement Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 802.

Failure of corporate officers to certify financial reports.''.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today--along with my good friend, \nSenator Hatch--to offer our bill, the White-Collar Penalty Enhancement \nAct of 2002 as a second-degree amendment to amendment No. 4174, Senator \nLeahy's amendment to S. 2637.\n  Let me begin by applauding Senator Sarbanes for his leadership in \nsponsoring S. 2637, and guiding it through his Banking Committee with a \n17-4 vote. It is my hope and expectation that it will win the same \noverwhelming support on the floor of the Senate. I also commend \nSenators Leahy and Daschle for offering the Corporate and Criminal \nFraud Accountability Act, of which I am a cosponsor.\n  Let me briefly recount the events which bring me to the floor today \nto offer this amendment to increase penalties on white collar \ncriminals. In recent months, dramatic events have shaken our country \nout of complacency. A decade of peace and prosperity\n\n[[Page S6549]]\n\ncame to an end, first with a shattering reminder of our vulnerability \nto external threats, and then with a series of spectacular corporate \ncollapses that revealed cracks in the very foundation of our economic \nsystem.\n  Our response to terrorism was to come together as a nation, reminded \nof all we have in common, all we have to be proud of.\n  The shock of those high-flying corporations falling spectacularly to \nearth presents us with different problems. We have to examine our own \nsystem--the capitalist system that has brought us so much material \nsuccess, the envy of the rest of the world.\n  As the stock market continues to lose value, as the dollar has \ndropped to a 2-year low, we know that investors, here at home and \nabroad, have lost some of their faith in the American economy.\n  That loss of faith has a material impact of the wealth of this \ncountry, as our currency and our securities lose value. Some observers \nworry aloud that a full-blown loss of faith in our economy could drain \neven more value from our markets.\n  The task before us is nothing less than restoring confidence in our \nmarket economy. There are many facets to this problem.\n  One is reforming the auditing process. On the Senate floor right now \nis the Sarbanes bill that is essential to any effort to restore \ninvestor's faith in our markets. Audit firms are supposed to be \nindependent voices, providing disinterested information that investors \nneed to assess risk and to allocate funds to those companies that will \nhave the best chance of raising our standard of living.\n  We need more transparency, more accountability in the conduct of \naccounting firms, and more confidence that they have access to, and are \nwilling to tell us, the truth about the businesses they audit. Senator \nSarbanes has done us all a service by bringing this bipartisan bill to \nthe floor.\n  Yesterday, I was hoping to hear the President support this bipartisan \napproach to reform, reform that is supported by the business community \nin the form of the Business Roundtable, when he spoke yesterday. I \nstill hope he will soon add his voice in support of this landmark \nreform.\n  Just as important is the amendment to the Sarbanes bill that I am \ncosponsoring with Senator Leahy. It will put real teeth in securities \nfraud enforcement, providing substantial criminal penalties for those \nwho defraud investors of publically traded securities or who destroy \nevidence to obstruct justice.\n  Yesterday, the President announced his support for tougher criminal \npenalties for fraud offenses. I applaud the President's call for \nincrease penalties for wire and mail fraud, and my amendment contains \nidentical provisions. But I am concerned that the President's proposals \ndo not go far enough.\n  For example, in the wake of the publicly reported problems at Enron, \nWorldCom, and other companies, we need to restore people's faith in \ntheir pension plans. They need to know that the companies they work for \nwill treat them fairly, handle their funds wisely, and that the \ninvestments made by pension funds are sound. Yet, I believe that the \ncriminal penalties for violations under the Employment Retirement \nInvestment Security Act of 1974, ERISA, limited to 1 year in jail, are \nwoefully inadequate to protect defrauded pensioners.\n  As chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, I held \na hearing several weeks ago--and am holding a second hearing this \nafternoon--on the adequacy of criminal penalties to deter this type of \ncorporate wrongdoing. Corporate executives who defraud investors by \nwhatever means should go to jail--period--and we need to give \ninvestigators and prosecutors the tools they need to send them there.\n\n  One thing most of our hearing witnesses agreed on was that there is a \n``penalty gap'' between white collar crimes and other crimes. For \nexample, if a kid steals your car and drives it over the 14th Street \nBridge into Northern Virginia, he could get up to 10 years in jail \nunder the Federal interstate auto theft law. Yet, if a corporate CEO \nsteals your pension and commits a criminal violation under ERISA, he is \nonly subject to 1 year in jail.\n  At my hearing, we heard from Charlie Prestwood, a 63-year-old Enron \nretiree, who lives in Conroe, TX. Charlie worked proudly for some 33 \nyears for that company, saved and invested in his pension, and retired \nwith about $1.3 million in his plan. Within a few tragic months, that \nwas nearly wiped out--only $8,000 remained. Charlie is not a lawyer, \nbut he had the good sense to know that its just not fair that a car \nthief who steals a jalopy can get 10 years in prison and a Gucci-clad \ncorporate crook can steal a person's life savings and might only end up \nwith 1 year in prison.\n  Accordingly, the amendment that Senator Hatch and I offer today is \ncarefully crafted to hold corporate officer responsible and to reduce \nthe ``penalty gap'' between a number of white collar crimes and other \nserious crimes. It does 3 basic things.\n  First, it goes beyond President Bush's proposal by raising penalties \nfor those white collar crimes that are most often violated but which \nhave insufficient penalties to deter corporate crooks. For example, it \nraises the maximum penalties from 1 to 10 years for ERISA criminal \nviolations. It double penalties for wire and mail fraud from 5 to 10 \nyears, and it treats white collar who conspire with others like drug \nking pins, by mandating that they receive the same maximum penalty for \nthe offense underlying the charged conspiracy, rather than their \nsentence being capped at a 5-year penalty as exists under current law.\n  When these penalty enhancements are taken in combination with the new \n10-year felony for securities fraud contained in the amendment I have \nco-sponsored with Senator Leahy, the Government will have the full \nrange of prosecutorial arrows in its quiver to fight pension crooks and \ncorporate wrong doers. Respectfully, the President's penalty proposal \nis only one small piece of the white collar crime-fighting puzzle.\n  Second, our amendment tells corporate big wigs that they are no \nlonger off the hook for their companies misdeeds. My amendment requires \ntop corporate officials to certify to the Securities and Exchange \nCommission that the periodic financial reports filed by their companies \nwith the Commission accurately reflect the financial health of these \ncorporations. Reckless failure by a corporate official to do so will \nresult in up to 5 years in prison, while willful failure to do so will \ntrigger a jail term of up to 10 years.\n  Third, our amendment directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to review \nand amend the federal sentencing guidelines to lengthen sentences for \nwhite collar criminals to reflect these new, more serious penalties. It \nalso directs the Commission to impose sentencing enhancement where \ncorporate officials defraud victims. I applaud President Bush for \nannouncing a similar proposal.\n  Make no mistake--this amendment will not stamp out white collar \ncrime. We live in a fallen world where bad people do bad things--\nwhether its stealing cars or stealing pensions. But, its time to \n``level the playing field'' between white collar and blue collar \ncriminals.\n  I believe the amendment that Senator Hatch and I are offering will \nmove us substantially in the direction of deterring corporate \nwrongdoers by holding them responsible for the criminal acts. It will \nalso begin the restoration of confidence in our financial markets. We \nmust do both. The time to act is now. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4188\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to applaud President Bush and \nSenator Lott for offering a comprehensive legislative proposal that \ncalls for harsh, swift punishment of corporate executives who exploit \nthe trust of their shareholders and employees, while enriching \nthemselves.\n  This bill, which tracks the President's recent proposal, increases \nthe criminal penalties that apply to fraud statutes that are frequently \nused to prosecute corporate wrongdoers. It also strengthens an existing \nobstruction of justice statute, and calls for an aggravated sentencing \nenhancement for frauds perpetrated by corporate officers and directors. \nFinally, it increases the Security and Exchange Commission's \nadministrative enforcement\n\n[[Page S6550]]\n\ntools by strengthening the SEC's ability to freeze improper payments to \ncorporate executives while the company is under investigation, and by \nenabling the SEC to bar corporate officers and directors from continued \nservice where they engage in serious misconduct.\n  I support these provisions because I strongly believe that it is \ncritical that we hold corporate executives accountable for acts of \nwrongdoing. We can do so by supplying the SEC and federal prosecutors \nwith the civil and criminal tools they need to investigate and \nprosecute acts of corporate misconduct.\n  Let me briefly elaborate on some of the specific provisions contained \nin this bill.\n  First, as I mentioned, the bill doubles the maximum prison term for \nmail and wire fraud offenses, from 5 years to 10 years. This is \nidentical to a provision Senator Biden and I have included in our \namendment. This is a necessary sentencing enhancement, and one that is \nlong overdue. Because prosecutors frequently use the mail and wire \nstatutes to charge acts of corporate misconduct, it is important that \nwe ensure that the penalties that apply to such offenses are \nsufficiently severe to deter and punish corporate wrongdoers.\n  Second, like the suggested enhancement contained in the bill Senator \nBiden and I have proposed, this amendment directs the U.S. Sentencing \nCommission to review the sentencing guidelines that apply to acts of \ncorporate misconduct and to enhance the prison time that would apply to \ncriminal frauds committed by corporate officers and directors. As I \nhave stated, I strongly support such an enhancement because corporate \nleaders who hold high offices and breach their duties of trust should \nface stiff penalties.\n  Third, the amendment strengthens an existing federal offense that is \noften used to prosecute document shredding and other forms of \nobstruction of justice. Section 1520 of Title 18 of the United States \ncode currently prohibits individuals from persuading others to engage \nin obstructive conduct. However, it does not prohibit an act of \ndestruction committed by a defendant acting alone. While other existing \nobstruction of justice statutes cover acts of destruction that are \ncommitted by and individual acting alone, such statutes have been \ninterpreted as applying only where a proceeding is pending, and a \nsubpoena has been issued for the evidence that is destroyed.\n  This amendment closes this loophole by broadening the scope of the \nSection 1512. Like the new document destruction provision contained in \nS. 2010, this amendment would permit the government to prosecute an \nindividual who acts alone in destroying evidence, even where the \nevidence is destroyed prior to the issuance of a grand jury subpoena.\n  Prosecutors in the Andersen case succeeded in convicting the \ncorporation. However, in order to so, they had to prove that a person \nin the corporation corruptly persuaded another to destroy or alter \ndocuments, and acted with the intent to obstruct an investigation. \nCertainly, one who acts with the intent to obstruct an investigation \nshould be criminally liable even if he or she acts alone in destroying \nor altering documents. This amendment will ensure that individuals \nacting alone would be liable for such criminal acts.\n  This amendment also includes new statutory provision that will \nstrengthen the SEC's ability to freeze improper payments to corporate \nexecutives while a company is under investigation. These provision \nwould prevent corporate executives from enriching themselves while a \ncompany is subject to an SEC investigation, but before the SEC has \ngathered sufficient evidence to file formal charges.\n  In particular, these provisions would enable to SEC to freeze \nimproper payments by obtaining a federal court order. The order, which \ncould last for 45 days and be extended upon a showing of good cause, \nwould freeze extraordinary payments to corporate executives and require \nthat such payments be escrowed. And where an executive is charged with \na securities law violation prior to the expiration of the court order, \nthe escrow would continue, with court approval, until the conclusion of \nlegal proceedings.\n  Finally, the amendment grants the SEC the authority to bar \nindividuals who have engaged in serious misconduct from serving as \nofficers and directors of nay public company. Under current law, only a \ncourt may order an officer and director bar. In an SEC enforcement \naction, a court may issue an order that bars a person from acting as an \nofficer or director of a public company where the person has committed \na securities fraud violation, and his or her conduct demonstrates \n``substantial unfitness'' to serve as an officer or director. However, \nunder current law, the SEC cannot order this remedy in an \nadministrative cease-and-desist proceedings, even where the person's \nconduct would otherwise meet the standards for the bar.\n  This amendment would enable the SEC to issue such a bar where the \nofficer or director has committed a securities law violation and his or \nher conduct demonstrates ``unfitness'' to serve as an officer or \ndirector. This will give the SEC the ability to punish an officer or \ndirector who has committed an unlawful act, where it has not yet \ninstituted an enforcement action.\n  I strongly believe that if Congress and the President act together to \nincrease corporate transparency and to enact tough civil and criminal \nprovision, we will succeed in restoring confidence in our market \neconomy. The Federal government plays an important role in upholding \nand enforcing standards of corporate conduct. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues and with the President to enact needed legislation \nto strengthen corporate accountability.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me try to explain where we are. We are \nabout to have two votes. One vote is on a bipartisan amendment that was \nput together prior to our receipt of the language of the President's \nproposal. That was done by Senator Biden and Senator Hatch. That \namendment will be voted on first.\n  I believe that amendment deals with the same subject area as the \nPresident's proposal. The overlap is not perfect, but when you take \nSenator Leahy's amendment that we have already adopted, when you take \nthis amendment, the things that are covered in the President's proposal \nare covered.\n  We also have the legislative language proposed by the White House to \nfollow on the proposals the President made yesterday in New York.\n  When we adopt these two amendments, we will have added a substantial \namount to the underlying bill. We will have added, in essence, two \ndifferent variants of the President's proposal of yesterday. I assume \nwe will get a unanimous vote for both of these amendments. I commend to \nmy colleagues to vote for both of them.\n  At that point, we will proceed in the outline we have. It is my \nunderstanding we will try to put together an additional list, depending \non the amount of time we have. Once these two votes are taken, the \nsubject matter of the President's proposal of yesterday will be part of \nthis bill. I commend to my colleagues to vote for both amendments.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, in just a few minutes, at 4:45, we will \nmove to the first of two votes. The first vote will be on the Daschle \namendment, and the second vote on the Lott amendment. I urge my \ncolleagues to support both amendments.\n  At the conclusion of those votes, we will go to Senator Edwards, who \nhas been waiting patiently, to call up an amendment. Then we have \nsequenced behind Senator Edwards, for purposes of calling up \namendments, Senator Gramm, and Senator Levin has an amendment involving \nthe powers of the SEC, and then back to Senator Gramm. That is the \nprocedure we have managed to put into place so far while continuing to \nwork to try to compile a list of amendments and to do some sequencing.\n  We urge our colleagues to inform us--I am not urging to add \namendments, but just informing colleagues of the process so they can be \non the alert.\n  Very shortly we will begin the first of two rollcall votes. Both of \nthese are amendments which strengthen the penalties. Many are related \nto the Leahy amendment which we adopted earlier today, and in a sense \ndeal primarily with the subject matter that was in the Leahy amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to be supportive of both amendments.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I yield back any time I may have.\n\n[[Page S6551]]\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield back the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller).

Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNorth Carolina is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4187\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about an \namendment I intend to offer along with Senators Enzi and Corzine. This \namendment addresses an important player in the problem we have had with \ncorporate misconduct in this country. It is a player with which I have \na lot of personal experience. That player is a lawyer.\n  As most people know, I practiced law for 20 years and spent a lot of \ntime representing kids and families against very powerful interests. I \nthink I have a reasonably good understanding of what responsibilities \nwe as lawyers have to the people we represent. While those are the \nkinds of folks that I mostly represented, other lawyers have different \nkinds of clients. Some lawyers represent corporations rather than \nindividuals. The lawyers who represent corporations have the same kind \nof responsibility, but it is to a different entity and a different \ngroup of people. They have a responsibility, though, to represent that \ncorporation, their client, zealously, the same way I had the \nresponsibility to represent kids and families.\n  One of the problems we have seen occurring with this sort of crisis \nin corporate misconduct is that some lawyers have forgotten their \nresponsibility. We have heard a great deal about managers and \naccountants, which Senator Enzi is familiar with, and scandals such as \nEnron and WorldCom. Managers and accountants are the focus of Senator \nSarbanes' bill, and they are critical to us doing what needs to be done \nto correct this problem and restore the public confidence.\n  The truth is that executives and accountants do not work alone. \nAnybody who works in corporate America knows that wherever you see \ncorporate executives and accountants working, lawyers are virtually \nalways there looking over their shoulder. If executives and/or \naccountants are breaking the law, you can be sure that part of the \nproblem is that the lawyers who are there and involved are not doing \ntheir jobs.\n  For the sake of investors and regular employees, ordinary \nshareholders, we have to make sure that not only the executives and the \naccountants do what they are responsible for doing, but also that the \nlawyers do what they are responsible for doing as members of the bar \nand as citizens of the country.\n  Let me be a little more specific about what this amendment does and \nwhat the responsibility of a lawyer is and should be. If you are a \nlawyer for a corporation, your client is the corporation and you work \nfor the corporation and you work for the shareholders, the investors in \nthat corporation; that is to whom you owe your responsibility and \nloyalty. And you have a responsibility to zealously advocate for the \nshareholders and investors in that corporation.\n  What we have seen some lawyers do, unfortunately, is different. We \nhave seen corporate lawyers sometimes forget who their client is. What \nhappens is their day-to-day conduct is with the CEO or the chief \nfinancial officer because those are the individuals responsible for \nhiring them. So as a result, that is with whom they have a \nrelationship. When they go to lunch with their client, the corporation, \nthey are usually going to lunch with the CEO or the chief financial \nofficer. When they\n\n[[Page S6552]]\n\nget phone calls, they are usually returning calls to the CEO or the \nchief financial officer. The problem is that the CEO and the chief \nfinancial officer are not the client. Their responsibility and the \nclient they have to advocate for--and which they have an ethical \nresponsibility to advocate for--is, in fact, the corporation, not the \nCEO or the chief financial officer.\n\n  One of the most critical responsibilities that those lawyers have is, \nwhen they see something occurring or about to occur that violates the \nlaw, breaks the law, they must act as an advocate for the shareholders, \nfor the company itself, for the investors. They are there and they can \nsee what is happening. They know the law and their responsibility is to \ndo something about it if they see the law being broken or about to be \nbroken.\n  This amendment is about making sure those lawyers, in addition to the \naccountants and executives in the company, don't violate the law and, \nin fact, more importantly, ensure that the law is being followed. For \nsome time, the SEC actually tried to do that in the late 1970s and \nearly 1980s. They brought legal actions to enforce this basic \nresponsibility of lawyers--the responsibility to take steps to make \nsure corporate managers didn't break the law and harm shareholders in \nthe process. If you find out that the managers are breaking the law, \nyou must tell them to stop. If they won't stop, you go to the board of \ndirectors, which represents the shareholders, and tell them what is \ngoing on. If they won't act responsibly and in compliance with the law, \nthen you go to the board and say something has to be done; there is a \nviolation of the law occurring. It is basically going up the ladder, up \nthe chain of command.\n  For years, the SEC recognized the principle that lawyers had a legal \nresponsibility to go up the ladder if they saw wrongdoing occurring. \nBut then they stopped. One of the reasons they stopped is because there \nwere a lot of protests coming from the organized bar. With Enron and \nWorldCom, and all the other corporate misconduct we have seen, it is \nagain clear that corporate lawyers should not be left to regulate \nthemselves no more than accountants should be left to regulate \nthemselves. There has been a lot of debate, rhetoric, and discussion--\nrightfully so--about the necessity about not ``letting the fox guard \nthe chicken coop.'' The same is true with lawyers. This has become \nclear through various acts of misconduct. The lawyers have involvement \nand responsibility, and they also cannot be left to regulate \nthemselves.\n  In January, a bipartisan group of the top securities lawyers and \nlegal ethics experts in the country wrote a letter to Harvey Pitt \ntelling him it was time for the SEC to enforce the up-the-ladder \nprinciple, as in the past. Mr. Pitt's top lawyer said: We are not going \nto do anything. If Congress wants something done, Congress should act. \nThen I wrote a letter to Mr. Pitt in essence saying: We are ready to \nact here. Will you help us in crafting legislation and working out this \nproblem?\n  That was 3 weeks ago. As of now, I have not yet received a response.\n  The time has come for Congress to act. This amendment acts in a very \nsimple way. It basically instructs the SEC to start doing exactly what \nthey were doing 20 years ago, to start enforcing this up-the-ladder \nprinciple.\n  This is what the amendment says specifically: First, the SEC shall \nestablish rules to protect investors from unprofessional conduct by \nlawyers, conduct that violates the legal standards of the profession.\n  Second, the SEC shall make one rule in particular, and it is a simple \nrule with two parts. No. 1, a lawyer with evidence of a material \nviolation of the law has to report that evidence either to the chief \nlegal counsel or the chief executive officer of the company. No. 2, if \nthe person to whom that lawyer reports doesn't respond appropriately by \nremedying the violation, by doing something that makes sure it is \ncured, that lawyer has an obligation to go to the audit committee or to \nthe board. It is that simple. You report the violation. If the \nviolation isn't addressed properly, then you go to the board.\n  Three important details about this amendment address some of the \nconcerns that I have heard voiced. First, the way we have drafted the \nbill, the duty to report applies only to evidence of a material \nviolation of the law. That means no reporting is required for piddling \nviolations or violations that don't amount to anything. The obligation \nto report is triggered only by violations that are material--violations \nthat a reasonable investor would want to know about. So we have been \nvery careful there.\n  Second, when the evidence is reported within the company, we have not \nspecified how a CEO or a general counsel should act to rectify the \nviolation. That is because the truth is that the appropriate response \nto cure the problem will vary dramatically, depending on the \ncircumstances. If the CEO can do a short investigation, for example, \nand figure out that no violation occurred, then the obligation stops \nthere. But if there is a serious violation of the law, the appropriate \nresponse is clear: The CEO has to act promptly to remedy the violation. \nIf he doesn't, the lawyer has to go to the board. It is that simple.\n  One final point. Nothing in this bill gives anybody a right to file a \nprivate lawsuit against anybody. The only people who can enforce this \namendment are the people at the SEC.\n  They will enforce this amendment not on behalf of any private party, \nbut in the name of the American people. This is about forcing the SEC \nto do its job and protect the American people.\n  Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4187 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Edwards], for himself, \n     Mr. Enzi, and Mr. Corzine, proposes an amendment numbered \n     4187.\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To address rules of professional responsibility for \n                               attorneys)\n\n       On page 108, line 15, insert before the end quotation marks \n     the following:\n       ``(c) Rules of Professional Responsibility for Attorneys.--\n     Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this \n     section, the Commission shall establish rules, in the public \n     interest and for the protection of investors, setting forth \n     minimum standards of professional conduct for attorneys \n     appearing and practicing before the Commission in any way in \n     the representation of public companies, including a rule \n     requiring an attorney to report evidence of a material \n     violation of law by the company or any agent thereof to the \n     chief legal counsel or the chief executive officer of the \n     company (or the equivalent thereof) and, if the counsel or \n     officer does not appropriately respond to the evidence \n     (adopting, as necessary, appropriate remedial measures or \n     sanctions with respect to the violation), requiring the \n     attorney to report the evidence to the audit committee of the \n     board of directors or to another committee of the board of \n     directors comprised solely of directors not employed directly \n     or indirectly by the company, or to the board of directors.\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4200 to Amendment No. 4187\n\n  (Purpose: To modify attorney practices relating to clients, and for \n                            other purposes)\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator McConnell, I send a \nsecond-degree amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm], for Mr. McConnell, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4200 to amendment No. 4187.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am not going to talk about the amendment. \nSenator McConnell was concerned--he has an appointment tonight and he \nwanted to be recognized, so I offered the amendment for him. I wish to \nsay a few words before I yield, giving him an opportunity to speak on \nbehalf of the second-degree amendment.\n  I wish to print in the Record the lead editorial from today's Wall \nStreet Journal. I would like to read the first paragraph. I want to \nmake it clear, I\n\n[[Page S6553]]\n\nam not talking about this amendment, I am just talking about the \nclimate we are in. This is the lead editorial in today's Wall Street \nJournal:\n\n       As if investors weren't frightened enough, the politicians \n     are now offering to help. That was worth more than 180 points \n     off the Dow yesterday, but then stock prices aren't the \n     point. Everything you're hearing now from Washington is aimed \n     at winning the November elections, not calming financial \n     markets.\n\n  This is an excellent editorial. One can agree with it or not agree \nwith it. The point I want to make is the following: There is a \nwonderful line in a very famous economics book, ``The Wealth of \nNations,'' where Adam Smith is talking about government and talking \nabout problems. A line in ``The Wealth of Nations'' goes something \nlike: The economy is powerful and it overcomes not only the illness but \nthe absurd prescription of the doctor that comes from the Government.\n  I believe we have now put together the makings of a good bill. We \nstill have differences of opinion. We still have differences not on \nwhether we should set up a board, not on how strong it should be. We \nagree on those issues. We have differences about how independent the \nSEC should be. We have differences as to whether that board ought to \nset audit standards and independent standards or whether we ought to do \nit by law.\n  As we go through the process in the next 2 days, if the some 30 \namendments that people on my side of the aisle are proposing to offer \nis any index, and as someone once said--and I am sorry I cannot \nremember his name--I have only seen the heart of a good man, not \nnecessarily the heart of an evil man. I have just seen these \namendments.\n  I am concerned that people who are looking at investing are going to \nsay: My God, it is one thing that my stock has been battered because \nthere were people who did things that were wrong, there were people who \ndid things that were illegal, but now I am going to be battered by one-\nupmanship efforts to show that Congress is really tough, that Congress \nis tougher than the President, the President is tougher than the \nCongress, that Republicans are tougher than Democrats, or Democrats are \ntougher than Republicans.\n  I would just like to say, not that anybody is going to be calmed by \nwhat I say, but I would like to say, in the end, I think we will end up \nwith a fairly responsible bill, and I hope people who are thinking \nabout investing money will take into account that this, too, will pass; \nthat this summer will pass; that after all the charges are made and the \none-upmanship has occurred, in the end, normally this process has \nworked pretty well for over 200 years, and my guess is it will work \nwell again and we will end up in a give-and-take in conference, with \nthe White House involved, measuring each amendment in terms of what we \nthink will work and what we think probably hurts more than it helps--\nthe absurd prescription of the doctor about which Adam Smith talked.\n  If we do go too far in one area or we do not go far enough in \nanother, there is going to be another Congress next year and the year \nafter and for every year from now until the end of the world, I hope.\n  Just reading this article set me thinking about it. There are \nprobably people trying to decide this afternoon what they are going to \ndo tomorrow on Wall Street. We have this bill passed in the House \nwhere, if you are domiciled outside the United States and move your \ndomicile, you cannot get Government contracts. This is the era of \nwhere, if you want to slap an accountant around, it is not going to do \na lot of harm. It is not fair, it is not right, I am not for it, and I \nam not going to do it, but if you want to slap business around, this is \na wonderful time to do it.\n  The problem is the market is going to open in the morning and people \nare going to either buy or sell or they are going to do both.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print this lead editorial from the Wall \nStreet Journal in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From the Wall Street Journal]\n\n                 Review & Outlook: The November Markets\n\n       ``Congress must now act to restore public confidence.''--\n     Senator Carl Levin (D., Mich.)\n       As if investors weren't frightened enough, the politicians \n     are now offering to help. That was worth 180 more points off \n     the Dow yesterday, but then stock prices aren't the point. \n     Everything you're hearing now from Washington is aimed at \n     winning the November elections, not calming financial \n     markets.\n       That includes President Bush's much-touted Wall Street \n     speech yesterday on ``corporate responsibility.'' His stern \n     words for CEO wrongdoers were perfectly apt, and some of his \n     proposals might even help. But coming so long after the Enron \n     scandal first broke, and amid election season, the speech was \n     widely and accurately described as an exercise in defensive \n     politics.\n       Democrats immediately panned it as inadequate, but they'd \n     have said that if Mr. Bush had proposed public hangings. \n     Their goal is to associate Republicans with corporate \n     ``greed,'' to knock Mr. Bush's approval rating from its war-\n     time pedestal and develop a campaign issue.\n       You can judge their sincerity by the sop to trial lawyers \n     that has suddenly appeared in the ``reform'' queue. For \n     months Maryland Democrat Paul Sarbanes has worked to form a \n     bipartisan coalition for accounting reform. But now Senate \n     Democrats are also demanding that Mr. Bush sign onto \n     expanding the time available for plaintiff plutocrat Bill \n     Lerach to file shareholder suits. In other words, what \n     they're really after is a Bush veto, which they will then run \n     against.\n       It's not as if Mr. Bush is letting business off the moral \n     hook. He's creating a new Justice Department task force on \n     corporate fraud, which as these things go will find someone \n     to indict. He's also painted a bull's-eye on CEOs, who will \n     now be personally and criminally liable (and face stiff \n     penalties) for their companies' financial results.\n       We only hope Justice keeps in mind the requirement of mens \n     rea, or criminal intent, when it's CEO hunting. This legal \n     principle got trampled in the rush to convict Arthur \n     Andersen. If otherwise honest CEOs can be indicted merely for \n     putting their names to a statement that turns out to be \n     false, good luck finding competent executives.\n       The brighter CEOs have also been busy cleaning up their own \n     act. They understand something that politicians won't admit, \n     which is that only business is truly capable of restoring \n     confidence in business. The New York Stock Exchange and \n     Goldman Sachs chief Hank Paulson have proposed more CEO \n     supervision by independent directors, among other reforms.\n       Just as significant, major pension funds and large \n     investors have begun to scrutinize stock options and other \n     forms of executive compensation. This sort of due diligence \n     too often went missing in the ``decade of greed,'' as \n     liberals now like to call the 1990s. (Or are we confusing our \n     decades?)\n       Mr. Bush put it well yesterday: ``I challenge every CEO in \n     America to describe in the company's annual report, \n     prominently and in plain English, details of his or her \n     compensation package, including salary and bonus and \n     benefits. And the CEO, in that report, should also explain \n     why his or her compensation package is in the best interests \n     of the company he serves.'' The point isn't that there is a \n     moral taint to high pay but that it has to be justified in \n     shareholders value.\n       The one place we've thought regulatory change might help is \n     audit reform. Clearly the culture of the accounting trade \n     went awry in the 1990s, and not only at Arthur Andersen. We \n     favored Paul Volcker's plan, which would have restored some \n     internal accounting-firm discipline and reduced conflicts of \n     interest. But the accounting lobby resisted and now finds \n     itself fending off much more intrusive regulation in \n     Congress. Serves them right.\n       As a political matter, Republicans are also paying for \n     protecting the accountants. Bush SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt, \n     who once worked for the Big Five, is now being urged to \n     resign by the likes of Al Gore, Tom Daschle and John McCain. \n     As these columns noted long before these politicians wet \n     their finger to the wind, Mr. Pitt's temptation now will be \n     to appease these critics by cracking down too hard on too \n     many, in a way that further roils financial markets. A \n     regulator with more credibility usually has to regulate less.\n       The investing public, fortunately, seems to understand \n     this. While rightly angry about WorldCom and Enron, the \n     public hasn't panicked even after three years of stock-market \n     losses. Americans know that even scarier than a bear market \n     in stocks is a bull market for politicians.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to read the editorial \nand pray over it. As I say, there are some things in it one may like, \nsome one may not like; one may not like any of it, or one may like all \nof it.\n  In the next couple of days, we are going to have a lot of proposals \nthat are going to be frightening to investors. I wanted to take this \nopportunity tonight to tell them that--I know my dear colleague who is \nsitting in the chair as a Presiding Officer remembers the old hymn, \n``This is My Father's World.'' Remember that hymn? It talks about all \nthese things that are happening, all these bad things that happen, but \nin the end it is going to be right. I think the Lord is going to count \non us to right it. I hope it is in good hands.\n  In any case, I wanted to say that as we hear all these ideas brought \nup, if\n\n[[Page S6554]]\n\nyou are thinking about investing money tomorrow or next week or next \nyear, do not be frightened. I think this issue is going to move back \ntoward a middle course, and if we go too far--and I hope we will not, \nand I am dedicated to not doing more harm than good--then we will fix \nit, and if in some areas we do not go far enough, we can come back and \nfix it, too.\n  As I said, I offered the second-degree amendment for Senator \nMcConnell who has an appointment and wanted to get his amendment in. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Texas, I have \nenjoyed his wisdom over the last 18 years. I am going to save my \nremarks about how I feel about his departure until later in the year. \nWe have just heard another example of the extraordinary wisdom of the \nsenior Senator from Texas from which I have benefited for 18 years. I \nwish to tell him again how much his service has meant not only to his \nState but to our Nation.\n  I say to my friends from Wyoming and North Carolina, they will be \nrelieved to know I do not intend to make my speech on the second-degree \namendment. This is an amendment about which I am sure the junior \nSenator from South Carolina is going to be particularly enthusiastic. I \nsay that with tongue in cheek. I will briefly describe what it is.\n  This is an amendment to provide a client's bill of rights for clients \nwith Federal claims or who are in Federal court. Fundamentally, what \nthis client's bill of rights would provide is an opportunity for an \norderly and systematic notice from their lawyers of the fee \narrangements to which they are subjecting themselves; in addition to \nthat, a bereavement rule which would prevent the solicitation of \nbusiness within 45 days of the occurrence of the event. That is a brief \nsummary of what my amendment is about. There will be ample time for \neveryone to take a look at the amendment over the evening. It does not \nin any way detract from the underlying Edwards-Enzi amendment, which I \nsupport and commend the authors for offering. I think it is right on \nthe mark. I would like to see these principles expanded to a larger \nclass of clients so they, too, can receive adequate protection.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nprevious sequence already in place, the amendments listed in this \nagreement be the next six amendments in the sequence, in the order \nlisted: Carnahan amendment regarding electronic filing; McCain \namendment regarding accounting treatment/stock options; Dorgan \namendment regarding bankruptcy/disgorgement; Enzi amendment regarding \nmateriality; Schumer amendment regarding restitution; and Murkowski \namendment regarding the Ninth Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would say to the Chair that I ask the \nSenator to yield to me for a unanimous consent request so the Senator \nfrom Illinois would have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to make a comment about the second-\ndegree amendment that is pending. I want to commend my colleague, the \nSenator from Kentucky.\n  Last night, at the close of the session, there was an amendment \noffered by the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from Texas. Now \nremember, this bill is about corporate misconduct. This is about \ncorporate corruption. Last night, they decided we ought to expand the \njurisdiction and scope of this debate to include reforming labor \nunions.\n  I have followed Enron, WorldCom, and others very closely and do not \nrecall ever hearing anybody say the root cause of the problem of these \ncorporations was labor unions. Thank goodness the Senate rejected that \nnotion.\n  The Senator from Kentucky comes back tonight and says, no, it is not \njust labor unions, it is the fees paid to lawyers; that is the problem. \nWhen you are dealing with corporate corruption, it is the fees paid to \nlawyers, contingency fee contracts, and class actions.\n\n  I was stopped cold when I heard this amendment being described to try \nto understand what this has to do with making certain that criminal \nmisconduct by corporate officers will result in time in jail. I do not \nget the connection. Perhaps the Senator from Kentucky can help me \nunderstand this. How does the issue of attorney's fees relate to \ncorporate misconduct and corporate corruption?\n  I am sorry he cannot join us in this debate to respond, but I say to \nmy colleagues I am beginning to get the distinct impression that the \nother side of the aisle is trying to change the subject on us. I do not \nthink they want to talk about wrongdoing in corporate boardrooms and \nwhat we can do to restore confidence.\n  Yesterday, the President used the bully pulpit and turned the bears \nloose on Wall Street. Today, we had another dip in the stock market. We \nhad better get honest. We had better get real. We had better make some \nreal changes in the law to bring honesty in transactions with major \nbusinesses if we want to restore America's confidence in business \ndealings and bring people back to the stock market and get this economy \nback on track and give people a chance to save for their retirement. \nThat is what this is all about.\n  Somehow or another the other side of the aisle wants us to veer off \nnow and talk about attorney's fees. I do not get the connection, and I \nurge my colleagues to take a close look at this long amendment and try \nto join me in divining what they are trying to achieve other than to \nperhaps change the subject.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I do rise in support of the Edwards-Enzi-\nCorzine amendment. I am disappointed there has been a second-degree \namendment to this, on which amendment we are working. It does not deal \nwith the same topic. It does not deal with the same bill. It is going \noff in a different direction. If we keep having second-degree \namendments throughout that go off in other directions, we are not going \nto get this bill finished and through the process. So it would be my \nhope it would be withdrawn.\n  I will concentrate my efforts on the amendment I have worked on with \nSenator Edwards, Senator Corzine, and others. This amendment is \ndesigned to assure that attorneys are responsible for fully informing \ntheir corporate client of evidence of material violations of Federal \nsecurities law. That is what we are talking about through the whole \naccounting reform.\n  Over the past few months, Congress and the public have concentrated \non the role of accountants and auditors involved in Enron, WorldCom, \nGlobal Crossing, and others. We have held hearings and drafted \nlegislation intended to restore a high level of ethical behavior to \ncorporate America and the accounting industry. This breach in ethical \nbehavior led to the problems these companies are now experiencing. I \nhave to say through all of those hearings, as an accountant, I felt the \nprofession was very picked on, and the profession deserved to be picked \non--not everybody in the profession. Again, it is that one-half of 1 \npercent or one-tenth of 1 percent who are fouling up everything for \neverybody. It happens in a lot of different professions.\n  As we beat up on accountants a little bit, one of the thoughts that \noccurred to me was that probably in almost every transaction there was \na lawyer who drew up the documents involved in that procedure. I know \nas to the companies we looked at, that was the case. It seemed only \nright there ought to be some kind of an ethical standard put in place \nfor the attorneys as well. All of the people who are involved should be \nlooking at a new way of doing business.\n  As an accountant, I have been deeply disturbed by the action taken by \nsome in my profession, and as a result I have taken a more personal \ninterest than others might in drafting legislation which will ensure \nthat accountants act professionally and responsibly, and which will \nprotect the interests of corporate shareholders.\n  Following hearings on this matter, it has become clear that the role \nof attorneys who counseled these corporations and their accountants \nmust be scrutinized as well. Just like accountants,\n\n[[Page S6555]]\n\nthese lawyers are expected to represent the corporation in the best \ninterests of the shareholders. In doing so, these attorneys are hired \nto aid the corporation and its accountants in adhering to Federal \nsecurities law.\n  When their counsel and advice is sought, attorneys should have an \nexplicit, not just an implied, duty to advise the primary officer and \nthen, if necessary, the auditing committee or the board of directors of \nany serious legal violation of the law by a corporate agent. Currently, \nthere is no explicit mandate requiring this standard of conduct. It is \nclearly in the best interest of their client to disclose this kind of \ninformation to the board, rather than just upper management.\n  Maybe it could be called the ``smell test.'' If something smells \nwrong, somebody who can do something to fix it ought to be told.\n  It is important to understand the corporate attorney's client is the \nwhole corporation and its shareholders, and not just the CEOs or some \nof the executives, accountants, or auditors. As a result, their \nultimate duty of representation is not to the people to whom they \nnormally report but to the shareholders through the board of directors.\n  This amendment would require the Securities and Exchange Commission \nto enact rules within 180 days to set forth minimum standards of \nprofessional conduct and responsibility for attorneys appearing and \npracticing before the Commission; not all attorneys, just attorneys \nappearing and practicing before the Commission; that is, those who are \ndealing with documents that deal with companies listed by the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission.\n  This amendment instructs the Commission to establish rules that \nrequire an attorney, with evidence of material legal violation by the \ncorporation or its agent, to notify the chief legal counsel or the \nchief executive officer of such evidence and the appropriate response \nto correct it. If these officers do not promptly take action in \nresponse, the Commission is instructed to establish a rule that the \nattorney then has a duty to take further appropriate action, including \nnotifying the audit committee of the board of directors or the board of \ndirectors themselves, of such evidence and the actions of the attorney \nand others regarding this evidence. It is all within the corporation.\n\n  This amendment is simple. It requires the attorney to contact \nspecific persons who are part of the management hierarchy and explain \nthe problem. If that fails to correct the problem, the attorney must \ncontact the audit committee or the board of directors.\n  I am usually in the camp that believes States should regulate \nprofessionals within their jurisdiction. However, in this case, the \nState bars as a whole have failed. They have provided no specific \nethical rule of conduct to remedy this kind of situation. Even if they \ndo have a general rule that applies, it often goes unenforced. Most \nStates also do not have the ability to investigate attorney violations \ninvolved with the complex circumstances of audit procedures within \ngiant corporations.\n  Similarly, the American Bar Association's Model Rules of Professional \nResponsibility do not have mandatory rules for professional conduct for \ncorporate practitioners which require them to take specific action. The \nABA merely has a general rule that an attorney must represent the best \ninterests of an organization and suggests a number of ways an attorney \ncould respond, including reporting illegal conduct to a responsible \nconstituent of the organization, such as the board of directors. But \nthis does not mandate action.\n  In response to Enron and the current environment concerning corporate \nintegrity, on March 27 of this year the ABA did form a task force on \ncorporate responsibility. But how many task forces have been formed and \naccomplished nothing? Task forces are often used to delay \nimplementation of necessary changes. When task forces are used, we all \nknow it takes years to set up the rules. When they are established, \nStates may not actively enforce them or even have the means to enforce \nthem.\n  In any event, it is my understanding that the ABA's task force's \npreliminary recommendations are for the attorney to report law \nviolations through a chain or ladder of the corporation. That is what, \nin fact, this amendment does, first through the legal counsel or CEO \nand then to the audit committee or the board of directors.\n  While I almost always advocate a State solution, in this instance I \nmust advocate a Federal solution. In the past, Congress has authorized \na Federal commission to regulate the conduct of attorneys through \npromulgation of rules on attorneys practicing before them. For example, \n31 U.S.C. section 330 provides the Treasury Department authority to \nregulate the practice of attorneys appearing before the Internal \nRevenue Service. Accordingly, the IRS has promulgated rules on the \nconduct of attorneys.\n  Under 31 CFR, part 10.21 of the IRS regulations, each attorney who \nknows the client has not complied with the revenue laws or who has made \nan error or omission on any return or document required by the IRS \nshall advise the client promptly of the fact of such noncompliance, \nerror, or omission. The amendment I am supporting will give the SEC \nauthority to promulgate a rule similar to the IRS rule.\n  In the past, the SEC has tried to impose ethical conduct on \nattorneys. SEC rule 2(e), previously 102(e), authorizes the Commission \nto disbar or suspend from practice before it a lawyer or other \nprofessional who violates the securities law, assists in someone else's \nviolation, or otherwise engages in unprofessional conduct.\n  Through this process, the SEC previously instituted proceedings under \nrule 102(3) to enforce the ethical standards for the practice of \nFederal securities law. But it has stopped bringing these types of \nactions. This amendment will get the SEC back on track and make \nattorneys stand up and pay attention if they have evidence a corporate \nagent has committed a material legal violation.\n  In the wake of Enron, over forty professors with expertise in Federal \nsecurities and ethics law, have written to SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt \nasking for some form of regulation over the practice and conduct of \nattorneys involved in Federal securities law.\n  In their letter, they state that if senior managers will not rectify \na violation, lawyers who are responsible for the corporation's \nsecurities compliance work, should be required to report to the board \nof directors.\n  As they point out, such a disclosure obligation is still less onerous \nthan that imposed on accountants under section 10A of the 1934 \nSecurities Exchange Act, which requires an auditor to report, both to \nthe client's directors and simultaneously to the SEC, and illegal act \nif management fails to take remedial action.\n  The amendment I am supporting would not require the attorneys to \nreport violations to the SEC, only to corporate legal counsel or the \nCEO, and ultimately, to the board of directors.\n  Some argue that the amendment will cause a breach of client/attorney \nprivilege, which is ludicrous. The attorney owes a duty to its client \nwhich is the corporation and the shareholders. By reporting a legal \nviolation to management and then the board of directors, no breach of \nthe privilege occurs, because it is all internal--within the \ncorporation and not to an outside party, such as the SEC.\n\n  This amendment also does not empower the SEC to cause attorneys to \nbreach their attorney/client privilege. Instead, as is the case now, \nattorneys and clients can assert this privilege in court.\n  In addition, this amendment creates a duty of professional conduct \nand does not create a right of action by third parties. The Fourth \nCircuit has made such a ruling concerning the code of conduct applied \nby the IRS Rules.\n  The SEC has already found that attorneys who fail to take steps to \nprevent their clients from violating Federal securities law are guilty \nof aiding and abetting. This amendment will put attorneys on the right \ncourse. By reporting violations to the board of directors, they can \navoid being found guilty of aiding and abetting their client.\n  Just as I am concerned about the conduct of accountants because that \nis my profession, I would think member attorneys would be as concerned \nabout the conduct of the legal profession. To ignore the role attorneys \nplayed in Enron, World.Com and Global Crossing is a disservice to their \nprofession.\n\n[[Page S6556]]\n\n  I hope you will join me in ensuring that attorneys are required to \nconduct themselves ethically and in the best interests of their client \nwhen they see evidence of a material legal violation. They should be \nexpressly required to report that type of activity to upper managers, \nand ultimately, to the board of directors who represent the \nshareholders.\n  After Enron, it is clear we need some hard and fast rules, and not \njust an arcane honor code rarely adhered to, so the necessary measure \nof client duty is placed into the hearts and minds of the legal \nprofession. Again, I am disappointed there is a second-degree \namendment. This is an important amendment and something that I thought \nwould be cleared by both sides. We will deal with the rest of the \nprocess.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Akaka). The Senator from Wyoming yields \nthe floor.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, first, I am proud to have worked with \nSenator Edwards and Senator Enzi on this amendment on lawyer \nresponsibility in corporate practice. It is an exceptional piece of \nadditional effort in dealing with corporate fraud, corporate crime, and \ncorporate abuse. I am very happy to have participated with him, and I \nparticularly compliment Senator Edwards on bringing this important \nissue to the attention of the Senate and for making sure that we \npropose this strong amendment, to ensure corporate lawyers' ethical \nresponsibilities.\n  I, too, with the Senator from Wyoming, am disappointed. We are mixing \napples and oranges when we are talking about lawyer's fees. This is \ndealing with corporate actions of lawyers. I don't understand why we \nare trying to move to a completely different subject when what we are \ntrying to deal with is corporate responsibility. Lawyers play a role in \nthat as much as accountants and management.\n  Again, I thank Senator Enzi for his cooperation and leadership, not \nonly on this effort but with regard to the core bill, which is going to \nmake a big difference in the marketplace. People talk about weakness in \nthe market and are fearful of what we do in Congress, but they are \nreally fearful of what we will not do or what we might do in addressing \nsome of the quite obvious needed reforms.\n  We have talked a lot in the wake of Enron and WorldCom about the \nresponsibility of accountants and corporate managers. Rightly so, as we \nhave seen far too much bending of the rules, breaking of the rules in \npursuit of profit, pursuit of personal gain. In their wake, \nshareholders, employees, and frankly the whole economy, has suffered \nfrom the selfishness that we have seen demonstrated by the actions of \nmany--the criminal actions, in some instances.\n\n  It is not insignificant that even before this week, before there was \nso much focus on this issue, this year there had been roughly $2 \ntrillion worth of damage, value lost in the stock market, which is \nreflective of the discomfort that investors across the globe, as well \nas here at home, feel about where we stand.\n  As a former corporate leader, I tell you I am disgusted with many of \nthe actions I have seen taken by some corporate managers when they \nbetrayed shareholders' trust, employees' trust, and the public \nconfidence in general. I think they have basically betrayed our whole \nNation's economy. That is why I have been pleased to work on this \ncritical legislation that Senator Sarbanes has proposed regarding the \naccounting industry's corporate responsibility.\n  But I do not think that is enough. I think, as Senator Edwards said \nwhen he brought this to our attention, executives and accountants do \nnot work alone. In fact, in our corporate world today--and I can verify \nthis by my own experiences--executives and accountants work day to day \nwith lawyers. They give them advice on almost each and every \ntransaction. That means when executives and accountants have been \nengaged in wrongdoing, there have been some other folks at the scene of \nthe crime--and generally they are lawyers.\n  This is not a new issue. The SEC had an unambiguous view about this \nmore than 10, 15 years ago. More than 10 years ago Judge Stanley \nSporkin, while commenting on the criminal actions of Charles Keating, \nnoted that Keating had:\n\n       . . . surrounded himself with literally scores of \n     accountants and lawyers to make sure all the transactions \n     were legal.\n\n  In a now famous refrain, Sporkin lamented:\n\n       Where were these professionals . . . when these clearly \n     improper transactions were being consummated? . . . Where, \n     also, were the outside accountants and attorneys when these \n     transactions were being effectuated?''\n\n  That sounds a little familiar in the current circumstance. The bottom \nline is this. Lawyers can and should play an important role in \npreventing and addressing corporate fraud. Our amendment seeks to \nensure that. It seeks to go back to the old way: When lawyers know of \nillegal actions by a corporate agent, they should be required to report \nthe violation to the corporation.\n  Let me be clear. The same as I feel about most accountants and most \nbusiness leaders, the vast majority of lawyers discharge their duties \nwith integrity and in an ethical manner. This is not an effort to blame \ncorporate lawyers. But we cannot overlook the role corporate lawyers, \nthe lowest common denominator, can play in addressing abuses and \nensuring that our markets have integrity. We need to clarify that \ncorporate lawyers have a duty to the shareholders, not just to the \nmanagement that hired them.\n  That is why Senator Edwards, Senator Enzi, and I have crafted an \namendment that will clarify that lawyers who know of wrongdoing by a \ncorporation must report that wrongdoing to the client so it can be \ncorrected. The client is more than just the person who hired them. The \nlawyer's client is the corporation's shareholders, not the manager. As \nwe have seen far too often this year, when management is engaged in \nfraud it harms the shareholders. That is why we need to ensure that \nlawyers who know of illegal acts report those acts to the board of \ndirectors which represent those shareholders. Our amendment would \nrequire the SEC to establish rules in the public interest and for the \nprotection of investors, setting forth minimum standards of \nprofessional conduct for attorneys appearing and practicing before the \nCommission. Those rules would include--shall include a requirement that \nlawyers who have evidence of a violation of law would be required to go \nup the ladder of corporate management and report the violation.\n\n  It is a simple principle--very much common sense. If a manager \ndoesn't respond appropriately, including remedying any violation, the \nlawyer would then be required to report the violation to the board of \ndirectors which represents the shareholders.\n  We should recognize that in some instances where there may be \nevidence of a violation, it may become apparent after a more complete \ninvestigation that there is not an actual violation. But when lawyers \nare aware of a potential violation, they do have a duty to investigate. \nAnd if they determine there is a material violation of law--not some \nsmall violation, some insignificant rule--that violation should be \nremedied by the corporation. If it is not remedied, it is the duty of \nthe lawyer, under our language, to report it to the board.\n  I am pleased that Senator Edwards and Senator Enzi and I have been \nable to craft an amendment that will firmly establish the ethical duty \nof corporate lawyers to report wrongdoing to their client, including, \nif necessary, to the board of directors that represents a company's \nshareholders.\n  Addressing the role of corporate lawyers is just as important a step \nas it is with accountants and with corporate officers. If we want to \ntruly address this breakdown in corporate responsibility, it is a \ncritical piece of the puzzle that cannot be overlooked. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this sensible amendment.\n  Once again I say I am disappointed with the McConnell amendment. I \nsuggest we move to table that, in light of its irrelevance with respect \nto the underlying matter.\n  I will withdraw that motion, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Does the Senator yield the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator withhold suggesting the \nabsence of a quorum?\n\n[[Page S6557]]\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Yes. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4206\n\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendments be laid aside so I may offer an amendment, and that there be \na time limitation of 2 minutes on my amendment, with no amendments in \norder to my amendment. This amendment has been agreed to by both \nmanagers.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, and following the \ndisposition of this that we will return to the Edwards amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the understanding of the Chair. Is \nthere objection? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MILLER. I send my amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia (Mr. Miller) proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4206.\n\n  Mr. MILLER. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the chief executive \n   officer of a corporation should sign the corporation's income tax \n                                returns)\n\n       At the end add the following new title:\n\n                   TITLE VIII--CORPORATE TAX RETURNS\n\n     SEC. 801. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE SIGNING OF \n                   CORPORATE TAX RETURNS BY CHIEF EXECUTIVE \n                   OFFICERS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the Federal income tax \n     return of a corporation should be signed by the chief \n     executive officer of such corporation.\n\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, this amendment is only three lines long. \nLet me read them to the Senate:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the Federal income tax \n     return of a corporation shall be signed by the chief \n     executive officer of such corporation.\n\n  Believe it or not, that is not in the law right now, and it should \nbe. The average wage earner on his 1040 form has to sign it. We require \nit of him. That is what we should require of the CEO of a corporation, \njust treat them the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland, Senator Sarbanes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I withdraw the request. I don't have any \nproblem. It was a confusion of which amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4206) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I announce that there will be no more \nrollcall votes tonight. I hope Senators will come to the floor and \ncontinue to participate in the debate. But for the interest of Senators \nand schedules, we will have no additional rollcall votes tonight.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, while we are all waiting for further \nbusiness, I will take just a moment to speak to the amendment that has \nbeen offered by the very able Senator from North Carolina. In fact, I \nwould like to put a couple of inquiries to the Senator, if I might.\n  It is my understanding that this amendment, which places \nresponsibility upon the lawyer for the corporation to report up the \nladder, only involves going up within the corporate structure. He \ndoesn't go outside of the corporate structure. So the lawyer would \nfirst go to the chief legal officer, or the chief executive officer, \nand if he didn't get an appropriate response, he would go to the board \nof directors. Is that correct?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, my response to the question is the only \nobligation that this amendment creates is the obligation to report to \nthe client, which begins with the chief legal officer, and, if that is \nunsuccessful, then to the board of the corporation. There is no \nobligation to report anything outside the client--the corporation.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I think that is an important point. I simply asked the \nquestion in order to stress the fact that that is the way this \namendment works. This has been a very carefully worked out amendment. I \nengaged in an exchange with the distinguished Senator from North \nCarolina, and the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi, the cosponsors of \nthis amendment. I know how careful they have been in trying to craft \nthe amendment and in bringing it here. I think they have done an \nabsolutely first-rate job in sort of focusing the amendment, \nconsidering questions that were raised from one source or another, and \nadjusting it in order to meet them.\n  I think the amendment they have now put before us is an extremely \nwell reasoned amendment, and it ought to command the support of the \nMembers of this body.\n\n  I very deeply regret that Senator McConnell has added an amendment to \nthe amendment. His amendment really doesn't address this amendment. It \ndoesn't really address the subject matter of this legislation. It is a \ntotal diversion. Of course, I presume it will complicate our ability to \ntry to move ahead as we consider amendments. It obviously complicates \nthe consideration of the Edwards-Enzi amendment which is now pending.\n  Furthermore, I understand that under this amendment it can only be \nenforced by the SEC through an administrative proceeding. Is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. The answer is yes. The only way to enforce this legal \nrequirement is through an administrative process.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That was an effort, of course, to deal with the idea \nthat somehow it might bring causes of action from outside, or somewhere \nelse. So it is limited to the SEC. The SEC, as I understand it, had \nsomething like this in place in the past. Is that correct?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. The answer is yes. Years ago, the SEC had and enforced \nsuch a regulation, which they have not been doing for some time.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I further understand that a number of professors of \nsecurities regulations and professional ethics are, in fact, supportive \nof this proposal. I think at an earlier time they wrote to the SEC \nurging the SEC itself to put some provision such as this into place. Is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. The Senator is correct. There is a large group of \ndistinguished securities lawyers and legal ethics lawyers who have \nwritten the SEC suggesting exactly what the Senator said--that it \nbecome part of the regulations and part of the law.\n  Mr. SARBANES. This amendment really, in effect, parallels or follows \nthose recommendations--at least in substantial respect--as I understand \nit.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. That is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Again, that letter which I have had the chance to \nreview, and also the signatories to it--some 40 or so distinguished \nprofessors of securities regulations or professors of professional \nethics at the law schools--is also a very carefully reasoned proposal. \nThe one they submitted to the SEC is the one the Senator from North \nCarolina has tracked in his amendment.\n  I thank both Senator Edwards and Senator Enzi for their very careful\n\n[[Page S6558]]\n\nwork. And I very much hope at the appropriate time we will be able to \nadopt this amendment and include it in this legislation. I think it \nmakes an important contribution.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent at this time that I \nbe called upon to offer an amendment; that the amendment be debated \ntonight--it is the amendment on SEC enforcement--and that when the \ndebate is completed tonight and when we recess until the morning, that \nwhen the morning arrives, we would then return immediately to the \nEdwards underlying amendment and the McConnell second-degree amendment \nthereto.\n  The reason I make this unanimous consent proposal tonight is that \nthere are a lot of relevant amendments which are waiting in line, which \nare important amendments, which have a lot of support, I believe, on a \nbipartisan basis in this body that ought to be considered prior to \ncloture or else; because they may not be technically germane, they \nwould be precluded if cloture is invoked.\n  I have a number of amendments on the list. I think we should move \nthis train forward tonight, utilize the time this evening to move this \nprocess forward so as many of these amendments as possible can be \nconsidered before cloture. I make that unanimous consent proposal at \nthis time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me say \nthat we have a lot of people who want to offer amendments. I have on my \nside some 30 amendments. We had better follow the regular order. Let me \nsay that I would intend, once we have disposed of this unanimous \nconsent request, to ask that all further amendments be germane to the \nbill and that at noon tomorrow we proceed to third reading. But I \nobject to the unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 10:30 \ntomorrow morning, Thursday, July 11, the Senate resume consideration of \nS. 2673 and that the time until 12 noon be divided as follows: The \nfirst 45 minutes under the control of Senator Byrd; the remaining 45 \nminutes under the control of Senator McConnell or his designee; that at \n12 noon Senator Enzi be recognized to make a motion to table the \nMcConnell second-degree amendment No. 4200, with no intervening \namendment in order prior to disposition of the McConnell amendment.\n  That is not part of this agreement. For the information of Senators, \nwe would have an hour, beginning at 9:30, for morning business for both \nsides, equally divided.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think this is a perfectly reasonable \nunanimous consent request, and I do not object.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I have two \nquestions relative to this unanimous consent request. The first \nquestion is, Does this then mean we would move to the disposition of \nthe Edwards amendment?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, that is my hope. One of the reasons we want \nto dispose of the second-degree amendment--Senator Enzi, who has worked \nwith you and others on the underlying amendment, is going to move to \ntable. We hope we can move to the Edwards amendment.\n  The Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, has told us he wants to study this \ntonight and he will give us word on it tomorrow. I think it has been \ndebated quite sufficiently. It appears to me the Edwards amendment is \nreasonable. I think in the dialog he answered all the questions of the \nSenator from Texas. I have no problem if the Senator wants to spend the \nnight looking it over more.\n  Mr. LEVIN. My second question under the reservation is this: This \ndoes not then change the order that has been previously listed for \namendments under the earlier UC request; is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. That is correct. We have a number of amendments queued up. \nSenator Edwards has been here all day, for example. The Senator from \nMichigan has been here a long time today. We hope we can move through \nsome of these tomorrow.\n  As the Senator knows, there is anticipation tonight that a cloture \nmotion will be filed on this bill. The majority leader has told \neveryone that we have only 3 weeks remaining in this little session \nbefore the August recess. We would like to do prescription drugs. We \nare going to move, we hope, to the MILCON appropriations bill in the \nnext day or so. We have homeland security we have to do. There is so \nmuch to do and a limited amount of time in which to do it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Further reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I \nwill simply add the following because there are relatively few hours \nbetween now and a vote on cloture, assuming that cloture motion is \nfiled. I think we should fully utilize that time to consider relevant \namendments. What my great fear is--which is being reinforced tonight--\nis that the time is going to be filled not by relevant amendments but \nin other ways which would preclude the consideration of relevant \namendments in the event cloture is adopted. That is a major concern I \nhave. I don't know if other people waiting in line with amendments that \nare relevant amendments have the same concern, but I hope and believe \nthey do.\n  I hope it will be possible for relevant amendments to be considered, \nif not tonight, then tomorrow, and that the time be fully utilized; \notherwise, it would simply preclude important relevant amendments that \nare waiting in line.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator also speaks for others. We have \nhad, over the last several months, problems getting legislation up the \nway we used to do it here. It is difficult when we have obstacles that \nare brought up. It does not allow us to proceed in the normal fashion. \nI hope the Senator will allow the agreement to go forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I am told one of my colleagues is coming \ndown to object to this unanimous consent request. I have to suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I renew my unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, the reservations of the Senator from \nMichigan have no impact on this unanimous consent request? That is a \nparliamentary inquiry. The reservations expressed by the Senator \nMichigan have no impact on the unanimous consent request as it is \nwritten?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I appreciate very much the work of the \nmanagers of this bill. This is very important legislation. I was \nadvised by the chairman of the committee just a few minutes ago the \nstock market dropped again today almost 300 points. We need to do \nsomething to reestablish credibility and to reestablish the confidence \nof the American people in corporate America. This legislation goes a \nlong way toward that end. I hope there will be cooperation tomorrow so \nthat some of these relevant amendments can be offered.\n  I hope everyone understands the importance of this legislation. I am \nconfident they do. I appreciate the ability to work this out so we can \nat least move forward tomorrow to the extent we do in this unanimous \nconsent agreement.\n\n[[Page S6559]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, let me just outline, if I may, where I \nsee we are in the process. Tonight, a cloture motion is going to be \nfiled. Tomorrow we are going to have a series of amendments. As \neverybody knows, when cloture is invoked, the relevant test is \ngermaneness, not relevance, not significance, not the feeling of a \nMember that their amendment is important or more important than any \nother Member. The test is germaneness.\n  Anybody who has ever been involved in a situation where we move \ntoward cloture understands that once we are on that track, unless \namendments are relatively acceptable on a broad basis to all parties \ninvolved, knowing that the amendment is sheared off at the hour of \ncloture, that amendment in all probability--let me state it more \nprecisely--that amendment is not going to be adopted.\n  We can do this in one of two ways, and either way works perfectly \nwith me. We can either try for the nongermane amendments--if your \namendment is germane, you are solid, you can offer it now, you can \noffer it later, and you are going to get a vote on it. But if your \namendment is not germane, I suggest we try to get our staffs together \nand see if something can be worked out where if part of the amendment \nor all of the amendment or the amendment and something else is \nnoncontroversial, it could be adopted.\n  At the end of the day, we will all be happier if we do that. If we \nspend all of tomorrow butting heads knowing what the final outcome is \ngoing to be, the net result is we are just going to have unhappiness \nand no good will come out of it.\n  I say to anyone who has a nongermane amendment, in the end, to have \nthat amendment adopted it is going to have to be generally supported \nbecause, obviously, any Member is going to be able to prevent it from \nbeing voted on. It is going to get sheared off at cloture.\n\n  I have a list of amendments, most of which have absolutely nothing to \ndo with this bill. I have amendments on bankruptcy. I have amendments \non the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. I have amendments on pensions. I \nhave amendments on tax policy. I have numerous amendments on stock \noptions.\n  I submit to all these people who want to offer amendments that what \nwe ought to do if we are going to try to get something done is to have \nthem have their staff sit down with staff on both sides of the aisle \nand say: Is there anything in here that might be generally agreed to, \nand if that is the case, we could move in that direction.\n  Finally, let me say we have in place a unanimous consent agreement \nabout how we are going to proceed tomorrow morning, and I ask the \nDemocratic floor leader, if I can, given that we have a unanimous \nconsent agreement in place for the morning, can we simply have the \nfloor open for the purpose of debate only tonight so that those of us \nwho are going to be here all day tomorrow, as we were all day today, \ncan go home?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, there are some things we have to do, \nsuch as filing cloture, and if that situation of debate only is in \neffect, we could not do that.\n  Mr. GRAMM. With what now?\n  Mr. REID. If there is debate only, we could not file the cloture \nmotion.\n  Mr. GRAMM. If you can just tell us, if we can have an agreement--the \nSenator can amend it. All I am saying is, if people want to stay and \ndebate any pending amendment or talk about whatever they want to talk \nabout, that is fine. It seems to me if we are through with all of our \nbusiness except debate, we could let people who have debated enough go \nhome.\n  Mr. REID. The leader has stated there will be no more rollcall votes \ntonight. I hope if one wants to talk about the bill, they will do that, \nbut I do not think we need a UC to accomplish that.\n  Mr. GRAMM. If the Senator will yield, what about a unanimous consent \nrequest, except to file a cloture motion, that there will be debate \nonly tonight? That way we do not have a problem of potentially someone \nasking unanimous consent for something.\n  Mr. REID. My personal feeling is I have no problem with that. I have \nto check with staff to make sure I am not missing anything, but I want \nto make sure the Senator from North Carolina is protected.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Will the Senator from Texas yield, if he has the floor?\n  Mr. GRAMM. If I do I yield to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4187, As Modified\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Madam President, I have a modification to my amendment \nat the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 108, line 15, insert before the end quotation marks \n     the following:\n       ``(c) Rules of Professional Responsibility for Attorneys.--\n     Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this \n     section, the Commission shall establish rules, in the public \n     interest and for the protection of investors, setting forth \n     minimum standards of professional conduct for attorneys \n     appearing and practicing before the Commission in any way in \n     the representation of public companies, including a rule \n     requiring an attorney to report evidence of a material \n     violation of securities law or breach of fiduciary duty or \n     similar violation by the company or any agent thereof to the \n     chief legal counsel or the chief executive officer of the \n     company (or the equivalent thereof) and, if the counsel or \n     officer does not appropriately respond to the evidence \n     (adopting, as necessary, appropriate remedial measures or \n     sanctions with respect to the violation), requiring the \n     attorney to report the evidence to the audit committee of the \n     board of directors or to another committee of the board of \n     directors comprised solely of directors not employed directly \n     or indirectly by the company, or to the board of directors.\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close the debate on Calendar No. \n     442, S. 2673, the Public Company Accounting Reform and \n     Investor Protection Act of 2002:\n         Jon Corzine, Deborah Stabenow, Paul Wellstone, Ron Wyden, \n           Daniel Akaka, Barbara Boxer, Charles Schumer, Byron \n           Dorgan, Harry Reid, Paul Sarbanes, Daniel Inouye, John \n           Edwards, Barbara Mikulski, Thomas Carper, Jack Reed, \n           Tim Johnson.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, before the Senator from Texas departs, \nI wish to add an observation to the comments he made before about how \nto proceed.\n  There are a number of amendments. The definition of germaneness, once \ncloture has been invoked, is very narrow. There are amendments that \nMembers have which in the normal terminology would be regarded as \ngermane and are certainly relevant. It seems to me an effort should be \nmade to address those amendments as well as ones that are perceived to \nbe germane in the very narrow sense.\n  There is another category of amendments that I am not very \nsympathetic to, and those are ones that have really nothing to do with \nthis bill. The second-degree amendment offered by the Senator from \nKentucky that is now pending, in my judgment, is an example of that. We \nprobably ought to move very quickly to table those kinds of amendments \nwhen they come up so we have an opportunity for colleagues who have \namendments that are really relevant to this legislation to bring them \nup and to have them considered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I think we have a fairly broad consensus that is the \ndirection in which we should go. The fact that we are getting ready to \nhave cloture should not prevent us from adopting amendments where there \nis support and where there is a collective judgment that the amendment \nis relevant. The plain truth is that anyone knowing that cloture was \ncoming could have held up the President's amendment which added \ncriminal sanctions. Any Member of the Senate could have prevented that \nfrom being voted on knowing that it was nongermane, but nobody did that \nbecause there was a general base of support for it.\n\n[[Page S6560]]\n\n  All I was saying was that every Member of the Senate knows the \ngermaneness rule and everybody knows that, come whenever we invoke \ncloture, any amendment that is nongermane is going to fall. Then what \nis going to happen is, unless there is some consensus for the \namendment, it is simply going to be delayed until it is cut off.\n  If what the Senator is saying is that if an amendment is relevant, if \nit would improve the bill, if it is not highly controversial, we ought \nto take it, I agree with that. Looking down my amendment list, there \nare not a lot of such amendments, but the ones that are there, if \npeople want to bring them up, I am not going to oppose an amendment \nsimply because it is not germane.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npreviously agreed to Daschle for Biden amendment, No. 4186, as \nmodified, be inserted in the appropriate place in the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/10/senate-section/article/S6560-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Madam President, I rise to give a few comments about a \ngood friend of mine, John Wirth. On June 20, 2 weeks ago, the life of \nJohn Wirth, a great American and a citizen of my State of New Mexico, \nended way too soon. His death brings deep sadness to his family, to his \nfriends, and indeed to all of us who knew him and knew his important \nlife's work.\n  John was an internationally acclaimed scholar in the history of Latin \nAmerica. He taught at Stanford University for many years. His vision \nwas for a more integrated world and for a Western Hemisphere in which \ncountries work together for the common good of all. Many of his efforts \nwere personal, and many of his efforts he pursued through the good \nworks of the North American Institute.\n  Several weeks ago, I heard former President Clinton describe the \ncurrent circumstances that we confront in the world as a struggle \nbetween the forces of integration and harmony on the one side and the \nforces of disintegration and chaos on the other. Throughout his entire \nlife, John Wirth was a leader in that struggle for world integration \nand harmony. He sought to understand the world in his travels and in \nhis studies. He sought to explain it through his teaching and through \nhis writing. He applied his very fine mind and good heart to every \nsituation, every problem, and the result was one in which everyone \ncould have confidence because of the judgment and thought he used.\n  His vision, his commitment, his strengthen of character, and bedrock \ndecency as a human being served his mission well. The world and all of \nus who knew him are poorer because of his death, but certainly richer \nbecause of his life. Our sympathy goes out to his wife Nancy, to their \nchildren, and to all of the Wirth family.\n  I ask unanimous consent that immediately following my remarks, the \nremarks of former Senator Tim Wirth, which were delivered at his \nbrother's memorial service in Santa Fe, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              John Davis Wirth--Remembrances of My Brother\n\n                             (By Tim Wirth)\n\n       Thank you for being here, for coming this morning to help \n     us--John's family--and to help each other--John's friends and \n     colleagues and neighbors--his extended family--as we try to \n     soften the shock and the sorrow of his death.\n       In recent years it has become customary to speak of funeral \n     services as celebrations of life.\n       And there was much in John's life to celebrate, much of his \n     life that we will hold and cherish in our lives for a very \n     long time to come.\n       But this morning I grieve not just because the was my \n     older, much-loved brother, but because he was an exceptional \n     man, a perceptive scholar and teacher and thinker, a \n     visionary, quietly passionate, civic activist, and a devoted \n     husband, proud father, and loving grandfather.\n       John saw himself and all of us as citizens not just of the \n     Southwest, not just of the United States, but of a diverse, \n     unique community as big as a continent--as citizens of North \n     America where he saw a future of regional collaboration, a \n     model for the world.\n       He was working toward that future when he died. I think he \n     had a very big book in mind, a capstone of an extraordinarily \n     influential career.\n       I grieve that he did not live to see the next stages in the \n     process to which he had dedicated so much imagination and \n     energy.\n        I grieve for a life cut off far too early.\n       In what was supposedly the beginning of retirement, he was \n     actually entering what were becoming his most productive and \n     creative professional years.\n       We cannot know what he have lost. We can be sure our loss \n     is beyond measuring.\n       I grieve for John's three sons, Peter the community leader; \n     Timothy the conservationist; and Nicholas like his father and \n     grandfather, also a teacher of history. Each in his own way \n     reflects his father's deep public service commitment. He was \n     so proud of all of you, the choices you have made in your \n     lives, the women you were fortunate to marry, the men you \n     have become.\n       Most of all, I grieve for his grandchildren--for Alex and \n     Elena and Charlotte and Zoe and for their brothers and \n     sisters who have not yet entered the world that John has \n     left. He had so much to give you--his love, his steady hand, \n     his example.\n       He loved the times he did have to share with you--as he had \n     loved earlier times with Peter, Tim and Nicholas. He knew how \n     to share the many joys he took from life, and the many gifts \n     he brought to living.\n       From your grandfather you already have a wonderful, special \n     inheritance. Part of it is the joy he took in study and in \n     the quest for excellence.\n       Your grandfather valued hard work and discipline, and he \n     was tough on himself, because being tough brought out the \n     best in him--his four, first-rate books of Brazilian history, \n     and the eight other volumes he co-authored or edited.\n       His focus, energy and discipline earned him many proud \n     accomplishments, including being named Gildred Professor of \n     Latin American studies at Stanford, and winning the \n     prestigious Bancroft prize for excellence in history. Those \n     qualities--focus, hard work, and discipline--will bring out \n     the best in you when you take his example as your guide.\n       Remember, too, the joy he took in fine writing--his own and \n     others'; the joy he gained from music; his utter delight in \n     the first run of a new ski season; and the days he spent \n     matching wits with the wily trout.\n       I hope you will share and carry forward his passion for \n     nature and the outdoors, which will translate for you, as it \n     did for him, into care for the beauty of our planet and for \n     the danger that face our fragile environment.\n       Of all the gifts he had and all the gifts he would have \n     wanted to share with you as you grow up with his memory but \n     without his presence, his enormous curiosity is the highest \n     of his legacies.\n       John always had to know why things worked, and how they \n     connected.\n       His curiosity was not idle. It drove him, all through life, \n     to look deeply into any question that animated him and to pry \n     out the reasons behind history and to sort out the \n     connections between past and future. And while it drove him, \n     John's curiosity often drove his family crazy--his \n     stubbornness, sometimes misplaced enthusiasms--all curious, \n     too!\n       John had discovered himself as a historian when he was an \n     undergraduate at Harvard, and then from teaching history at \n     Putney. He originally planned to make Asian studies his \n     specialty, and he decided to come back to the west--to \n     Stanford--to become a scholar of the far east.\n       However, the spring vacation of his last year in Vermont \n     (before his first class in Palo Alto), he and Nancy took a \n     vacation to Brazil, to stay with some of Nancy's family. This \n     proved to be a voyage of discovery, and it changed the course \n     of his life.\n       John became a modern explorer, not a conquistador hunting \n     for El Dorado, but an investigator intrigued by a vibrant, \n     complex culture and a land and people as full of possibility \n     as his own country.\n       His scholarship evolved, from Brazilian history, to \n     comparative studies within Brazil to regional economic \n     studies in South America to trying to understand why some \n     countries develop, and others don't. As Susan Herter has told \n     us, he ended up studying North America--Mexico, Canada, and \n     the U.S.--and became the most distinguished continental \n     scholar.\n       His last book analyzed transborder environmental problems, \n     especially air pollution. In showing that cooperation could \n     work, John used one central story--how the U.S. and Mexico \n     had worked to clean up two copper smelters on each side of \n     the Rio Grande.\n\n[[Page S6561]]\n\n     He took pleasure in the irony that, 60 years earlier, our \n     grandfather had managed the huge open pit copper mine in \n     Morenci, Arizona, that had fed those two same smelters.\n       Beyond love and scholarship and his wide-ranging, \n     enthusiastic curiosity, John was driven all his life by a \n     gnawing desire to reconnect with the life that had been \n     shattered for him during a short six months in 1943 when he \n     was only six years old.\n       In that period, illness took our father, the Manhattan \n     project took our home in Los Alamos, and, when we had to move \n     away, the army took John's beloved collie, Tor, to serve in \n     the war effort.\n       Separately, those were terrible losses for a child to \n     suffer. They drove him and throughout his life as he has \n     worked to try to understand, to put the pieces back together.\n       Only two days ago I found a short piece that John had \n     written about the weight of those early years--one including \n     even the loss of his birthplace, Dawson, New Mexico (in 1936, \n     when John was born, Dawson was a vibrant coal mining \n     community, now it is a ghost town.)\n       Writing about his childhood, he said, ``Thus, by age 8, I \n     had already developed a keen sense of life's contingencies. \n     Displaced by the war, single parented, and with a birth \n     certificate from nowhere, I felt the pull and the need for \n     historical explanation.''\n       John's ``pull and need'' were scholarly.\n       But his curiosity fed a steadily expanding drive to apply \n     his knowledge, and to stimulate inquiry by others, beyond the \n     lecture hall, beyond the campus and into the messy realities \n     of public policy.\n       His curiosity led him to see, for instance, the connections \n     between environmental history, which he taught with his heart \n     as well as his intellect, and the immediate pressures on the \n     environment of the Southwest--which he worked to alleviate.\n       Curiosity also fired his perception of our continent as a \n     single region--well before most policymakers even thought of \n     it as a single market.\n       His thirst to make sense of history fed his skill as a \n     teacher and his vision as a citizen.\n       If you, as his grandchildren, take some measure of his \n     curiosity out the door with you every day, your lives will \n     surely have the richness and satisfaction that his had.\n       His last, great gift to you is actually one he inherited, \n     lost and regained.\n       It is his sense of this place to which he so deeply \n     belonged, to the Southwest, to New Mexico, to Santa Fe.\n       His mind traveled far and wide, but his heart was always \n     here. Born in New Mexico, John spent much of his childhood in \n     Colorado.\n       For education he went east. He started his school years in \n     New England as a scholarship student at Putney School to \n     which he returned as a teacher, then a trustee, father of \n     three Putney students, and then chairman of the board. The \n     help he got from Putney, and the help he in turn gave to make \n     it an even better school, became a major part of his life.\n       But one other school, a school that no longer exists, was \n     probably even more important to him. It was called the Los \n     Alamos Ranch School. Our father, Cecil Wirth, taught there.\n       As Bill Carson has reminded us, John's earliest memories \n     were of that oasis on the edge of the beautiful New Mexico \n     desert. His last book, which will be published this fall by \n     the University of New Mexico Press, is a history of this \n     school.\n       When some day you read it, you will find your grandfather \n     in its pages. When his childhood ended, your grandfather was \n     younger than Alex is today. Loss upon loss sent him out to \n     find why the world worked the way it did and how to fit it \n     all together.\n       In that world, in fact in this church, 42 years ago last \n     week, he married your grandmother. She gave him a wonderful, \n     warm, sustaining love that helped him search, filled so many \n     vacuums, and was his partner in every way. Nancy molded and \n     softened the man whose death we mourn today.\n       So, as we grieve, we thank John too for his strong will, \n     exemplary focus and vision, for his energy and legendary \n     enthusiasms, and for his optimism.\n       He gave us much and left his own legacy, broad and deep.\n       Thank You.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/10/senate-section/article/S6561-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6561-S6567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE NEED TO ENACT ACCOUNTING AND CORPORATE REFORMS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, this week we will hopefully act with \nstrength and unity to help bring confidence back to the investing \npublic. The last 18 months have shaken the foundation of the public's \nbelief in the accuracy of the financial statements of our major U.S. \ncorporations, beginning with the precipitous fall of Enron last year. \nThe Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act \nsponsored by Senator Sarbanes and reported last month by the Banking \nCommittee, will make significant headway in restoring the needed \nconfidence in our financial markets, and I strongly support it. Senator \nSarbanes and the supporters of this bill on the Banking Committee have \nshown vision and leadership in tackling the tough issues of corporate \nand auditor misconduct, and the Congress needs to enact this \nlegislation as quickly as possible.\n  On Monday, July 8, in my role as chairman of the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations, I released an official Subcommittee \nreport on the role of the Board of Directors in Enron's collapse. This \nbipartisan report found that much of what was wrong with Enron--from \nits use of high risk accounting, extensive undisclosed off-the-books \nactivity, conflict of interest transactions and excessive executive \ncompensation--was not hidden from the company's directors but was known \nand permitted to happen. The report also found that Enron board members \nrefused to admit any missteps, mistakes, or responsibility for the \ncompany's demise. The refusal of the Board to accept any share of blame \nfor Enron's fall is emblematic of a broader failure in Corporate \nAmerica to acknowledge the ongoing, widespread problems with misleading \naccounting, weak corporate governance, conflicts of interest, and \nexcessive executive compensation. Corporate misconduct is not only \nfueling a loss in investors confidence, but also threatens to derail \nthe recovery of the American economy.\n  The plain truth is that the system of checks and balances in the \nmarketplace designed to prevent, expose, and punish corporate \nmisconduct is broken and needs to be repaired. Action is critically \nneeded on a number of fronts to restore these checks and balances.\n  American business success is a vital part of the American dream. That \ndream is that any person in this country who works hard, saves, and \ninvests can be a financial success. If that person sets up a company, \nthat company's success can be magnified through our capitalist system \nwhich allows other investors to buy company stock, invest in the \ncompany's future, and share in the company's financial rewards.\n  The American stock market is part of that American dream. In recent \nyears it has been the biggest and most successful stock market in the \nworld, an engine of growth and prosperity. It has not only brought \ncapital to a company so they can set up new businesses and employ more \npeople, it has brought financial rewards to individual investors who \nput their money in the market.\n  Over the years, the Government has developed checks and balances on \nthe marketplace to put cops on the beat to try to make sure that people \nwho are using other investors' money play by the rules. That is why we \nhave the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission, and banking regulators. That is why we have rules \nrequiring publicly traded companies to issue financial statements and \nwhy we have accounting standards to make those financial statements \nunderstandable and honest. That is why we require companies to submit \ntheir books to auditors and why auditors certify whether the financial \nstatements fairly present the company's financial activity.\n  Today we are in the middle of another ugly episode. In the aftermath \nof the go-go 1990s where American business grew at breakneck strength, \nthe famed high-tech bubble inflated stock prices and the stock market \ngot tagged with the strange new phrase ``irrational exuberance.'' \nCompany after company, especially in the high-tech sector, announced \nprofits that increased by huge percentages year after year. Mergers and \nacquisitions proliferated, and corporate fees went through the roof. \nExecutive pay skyrocketed. The highest paid executives made as much as \n$700 million in a single year. By 2000, average CEO pay at the top 350 \npublicly traded companies topped $13 million per executive CEO, while \nthe workplace pay gap deepened. In 1989, CEO pay was 100 times the \naverage worker pay. By the year 2000, it was 500 times.\n  Some pointed to this alleged prosperity during the 1990s as a \njustification for deregulating business, weakening regulators, and \nmaking it harder\n\n[[Page S6562]]\n\nto seek corporate insiders and advisers. But now we are learning that \nsome portion of the success and profits claimed by the companies during \nthe 1990s--we still don't know how much--were based on corporate \nmisconduct.\n  Lies about income and profits, hidden debt, improper insider trading, \ntax evasion, conflicts of interest--the list of recent corporate \nmalfeasance is an alphabet of woe.\n  Adelphia Communications. This is a publicly traded company, but the \ncompany founders, the Rigas family, are accused of using the company \ntreasury as if it were the family piggy bank. The allegation is that \nthe family borrowed from the company over $2 billion--yes, billion--and \nhas yet to pay it back. The company recently declared bankruptcy under \nChapter 11.\n  Dynegy. This high tech energy firm is under SEC investigation for \npossibly inflated earnings and hidden debt. The questions include how \nit valued its energy derivatives, whether it booked imaginary income \nfrom capacity swaps with other companies, and whether it manipulated \nthe California energy market. Senior executives, including CEO Chuck \nWatson, have recently been forced out.\n  Enron. This high tech company epitomizes much of the corporate \nmisconduct hurting American business today, from deceptive financial \nstatements to excessive executive pay. Its executives, directors, \nauditors and lawyers all failed to prevent the abuses, and many \nprofited from them.\n  Global Crossing. This is another high tech corporate failure with \noutrageous facts. Less than 5 years old, Global Crossing was founded in \n1997 by Chairman of the Board Gary Winnick. In 1998, the company went \npublic, touting its plans to establish a worldwide fiber optic network. \nGlobal Crossing gave Mr. Winnick millions of dollars in pay, plus \nmillions more in stock and stock options. In the 4 years the company \ntraded on the stock market. Mr. Winnick cashed in company stock for \nmore than $735 million. Other company insiders sold almost $4 billion \nin company stock. Then questions began to arise about inflated \nearnings, related party transactions, insider dealing, and board of \ndirector conflicts. In January 2002, the company suddenly declared \nbankruptcy. The company's shareholders and creditors have lost almost \neverything, while corporate insiders have so far walked away with their \nbillions intact.\n  Halliburton. The question here is whether this construction company \nimproperly booked income from contract cost overruns on construction \njobs, before the company actually received the income. The company is \nunder SEC investigation.\n  IBM. This all-American company, once a model of American know-how and \ncan-do, has recently acknowledged misreporting about $6 billion in \nrevenue and restated its earnings by more than $2 billion. Another high \ntech disaster for investors and American business.\n  ImClone. ImClone's CEO, Samuel Waksal, has been indicted for insider \ntrading. The company produced a new drug whose effectiveness is still \nin question and whose developer, Dr. John Mendelsohn, was not only an \nImClone board member but also the President of M.D. Andersen Cancer \nCenter in Texas. Dr. Mendelsohn arranged for the Center to conduct \ntests on the drug without telling patients that the Center's President \nhad a direct economic interest in the drug's success. Dr. Mendelsohn \nwas also a board member at Enron.\n  Kmart. This once successful company, headquartered in my home state \nof Michigan, is now bankrupt and under scrutiny by the SEC for possible \naccounting fraud. The pain of the employees who lost their jobs and the \ninvestors who lost their savings is ongoing, not only in Michigan but \nacross the country.\n  Merrill Lynch. Once a highly respected investment advisor, this \ncompany has become a poster child for financial advisors who mislead \ntheir investors, telling them to buy the stock of companies the \nadvisers privately think are losers. Merrill Lynch recently paid $100 \nmillion and agreed to change how its financial analysts and investment \nbankers operate to settle a suit filed by New York Attorney General \nElliot Spitzer.\n  Qwest Communications. This is another high tech company under SEC \ninvestigation. Questions include whether it inflated revenues for 2000 \nand 2001 due to capacity swaps and equipment sales. Qwest's CEO Joe \nNacchio, made $232 million in stock options in 3 years before the stock \nprice dropped, leaving investors high and dry. Its Chairman Philip \nAnschutz made $1.9 billion.\n  Rite Aid. Last month, three former top executives of Rite Aid \nCorporation, a nationwide drugstore chain, were indicted for an illegal \naccounting scheme that briefly--until WorldCom--qualified as the \nlargest corporate earnings restatement in U.S. business history. The \nrestatement involved $1.6 billion. The indictment alleges that the \ncompany used brazen accounting gimmicks to overstate its earnings \nduring the late 1990s, and when investigators came after them, made \nfalse statements and obstructed justice.\n  Stanley Works. This company is a leading example of U.S. corporations \nthat have pretended to move their headquarters to Bermuda to avoid \npaying U.S. taxes. It joins a growing number of companies that want to \ngo on enjoying US banks, US laws, and US workers, but do not want to \npay their fair share of the costs that make this country work from the \ncosts of public education, to police and the courts, to environmental \nprotection laws. To me, these companies are not just minimizing their \ntaxes, they are demeaning their citizenship. They are taking advantage \nof this country by enjoying its fruits without giving anything back. No \ncompany ought to be allowed to get away with this fiction and throw \ntheir tax burden on the backs of other US taxpayers.\n  Tyco International. Last month, the CEO of Tyco, Dennis Kozlowski, \nwas indicted in New York for failing to pay sales tax due on millions \nof dollars of artwork. The allegation is that Mr. Kozlowski shipped \nempty boxes to New Hampshire in a scam to show that $13 million worth \nof artwork was sent out of state and exempt from sales tax when, in \nfact, the artwork never left New York. This is a millionaire, many \ntimes over, who could have easily afforded the tax bill but engaged in \na sham to avoid paying it. The question is whether he ran his company \nthe same way he ran his own affairs.\n  Tyco is one of those companies that has allegedly moved its \nheadquarters to Bermuda. It has numerous offshore subsidiaries, \nincluding more than 150 in Barbados, the Cayman Islands and Jersey. The \ncompany's U.S. tax payments have apparently dropped dramatically. \nAllegations of corporate misconduct by insiders have also emerged. \nThere was a $20 million payment made to one of the company's directors \nand another $35 million in compensation and loans paid to the company's \nformer legal counsel. That's $55 million paid to two corporate \ninsiders, allegedly without the knowledge of the Board of Directors. \nAdded to that is an ongoing SEC investigation allegedly examining \nwhether a Tyco subsidiary paid bribes to win a contract in Venezuela.\n\n  WorldCom. WorldCom is the latest in this list of corporate \nembarrassments. It built a glowing earnings record through the \nacquisition of high tech companies like MCI and UUNet. It became a \nfavorite investment for pension companies, mutual funds and average \ninvestors. Then we learn that the longtime CEO Bernard Ebbers borrowed \nover $366 million in company funds and has yet to pay it back. After \nhe's forced out and a new CEO takes over, we learn that the company \nbooked ordinary expenses as if they were capital investments in order \nto string out the expenses over several years and make the current \nbottom line look great. The result was $3.8 billion that had been \nconveniently left off the books--more than enough to wipe out the \ncompany's entire earnings for last year; more than enough for 17,000 \nworkers to lose their jobs; more than enough to wipe out billions in \ninvestments across the country. Just one example in Michigan is the \nMunicipal Employee's Retirement System which lost $116 million that \nsupported workers' pensions. At the same time, we're told that Mr. \nEbbers has a corporate pension that will pay him over $1 million per \nyear for life.\n  Xerox. This all-American company has already paid $10 million to \nsettle an SEC complaint that, for four years, the company used \nfraudulent accounting to improve its financial results. As\n\n[[Page S6563]]\n\npart of the settlement, Xerox agreed to restate its earnings after \nallegedly recording over $3 billion in phony revenues between 1997 and \n2000.\n  This list is painful in part because it includes some icons of \nAmerican business, symbols of what was right about the American dream. \nNow they symbolize corporate misconduct damaging to the entire country. \nThe S index has plunged. The Nasdaq has been down 20% and even 30%. \nMutual funds, the equity of choice for average investors, have dropped \nin value by more than 10%. The average daily trading volume at Charles \nSchwab & Co.--a measure of average investor activity--is down 54% from \nthe height of the bull market, according to Fortune Magazine. Investor \nconfidence in the U.S. stock market has dramatically declined. Foreign \ninvestment is fleeing.\n  There are many explanations for the corporate misconduct now tainting \nAmerican business. One key factor is the terrible performance of too \nmany in the accounting profession.\n  Auditors play an essential role in the checks and balances on the \ncorporate marketplace. Under current law, a publicly traded company is \nnot allowed to participate in the stock market unless its financial \nstatements have been audited and found by an independent public \naccounting firm to be fair and honest. Auditors are supposed to be the \nfirst line of defense against companies cheating on their books.\n  The Supreme Court put it this way in United States v. Arthur Young, \n465 U.S. 805, 1984, a case that contrasts the role of auditors with the \nrole of lawyers. The Court noted that a lawyer is supposed to be a \nclient's confidential advisor, but the:\n\n       . . . independent certified public accountant performs a \n     different role. By certifying the public reports that \n     collectively depict a corporation's financial status, the \n     independent auditor assumes a public responsibility \n     transcending any employment relationship with the client . . \n     . [and] owes ultimate allegiance to the corporation's \n     creditors and stockholders, as well as to the investing \n     public. . . . This `public watchdog' function demands that \n     the accountant maintain total independence from the client at \n     all times and requires complete fidelity to the public trust.\n\nBut that's not what has happened recently.\n  In Adelphia, the auditors, Deloitte Touche, allegedly missed the fact \nthat the Rigas family borrowed company funds totaling $2 billion.\n  At WorldCom, Andersen allegedly never knew that $3.8 billion in \nexpenses had been incorrectly accounted for as capital investments.\n  At Xerox, KPMG allegedly missed errors involving $6 billion in \nrevenue and $2 billion in earnings.\n  These are not marginal amounts; they involve billions. How did the \nauditors miss the accounting errors and dishonest financial reports? Or \nare these cases like Enron, where the auditor didn't miss the \nproblems--they knew of them, had misgivings about the accounting, but \nallowed questionable transactions and financial statements to go \nforward anyway?\n  And there are many more cases than the high profile scandals I just \ndescribed. In the last few years, there has been a surge in corporate \nrestatements--financial filings in which a publicly traded company \nadmits that a prior financial statement was inaccurate and corrects the \nearlier information. From 1990 through 1997, publicly traded companies \naveraged 49 of these restatements per year. In 1999 and 2000, that \nnumber tripled--publicly traded companies filed about 150 each year.\n  These restatements go beyond the list of companies I started with, \nreaching much deeper into corporate America. In addition to those \nalready reported in the media over the last few years, I asked the \nCongressional Research Service to look at the most recent corporate \nrestatements, those filed since January of this year. On June 17th, CRS \nissued a report listing over 100 completed and expected restatements in \nthe first six months of 2002, and predicted that the total number of \nrestatements in 2002 may exceed 200. A smattering of these \nrestatements, another alphabet of corporate woe, include the following.\n  American Physicians Service Group. This health services company \nrestated its 2000 and 2001 earnings due to a revaluation of a private \nstock investment.\n  CMS Energy Corporation. This energy company, which has operations in \nMichigan, has restated its 2000 and 2001 financial statements to \ninclude $4.4 billion in revenues attributable to ``wash trades'' with \nother companies involving energy commodities.\n  Dollar General Corporation. This company has restated its financial \nresults for three years, 1998 through 2000.\n  Hanover Compression. This company has restated its earnings for seven \nquarters in a row, ending September 2001.\n  Microsoft. Following an SEC investigation, the flagship American \ncompany agreed to restate its earnings for 1995 through 1998, when it \nused accounting devices to ``smooth'' its reported earnings.\n  PNC Financial services. This financial services company has restated \nits financial results for 2001 after questionable accounting under \ninvestigation by the Federal Reserve and SEC involving the sale of over \n$700 million in problem loans and other non-performing assets to three \ncompanies it set up with the insurance conglomerate, American \nInternational Group.\n  Pacific Gas & Electric. This energy company has announced that it \nwill restate its earnings back to 1999 to account for off-the-books \n``synthetic leases'' involving about $1 billion in financing for \nseveral power plants.\n  Peregrine Systems. This company announced it would restate earnings \nfor 2000, 2001, and 2002, and that an SEC investigation was in \nprogress.\n  Stillwater Mining Co. This company announced that the SEC had \ncriticized its accounting practices and a restatement of earnings would \nbe issued.\n  There are many more examples. What is happening that more and more \nfinancial results have to be restated, erasing more and more questions \nabout the reliability of the original financial reports? Why this surge \nin corporate restatements?\n  Part of the answer is that too many accounting firms apparently no \nlonger value in their watchdog role. Today, they celebrate instead the \nearnings they receive as tax advisers and business consultants.\n  During the 1990s, all the major accounting firms dramatically \nincreased the non-audit services they provided to their audit clients. \nBy 1999, 50% of firm revenues at the big five accounting firms came \nfrom consulting, while only 34% came from auditing. A few years later, \nthe data indicates that almost 75 percent of the fees earned by the big \nfive accounting firms came from non-audit services. Specific company \nproxy statements show that many publicly traded companies now pay \nmillions more for consulting than they do for auditing, including such \ncompanies as Raytheon, Apple Computer, Nike, International Paper, At, \nHoneywell and Coca-Cola. A January 2002 Harvard Business School \npublication raising questions about auditor independence cited \nanecdotal evidence that accounting firms were using their positions as \nauditors to obtain consulting work, including by ``lowballing'' audit \nfees if a company simultaneous agreed to a consulting contract. The \nwork done by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I \nchair, includes evidence that accounting firms are shopping around to \npublicly traded companies, including their audit clients, complex \naccounting arrangements that they say will improve a company's \nfinancial results and pending complex tax strategies that will lower \nits tax bills.\n  The role of Arthur Andersen at Enron illustrate the profession's \nmovement from auditor to moneymaker, Andersen was Enron's outside \nauditor from the company's inception in 1985. As Enron grew, Andersen's \nrole at the company grew, with more and more of Andersen's time spent \non financial services other than auditing.\n  Andersen began to offer Enron business and tax consulting services \nwhich included assistance in designing special purpose entities, \noffshore affiliates, and complex structured finance transactions. For \nexample, Andersen was paid about $5.7 million to help Enron design the \nLJM and Chewco partnerships and engage in a series of purported asset \nsales to these entities. Andersen was paid more than $1.3 million to \nhelp Enron set up the Raptors, a series of four complex transactions \nthat were an improper attempt by Enron to use the value of its own \nstock to offset losses in its investment portfolio. Andersen also \nhelped Enron engage in\n\n[[Page S6564]]\n\never more exotic and complex transactions, such as prepaid forward \ncontracts, swaps, and merchant asset sales. For two years, Andersen \neven acted an Enron's internal auditor while also serving an Enron's \noutside auditor.\n  By 1999, Andersen was earning more for its non-audit services than \nfor its audit services at Enron. By then, Andersen had set up its own \noffices at the company site to enable it to work with Enron employees \non a daily basis. A number of Andersen employees switched to Enron's \npayroll. Enron became one of Andersen's largest clients, In 2000, \nAndersen was paid $1 million per week for the many services it was \nproviding Enron. Andersen partners handling the Enron account earned \nmillions in bonuses and partnership income.\n  Common sense tells us that as Andersen's joint efforts with Enron \nmanagement increased, it became tougher and tougher for Andersen \nauditors to challenge Enron transactions--after all, these transactions \nhad been set up with Andersen's assistance at the cost of millions of \ndollars. How could Andersen auditors say that Andersen consultants were \nwrong? And in many cases the same Andersen employee served as both \nconsultant and auditor, essentially auditing his or her own work. We \nnow know that internal Andersen documents demonstrate serious \nmisgivings up and down the Andersen chain of command with respect to \nEnron's transactions or accounting. To the contrary, one of the few \nAndersen senior partners to raise gentle objections to some Enron \ntransactions was, at Enron's request, removed from the Enron account. \nIn the end, Andersen approved questionable transactions and financial \nstatements that made Enron's financial condition appear better than it \nwas.\n  Andersen once had a proud tradition that stressed its commitment to \nthe public trust to ensure accurate financial reporting and honest \naccounting. But that tradition gave way in the Enron case. And it give \nway in other recent cases of corporate misconduct as well, from Sunbeam \nto Waste Management to the Baptist Foundation of America.\n  Worse, Andersen was not alone. Media reports are filled with tales of \nauditors going along with questionable transactions and financial \nreporting. PricewaterhouseCoopers and Microstrategy. Ernst & Young and \nPNC Financial. Deloitte Touche and Adelphia. KPMG and Xerox.\n  The conflicts of interest inherent in auditors performing consulting \nservices for their audit clients have been building for years and were \nnot lost on those concerned about accurate financial reporting by U.S. \ncompanies. In 2000, SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt waged a highly visible \ncampaign to rein in auditor conflicts of interest and restore auditor \nindependence. In July 2000, under his leadership, the SEC proposed \nregulations to stop auditors from providing certain non-audit services \nto their audit clients. The rules proposed four principles to determine \nwhether, in fact and in appearance, an accountant was independent of \nits audit client. The proposed regulations stated that an accountant \nwould not be considered independent if the accountant: (1) had a mutual \nor conflicting interest with the audit client; (2) audited the \naccountant's own work; (3) functioned as an employee of the audit \nclient; or (4) acted as an advocate for the audit client. Using these \nfour principles, the regulations proposed a ban on audit firms \nperforming certain non-audit services for their audit clients.\n  The reaction of the accounting profession was to fight the proposal \ntooth and nail. The proposed regulations were also pummeled by the \ncorporate community, which lost sight of how important reliable \nfinancial statements and reliable auditors are to the viability of \nAmerican business and investment.\n  In the end, the proposed Levitt regulations were gutted. Instead of \neliminating auditor conflicts, a compromise emerged that simply \nincreased disclosure of the scope of the conflicts and the extent to \nwhich auditors were auditing their own work. That was the wrong result, \nwhich I hope the Senate will remedy through enactment of the Sarbanes \nbill.\n  What happened to the board?\n  In U.S. corporations, Boards of Directors are at the top of a \ncompany's governing structure. According to the Business Roundtable, \nthe Board's ``paramount duty'' is to safeguard the interests of a \ncompany's shareholders. Persons who serve on corporate boards are \nrequired by state law to serve as fiduciaries to the shareholders and \nemployees of the corporation for which they serve. As the Fifth Circuit \nsaid in 1984:\n\n       Three broad duties stem from the fiduciary status of \n     corporate directors: namely, the duties of obedience, loyalty \n     and due care. The duty of obedience requires a director to \n     avoid committing . . . acts beyond the scope of the powers of \n     a corporation as defined by its charter or the laws of the \n     state of incorporation. . . . The duty of loyalty dictates \n     that a director must not allow his personal interest to \n     prevail over the interests of the corporation. . . . [T]he \n     duty of care requires a director to be diligent and prudent \n     in managing the corporation's affairs.\n\n  One of the most important duties of the Board--along with corporate \nofficers and company auditors--is to make sure that the financial \nstatements are in fair representation of the company's financial \ncondition. It requires more than technical compliance; it requires, as \nthe Second Circuit Court of Appeals said in 1969, that the Board ensure \nthat the financial statement ``as a whole fairly present[s] the \nfinancial position'' of the company.\n  The key committee of a board in carrying out that function is the \nAudit Committee, and a Blue Ribbon Commission in 2000 issued a report \non what Audit Committees should do to meet their obligation to the \nshareholders. Among the responsibilities the Audit Committee should \nmeet are: ensuring that the auditor is independent and objective; \nassessing the quality, not just the acceptability, of an auditor's \nwork; discussing with the auditor significant auditing issues; and \nmaking sure that the financial statement are ``in conformity with \ngenerally accepted accounting principles.''\n  As I mentioned at the beginning of this statement, the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, looked in depth at the \nactions of the Board of Directors on the Enron Corporation in light of \nits sudden collapse and bankruptcy. The Subcommittee on a bipartisan \nbasis found that the Enron Board failed to safeguard Enron shareholders \nand contributed to Enron's collapse. If failed, we found, because the \nBoard allowed Enron to engage in high risk accounting, inappropriate \nconflict of interest transactions, extensive undisclosed off-the-books \nactivities, and excessive executive compensation. Based on review of \nthe hundreds of thousands of Enron-related documents by the PSI staff \nand dozens of interviews, the Subcommittee concluded that the Board \nknew about numerous questionable practices by Enron management over \nseveral years, but it chose to ignore these red flags to the detriment \nof Enron shareholders, employees, and business associates. In short, \nthe Enron Board failed to meet its fiduciary responsibility to the \nshareholders and employees of Enron.\n  When pressed to explain their conduct at a PSI hearing, the Board \naccepted no responsibility for Enron's failure. The Board members \nclaimed they didn't know what was going on in the company--that \nmanagement didn't tell them, and that the auditor, Arthur Andersen, \ntold them everything was OK. The Subcommittee didn't accept that \nanswer, because a review of the documents, the Board meetings, the \nAudit and Finance Committee meetings, and interviews with the Board \nmembers revealed that the Board Members did know what was happening at \nEnron and went along with it.\n  The Board failed with respect to the Enron Corporation, and my guess \nis that the boards of the other corporations now under investigation \nfor investor fraud and auditing misconduct will fare little better. \nAlthough the performance of corporate boards in American corporations \nmust be addressed by the corporations themselves, Congress must also do \neverything it can to ensure that this important watchdog of corporate \ngovernance operates properly in each U.S. company.\n  What happened to other corporate players?\n  The auditors and the Boards of Directors are not the only ones with \noversight responsibility for corporate conduct who have let down the \ninvesting\n\n[[Page S6565]]\n\npublic. Top-name law firms wrote legal opinions that allowed some of \nthe worst deceptions to go forward. Financial analysts who depend upon \nlarge corporations for investment banking business and at the same time \npromote the stock of those corporations to their clients, operate with \nclear conflicts of interest. They may know inside information about the \nfinancial condition of the companies with which they do business, but \nkeep that information from the investors to whom they are promoting the \ncompany stock.\n\n  What needs to be done now?\n  The Sarbanes bill, with additional amendments, will address the \nduties and failings of their corporate players. After 10 days of \nhearings, the Banking Committee has reported to the Senate floor a bill \nthat significantly addresses not only the audition failures, but \nfailures of corporate governance and conflicts with financial analysts. \nI understand there may be an amendment to hold the legal profession \naccountable as well.\n  We have got to take action on this legislation now, this Congress. We \nneed to restore the checks and balances on the marketplace, and we need \nto give our cops on the beat the tools and resources to crack down on \ncorporate misconduct.\n  We need to change the laws to make it possible to punish corporate \nand auditor misconduct swiftly and with appropriate penalties. We need \nto ensure that crime does not pay for corporate executives seeking to \nprofit from corporate misconduct. We need to shake up the auditing \nindustry and remind them that their profession calls for them to be \nwatchdogs, not lapdogs for their clients. We need to give SEC \nadministrative enforcement powers and more funds for investigations and \ncivil enforcement actions. We need to increase investor protections to \nrestore investor confidence.\n  The Sarbanes bill takes many of the actions needed, and I want to \ncommend the hard work of not only Senator Sarbanes who chairs the \nBanking Committee, but also the many other Senators on that Committee \nwho contributed to this much needed bill. It offers strong medicine, \nand it is what this country needs.\n  On corporate misconduct, the bill presents a number of new provisions \nto deter and punish wrongdoing. For the first time, CEOs and CFOs would \nbe required to certify that company financial statements fairly present \nthe company's financial condition. If a misleading financial statement \nlater resulted in a restatement, the CEO and CFO would have to forfeit \nand return to the company coffer any bonus, stock or stock option \ncompensation received in the 12 months following the misleading \nfinancial report. The bill would also make it an unlawful act for any \ncompany officer or director to attempt to mislead or coerce an auditor. \nIt would also require auditors to discuss specific accounting issues \nwith the company's audit committee, which will not only increase the \nunderstanding of the company's board of directors, but also prevent \ndirectors from later claiming they were not informed about the \ncompany's accounting practices. The bill would also enable the SEC to \nremove unfit officers or directors from office and to bar them from \nholding any future position at a publicly traded corporation. These are \npowerful new tools to help prevent and punish corporate misconduct.\n  The Sarbanes bill takes on another great issue of importance that \nI've been working on for years, strengthening the independence of the \nFinancial Accounting Standards Board or FASB, which has the task of \nissuing generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP. Among other \nimportant measures, the bill grants statutory recognition to FASB and \nsets out its obligation to act in the public interest to ensure the \naccuracy and effectiveness of financial reporting; states that the \ntrustees who select FASB's members must represent investors and the \npublic, not just the accounting industry or corporate interests; and \nstreamlines FASB's operations by requiring it to act by majority vote \ninstead of through a supermajority.\n  Most important of all, the bill sets up a system that provides FASB \nwith an independent, stable source of funding through fees assessed on \npublicly traded companies. Once this new system is set up, it will no \nlonger be the case, as it has been for years, that FASB will have to go \nhat in hand for funds from the very companies and accounting firms that \nwant to affect its decisionmaking. I have no doubt that this conflict \nof interest has contributed to some of the distortions and weaknesses \nin current accounting standards. I proposed a similar change in FASB's \nfunding status in my Shareholder Bill of Rights Act, and I appreciate \nthe Committee's including the provision for my bill making it clear \nthat FASB's funding cannot be affected by the congressional \nappropriations process and the political pressures that can be exerted \nthrough it. The point of the bill is to set up an independent, stable \nsource of funding that is insulated from political pressure and funding \nthreats so that FASB can do its work free of such pressures and \nthreats. Once the new funding system is in place, I urge FASB to begin \nto reassess U.S. accounting standards and to begin to clear up some of \nthe problems that have allowed so many companies to engage in dishonest \naccounting while claiming to be in compliance with GAAP.\n  On auditor conflicts of interest, the bill takes concrete action to \nstop auditors from providing non-audit services to their audit clients. \nFor the first time, the bill specifically prohibits auditors from \nproviding 8 types of non-audit services to their audit clients. The 8 \nprohibited services are bookeeping services; financial information \nsystems design; appraisal and valuation services and fairness opinions; \nactuarial service; internal auditing services; management functions and \nhuman resource services; broker-dealer, investment adviser of \ninvestment banking service; and non-audit legal or expert services. The \nbill also enables a newly established Public Company Accounting \nOversight Board to specify other prohibited services. Any other non-\naudit service can be provided by an auditor to its audit client only if \nthe client's audit committee specifically authorizes the auditor to \nundertake the service. While I would have preferred an even stronger \nprovision barring auditors from providing any non-audit services to an \naudit client, this bill makes a meaningful change in law that would \nhelp put an end to auditor conflicts of interest.\n  Additional work is needed. For example, many of the key terms in the \n8 prohibited non-audit services were left undefined after the Banking \nCommittee, as part of the negotiations over the bill, dropped a \nrequirement for the SEC to promulgate the July 2000 Levitt regulations \nwhich would have defined many of the terms. If enacted into law, the \nnew Board and the SEC would need to place a priority on further \ndefining the key terms in the 8 prohibited services. That task would be \na key test of their willingness to use the bill's authority to \neliminate auditor conflicts of interest and restore auditor \nindependence.\n  Let me give you an example. The bill currently prohibits auditors \nfrom providing their audit clients with ``investment banking services'' \nbut does not define this term. Based upon the work of the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations into the Enron scandal, I believe it is \ncrucial for that term to include prohibiting auditors from working with \ntheir audit clients to design special purpose entities and structured \nfinance arrangements, as investment bankers do, and then audit the \nstructures they helped to create. In the case of Enron, Andersen was \npaid about $7 million to help Enron design the LJM, Chewco and Raptor \nstructures, which Andersen then audited and approved. That never should \nhappen. Auditors should not be auditing their own work. To make sure \nthat this conduct is stopped, the SEC and Board would have to prohibit \nit either by further defining the term ``investment banking services'' \nor by specifying another prohibited service. The public companies' \naudit committees could also accomplish this goal by prohibiting the \ncompany's auditor from designing these structures and then auditing its \nown work.\n  In addition to defining the key terms in the 8 prohibited services, \nadditional work is needed to clarify how auditors and companies are \nsupposed to treat the issue of ``tax services.'' The bill states \nexplicitly that an auditor may provide ``tax services'' to an audit \nclient if the specific tax services are cleared beforehand by the \ncompany's audit committee. There are several\n\n[[Page S6566]]\n\nproblems with this approach. First, like investment banking services, \none danger is that an auditor will end up auditing its own work, which \nmeans that a critical check and balance on possible company misconduct \nwill be circumvented. No auditor should assist a company in designing a \ntax strategy to lower the company's tax bill and then also serve as the \nauditor approving the accounting for that tax strategy. Two different \nparties must be involved--one to design the strategy and one to audit \nit for improper accounting and possible illegal tax evasion. A second \nproblem involves the fees paid for various types of tax services. In \nthe July 2000 regulations proposed by the SEC under former Chairman \nLevitt, concerns were raised about allowing an auditor to provide an \naudit client with written opinions related to a tax shelter or other \ntax strategy to lower the client's tax bill. Providing these opinions, \nespecially for complex or questionable tax strategies, can lead to \nlucrative fees for an accounting firm and, in so doing, raise the same \nconflict of interest concerns that have so damaged auditor \nindependence.\n  These and other non-audit service issues needed to be examined by the \nBoard and the SEC, not only to develop definitions for key terms, but \nalso to determine whether additional non-auditing services should be \nadded to the list of 8 prohibited services now specified in the Senate \nbill. Audit committees must also confront these issues and take the \nsteps necessary to prohibit the company's auditor from engaging in non-\nauditing services that raise conflict of interest concerns or lead to \nan auditor's auditing its own work for the company.\n  On auditor misconduct and oversight of accounting firms, the Sarbanes \nbill offers fundamental change that is sorely needed. The new Public \nCompany Accounting Oversight Board that the bill would establish is \ndesigned to be free of domination by either accounting or corporate \ninterests and would enjoy an independent and stable source of funding. \nThis Board would have several duties including issuing auditing, \nauditor independence, and auditor ethical standards; inspecting and \nreporting on the internal controls and operations of registered public \naccounting firms; and conducting disciplinary proceedings regarding \naccountants suspected of wrongdoing.\n  With respect to investigating possible auditor misconduct, the Board \nwill have the authority to subpoena documents, take sworn testimony, \nand impose meaningful sanctions on individual accountants and \naccounting firms found to have engaged in wrongdoing. The sanctions \ninclude revoking the registration that a firm needs to audit public \ncompanies, barring a person from participating in a public company \naudit, imposing a civil fine on an individual or firm, and issuing a \ncensure. The Board must also disclose its disciplinary proceedings to \nthe public so that we will know what misconduct was involved and what \nsanction was imposed.\n  This provision represents significant improvement over existing \ndisciplinary proceedings which are dominated by the accounting \nindustry, secretive, time-consuming, and ineffective. It also has at \nleast two weaknesses. First, although the bill requires the Board to \nissue a public report on any disciplinary proceeding that results in a \nsanction on an auditor, the bill is silent on public disclosure of \ndisciplinary proceedings that do not result in a sanction. The bill \napparently leaves it to the discretion of the Board on whether to \ndisclose these disciplinary proceedings, but a better approach might \nhave been to direct the Board to disclose such proceedings when doing \nso would be in the public interest. A second, more serious weakness is \nthat the provision imposes an automatic, unlimited stay on any auditor \nsanction imposed by the Board if the sanction is appealed to the SEC. \nUntil the SEC lifts the stay, the Board is prohibited from disclosing \nto the public the name of the auditor, the sanction imposed, or the \nreasons for the disciplinary action. These provisions are out of line \nwith broker-dealer disciplinary proceedings and only serve to prolong \ncriticisms of auditor disciplinary practices as overly secretive and \nslow moving.\n  On the issue of auditing, auditor independence, and auditor ethical \nstandards, I fully support making the Board the final arbiter of these \nstandards. The standard-setting process has for too long been under the \ndirect control of the accounting industry, and one of the most \nimportant changes the bill makes is to put an end to this arrangement. \nOf course, the accounting industry is not and should not be excluded \nfrom the Board's standard-setting process; the bill requires the Board \nto engage in an ongoing dialog with the accounting, corporate and \ninvestor communities to take advantage of their expertise. The bill \nexplicitly requires the Board to ``cooperate'' with any designated \nprofessional group of accountants or any advisory board convened by the \nBoard to assist its deliberations. The bill also states that the Board \nmust ``respond in a timely fashion'' to any request for a change in the \nstandards if the request is made by a designated professional group or \nadvisory committee. It is important to note, however, that the bill \ndoes not grant any preferential status to these groups compared to \nother participants in the standard-setting process, and participants \nsuch as the SEC, state accounting boards, other federal and state \nagencies and standard-setting bodies, and investors are entitled to \nreceive equal consideration from the Board in its standard-setting \ndeliberations.\n  On the issue of accounting oversight, the Sarbanes bill again offers \nvast improvement over the status quo. The newly created Board offers \noversight authority that will be more independent, more systematic and \nmore public than the existing system. And, again, one comment. With \nrespect to the inspection reports that the Board is supposed to \ndisclose to the public regarding a registered public accounting firm's \noperations, the bill states that the Board must develop a procedure to \nallow the registered public accounting firm that is the subject of the \ninspection an opportunity to comment on the draft report before it is \nfinalized. I support this process. However, it is also my understanding \nafter consulting with the Committee, that the bill is not intended to \nrequire the Board to submit the actual text of its draft report to the \nsubject firm prior to making it public, but rather to inform and \ndiscuss the key points with the firm and provide the firm with a \nmeaningful opportunity to comment on the Board's analysis, commit to \nspecific steps to cure any defects in the firm's quality control \nsystems, and commit to other reforms.\n\n  Finally, on the issue of increased resources, the Sarbanes bill takes \nlong needed steps to beef up the SEC's enforcement staff through \nauthority to hire new accountants, lawyers, investigators and support \npersonnel. It also increases the SEC's budgetary authority. Once this \nis enacted into law, it will be up to the Bush Administration and the \nAppropriations Committees to give the SEC what it needs to respond to \nthe current wave of corporate scandals and help restore investor \nconfidence.\n  There are many other provisions in the bill that I could comment on, \nbut I will stop here. The bottom line is that the Sarbanes bill is a \nstrong bill. It provides new tools and resources to go after corporate \nmisconduct. It offers fundamental change in the way we oversee the \naccounting industry and punish auditor wrongdoing. It tackles auditor \nconflicts of interest by setting up, for the first time, prohibitions \non the non-auditing services that an auditor can provide to an audit \nclient. It provides new ways to hold corporate insiders accountable, so \nthe next time a public company erupts in scandal, the senior officers \nand directors can't claim that they were out of the loop and not \nresponsible.\n  As strong as it is, the Sarbanes bill would benefit from a number of \nstrengthening measures. This includes the amendment by Senator Leahy to \nstrengthen criminal penalties for corporate misconduct and to protect \ncorporate whistleblowers, which I am cosponsoring, and an amendment by \nSenator Edwards to require legal counsel to play a more active role in \ndeterring corporate misconduct.\n  I intend to offer several amendments myself.\n  Administrative penalties: Senators Bill Nelson, Tom Harkin, and I \nwill offer an amendment to give new authority to the SEC to impose \nadministrative penalties for corporate wrongdoing. The amendments would \nallow\n\n[[Page S6567]]\n\nthe SEC to impose civil monetary penalties on persons who violate the \nsecurities laws such as companies, officers, directors, auditors, and \nlawyers and to bar unfit officers and directors of publicly traded \ncorporations without having to go to court to do so. The amendment \nwould also allow the SEC to subpoena financial records as part of an \nofficial SEC investigation without notifying the subject of the records \nrequest. This amendment would also increase the maximum civil fines the \nSEC can impose on securities laws violators under current law and the \nnew authority provided by this amendments. Today's fines of $6,500 to \n$600,000 per violation would increase to $100,000 to $10 million.\n  Auditor certification. A second amendment I intend to offer would \nrequire that auditors of publicly traded corporation provide a written \nopinion on whether a client company's financial statements fairly \npresent the financial condition of the company. The Sarbanes bill has a \nsimilar provision with respect to CEOs and CFOs. Many think this is \nalready required of auditors of publicly traded companies, but there is \nno provision in current law that imposes such a requirement; there is \nonly guidance pursuant to SEC regulation.\n  Auditors communication with board of directors: My third amendment \nwould require that an auditor of a publicly traded corporation discuss \nwith the Audit Committee on the Board of Directors the ``quality, \nacceptability, clarity, and aggressiveness'' of the company's financial \nstatements and accounting principles. This amendment will eliminate any \nexcuse that the Board of Directors of a company didn't know what the \ncompany was doing.\n  There were many investors and commentators in the 1990's who \nexpressed their awe of the astronomical growth in the stock market by \nsaying it was too good to be true. Well, they were right. It was too \ngood to be true, and now we know that. This bill, particularly with \nsome strengthening amendments will bring credibility and accuracy back \nto the financial statements of our publicly traded corporations. It \nwill bring reality into the marketplace and make the deceptive \npractices of the 1990's the true exception rather than the rule.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/10/senate-section/article/S6567-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6567-S6568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       DELAYING ACTION ON S. 2673\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, it is my understanding that \nwhat has happened here is that our friend and colleague, the senior \nSenator from Michigan, has asked for unanimous consent, earlier, and it \nwas denied by the senior Senator from Texas, in order to proceed with \nthe offering of an amendment that would considerably strengthen the \nunderlying bill that we have under consideration.\n  It is with a heavy heart that I saw the parliamentary tactics--\nclearly within any Senator's opportunity to utilize--to delay a piece \nof legislation that would address the issue before us that is \nresonating in the hearts of every American, that being the subject of \ncorporate greed.\n  Indeed, what we have seen is that which is obviously resonating \nbecause I am told the stock market has gone down almost 300 points \ntoday, down to a range of about 8,800. You would think folks would \nrealize that the stock market is a reflection of the confidence of the \nAmerican people, not only in the economy but in a lot of the engines \nthat drive the economy.\n  Most of the great corporate structures are very solid financially as \nwell as ethically, but having seen some of the lapses in ethical \njudgment have led to some of the exposes that we have seen over the \ncourse of the last months, I am rather surprised to see these \nparliamentary delaying tactics by folks from the other side of the \naisle when in fact what the American people would like to know is that \ntheir Representatives in the U.S. Congress are responding with very \ntough laws enacted to address the problems of corporate greed.\n  We can talk about the Enrons. We can talk about the WorldComs. We can \ntalk about whatever. Lord knows what is going to be next. But that is \nwhy Senator Levin and I will be coming to the floor after being denied, \ntonight, the opportunity to offer an amendment that will strengthen the \nunderlying bill. We will come to offer reforms aimed at preventing \ncorporate fraud and punishing its perpetrators.\n  The senior Senator from Michigan, as the Chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, lends an expertise to this body in matters of \ndefense. He has a perspective that, to keep America strong from a \nmilitary standpoint, we have to be economically strong and we have to \nbe morally strong. So that is getting right to the heart of what we are \ndoing, trying to enact a law preventing the perpetrating of corporate \nfraud or then seeing that the perpetrators are punished.\n  There were at WorldCom 17,000 workers who received pink slips. While \nit was realizing $1.1 billion in losses in the retirement funds of \nthose employees, and while those 17,000 employees were getting those \npink slips, the corporate executives were attending a retreat in \nHawaii. One of them was putting the finishing touches on a new $15 \nmillion mansion. I am not absolutely sure, but I think that person is \none and the same person whose $15 million mansion is in my State.\n  Then late last year, Global Crossing laid off 1,200 people, giving \nthem no severance package, while the CEO there walked away with \nhundreds of millions of dollars. Is there something wrong with this \npicture? Yes, there is. And the American people are feeling it. Part of \nthat is what we are seeing resonating in the plunge of America's stock \nmarkets.\n  So last summer, while Enron executives were selling their shares for \nhundreds of millions of dollars and protecting their portfolios, their \nemployees and their retirees lost more than $1.2 billion in retirement \nsavings.\n  Sadly, that includes Janice Farmer, a former Enron employee who is \nnow a retiree. She lives in Orlando. Janice Farmer lost her whole \nsavings--$700,000--in her retirement plan with Enron.\n  Then, if you will recall, the pension fund of the State of Florida \nlost $335 million--more losses than any other State--from Enron stock \npurchases.\n  When we had a hearing in the Commerce Committee with the managers of \nFlorida's pension fund, which covers all of our public employees in \nFlorida, the testimony came out that the money managers of that fund \nwere buying Enron shares based on the management's and the company's \nassertions that everything was OK. But it wasn't. The stock was \ndropping like a rock, but, oh, by the way, not before company \nexecutives had unloaded their shares.\n  In the last 18 months alone, we have seen corporate abuses of \nmonumental proportions. People have had it. Their representatives in \nCongress, I hope, have had it. I can tell you I have had it. So has my \ncolleague, Senator Levin. Eventually, after we have to go through all \nthe parliamentary rankling, we will be allowed to offer our amendment.\n  We must act now to protect taxpayers and employees and investors. We \nmust prevent huge losses for public institutional investors.\n  Now we are looking sadly as thousands of layoffs, earnings and \nrestatements by more than 300 companies with billions of dollars lost \nby ordinary people. The victims are the ones demanding the reforms that \nwe are talking about today. Unfortunately, because of the objections \nrendered by that side of the aisle, we are not able to take that up \ntoday.\n  Those victims and the American people who believe in a strong economy \nwant us to act strongly and swiftly to punish such corporate abuse and \nto prevent corporate abuse. That is why Senator Levin and I want to \nintroduce stronger enforcement measures.\n  We have a package of three amendments. They complement the Sarbanes \nbill by streamlining and strengthening procedures to punish corporate \nand auditor misconduct.\n  There is a glaring shortcoming of our current statutes. The \nSecurities and Exchange Commission is essentially powerless today, even \nafter conducting an investigation and even after finding\n\n[[Page S6568]]\n\nwrongdoing. What the SEC needs is more enforcement authority.\n  The amendments that Senator Levin and I are offering will strengthen \ncivil penalties and provide for more enforcement authority over \ncorporate misconduct. And it will do it in several ways.\n  First, these amendments will grant the SEC administrative authority \nto ban unfit officers and directors from publicly traded corporations. \nAnd the SEC will be able to do so without having to go through the \nlengthy court proceedings in advance that makes it so difficult under \nthe present law to get anything done. Their decisions, however, will be \nsubject to judicial review so that we have the checks and balances.\n  Yesterday, the President gave a speech on Wall Street. He echoed the \nidea that unscrupulous officers and directors should not be able to \nserve in that capacity again. But he offered nothing to enforce that \nprinciple.\n  I hope the President will realize that he was a day late and a dollar \nshort--that his proposal did not have the strength and the backbone \nbehind it. What we offer here will allow the SEC to have the authority \nto remove crooked executives.\n\n  This amendment also will increase the maximum civil fines that the \nSEC can impose on violators of securities laws and increase those by \nmanyfold. Future fines against crooked executives would range from \n$100,000 up to $2 million. Right now some of the fines are only $6,500. \nWhen you are dealing with white-collar crime, you have to hit the \ncriminals where it hurts--in the pocketbook.\n  Our amendment also broadens the authority of the SEC to impose fines \non companies, officers, directors, auditors, and lawyers. Currently, \nthe Commission can only impose fines on narrow categories of regulated \nindividuals, such as brokers and dealers. But this amendment would \nallow the SEC to cast the net wider and go after a broad range of bad \nactors who engage in fraudulent conduct.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Carnahan and I introduced legislation \nadvocating that the SEC take a tough enforcement approach, including \ncriminal prosecutions whenever necessary. We also sought to end the \ncozy relationships among company executives, auditors, and directors, \nmoney managers, analysts, lawyers, and others who create this \nincestuous kind of relationship that does nothing but undermine the \nconfidence of the American people in the corporate structure of this \ncountry.\n  Senator Levin and I are glad to see that a consensus is coming to \nembrace this approach, and if the other side of the aisle will ever let \nus bring this to a vote, it will be widely accepted in this body.\n  The recent Enrons, WorldComs, and other financial tragedies have \ndemonstrated that white-collar crimes can be incredibly damaging--\nrobbing hard-working Americans of their jobs, their savings, and their \nretirements.\n  There is simply no justification for handling corporate wrongdoers \nwith kid gloves. Earlier today Senator Leahy pointed out that if you \ndefraud the public you must go to jail.\n  I came over here hoping that I could give a speech to support Senator \nLevin before we adopted this amendment. But I guess it is going to be \nFriday, or if they drag us on, I guess it will be Monday, or Tuesday. \nBut we will pass this amendment, and we will pass this bill. It is a \nreflection of the will of the American people to keep our country \nstrong and to keep our country free.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/10/senate-section/article/S6568-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I rise today to speak about \nhate crimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of \nlast year. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred July 7, 2002 \nin St. Petersburg, FL. Sonny Gonzales and his friends were walking to \ntheir limousine after a gay pride party when an angry man approached \nthem in a parking garage. ``The first thing out of his mouth was, `` \n`faggots,' '' said Gonzales. The man taunted the group, screamed \nobscenities, and then punched Gonzales and his friends. Gonzales \nsuffered a head laceration. His partner, Stephen Hair, 25, suffered a \nskull fracture, a cracked sinus, and a broken tooth trying to defend \nhim. Authorities arrested Devin Scott Angus, 20, in the attack. He was \ncharged with aggravated battery with great bodily harm and battery \nevidencing prejudice.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/10/senate-section/article/S6568-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6568-S6569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      LOW MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENTS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I submit for the Congressional Record \nseveral additional supporting documents regarding Medicare Metropolitan \nStatistical Areas referenced in my statement on Monday, July 8, 2002.\n  I therefore ask unanimous consent that the additional documents be \nprinted in today's Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Berwick Hospital Center,\n\n                                        Berwick, PA, July 3, 2002.\n     Senator Arlen Specter,\n     Scranton District Office,\n     Scranton, PA.\n       Dear Senator Specter: I am writing to reiterate our support \n     for the proposed increase in Medicare Reimbursement Rates for \n     hospitals in Northeastern Pennsylvania. The proposed increase \n     would mean an additional $800,000 in increased annual \n     reimbursement to Berwick Hospital Center.\n       This increase, if granted, would go directly for training \n     and recruiting health care personnel who are in critically \n     short supply in our area. The hospital currently has 19 \n     registered nurse and 6 licensed practical nurse vacancies. In \n     addition, there are 10 vacancies in the support departments, \n     such as laboratory and radiology. A significant factor in \n     these vacancies is the higher wages and benefits that are \n     paid in the Philadelphia and New York metropolitan areas that \n     are within a 2.5 hour drive from our hospital. Our hospital \n     cannot afford to match these urban wages due to the disparity \n     in our Medicare Reimbursement levels.\n       As such, the proposed increase in Medicare Reimbursement is \n     critical to stop the out-migration of skilled health care \n     workers from our area. Since the average age of nurses in our \n     state is now approaching 45, in the next decade when the Baby \n     Boomer generation reaches retirement age, there will be no \n     nurses and other support personnel to take care of their \n     medical needs in our community. A concerned effort to improve \n     educational opportunities for high school graduates, as well \n     as improved wages for existing workers is needed.\n       Finally, I would urge the Congress to take immediate action \n     on this issue. It will take years to reverse the current \n     trend, through support of new educational programs, and other \n     programs to retain the existing workforce. Postponing a \n     decision will make the current crisis worsen to the point \n     where the health care delivery system in our community will \n     not function.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Marian Community Hospital,\n\n                                     Carbondale, PA, July 8, 2002.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: On behalf of Marian Community \n     Hospital, its Board of Directors, and the greater Carbondale \n     area community, which we serve, we thank you for the efforts \n     that you, Representative Sherwood and your respective staffs \n     have committed to addressing the disparity caused by the \n     Medicare wage index.\n       We know that you are keenly aware of the challenges facing \n     the hospitals in our region but we would like to share with \n     you the following points that were communicated to our Board \n     of Directors through our current operating budget:\n       Over half of the Hospital's healthcare service and \n     activities are provided to patients who are poor and elderly. \n     The reimbursement received from the federal government for \n     services provided to these patients under the Medicaid and \n     Medicare programs are not sufficient to cover the cost of \n     care (approximately 55% of the hospital's costs is for \n     salaries and fringe benefits).\n       For the fourth year in a row, revenues from operations have \n     not been or expect to be adequate to cover the cost of \n     providing care and, accordingly, savings intended for \n     building and equipment replacement were used to cover the \n     unreimbursed costs (Pennsylvania Cost Containment Council \n     indicates these losses are consistent for those hospitals \n     residing in Northeastern Pennsylvania).\n\n[[Page S6569]]\n\n       The Hospital has been faced with a health professional \n     shortage requiring the payment for caregiver services through \n     overtime and use of temporary agencies at a level much \n     greater than anticipated. (Even when staff becomes available, \n     we have been forced to pay higher hourly rates to attract \n     health professionals to the Carbondale area.)\n       This past spring, the Hospital's provider of professional \n     and general liability insurance (PHICO) become insolvent \n     requiring the use of expensive alternatives and financial \n     resources that were not planned until a solution could be \n     formulated with other Pennsylvania hospitals in a like \n     situation.\n       Capital expenditures and replacement of medical equipment \n     in the current fiscal year will need to be reprioritized \n     until relief from unreimbursed costs can be resolved.\n       Thank you again for your interest in our Hospital and in \n     the Northeast region of Pennsylvania. We are prepared to \n     participate in any way in hearings with your Committee to \n     resolve this crises.\n           Respectfully yours,\n                                                  Thomas L.

In 2000, our base payment rate actually \n     decreased because of a reduction in the wage index.\n       With increases in our payments that do not surpass the \n     rising cost of healthcare, the hospital is put in a position \n     where, in order to staff the lone hospital within a 45-mile \n     radius, it must tap into its own cash reserves that were \n     earmarked for improved capital equipment.\n       It's imperative that the wage index be increased to allow \n     the patients that we serve get the equipment and the care \n     that they deserve. Without that increase, it's only a matter \n     of time before the hospital's own cash reserves are depleted.\n       In negotiating with an HMO, the hospital can bargain to \n     receive higher payments; with federal or state insurance, the \n     hospital has to take what is offered. Congress should do its \n     best to make sure that the payment it offers is a fair one.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/10/senate-section/article/S6569-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM B.

Madam, President, I rise today to pay tribute to \none of New Mexico's favorite daughters, Nancy Lopez, who over the \nFourth of July holiday concluded her full-time career on the Ladies \nProfessional Golf Association tour.\n  Nancy has a remarkable history not only as a player, but as an \ninspirational role model, who overcame hardships like racial and gender \nbias, to reach remarkable heights as a golfer. She did so with an inner \nstrength, natural talent and the sustaining guidance of her loving \nparents, Marina and Domingo. They scrimped and saved to help Nancy \nreach her potential, which culminated at the pinnacle of the \nprofessional golfing world.\n  Her father's love for golf helped Nancy tap her natural talent for \nthe sport at the young age of 8. She soon excelled, winning the New \nMexico Women's Amateur title at 12, followed by twice winning the USGA \nJunior Girls Championship.\n  Nancy successfully petitioned the New Mexico Activities Association \nto be allowed to play on the boy's team at the Robert H. Goddard High \nSchool in Roswell. She honed her talents as a player at Tulsa \nUniversity and turned pro in 1977.\n  From the little girl who first swung a club with her father on \nRoswell's public course, Nancy embarked on a 25-year career that \nbrought greater public attention to the LPGA. In her first full year as \na professional, she won nine tournaments and grabbed another eight \ntitles in 1979. In all, Nancy has won 48 titles on the LPGA Tour and \nhas rightfully been identified as the key figure who helped popularize \nwomen's golf.\n  In 1987, she was inducted into the LPGA Hall of Fame, and in 1992, I \nwas privileged to personally congratulate her as she received the \nprestigious Flo Hyman Award from the Women's Sports Foundation for \n``exemplifying dignity, spirit and commitment to excellence.''\n  I think it is only fitting that a school in her old stomping grounds \nhas been renamed, through the efforts of the Roswell Hispano Chamber of \nCommerce, the Nancy Lopez Elementary School. This tribute serves as one \nreminder of the enduring pride the people of Roswell and New Mexico \nhave for Nancy. As she makes the transition from the LPGA tour to \ndevote more time to her family and charitable endeavors, I believe it \nis proper to honor and congratulate Nancy Lopez.\n  I fully expect Nancy will continue to serve as a model for Hispanic \nyouth, female athletes, and parents striving to provide a nurturing and \nloving environment for their children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/10/senate-section/article/S6569-3", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6569-S6570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     U.C.

Madam President, I am pleased to note that the \nUniversity of California, Davis Cancer Center has achieved National \nCancer Institute, NCI, designation. With this designation, the UC Davis \nCancer Center becomes one of only nine centers in California.\n  The NCI designation is most prestigious, awarded to cancer \ninstitutions that have significantly contributed innovative cancer \nresearch to the scientific community. Furthermore, this notable \ndistinction provides ongoing Federal support for research in the fight \nagainst this disease\n  The center is a collaboration of over 200 scientists, working at the \nUC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento, the main UC campus in Davis, and \nthe Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.\n  The partnership with Lawrence Livermore, the first of its kind in the \nNation, was a major factor in winning the NCI designation. Physicians \nand scientists work together to use technology developed for the \ndefense industry and other non-medical uses to advance cancer diagnosis \nand treatment.\n  In addition to hundreds of cancer studies underway at the cancer \ncenter,\n\n[[Page S6570]]\n\njoint research collaborations with Lawrence Livermore include such \ninnovative projects as photonic probes testing, which is used to \ninstantly detect cancer and save patients from unnecessary biopsies.\n  The center serves a population of five million people throughout \nNorthern and Central California, Nevada, Arizona and Oregon and cares \nfor about 3,000 newly diagnosed cancer patients each year.\n  I commend the UC Davis Cancer Center on this impressive achievement, \nand I extend my confidence that the center will make meaningful \ncontributions to our search for a cure for this devastating \ndisease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/10/senate-section/article/S6570-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  PEACHES FROM SOUTH CAROLINA FARMERS\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, today, peaches from my home \nState have been delivered to offices throughout the Senate and the U.S. \nCapitol. Those of us here in Washington can cool off from the summer \nheat with fresh, juicy peaches, thanks to South Carolina's peach \nfarmers.\n  For a tiny State, South Carolina is second, only to California, in \npeach production. This year we planted 16,000 acres, and expect to \nharvest 160 to 180 million pounds--twice what we harvested last year \nwhen cold weather devastated the crop. Because of hot, dry weather this \npast month, the peaches are slightly smaller, but the small size \nusually results in a sweeter peach for the consumer. So with all due \nrespect to my colleagues from Georgia, South Carolina is known as the \n``Tastier Peach State'' for good reason.\n  Earlier this spring, in a bipartisan fashion, this Congress passed a \ngenerous farm bill that when times are tough, will help the people who \nfeed us. I voted for it. I did so because farmers are dedicated people \nwho need support they can depend on. I hope as Senators and their \nstaffs feast on these peaches, they think about the farmers who get up \nearly every morning and labor all summer in the heat and humidity to \nbring us this delicious, nutritious, and satisfying harvest. We are so \nfortunate to have in this country safe, plentiful, and affordable fresh \nfruit and vegetables--but this Congress can never take that for \ngranted.\n  I thank the South Carolina Peach Council, and especially David \nWinkles and the South Carolina Farm Bureau, for giving the U.S. Senate \na taste of South Carolina. And I remind the rest of America to ask for \nSouth Carolina peaches at their groceries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/10/senate-section/article/S6570-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/10/senate-section/article/S6570-3", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a \nwithdrawal and sundry nominations which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/10/senate-section/article/S6570-4", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          enrolled bill signed\n\n  At 3:34 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       S. 2594.

A bill to modify the authority of the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission to conduct investigations, to increase the \ncriminal penalties for violations of the Federal Power Act and the \nNatural Gas Act, and to authorize the Chairman of the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission to contract for consultant services; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I am pleased to introduce this bill \ntoday to strengthen the authority of the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission. In May, 2000 an energy crisis began in California and \neventually spread to the other Western States. For about a year, FERC \nrefused to execute its mandate to enforce the provisions of the Federal \nPower Act which required the Agency to enforce ``just and reasonable'' \nelectricity prices.\n  In May, 2001 Pat Wood became the Chairman of the Commission and under \nhis leadership the Commission has finally begun to aggressively \ninvestigate what went wrong in the California and Western energy \nmarkets.\n  However, there are still some weaknesses in FERC's authority to \ninvestigate problems in energy markets, solicit necessary information \nand punish wrongdoers. A report by the General Accounting Office, GAO, \nlast month concluded that FERC does not have the necessary legal \nauthority to police competitive energy markets.\n  This legislation is designed to bolster FERC's authority and allow \nthe Agency to levy penalties that will hold market manipulators \naccountable for violations of the law. This legislation will go a long \nway toward providing FERC with the resources and legal authority it \nneeds to protect consumers and ensure that energy prices are just and \nreasonable.\n  My legislation would do five things: 1. It would grant FERC the \nauthority to use monetary penalties on companies that don't comply with \nrequests for information. This is essentially the same authority that \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission has; 2. It would make it easier \nfor FERC to hire the necessary outside help they need including \naccountants, lawyers, and investigators for investigative purposes; 3. \nIt would eliminate the requirement that FERC receive approval from the \nOffice of Management and Budget before launching an investigation or \nprice discovery of electricity or natural gas markets involving more \nthan 10 companies; 4. It would increase the penalty amounts to $1 \nmillion instead of the current $5,000 for violations of the Federal \nPower Act and the Natural Gas Act; five years instead of the current \ntwo for violations of the statute; and, $50,000 per day per violation \ninstead of the current $500 for violations of rules or orders under the \nFederal Power Act and the Natural Gas Act; and 5. It would increase the \nCommission's authority to impose civil penalties, it also broadened to \nall sections of Part II of the Federal Power Act and the penalty amount \nis increased from $10,000 to $50,000 per violation per day.\n  I continue to support FERC and Chairman Pat Wood in its efforts to \nstabilize energy prices, and ensure that our energy markets function \nproperly although I believe that much more still needs to be done.\n  But even if FERC has the will, the GAO report correctly points out \nthat it may not have all the necessary tools. It is my hope that this \nlegislation will help by providing FERC the necessary authority to \ncontinue to aggressively monitor energy markets and investigate \nwrongdoing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/10/senate-section/article/S6575-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6575-S6590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4182.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 3971, Calendar No. 446.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3971) to provide for an independent \n     investigation of Forest Service firefighter deaths that are \n     caused by wildfire entrapment or burnover.\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to urge the passage of this \nlegislation. Roughly a year ago, about this time of night, my \ncolleague, Senator Murray, and I stood before the Senate in a terrible \nmoment to describe our sympathy for the deaths of four young \nfirefighters: Devin Weaver, Jessica Johnson, Karen Fitzpatrick, and Tom \nCraven.\n  They lost their lives fighting a forest fire that had been out of \ncontrol, and, as we found out, these four young people were barely \ntrained. They were on the job, having had training, but were new, and \nthis was their first fire.\n  Since that day on the Senate floor, we have had hearings, \ninvestigations, a lot of discussion, and what we found in the report \nfrom the Forest Service on the Thirtymile fire is that some of the same \nissues that had arisen in a fire, the Storm King fire, many years ago \nwere the same issues that were arising again; the fact that maybe there \nwere rules in place but they were not being followed.\n  When the report came back to say that, sadly, the young men and women \nwho perished fighting the Thirtymile fire did not have to die, it was a \nvery painful moment. The fact that they did not have to die meant we \nwere not really implementing the processes and procedures that needed \nto be in place.\n  Tonight I am glad to say that we are taking a big step forward in \nassuring the oversight and accountability of the Forest Service, by \nmaking sure there is an independent investigation in the case of forest \nfire fatalities.\n  This legislation will not bring back Devin Weaver, Jessica Johnson, \nKaren Fitzpatrick, or Tom Craven, but it will say that the Congress--\nthe House and the Senate--does believe there needs to be \naccountability, there needs to be oversight, there needs to be \nprotection. There needs to be rules in place not just because we can \npoint to them on a piece of paper but that they are actually being \nfollowed.\n\n  So tonight, even though it has been just 1 year, I feel at least we \ncan go to families and say we do believe accountability is important.\n  I thank my colleague in the House, Doc Hastings, for getting this \nlegislation passed as companion legislation to what we have.\n  I note that the Senate did take action earlier this year. We passed \nthis as an amendment as part of the farm bill, and, unfortunately, it \ndid not make it through the conference process. So we are passing this \nlegislation tonight, to send on to the President for his signature, in \nhopes he will sign this in fast order and help improve the process to \nmake sure we have accountability in the Forest Service in this \nparticular area.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the bill be read three times, \npassed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no \nfurther intervening action or debate, and that any statements relating \nthereto be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S6593]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
