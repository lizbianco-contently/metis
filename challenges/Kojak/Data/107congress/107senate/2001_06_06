We hear the psalmist's \nassurance, ``And now, Lord, what do I wait for? My hope is in You.''--\nPsalm 39:7. We place our hope in Your problem-solving power, Your \nconflict-resolving presence, and Your anxiety-dissolving peace.\n  You inspire in us authentic hope in You. We thank You for the \nincredible happiness we feel when we trust You completely. The \nexpectation of Your timely interventions give us stability and \nserenity. It makes us bold and courageous, fearless, and free. Again, \nwe agree with the psalmist, ``Happy are the people whose God is the \nLord.''--Psalm 144:15.\n  Today we thank You for the leadership You have given the Senate \nthrough Trent Lott and Don Nickles. Now we ask for Your blessing on Tom \nDaschle and Harry Reid as they assume the demanding responsibilities of \nmajority leadership. Grant all of the Senators the gift of loyalty and \ninspire the spirit of patriotism that overcomes party spirit and the \nhumility that makes possible dynamic unity. You, dear God, are our Lord \nand Saviour. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/06/senate-section/article/S5843-3", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  The Honorable Barbara Boxer, a Senator from the State of California, \nled the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:\n\n       I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of \n     America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation \n     under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/06/senate-section/article/S5843-4", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              APPOINTMENT OF ACTING PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, \nStrom Thurmond, for his service to our country and to this body as \nPresident pro tempore.\n  I offer my hearty congratulations to Senator Robert C. Byrd in \nreturning to this high position this morning. Between these two men, \nthe Senate enjoys 90 years of service. The wisdom they have given \nMembers is beyond measure.\n  I thank my partner, my counterpart, Senator Lott. This is the second \ntime this year Senator Lott and I have switched roles. To us, this is \njust another in a series of challenges he and I have faced already this \nyear. Every time we have been presented with these challenges, we have \ncome through with our working relationship and our friendship not only \nintact but, in my view, strengthened. It is my hope and my expectation \nthat we will continue to be able to work together in this manner.\n  Finally, there is another person who deserves special recognition. \nThat is Senator Jeffords. Last week, I was deeply touched by Senator \nJeffords' courageous decision and his eloquent words. The Senator from \nVermont has always commanded bipartisan respect because of the work he \ndoes. Regardless of where he sits in this Chamber, his work will \ncontinue, and America will be better for it.\n  This, indeed, is a humbling moment for me. I am honored to serve as \nmajority leader, but I also recognize that the majority is slim. This \nis still one of the most closely divided Senates in history.\n  We have just witnessed something that has never happened in all of \nSenate history--the change of power during a session of Congress.\n  At the same time Americans are evenly divided about their choice of \nleaders, they are united in their demand for action. Polarized \npositions are an indulgence that the Senate cannot afford and our \nNation will not tolerate.\n  Republicans and Democrats come to this floor with different \nphilosophies and different agendas, but there are beliefs we share. \nBoth Republicans and Democrats believe in the power of ideas. Both \nRepublicans and Democrats believe in fashioning those ideas into sound \npublic policy. The debate on that policy is what I like to call the \nnoise of democracy. Sometimes it is not a very stereophonic sound. \nSometimes there is too much sound from the right or from the left. But \nit is a sound that, in my view, is beautiful--especially in comparison \nto the noise of violence we hear in so many places all over the world \ntoday.\n\n  In this divided Government--in spite of the passion with which we \nhold these ideas, in spite of the fervor with which we come to the \nfloor to represent them--we are required to find common ground and seek \nmeaningful bipartisanship. As I have said before, real bipartisanship \nis not a mathematical formula; it is a spirit. It is not simply finding \na way to reach 50 plus 1. It is a way of working together that \ntolerates debate. It means seeking principled compromise. It means \nrespecting the right of each Senator to speak his or her mind and to \nvote his or her conscience.\n  In this Senate, at this time, on this historic occasion, each Member \nhas something to prove. We need to prove\n\n[[Page S5845]]\n\nto the American people we can overcome the lines that all too often \ndivide us. We need to prove we can do the work the American people have \nsent us to the Senate to do.\n  I came to the Congress 22 years ago. I have had the good fortune of \nhaving many mentors. My friends know that I often speak of one, in \nparticular, whose advice continues to guide me. His name: Claude \nPepper. He was a Congressman from Florida and at one time a Senator in \nthis body. He told me once that, as fervent and as passionate a \nDemocrat as he was, it wasn't really whether one was a ``D'' or an \n``R'' that mattered; it was whether one was a ``C'' or ``D''--it was \nwhether one was ``constructive'' or ``destructive'' in the political \nand legislative process.\n  I hope I can prove to my colleagues on this side of the aisle that I \ncan be a constructive leader. I hope we all recognize the difference \nbetween constructive and destructive politics and legislative work. I \nhope that we can live up to the expectations of the American people and \npeople such as Claude Pepper.\n  As we address the agenda this body has before it, I hope we can be \nconstructive Republicans and constructive Democrats.\n  I thank my colleagues for their trust. I thank my colleagues for \ntheir friendship. I am prepared to go to work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me first join Senator Daschle in \nexpressing my personal appreciation and great admiration to Senator \nThurmond, for the job he has done for so many years for the people of \nSouth Carolina and, yes, the people of America. Today he is with the \nPresident of the United States, in Bedford, VA, for the dedication of a \nmemorial to those who lost their lives in Normandy. As our colleagues \nknow, Senator Thurmond landed at Normandy and served so honorably \nthere. The energy and strength he exhibited in Normandy continues to \nthis very day in the Senate. He is a legend in his own time. We all \nadmire him and appreciate him so much.\n  Also, I congratulate Senator Byrd for assuming this position of \nPresident pro tempore of the Senate. He certainly is going to need no \nbriefing on the rules. He is the paragon regarding the rules of the \nSenate. He is the guardian of the rules. He certainly knows the rules, \nand he will administer them fairly and reside in the chair in a way we \nall will appreciate and admire.\n  So to you, Senator Byrd and Mr. President, thank you for what you \nhave done and what I know you will do as President pro tempore of the \nSenate.\n  I also thank our staff members. There are so many people to recognize \nwho have served the Senate during the period of time I have been \nmajority leader. The officers, those who are here day in and day out, \ninto the night, do such a great job for the Senate, for the Senators, \nand for our country. To all of you, I express my appreciation. I \nparticularly express appreciation to our staff assistants, Elizabeth \nLetchworth, who has been secretary of the majority, now secretary of \nthe minority; and to Marty Paone, who has served as secretary of the \nminority and will be secretary of the majority. They have the answers \nthat we need in the Senate. We can always rely on them as to what the \nschedule may be, based on what the leaders have told them, and when the \nvotes will occur. They do so much to make our life and our job easier.\n  But primarily I want to extend my congratulations to my partner and \nalso my friend, Tom Daschle, as majority leader. I also extend to him \nmy hand of continued friendship and commitment to work with him for the \ninterests of the American people. I know he will do an excellent job. I \nthink he has set a very positive tone in his opening remarks and I told \nhim so when I congratulated him as we shook hands.\n  We have worked together over the past 5 years when I have been the \nmajority leader, through some good times and some tremendous \nlegislative achievements and through some tough times. Sometimes we \nhave been criticized for that, but most of the time I think people \nunderstood we maintained a working relationship and we did the best we \ncould as we saw our jobs and what we thought was right for the Senate \nand right for the American people. The good times we will remember and \ntry to repeat. The bad times have already been forgotten. But there \nhave been clear examples of where we have worked together in a \nbipartisan way for the interests of the American people. It covers the \ngamut.\n  It has been on financial issues, on transportation, and on trade. \nThere have been times when we had opposition in our own parties, but we \ncame together because we thought a result was very important.\n  I know Senator Daschle will find, sometimes, the weight of this job \nwill be as heavy as the weight of the Earth Atlas carried on his \nshoulders. I hope on occasion I can help make that weight a little \nlighter.\n  Of course, at some point, he tricked Hercules into assuming that \nburden, and Atlas was at last relieved of the weight of the world.\n  I know how he felt. I mention this by way of congratulating Senator \nDaschle on his assuming the august responsibilities that come with \nbeing the majority leader of the U.S. Senate.\n  Perhaps I should mention the remainder of that old story: Hercules \nmanaged to trick Atlas, so the poor giant wound up, once again, \ncarrying the Earth as he was fated to do. There probably is a moral in \nthere somewhere about how things not only change, but keep on changing. \nThings certainly have changed for the better since the American people \nelected Republican majorities to the Senate and the House in 1995. Back \nthen, deficits stretched further than the eye could see, and Social \nSecurity was used as a government piggy bank. The welfare system hurt \nmore people than it helped, high taxes prevented families from enjoying \nthe fruits of their labor, and military readiness was seriously in \nquestion.\n  Those problems were magnified by a bureaucracy that diverted \neducation dollars from our children's classrooms, putting their futures \nat risk. Today, our hard work enables us to boast of a different \nstory--the story of how Republican initiatives have made a difference \nby changing things for the better:\n  Republicans became the catalyst for balancing the budget. We stopped \nthe raid on Social Security. We moved people from welfare to the \ndignity and independence of work. We lowered taxes for families and for \njob creation. We began to restore America's military strength. And, we \nreturned education dollars to parents, teachers and communities.\n  The result? A record-setting economy, higher-paying jobs, record low \ninterest rates, greater investment, more opportunity, and more parents \ninvolved in schools. Many landmark achievements were accomplished \nthrough bipartisan cooperation: the balanced budget, welfare reform, \nthe Soldiers' Bill of Rights, juvenile justice reform, education \nreform, safe drinking water, a minimum wage increase combined with \nsmall business tax relief, and ISTEA--the legislation that is \ndramatically modernizing our transportation infrastructure, Air 21, and \nfinancial services modernization.\n  Add to that our defense modernization, the Caribbean Basin \nInitiative, the Africa Free Trade bill, and telecommunications reform. \nWe accomplished many difficult things together in a bipartisan way--in \ngood times, as well as in seemingly impossible times of gridlock. I am \nhopeful that there will be more of those good times when we can do so \nagain. I know that the distinguished majority leader does not need any \nadvice on this occasion. But I do remember that I never believed as \nmajority leader I could work my will with the Senate, unless it was a \ncoalition of wills.\n  From the very first, I have never gotten all that I asked for: I \ncertainly did not get all the tax cuts we wanted for the American \npeople. But I accepted what we could get and determined to come back \nand try again for more the next time. It is true that Senate Democrats \nwill now set the schedule for this body. But any group of 49 Senators \nis an exceptionally strong minority. Each of those Senators looks \nforward to exercising all the rights of the minority to advance \nPresident Bush's and the people's agenda in the months ahead.\n  We will be vigilant in protecting and improving social security and \nmedicare. We will craft an energy policy to respond to the crisis that \nthreatens our economy and qualify of life. We will create the world's \nbest schools by empowering local school districts which\n\n[[Page S5846]]\n\nare accountable to parents. Too much money still is being wasted in \nWashington's education bureaucracy. We will confirm the President's \nnominations to enable him to run the government he was elected to \nadminister and to provide for a fair and impartial judiciary. We will \nwork to rebuild our nation's defenses because our military is still \nstretched way too thin for comfort in a dangerous world.\n\n   Finally, taxes are still too high, and there is still too much waste \nin Federal spending. We will continue to work to bring both under \ncontrol. Our minority status in the Senate--albeit temporary--neither \ndampens our enthusiasm for building upon our successes, nor excuses us \nfrom embracing the challenges ahead. For we did not come to Washington \nto be caretakers of power. We were sent to the Senate for a specific \npurpose, as reflected in President Bush's agenda, to: move America \nforward again by putting people back in charge of their own country; \npromote economic growth; give all individuals the opportunities to \nreach for their dreams; strengthen our bedrock institutions of family, \nschool, and neighborhood; and make the United States a stronger leader \nfor peace, freedom, and progress abroad.\n  For too long, government has supported itself by taking more of what \npeople earn, preventing them from getting ahead, no matter how hard \nthey work. President Reagan called it ``economics without a soul'' and \ntaught us that the size of the federal budget is not an appropriate \nbarometer of social conscience or charitable concern. And that is why \nthe ultimate goal in everything we are working with President Bush to \ndo is to give this economy back to the American people.\n  Some say it is dangerous to push for dramatic reforms in a period of \neconomic instability. But I believe it is dangerous not to. There may \nnot always be an opportunity. Along with all my fellow Republicans, I \nsay: Our goals have not changed. Neither has our resolve to rally \naround President Bush to meet them. Our opportunity is today. To my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle: We are here and ready to go to \nwork for the people who elected us to represent them.\n  Now we have a challenge before us that is different for me and will \nbe different for Senator Daschle. Can we come together? Can we find a \nway to work with this President, President Bush, and find common ground \neven on the bill that is pending before us now, education? We have said \nwe want education reform and we want a responsible increase in \neducation spending. The American people said they want it, people in \nevery State, as did the President, and so do we. Yet we have not gotten \nit done.\n  Can we come together on education? I think we can. It is going to \ntake work. It is going to take some sacrifice. Senator Kennedy is going \nto continue to push it aggressively, and he is probably going to have \nto cast votes he doesn't particularly like, and so am I, and so will \nSenator Gregg. But can we do any less? Can we afford not to, finally, \nmake progress on education reform and take some steps for the Federal \nGovernment to be of help in improving education in America? I believe \nwe can do it. It may take a little more time, but that will be our \nfirst test. I pledge to work with the managers and with Senator Daschle \nto make that happen.\n  We have a lot of other important issues we are going to have to deal \nwith this year. Senator Daschle noted yesterday we have 13 \nappropriations bills and supplemental appropriations bills to do to \nkeep the Government operating, and we have 59 days--estimated I guess--\nto get it done. It is going to take a pretty good lift. I hope we don't \nhave 100 amendments on every appropriations bill, as we had last year. \nI hope we can find a way to show fiscal restraint and get these bills \ndone.\n  Obviously, there are going to be health-related issues. How do we \ndeal with Patients' Bill of Rights? How can we deal with this important \nquestion of prescription drugs, to make sure elderly poor get the help \nthey need? Can we come together on Medicare reform? Can we take the \nlead from Senator Moynihan, the former Senator from New York, on Social \nSecurity? Will we be able to really address the energy needs of this \ncountry? Will we be taking partisan positions and trying to assess \nblame? Will we be trying to find how little we can do or can we come \ntogether and have a real national energy policy that will, hopefully, \nhelp this year but, more importantly, will make sure we do not have \nthis problem in 5 years or 10 years? Defense continues to be something \non which we are going to have to focus.\n  So we have a full agenda. I do not think a lot will change. Senator \nDaschle will get recognized. He will be the majority leader, and I will \nbe minority leader, the Republican leader.\n  He will call up the bills, and we will take advantage of our rights \nin the minority to offer amendments, as certainly the other side has. \nSometimes we will offer substitutes. But we commit and pledge our best \nefforts to finding a way to make it work and to pass important \nlegislation to address these issues and find the solutions that are \nneeded by the American people.\n  It is not about personalities. I still believe that government is \nabout ideas, about issues. So it is not really that important in what \nrole we serve. What is important is what do we do for the people we \nserve, what legacy will we leave for the next generation.\n  I believe we can get it done. We have a lot of work to do. Let's get \nstarted. I again pledge to you my support and cooperation, Senator \nDaschle. I yield the floor.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 16 minutes \nremaining, and the Senator from Minnesota has 7 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I hope we can proceed without a vote on \nthis amendment. But as long as we are going to vote, let me raise some \nconcerns about it.\n  This amendment comes down on the side of political correctness. One \nof the biggest problems we are seeing today in the whole issue of how \nwe structure our educational system is that it is becoming \nextraordinarily subjective in the area of testing. The President has \nproposed a fair and objective approach where kids in the third grade, \nfourth grade, fifth grade, and sixth grade are tested on key issues \ninvolving English and mathematics in an objective manner.\n  This amendment essentially opens the door to the opportunity for the \nSecretary of Education--whoever that Secretary might be--or for States, \ndepending on how this gets interpreted, to basically create a \nqualitative test based on subjectivity. It is no longer an issue of \nwhether you know how to add 2 and 2; it is an issue of whether or not \nnew math means 2 and 2 and should be added correctly. It is no longer \nan issue of whether or not English involves the King's English or \nEnglish as defined by Webster's Dictionary; it becomes a question of \nwhether or not English maybe should be created in different terminology \nfor certain groups of folks who maybe don't speak English quite as well \nand therefore need a different type of English in order to pass a test.\n  ``Qualitative'' is a very subjective term. This amendment, although \nnot definitively defective, creates the opportunity for significant \nharm down the road if it is carried forward to its full potential.\n  So I am going to oppose it. I suspect it will pass because it has the \nname ``quality'' on it. But I am going to oppose it because I am very \ntired of political correctness being introduced into our educational \nsystem. I think it is especially inappropriate at the level of \nmathematics and English in the early grades of our educational system.\n  Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I will take a few moments. I am a \nlittle confused by my colleague's remarks.\n  This amendment just says that we want to have a bonus go to the \nStates that develop high-quality assessments as determined by peer \nreview. We have peer review of everything. It says nothing about \nqualitative. It tells no State and no school district how to do a \nmathematics test. I have been a teacher and educator for 20 years. That \nis not what this is about at all. This amendment just says, first of \nall, that every State has to implement these tests on time. We make it \nclear. But the second thing it says is, rather than putting an \nincentive on rushing, we also want to encourage high-quality tests.\n  I draw on all of the professional literature and I draw on what the \nSecretary said about high-quality tests. They are comprehensive, with \nmultiple measures. What are they? In addition to comprehensive, they \nare coherent so our school districts know they will be able to have \ntests related to the curriculum that is being taught--not some national \nsimple jingo, multiple-choice test. What are they? They are continuous.\n  I am really saying let's not penalize any State that wants to go \nforward and do the very best job of putting together high-quality \ntests. That is what States want to be able to do. That is what we are \nhearing. All of the articles that have been coming out all over the \ncountry in almost every State say if you are not careful, you have \ntests which aren't even correct, and then mistakes are made; kids pay \nconsequences; schools pay consequences; and teachers pay consequences.\n  We have quotes from people who have been leading the test movement: \nRobert Schwartz, president of Achieve, Incorporated, and the \nindependent panel review of title I that just issued a report. And what \ndo they say? They are saying: Look, we have to make sure that we don't \nhave people rushing to attach consequences to tests until we get the \ntests right.\n  What are they saying? They are saying: Accountability for student \nprogress is only as good as the tools used to measure student progress.\n  That is what we are talking about, having high-quality tests, having \na bonus system that goes to States which move forward with high-quality \ntesting. It couldn't be more simple. It couldn't be more \nstraightforward. It doesn't micromanage. It doesn't tell anybody how to \ndo a mathematics test. I never would dream of doing that.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire retains 6 \nminutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. And the Senator from Minnesota?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. Who is the time being charged to now?\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time be charged equally to both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, will the Senator be good enough to \nyield me 3 minutes?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the \nWellstone amendment. I am really kind of disappointed we are not \ngetting, as our first action on the floor of the Senate in our new \natmosphere, broad support for what is a very basic and fundamental and \nsensible and responsible amendment to assure that we are going to have \nthe development of quality tests. That is all prior to the time that \nyou get the bonus.\n  We have all seen this in one of the national newspapers--it happens \nto be the New York Times--with two front page stories over the period \nof May 20, just before the Memorial Day break. Let me just refer to \nwhat happened in New York City with the application of a test for some \nof the children there:\n\n       The law's ``unrealistic'' deadlines, state auditors said \n     later, contributed to the numerous quality control problems \n     that plague the test contractor, Harcourt Educational \n     Measurement, for the next two years.\n\n  This is a company that has a 99.9 percent accuracy rate, and we still \nhad tens of thousands of children who did not graduate. We had the \ndismissal of\n\n[[Page S5848]]\n\nprincipals, the dismissal of teachers, and numerous children who failed \nto go to college.\n  All we are asking for is that the tests that are going to be \ndeveloped be quality tests. And there are standards on how those are to \nbe reached. For example, as the Senator from Minnesota pointed out \nyesterday, one of the very responsible nonprofit organizations called \nAchieve has done evaluations of various tests in various States. They \nhave identified, for example, the States that are not just giving off-\nthe-shelf testing but those that are really testing the child's ability \nto think through a problem and reflecting that in the form of exams.\n  We are seeing as a result of that the rise in terms of achievement \nand accomplishment by these children. That is what is basically being \nasked for by the Senator from Minnesota. I think many of us have seen--\nas has been stated to me by the Senator from Minnesota, the Senator \nfrom Washington, and others, over the period of the last 24 hours, and \nover the period of the Memorial Day recess--the concern that many \nparents have about how the tests are being used in schools, in school \ndistricts, and how teachers are just teaching to the test rather than \nreally examining the ability of children to really process the \nknowledge they are learning and reflect it and respond in terms of the \ntests.\n  I want to mention, just finally, this costs something for the States. \nYou can get a quick answer on a Stanford 9. That might cost you $8 or \n$9 for a test. A more comprehensive test may cost as much as $25. But \nnonetheless, we believe if we are to achieve what this President has \nsaid he wants to achieve--and that is to use the tests to find out what \nthe children don't know, so we can develop the curriculum and the \nsupport and the help for those children--let's make sure that it is \ngoing to be quality. That is what the Senator from Minnesota is trying \nto do.\n\n  I hope his amendment will be accepted.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire retains 6 \nminutes 45 seconds. The Senator from Minnesota retains 1 minute 49 \nseconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. I simply point out, this amendment is one of a series of \namendments that the Senator from Minnesota is proposing to deal with \ntesting. And the Senator from Minnesota has never been shy--he is never \nshy on anything--he has certainly not been retiring or shy in his \nopposition to the testing regime in this bill.\n  The testing regime in this bill is the core of the bill. The \nPresident has suggested that if we are going to have effective \naccountability in this country, we must have an effective evaluation of \nwhat children are being taught and what they are learning by grades so \nwe don't leave children behind. He suggests that be disaggregated so \nthere is no group that will be left out or normed in and overlooked. So \ntesting is critical to this bill.\n  This is not the most egregious amendment the Senator from Minnesota \nhas proposed in this area. No. In fact, in the spirit of cooperation, I \nsuggested we simply take it. But the Senator from Minnesota decided he \nwanted a vote. So I think it should be openly debated because the \namendment has some serious problems down the road, unless it is fixed. \nThe reason I was willing to take it is because I assumed it would be \nfixed in conference. It will be a problem for the testing regime.\n  The issue on testing, as has been highlighted--in fact, the Senator \nfrom Minnesota made the case--the issue on testing is whether or not we \nare going to set up a politically correct regime or one that actually \ntests kids to evaluate whether they know what they are supposed to know \nor whether we are going to set up a standard that essentially dumbs \ndown, essentially takes the median and, when it isn't met, decides to \ndrop it.\n  The bonus system is a critical part of that. The President's bonus \nsystem is in the bill and is structured in a way that the States get a \nbonus if they come on line with a good test early. The Senator from \nMinnesota is trying to gut that in this amendment. That is part of the \nfirst step of gutting the whole concept of quality testing.\n  So from my standpoint, this amendment, although not fundamentally \nbad, moves us in the wrong direction and therefore should be opposed. I \nwould have been happy to try to rewrite it and make it more effective \nin conference, but the Senator from Minnesota wants a vote on it. Let's \nvote on it. It may be adopted, but I am certainly going to vote against \nit because I do not support political correctness as an element of our \ntest regime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. In the time I have left, first of all, I want my \ncolleagues to know I am all for accountability. I have never taken a \nposition that we should not have accountability. The question is, How \nwe do it?\n  I have drawn from everybody in the testing field. I have drawn from \nall the people in the States. I have drawn from all the people who are \ndoing this work. And they are all saying: Let's make sure the bonus \nincentive goes to the States for doing the assessments as well as \npossible as opposed to doing the assessments as fast as possible.\n  This is just a commonsense amendment. This has nothing to do with \npolitical correctness. I think this really adds to the strength of the \nbill. Again, the truth is, the accountability is only as good as the \nassessment of the children, of the students. Let's make sure we have \nthe best assessment. Let's make sure it is comprehensive, that there is \nmore than one measurement. Let's make sure there is coherence and that \nthe teachers don't have to teach to the test but that the tests are \nactually measuring the curriculum that is taught in our school \ndistricts and in our States. And lets's make sure it is continuous and \nwe can look at the progress of the child. This is the best amendment \nthat, frankly, strengthens this bill.\n  Right now, I say to my colleague from New Hampshire, I am wearing my \nvery pragmatic hat and trying to get this legislation to be a better \npiece of legislation. The reason I want to have a vote on this \namendment is because this whole issue of testing is important. I want \nas many Senators as possible to go on record for high-quality testing.\n  Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota retains 14 seconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I make my final 14-second plea for colleagues to have \ngood, strong support for this amendment. It is a very good amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire retains 4 \nminutes 14 seconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I point out that there has been some \nrepresentation that the President's initiative in the area of testing \nis not adequate. In the financial area of supporting the testing regime \nin this bill, there is $2.8 billion committed for testing over the term \nof the bill. That is 7 years.\n  Equally important, what we should point out is that what we are \nadding are three new tests to the regime that was put in place back in \n1994 when the reauthorization of ESEA occurred. We then required that \nStates test in three grades. At that time, when we required as a \nFederal Government that States test in three grades--when the President \nwas from the other party and the Congress was controlled by the other \nparty--we put no money on the table for the purposes of supporting the \nStates as they did that testing.\n  We are now asking that the States do an additional 3 years of testing \non top of the three that are already required, and we are putting on \nthe table a dramatic increase in funding--$2.8 billion over that \nperiod.\n  But I would come back to the basic point of this amendment. This \namendment's goal is to undermine the bonus system necessary to create \nthe incentives to put in place a testing regime that will actually \nevaluate whether or not kids can succeed or not succeed.\n  It is part of a sequential event of amendments, the goal of which, in \nmy humble opinion, is to undermine the whole testing regime concept. As \nI have said before, if we start creating a subjective or national \ntesting regime--either one--we end up undermining the\n\n[[Page S5849]]\n\ncapacity to deliver effective tests that evaluate kids and what they \nare doing in relationship to other kids versus evaluating what some \neducational guru decides is the new math or the new English.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time. I believe we are ready to \nvote.\n  Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 465, as modified.

Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second. The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator \nConrad, to offer what I believe is the first bipartisan amendment since \nwe have seen the change in control of the Senate. We are offering an \namendment that will help Congress ensure that it provides States with \nan appropriate level of funding to develop and administer the student \nassessments that will be required under the BEST Act.\n  As do many of my colleagues, I want to make sure the Federal \nGovernment pays for its fair share of the costs associated with the \nassessment requirements of this important legislation. However, \ncritical though it is that we have a system to determine whether or not \nour children are really learning, no one really understands or knows \nthe cost of these assessments. We cannot see in the future, but the \nvarious experts have their own estimates of the assessment costs, and \nthose estimates vary widely. Cost estimates range by orders of \nmagnitude, and yet no comprehensive examination of these costs has yet \nbeen undertaken. Thus, we find ourselves in a dilemma of trying to \nestimate what the costs will be and figuring out the appropriate \nFederal share, but we really do not know the costs involved.\n  The amendment which Senator Conrad, Senator Hagel, and I offer \nrequires the General Accounting Office to conduct a study of assessment \ntests and transmit its report to the chairman and ranking members of \nthe House and Senate Appropriations Committees, the Labor-HHS \nsubcommittees, the HELP Committee, and the education and workforce \ncommittee.\n  The report would have to be transmitted to Congress by May 31 of next \nyear. This would provide the opportunity to incorporate GAO's estimates\n\n[[Page S5850]]\n\ninto our planning for the fiscal year 2003 appropriations cycle.\n  I also note that the testing requirements of the bill do not become \nfully effective until the year 2005. Congress would have a full 3 \nfiscal years to provide funding based on the estimates provided by the \nGAO.\n  The GAO study draws upon the best available data, including the cost \nor pricing data from each State that has already developed and \nadministered statewide student assessments and from the companies that \nactually develop these tests. For example, the State of Maine has an \nexcellent testing system that is used in three grades. It is well \ndeveloped; it is of high quality. That will be the kind of information \nthe GAO will gather in determining the cost of these assessments. Other \nStates have taken different approaches to testing and have different \ncosts associated with the tests they are now administering.\n  The GAO will determine the aggregate costs for all States to develop \nand administer the assessments required by the BEST Act, and the GAO \nwill estimate how much of these costs will be expected to be incurred \nin each of the fiscal years 2002 through 2008. The study determines \nassessment development and administrative costs for each State.\n  In addition to looking at the aggregate, we want to look at what the \nexperience has been and will be in each State. We have also asked the \nGAO to examine the factors that help explain the wide variations in the \ntest costs that are now administered by States. This information will \nhelp Congress determine whether it is apportioning funds among the \nStates in an equitable manner.\n\n  The General Accounting Office is particularly well suited to conduct \nthis study. My staff has had extensive discussions with GAO to \ndetermine whether or not they will be able to conduct this important \nassignment. The GAO has broad experience in estimating the costs of \ngovernmental programs and analyzing the Federal Government's role in \nelementary and secondary education. Indeed, just last year the GAO \ncompleted a 50-State study of the title I program, which included an \nanalysis of the efforts of the States to ensure compliance with key \ntitle I requirements and to hold local districts and schools \naccountable for educational outcomes. The GAO, therefore, is the right \nagency to conduct an impartial, thorough study of assessment costs.\n  The assessment provisions in the BEST Act are intended to help reach \nthe goal of leaving no child behind. Yesterday, a bipartisan group \ntalked with the President about the education bill. He, once again, \nvery eloquently stated the premise of the bill of making sure that \nschools are held accountable for the education of each child, of making \nsure that no child, no matter what the family income or country of \norigin, is left behind. We want to make sure every child is learning. \nThat is the inspiring goal of this legislation. That is why the \nPresident has proposed this assessment process--so we can assess \nwhether or not each child from grades 3 through 8 is learning in the \nareas of reading and math. The education blueprint we are drafting will \nwork only through a concerted, cooperative effort, where the Federal \nGovernment, States, and communities all share responsibility.\n  Senator Jeffords offered an amendment that passed overwhelmingly last \nmonth to provide a guaranteed stream of funding to States, beginning in \nthe year 2002, in order to assess the performance of their students. \nUnless the Federal Government provides the States with $370 million in \nthe year 2002 and an increasing amount in each of the succeeding 6 \nfiscal years, the assessment requirements in the bill will be delayed. \nIn other words, we are making sure we are matching the requirements \nwith the resources necessary for the Federal Government to help States \nand local school districts fulfill the requirements of this new \nlegislation.\n  The BEST Act requires a great deal from our schools and from our \nStates. For the first time, we are requiring accountability in a \nmeaningful way. We are requiring that all students, and in particular \nour disadvantaged and low-income students, show improvement in their \nacademic achievement from year to year. We need to provide adequate \nfunding to help States develop high-quality assessment tools. At the \nsame time, we just don't want to write a blank check to the testing \ncompanies. Such an approach would sap the incentive of companies to \ndevelop student assessments efficiently and cost effectively.\n  The solution is information. We need to have solid, well-researched \ndata to make the best decisions possible when determining funding \nlevels to support the States' testing systems over the next several \nyears.\n  Now is the ideal time to authorize a thorough study by the GAO to \ngather the information we need. Since States and local school districts \nwill be in the first year of assessment development and implementation \nnext year, it is the perfect time to gather the critical information on \nwhich to base future funding decisions. The GAO report will provide the \ninformation we need to make the right decisions based on actual State \nexperience and the best available data and informed projections.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this reasonable addition to the \neducation reform bill. I urge my colleagues to support the Collins-\nConrad amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I rise in support of the amendment of the \nSenator from Maine. It is a very appropriate approach to determining \nhow much these tests are going to cost and the best way to address \nthem.\n  I think it will provide a significant amount of information which \nwill be a welcome addition to the process as we go forward trying to \nevaluate how best to do these tests and how to keep them from being an \nextraordinary burden on the States, which is of course our goal.\n  The President has set up a testing regime which, as I mentioned, is \nreally the key to this whole bill, as far as he is concerned. It is a \nprocess by which all children in America will be tested in order to \ndetermine whether or not they have succeeded in learning what they \nshould know at the grade level they are presently attending. The \nobject, of course, is to keep track of children and make sure no child \nis left behind, which is the stated goal of the President and all of us \nhere in this Congress.\n  In doing that, we are clearly creating a huge new activity in the \narea of testing. It is appropriate we have this evaluated effectively. \nThe GAO study proposed by the Senator from Maine is the right way to do \nit. I congratulate her on her amendment and strongly support it.\n  I yield the floor. I make a point of order a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask consent the pending amendment by the Senator from \nMaine be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 532 to amendment no. 358\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 532.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] for himself, Mr. \n     Schumer, and Mr. Corzine, proposes an amendment numbered 532.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To increase the authorization of appropriations for certain \n                       technology grant programs)\n\n       On page 362, line 14, strike ``$500,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$900,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this amendment I am offering addresses \nan issue of which I think every parent is well aware. In this debate \nabout education, we are focusing on critical needs in American \neducation. One of those critical needs is the ability of a child to \nread. We have established partnerships in this bill that will try to\n\n[[Page S5851]]\n\nfind new and innovative ways to teach our children how to read.\n  As a parent and as a former student, I certainly can recall the \nbreakthrough in my life and the lives of my kids when their reading \nskills reached a level where they picked up a book by themselves and \nenjoyed it. I am glad they did. My kids have turned out just fine. \nThanks to good teachers and a lot of prodding by parents, a lot of \nchildren go through this learning experience to read. I think it is \nwonderful that this bipartisan education bill focuses money on these \npartnerships to bring in new, innovative thinking to teach our children \nhow to read.\n  The amendment I offer today looks at another challenge beyond \nreading, on which I think we should take a moment to reflect, and that \nchallenge is math and science education. Think about the wondrous \nthings occurring in America today. Think of all the technology that is \nbeing developed. Think of the fact that the United States leads the \nworld--and we are proud of it--when it comes to the development of \ntechnology. Pause for a moment and reflect on whether or not we are \ntraining our children so they can continue this dominance of the United \nStates when it comes to math and science.\n  If you make an honest and objective appraisal, you may come to the \nsame conclusion I have come to, and that is that we can do a better \njob. I fully support the idea of the reading partnerships. The \namendment I offer today suggests we fund for math and science \npartnerships at the same level of funding as reading partnerships. That \nsounds like a pretty simple thing. I hope it is agreed to on a \nbipartisan basis. It is not offered as an unfriendly or hostile \namendment. I hope many will view it as a positive response to a good \nsuggestion. Yes, let's invest in reading, but don't forget the need to \ninvest in math and science.\n  Does anyone doubt the need exists? I am going to recount for a moment \nsome statistics and information we brought together about the current \nstate of education in math and science in America. As you listen to \nthis information, reflect on whether or not we can do a better job, \nwhether or not we need to make the right investment in teachers and in \nstudents and teaching techniques so we continue our dominance in the \nworld in the areas of science, technology, and mathematics.\n  In too many cases today, elementary and secondary students in \nAmerican schools are not receiving world-class math and science \neducation. Every 4 years we have an Olympics, a winter Olympics and a \nsummer Olympics. We are very proud of U.S. athletes who compete with \nathletes from nations around the world. Those young men and women \nusually end up in the White House for representing our Nation, and they \nshow off their gold medals and silver medals and bronze medals and we \ntake great pride in it.\n  There was another Olympics which took place a few years ago, the 1996 \nThird International Mathematics and Science Study, called the TIMSS \nassessment. It was administered to students around the world in grades \n3, 4, 7, 8, and 12; 45 different countries participated in it.\n\n  The U.S. students at the third and fourth grade levels scored near \nthe top in these international assessments. Their performance started \nto decline when we were compared to 8th graders around the world, and \ntheir ranking was well below the international average by the 12th \ngrade.\n  American eighth graders were tested with TIMSS again in 1998 and 1999 \nto see if there had been any change. The raw average scores were about \nthe same as they were for the eighth graders tested in 1996. The eighth \ngraders tested in 1999 exceeded the international average in both \nscience and math. But of the 38 countries that participated in the \nassessments, students in 17 countries performed better than students in \nthe United States in science and 18 nations outscored the United States \nin math. Singapore, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan led the nations that \nwere tested in math and science. U.S. students' math and science scores \nput us in the same category as Bulgaria, Latvia, and New Zealand.\n  U.S. students today are just not taught what they need to know when \nit comes to math and science. Most American high school students take \nno courses in advanced science; 50 percent of students take chemistry; \n25 percent take physics.\n  In a February opinion article for Education Week, the president of \nthe National Science Teachers Association asked this question: If the \nUnited States were ranked 17th in the world in Olympic medals, it would \nbe a national embarrassment and no doubt there would be a free flow of \nmoney to fix the problem. Why can't the same be true for education?\n  First, let's speak about teachers. This is the key to it. If you do \nnot have a person standing in front of the classroom who understands \nthe subject and knows how to teach the subject, then the child has to \nlearn on his or her own.\n  Can you remember when you were sitting at a desk in a classroom? \nCould you have taken out that book in the classroom and learned by \nyourself and gone home at night and have done your own homework without \nthe help, the urging, and encouragement of a teacher? I doubt it.\n  In 1998, the National Science Foundation found that just 2 percent of \nelementary school teachers had a science degree and 1 percent had a \nmath degree. An additional 6 percent had majored or minored in science \nor math education in college. Nearly one in four of American high \nschool math teachers and one in five high school science teachers \nlacked even a minor in their main teaching field.\n  Do you know what that means? These are teachers standing in front of \nclassrooms in our high schools teaching math and science who did not \nminor or major in that subject in college. They might be good teachers. \nMaybe they have a lot of talent. But it suggests that someone who has \nmajored perhaps in English or history, standing up trying to teach a \nchemistry or physics course, may not have the skills they need.\n  Internationally, fully 71 percent of students learn math from \nteachers who majored in mathematics--around the world, 71 percent. Only \n41 percent of all American elementary and secondary students are taught \nby teachers with a math degree.\n  I would like to have a pop quiz in the Senate for all of my \ncolleagues. Please take out your pads and pencils. We are going to have \na little math test.\n  A researcher at the University of California at Berkeley found that \njust 11 out of 21 American elementary school teachers could divide 1\\3/\n4\\ by \\1/2\\ and come up with the correct answer. Every single teacher \nin a group of 72 Chinese teachers got it right. I wonder how many \nSenators could get it right.\n  High school and college students in America, unfortunately, are not \nmajoring in math and science as they must if we are going to meet world \ndemand for the skills to make certain that the 21st century is an \nAmerican century. In 1997, the National Science Foundation found that \n22 percent of college freshmen who intended to major in science or \nengineering reported that they needed remedial work in math, and 10 \npercent reported they needed remedial classes in science.\n  Let me speak for a moment about women and minorities in the fields of \nmath, science and technology.\n  In 1996, women received 47 percent of all science and engineering \nbachelor's degrees awarded but just 9 percent of the bachelor's degrees \nin engineering-related technologies, 17 percent of the bachelor's \ndegrees in engineering, and 28 percent of the bachelor's degrees in \ncomputer and information sciences. Women make up half of the U.S. \nworkforce, but they account for only 20 percent of those with \ncredentials in information technology.\n  The National Science Foundation tells us that African Americans, \nHispanics, and Native Americans comprise 23 percent of the population \nas a whole but earn just 13 percent of bachelor's degrees, 7 percent of \nmaster's degrees, and 4.5 percent of doctorate degrees in science and \nengineering.\n  So we are not only failing to teach Americans when it comes to math \nand sciences, but we are leaving behind women and minorities who should \nbe part of this exploding opportunity that America knows is really our \nfuture.\n  There is also a terrible shortage of technological workers. If you \nfollow the proceedings of the Senate, you probably are aware of the \nfact that we debate from time to time changing visa quotas of those who \nwant to come into the United States, particularly under\n\n[[Page S5852]]\n\nH-1B visas. The reason, of course, that we are opening our doors in \nAmerica for technology workers to come in from overseas in larger \nnumbers is that we do not have the work pool in this country to meet \nthe needs.\n\n  There is a lesson here. For Senators who are following this debate \nand those who are in the galleries and listening, the lesson is this: \nIf we are going to produce the workers in America to meet the needs of \nhigh-tech employment, we can't start with a law mandating that it comes \nfrom Congress. We have to start in the classroom, and we have to start \nit at an early age.\n  The purpose of the amendment I am offering today is to say let us \nstart investing in math and science partnerships early on so that we \nhave a chance to produce these workers for the next generation. I think \nit is not unreasonable to ask my colleagues in the Senate to make an \nequal investment in math and science as they do in reading so that we \nno longer have to debate on an annual basis opening the doors of our \nNation so that those who were trained in foreign schools and foreign \nuniversities can come and fill those high-paying jobs.\n  There is a terrible shortage when it comes to math and science \nteachers. The National Science Teachers Association has reported that \n48 percent of all middle schools and 61 percent of all high schools \nreported difficulty in finding qualified science teachers. In urban \nareas, an astounding 95 percent of districts report an immediate need \nfor high school science and math teachers.\n  I was born and raised in East St. Louis, IL. It was a great town in \nwhich to grow up. But East St. Louis has fallen on very hard times. The \npublic schools of my old hometown struggle to survive and to educate \nchildren.\n  I once met with the superintendent of the school district of my old \nhometown. I asked him about math and science teachers at East St. Louis \nSenior High School. This is what he told me: We will have any teacher \nwho is willing to try to teach math and science. We are not going to \nquestion their background or qualifications. If they will take that \ntextbook and stand in front of the classrooms, we will hire them on the \nspot.\n  That is just not a story of East St. Louis, IL, it is a story, sadly, \nacross America, particularly in urban school districts. Think of a \nwasted opportunity. How many young men and women sitting in that \nclassroom with the right teacher and the right opportunity can make a \nvaluable contribution to this Nation? But they won't be able to do it \nif the teacher standing in front of the classroom doesn't have the \nskills.\n  In Chicago, school officials have begun recruiting foreign teachers \nand bringing them in from overseas to teach in the Chicago public \nschools, particularly in the areas of math and science. They find in \nsome areas of Europe and Asia where math and science are really valued \nthat these young people have great degrees and want to come to America. \nOnce again, we are issuing additional visas so that foreign-trained \nteachers can come and teach in our high schools. It is happening in \nChicago, a town I am proud to represent. But it ought to give us some \npause to think that is how we are responding to this national need.\n  Let me recall the year 1957 for a moment. The Soviet Union shocked \nthe world by launching a satellite called Sputnik. We had just started \nour concern about the cold war. Along comes this Soviet breakthrough in \nscience which literally scared the Members of Congress into doing \nsomething substantive. We enacted major legislation known as the \nNational Defense Education Act. It was maybe the first initiative by \nthe Federal Government to make a direct investment in education. We \nwere concerned that we didn't have the engineers, scientists, and \ntechnicians to compete with the Soviet Union in the cold war. Money was \nput into the National Defense Education Act. It provided funds for \nschools to improve their math and science courses. It provided \nscholarships and loans for those who went to college so they could get \nbetter degrees and be prepared to lead this country.\n\n  Why do I know so much about the National Defense Education Act? I was \none of the recipients. I borrowed money from the Federal Government, \ncompleted my education, and paid it back so others could follow. Was it \na good investment for America? Personally, I think so. Thousands of \nstudents benefited from it. In fact, we did not only begin the race to \nthe Moon, but competing with nations around the world in science and \ntechnology is evidence that it paid off. We made a Federal investment \nthat was a good investment.\n  The mounting evidence of the state of the world today should give us \npause. Student achievement in science and math in the United States is \nstagnant. Students are losing interest in math and science in high \nschool. Fewer students pursue degrees in the math and science fields. \nThe technology workforce is having a difficult time finding qualified \nworkers, and it is hard to attract math and science teachers whom we \nneed in our schools.\n  All of these factors must lead us to conclude that something must be \ndone to reform math and science education in grades K through 12. This \nbill makes an important first step in funding national science \npartnerships. I am asking the sponsors and those supporting this bill \nto consider expanding the amount of opportunity in math and science as \nwe have in reading. Let us not make math and science second rate next \nto reading. Reading is critically important, but don't in any respect \nforget the importance of math and science to our Nation.\n  We have appointed several commissions over the last several years, \none of them with our former colleague from Ohio, Senator John Glenn. We \nall know John Glenn's story--this great American who served in the \nMarine Corps in both World War II and the Korean war, the first man in \nspace, and who served with us in the Senate. After he announced his \nretirement from the Senate, once again he became an astronaut. What a \ngreat man, and what a great contribution he made to America; he is a \nperson who really appreciates science and math. He was asked by \nPresident Clinton to establish a commission to look into this issue of \nthe question of math and science.\n  The Glenn Commission came out with some startling findings to back up \nthe reasons we need this amendment today. Senator Glenn came to the \nconclusion that if America is really going to succeed in the future, we \ncannot ignore the need for math and science.\n  What he has said in this report--which is bipartisan, bringing \ntogether some of the best educators in America--is, we need to make the \ninvestment to make it happen, to make certain we have good teachers who \nare well paid and kids who are well educated in the fields of math and \nscience.\n  There was another commission created which reported to Congress in \nFebruary of this year. It was cochaired by former Senator Gary Hart of \nColorado and former Senator Warren Rudman of New Hampshire. This \ncommission did not look at science from the viewpoint of just \neducation; they looked at it in terms of national security. And, once \nagain, this bipartisan commission, representing some of the best minds \nin America, looking in the field of national security, came to the \nconclusion that education was a national security imperative.\n  So if you are one of those in Congress who believe our first \nresponsibility is to provide for the national defense, then you should \nread this commission report and realize that a strong America, with a \nstrong national defense, relies on strong teachers and strong students \nin classrooms around America who are learning math and science.\n  I think the message is very clear. I hope my colleagues will pause \nand reflect on it for a moment. We have a chance, in this legislation, \nto do something significant for our schools. I am happy that it is a \nbipartisan effort. I am happy that we have Senators from both sides of \nthe aisle working with Members in the House of Representatives on both \nsides to come up with a bill.\n  I do not believe this is a partisan amendment I am offering. I \nbelieve there are Republican Senators, as well as Democrats, who \nappreciate the need for an investment in math and science.\n  It is interesting that when I asked for support for this amendment \nfrom around the country, the support did not just come from teachers \norganizations; the support came from those representing scientific \nendeavors, people who are on the front line in research in America, \npeople at the National Institutes of Health, those who are involved\n\n[[Page S5853]]\n\nin research in Silicon Valley. These are the people who came forward \nand said to me: Senator, don't overlook math and science. Make this \nbasic investment in reading, but don't forget math and science.\n  We want to be able to hire American students to work in American \ncompanies to produce American products that sell around the world. I am \nnot averse to people coming to this country. My mother was an \nimmigrant. I have an open mind, and I really believe in the value of \nimmigration. But if we look to the future, don't we want to give our \nkids the first opportunity in the classroom?\n  What we do with this amendment is increase the authorization level \nfor math and science partnerships.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Illinois yield to the \nSenator from New Hampshire for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. Would the Senator be willing to take this on a voice vote?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes, I would. And with that kind of encouraging question, \nI yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it is my understanding that my \ncolleague--and yours--from New York wants to come over to speak to this \namendment. So at this point I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am proud to join with the occupant of \nthe chair, my friend and colleague from the State of Illinois, in this \namendment. I very much appreciate the opportunity to speak on it. I \napologize for the slight delay; we are finishing up a hearing on faith-\nbased institutions in Judiciary, which I had to chair.\n  American students are falling further and further behind in math and \nscience. The numbers tell a dismal story.\n  In 1996, only 23 percent of all eighth graders were at or above \nproficiency in math, and 27 percent of all eighth graders were at or \nabove proficiency in science.\n  A 1999 international study revealed no significant progress for \nAmerican eighth grade students in math and science achievement over the \nlast 5 years. Even worse, the study indicated that U.S. student \nachievement in these academic areas actually declines between grades 4 \nand 8.\n  I don't have to tell my colleagues how important math and science are \nin this new global economy. Technology is key, and the base of \ntechnology is math and science. As sure as we are debating this \namendment today, if America does not improve its math and science \nability, we are not going to stay the No. 1 economy in the world. High \nvalue is added, as Alan Greenspan says, by thinking things, not by \nmoving things anymore. We have to have the best people at thinking \nthings. When math and science are as poorly learned and as poorly \nretained as they have been, there is trouble on the horizon.\n  My own State of New York is not immune; 28 percent of our New York \nhigh school students failed the math Regents test--up from 24 percent \nin 1997.\n  So we have an anomaly in America. While we have many brilliant U.S. \nscientists and mathematicians leading the way in research and \ntechnology, basic education in these areas has been increasingly \ndeficient.\n  How are we going to have the next generation be as brilliant, as \nproductive, and as important as this one has been in math and science \nif our schools continue to teach them poorly? We cannot continue to \nsimply rely on immigrants to fill the brain gap. We have to have \nAmerican students doing much better.\n  As a good friend of mine, an accomplished mathematician, Jim Simons \nlikes to say, ``For every person familiar with neural networks, double \nhelixes, or string theory, there are thousands who cannot do long \ndivision, let alone high school algebra.'' That is the anomaly we face \nin modern America--the anomaly that this amendment helps, we hope, to \nalleviate.\n  How do we make the change? Well, probably the most important answer \nlies in our teachers. Teachers make a difference. Studies tell us that \nteacher qualifications can account for more than 90 percent of the \ndifferences in students' reading and math scores. To repeat that, \nteacher qualifications can account for more than 90 percent of the \ndifferences in students' math and reading scores. But we are facing a \nbattle on two fronts--a lack of interest in the teaching profession and \ninadequate teacher training in math and science.\n  Depression babies in the thirties and forties wanted to get a civil \nservice job and were willing to sacrifice pay. Women, in the 1950s and \n1960s were told: be a nurse or a teacher. And millions were. They sure \nhelped me with my education. Those in the last group--my generation, \nthe Vietnam war era of young men--were granted a deferment if they \ntaught, and many did.\n\n  We had open school day. My children attend New York City public \nschools. I talked to each of their teachers. There are 12 of them--6 \nfor each daughter in the various subjects. Jessica is in high school \nand Allison is in middle school. I asked, ``How did you become \nteachers?'' Half of the women who I interviewed entered in those years, \nand of the six men I interviewed, four entered teaching during the \nVietnam war era. It was amazing.\n  As this chart shows, fewer and fewer talented men and women in math \nand science are choosing careers as teachers. Only 8 percent of the \nNation's math teachers and 7 percent of the Nation's science teachers \nwere new in 1998. It is worse in my State of New York. The numbers are \n5 percent and 4 percent, respectively.\n  This is an amazing and frightening statistic: 28 percent of math \nteachers and 26 percent of science teachers in the United States did \nnot major in the field in which they teach; 22 percent of the Nation's \nmiddle school math and science teachers are not certified. How are we \ngoing to attain excellence with these statistics?\n  The combination of low pay--teachers earn 30 percent less than other \nworkers with a bachelor's degree in the same subject--little prestige, \nand, of course, multiplying job opportunities for talented math and \nscience majors has led to a shortage crisis in these vital subject \nareas.\n  Let me read you this statistic, which is equally frightening: As of \n1998, a quarter of our Nation's math teachers were over age 50. In \n1998, a third of New York's math teachers were over 50. That means a \nhuge percentage of these teachers from the old generations are going to \nretire. With whom are we going to replace them?\n  The shortage is particularly acute in low-income and urban \ncommunities. These communities alone will need more than 700,000 \nadditional teachers in the next decade.\n  We must demand excellence from all of our teachers. We have to ensure \nthat teachers who have spent years in the classroom continue with their \nprofessional development. Similarly, we must ensure that new teachers \nenter the field with the skills and knowledge base necessary to educate \nour children.\n  As last year's Glenn Commission concluded:\n\n       The most consistent and powerful predictors of student \n     achievement in math and science are full teaching \n     certification and a college major in the field being taught.\n\n  Last year in New York, 37 percent of teachers or prospective teachers \nfailed the State teacher's certification examination in math--that is \nup from 32 percent 3 years ago--38 percent failed the biology test \ncompared to 24 percent 3 years ago. So things are not getting better; \nthey are indeed getting worse.\n  So what do we do about it? Well, the bill before us, S. 1, takes an \nimportant step in prioritizing math and science education by creating a \nnew program to improve teaching in these critical areas. Just \nyesterday, we passed an important amendment which would strengthen \nthese provisions, and I am proud to have worked in a bipartisan fashion \nwith not only Senator Durbin, but Senators Frist, Roberts, Warner, \nCrapo, and Gregg on this important amendment.\n\n[[Page S5854]]\n\n  Now, specifically, the amendment ensures that schools working in \ncollaboration with colleges and universities use funds to recruit and \nretain highly qualified teachers--both recent graduates and midcareer \nprofessionals--in math and science.\n  We encourage local districts to use scholarships, signing incentives, \nand stipends to attract talented individuals to the field and to pair \nthose activities with effective retention tools such as professional \ndevelopment and mentoring.\n  We authorize districts to create mastery incentive systems, where \nexperienced certified math and science teachers who demonstrate their \nexpertise through an exam and classroom performance are rewarded.\n  With the passage of this amendment, the provisions in this bill are a \ngood first step, but we must ensure that we provide enough funding to \nmake the new program work. The greatest worry I have about this bill, \nwhich I think has been exquisitely crafted by our leader from \nMassachusetts, working so hard with so many other Senators and with the \nWhite House, is that we will have all this great language and no money \nto help with what we say we are going to do.\n  It would be the sheerest hypocrisy to do that. It would delude the \nAmerican people into thinking we are doing something when we are \nactually doing nothing, other than adding more laws without \nimplementing them.\n  That is why today Senators Durbin, Corzine, and I are offering an \namendment which would increase the math and science partnership \nauthorization--what we did yesterday--from $500 million to $900 \nmillion. We are pleased that Reading First is authorized at $900 \nmillion. Our children have to be proficient readers, but in today's \nworld, science and math are no less important, and our funding \npriorities should reflect that.\n  We should be funding these math and science partnerships at the same \nlevel that Reading First is funded. Math and science has to be a \npriority for our Nation. We have to recruit, retain, and reward great \nmath and science teachers. After all, it is these men and women who are \nresponsible for educating our children and ensuring that our Nation \nwill be prepared to stay No. 1 in the very competitive math and \nscience-oriented global economy of the 21st century.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his suggestion?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I withhold my suggestion if my colleague from \nMassachusetts wishes to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see my friend and colleague from New \nHampshire is here. We want to move ahead with this amendment.\n  First, I commend the good Senator from Illinois for this amendment. I \nremember when we passed the Eisenhower program. It was passed in 1984 \nafter the excellent report of Ernie Boyer, ``A Nation at Risk,'' which \nis still the definitive work as to where we were in early education and \nthe challenges we faced. We have been trying to respond to those \nchallenges from that period of time.\n  This legislation, as has been pointed out by the Senators from \nIllinois and New York, is different from the Eisenhower program in that \nit enhances the opportunity for recruitment, which is enormously \nimportant, and also has an emphasis on curriculum, which is extremely \nimportant, as we are finding out in the review.\n  In the first testing we are going to have for the 3-8 grades, it is \ngoing to be on math--science is going to be down the road, but it is \ngoing to be on math and it is also going to be on literacy. As the \nSenator from Illinois pointed out, we are seeing a three-fold increase \nin literacy but we have not increased in math and science.\n  If we are going to have a greater sense of expectation of the \nchildren in literacy, because this is the area that is going to be \ntested, the Senator says let's give equal priority to the areas of math \nand science. That makes eminently good sense. It is a modest increase. \nIt is basically going to establish similar funding in math and science, \nas we have on literacy. It strengthens our whole effort.\n  The legislation has provisions for recruitment and curriculum; this \nis an enhancement of that program. It makes a good deal of sense.\n  I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for his willingness to accept \nit. It is an important amendment. It adds to the legislation. I welcome \nthe excellent presentation the Senator made and the strong support of \nmy colleague and friend from New York. I look forward to voting on this \nmeasure at this time, if possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 532.\n  The amendment (No. 532) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schumer). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I understand the pending amendment is \nthe Voinovich amendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is the Collins amendment \nNo. 509.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to talk about the Voinovich \namendment and a second-degree amendment that I want to offer to that, \nonce the Senator from Ohio, Mr. Voinovich, has had a chance to modify \nhis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from New Mexico \nis recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The second-degree amendment I will offer on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Hatch, and Senator Kennedy, in my view, will help \nclarify that we do not intend to change the basic relationship between \nthe Federal Government and the States by virtue of this Voinovich \namendment. Senator Voinovich seeks to accomplish a laudable goal with \nhis amendment. It is my understanding he is striving to ensure \ncoordination between the Governors and the State superintendents of \neducation and the State boards of education in the development and \nimplementation of educational policy as it relates to Federal funding.\n  All Senators in this Chamber will agree that is an admirable \nobjective. The language he has proposed, however, as I understand, even \nafter the modification he is going to offer, effectively gives \nGovernors a veto power over State school boards and superintendents. It \nsupersedes most, if not all, State constitutions and laws on that \nissue.\n  The Voinovich amendment changes 35 years of Federal education law by \ngiving the Governors of every State joint authority to prepare and \nprove and submit consolidated plans and applications for all of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act programs to the U.S. Department \nof Education. It would explicitly mandate that the Governor of each \nState sign off on title I plans which include the State's educational \naccountability system, the content and student performance standards, \nassessments, definition of adequate yearly progress, and the uses of \nthose funds--and particularly the State's plan for identifying and \nimproving low-performing schools.\n\n  In my view, we should not violate State sovereignty to determine how \nthe State chooses to structure the governance and administration of \neducation. Federal education policy has long recognized that each State \nsets its own State educational authority for elementary and secondary \neducation. The bill before us does so by designating the agency or \nindividual given this authority under State law as the person or agency \nin charge of administering the Federal programs. So elsewhere in the \nbill we do not in any way try to dictate to the State any requirement \nit change the way it administers its educational system.\n  In my home State of New Mexico, our State constitution vests the \nultimate authority over education in the State school board. We have 10 \nelected members; we have five members who are appointed by our \nGovernor. This board is given authority under our constitution to \ndetermine public school policy and\n\n[[Page S5855]]\n\nto have control and management over our public school system. The model \nin our State contemplates coordination between our Governor and the \nboard through the appointment of these five members that the Governor \nis directed to appoint.\n  The Federal Government should not attempt to undo the balance \nachieved in the State of New Mexico by giving the Governor federally \nmandated veto power over what a majority of the board decides. To do so \nwould deprive the voters of New Mexico of the right to vote for the \nmajority of our school board and to have that majority set policy in \nour State.\n  The impact of the amendment the Senator from Ohio is offering would \nnot be unique to New Mexico. I am not just offering my second-degree \namendment because of a problem in New Mexico. Virtually no two States \nuse the same model for education governance. I know of no State that \nvests ultimate authority solely with the Governor or gives the Governor \na veto. Some States vest the authority in a State school superintendent \nappointed by the Governor. But in most, if not all of these States, \nthis appointment is subject to confirmation by the State legislature.\n  In some States, the Governor sits on or chairs the State's board of \neducation and has a defined role in the development and approval of \nState education plans. Federal provisions requiring additional signoff \nand approval by the Governor give the Governor a power to revise or \noverrule the very board the citizens of the State have established to \nmake these decisions. In those States where the constitution vests \nautonomy and power in elected State boards and/or State \nsuperintendents--there are at least 13 States that do this--the \nadoption of the Voinovich amendment would substantially override State \nlaw and the will of the people of the State. If States want Governors \nto make these decisions, they can so provide, but we should not be \nmaking a provision like that in this bill as a side consequence of our \nother legislation.\n  As is pointed out in a joint letter signed by 20 major educational \norganizations that support my second-degree amendment, the amendment by \nthe Senator from Ohio would allow Governors to supersede State-\ndetermined authority by requiring Governors' approval of the decisions \non applications and plans assigned by the State to the State education \nauthority.\n  I ask unanimous consent this letter by these organizations be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Organizations Supporting State Authority in The Administration of \n                       Federal Education Programs\n\n                                                     May 21, 2001.\n     To: Members of the United States Senate:\n\n\n    VOTE YES FOR THE BINGAMAN-HATCH AMENDMENT TO ASSURE GOVERNORS' \n           PARTICIPATION IN ESEA STATE PLANS AND APPLICATIONS\n\n       The undersigned organizations urge you to vote YES on the \n     Bingaman-Hatch 2nd Degree Amendment to the Voinovich \n     Amendment No. 389. The Binhaman-Hatch Amendment provides that \n     state plans and applications for ESEA would be prepared and \n     submitted by state education agencies after consultation with \n     governors. This will assure coordination of these state plans \n     and applications for federal programs with state education \n     policy and also assure that the federal government is not \n     superimposing an education governance structure on the \n     states.\n       The undersigned organizations previously have urged the \n     Senate to vote NO on the Voinovich Amendment No. 389 because \n     it would require that governors jointly prepare plans and \n     applications for the entire Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act together with state education agencies. We \n     oppose that amendment because it makes a very fundamental \n     change in the time-honored separation of powers for education \n     between the federal and state governments. The governance and \n     administration of education is clearly the responsibility of \n     states. The federal government has recognized this authority \n     in all of the elementary and secondary education acts over \n     the past 50 years by providing that whatever each state has \n     determined to be its administering agency for elementary and \n     secondary education will the agency responsible for the \n     federal education programs. The federal government must \n     continue to rely on that agency without imposing added \n     conditions!\n       A copy of our letter of opposition is attached.\n       The federal government has provided that whatever choice a \n     state makes in education governance, through a combination of \n     elected or appointed officials, powers of state boards of \n     education, state legislatures, governors or chief state \n     school officers, that state determination is final. Federal \n     statutes have not and must not overturn that determination by \n     requiring additional authorities for governors, or other \n     officials, not otherwise provided by the state constitution \n     or state law.\n       The United States Senate has the opportunity to maintain \n     the recognition of state sovereignty while advancing \n     provisions in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act that \n     would encourage coordination among state officials and \n     explicitly provide for consultation by the state education \n     agency with the governor in the preparation of plans and \n     applications for ESEA.\n       The undersigned organizations believe the issues of \n     governance and administration are of critical importance with \n     respect to the fundamental authority of state and local \n     responsibility for elementary and secondary education. The \n     Voinovich amendment is not a minor extension of authority \n     for coordination and consultation. It is a fundamental \n     change in federal-state relations by imposing requirements \n     which are properly the responsibility of the states. We \n     urge your vote for the Bingamin-Hatch amendment which \n     truly provides for appropriate participation by the \n     governor.\n       To assist with understanding of the specific provisions and \n     consequences of the Voinovich amendment No. 389, we also \n     attach a set of questions and answers about that amendment.\n       We urge your support of the amendment by Senators Bingaman \n     and Hatch.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Association of School Administrators, American \n           Association of University Women, American Federation of \n           Teachers, Association for Career and Technical \n           Education, California State Superintendent of Public \n           Instruction, Citizens Commission on Civil Rights, \n           Council for Exceptional Children, Council for Chief \n           State School Officers, International Reading \n           Association, Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, \n           National Alliance of Black School Educators, National \n           Association for Bilingual Education, National \n           Association of Elementary School Principals, National \n           Association of Federally Impacted Schools, National \n           Association of School Psychologists, National \n           Association of Secondary School Principals, National \n           Association of State Boards of Education, National \n           Association of State Directors of Special Education, \n           National Association of State Title I Directors, \n           National PTA, National School Boards Association, \n           School Social Work Association of America, United \n           Church of Christ Justice and Witness Ministries.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The second-degree amendment I will propose, along with \nSenators Hatch and Kennedy, will provide for coordination between \nGovernors and State education authorities, but it will not have the \neffect of superseding State-determined decisionmaking. Through \nconsultation, the Governor and the State education authority will \nreview key issues and ensure the plans and applications are consistent \nwith overall State policy for education.\n  It is my understanding Senator Voinovich will modify his amendment to \nadd a new phrase. The phrase is ``unless expressly prohibited by State \nconstitution or law.'' The modification does not solve the problem \nabout which I am concerned. State constitutions and laws do not \nexpressly prohibit any State authority from acting with respect to \neducation. Instead, in my State and all States I am aware of, the State \nconstitution affirmatively assigns responsibility to certain State \nauthorities. They do not prohibit other State authorities from taking \naction.\n  The amendment with the modification still would have the effect of \ninterfering with State sovereignty by giving Governors a veto power \nover State plans under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I \nbelieve this second-degree amendment is a better alternative. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it. I appreciate the chance to explain the \namendment at this point.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S5856]]\n\n                     Amendment No. 509, As Modified\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the yeas and nays on the Collins-Conrad amendment be vitiated, and \nthat the amendment be agreed to by a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 509), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will take one moment to thank the \nSenator from Maine for this excellent amendment. There has been concern \nabout what is going to be the real cost. There have been wide \ndisparities in terms of the estimates. I have looked through a number \nof these studies. The Senator from Maine said let's really get a \ndefinitive study so we will know what the burden upon the States is \ngoing to be so we can act responsibly. I think it makes a great deal of \nsense. I think it will make even more sense if we include the more \nrecent alterations that are in the Wellstone amendment.\n  I thank the Senator. I think this is enormously helpful and valuable.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts \nand the Senator from New Hampshire for their kind comments. I \nappreciate their support for the amendment. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 389, As Modified\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I call up amendment 390, and I send a \nmodification to my amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 389), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 7, line 21, add ``and the Governor'' after \n     ``agency''.\n       On page 8, line 1, insert ``and the Governor'' after \n     ``agency''.\n       On page 35, line 10, strike the end quotation mark and the \n     second period.\n       On page 35, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n       ``(c) State Plan.--Each Governor and State educational \n     agency shall jointly prepare a plan to carry out the \n     responsibilities of the State under sections 1116 and 1117, \n     including carrying out the State educational agency's \n     statewide system of technical assistance and support for \n     local educational agencies.\n       ``(d) Nonapplication of Provisions.--The requirements of \n     this section shall not apply to a State where compliance with \n     such requirements is expressly prohibited by the State \n     constitution or a State law.''.\n       On page 35, line 20, insert ``, that, unless expressly \n     prohibited by a State constitution or law, is jointly \n     prepared and signed by the Governor and the chief State \n     school official,'' after ``a plan''.\n       On page 706, line 8, insert ``Governor and the'' after \n     ``which a''.\n       On page 706, line 16, insert ``Governor and the'' after \n     ``A''.\n       On page 707, line 2, insert ``Governor and the'' after \n     ``A''.\n       On page 708, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n       ``(c) Nonapplication of Provisions.--The requirements of \n     this section shall not apply to a State where compliance with \n     such requirements is expressly prohibited by the State \n     constitution or a State law.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, throughout the course of the debate on \nthe education bill, we have been proceeding toward the goal of bringing \npositive change to our education system. However, for these school \nreforms to succeed, we need to ensure that the parties affected by this \nbill are able to work in unison.\n  In nearly every instance where federal funds pass-through to states \nfrom highways to health care the Federal government directs those \nFederal funds to go right to Governors and to State legislatures.\n  The exception is education, where State education agencies are the \ndirect recipients of Federal funds for education. Most of that funding \nis then passed on to local schools.\n  State plans submitted by State education departments to the U.S. \nDepartment of Education set the guidelines local school officials are \nto follow in coming up with their own spending plans.\n  However, there is no requirement for coordination between chief State \nschool officers and Governors on how Federal education dollars are to \nbe used in a State.\n  In some States, the chief State school officers are appointed by \nGovernors. In other States, though, chief State school officers are \nelected.\n  Whatever situation exists between chief State school officers and \nGovernors, in the final analysis, it is the Governors of our States who \nare held accountable for the overall condition and success of public \nschools. I can testify to that as a former Governor of Ohio.\n  As it is currently written, the Senate's ESEA reauthorization bill \nalso holds governors accountable for student progress, even where \nGovernors have no current discretion over federal education programs \nand federal education funding.\n  In my view, it doesn't make sense that a Governor, who has to manage \nhis or her State's budget and is responsible for any shortfall, is not \nrequired to be consulted when state educational officers set education \npriorities.\n  That is why I have offered this amendment.\n  This amendment is simple: for programs where a State receives federal \nmonies under ESEA, both a chief State school officer and that State's \nGovernor need to sign the education plan that is submitted to the \nSecretary of Education.\n  Requiring joint sign-off on education plans by the Governor and the \nchief State school officer ensures agreement over the content of the \nState's submitted education plan.\n  The amendment we have offered makes sure that Federal education funds \nwork with State education funds for the benefit of our children.\n  Opponents of our amendment have made the assertion that under this \namendment the Federal Government would be imposing a new structure of \neducation on the states by superceding State law.\n  This is incorrect.\n  Each State's constitution or its statutes create a State education \nagency that administers State education programs. This amendment does \nnot change State or local education policy or structures. This \namendment only applies to Federal education policy. It only applies to \nESEA. Our amendment would leave State governing authority alone.\n  Here is how it would work.\n  Today, nearly every State files a consolidated education plan to the \nSecretary of Education to receive ESEA funds. State constitutions and \nlaws do not define what entity signs the ESEA consolidated plans.\n  Most State constitutions and accompanying statutes were passed long \nbefore ESEA was even written. In fact, it is the Federal Government--\nESEA itself--that specifically states that State education agencies \nshould sign the consolidated plans that nearly every State uses.\n  Some of my colleagues have expressed their concerns that this \namendment may violate State constitutions and laws because a particular \nState may give sole authority for education policy to the State \neducation agencies.\n  To address these concerns, we have modified the amendment to say that \nthis joint sign-off will not apply if it is prohibited under a state's \nconstitution or its laws.\n  In other words, this amendment will not supersede State constitutions \nor State laws. Any State that gives their State education agency the \nsole statutory authority to sign these plans can do so.\n  My co-sponsors, Senator Evan Bayh, Senator Ben Nelson, and Senator \nChuck Hagel, and I are not proposing to substitute State education \nauthority with Federal authority.\n  As a former Governor of my State, I have fought for years to support \nState education authority, and I believe my co-sponsors have as well. \nIn addition, we realize that each State's Governor plays a key role in \nthe development of education policy.\n  That is something a lot of people fail to realize--that during the \n1980s, and, frankly, during the term when President Clinton was \nGovernor of Arkansas, and during the period when he became chairman of \nthe National Governors' Association, the Governors really became \nintimately involved in education in their respective States.\n\n[[Page S5857]]\n\n  There were education summits in 1989, 1996, and 1999. In each State \nit is the Governor who works with the legislature to determine key \nState education policies and funding priorities.\n  It seems logical that the individual who helps direct a State's \neducation policy and education funding--the Governor--should have some \nmeaningful input into where the Federal money that State receives goes.\n  This amendment makes sense because under ESEA we say that States that \ntake title I funds must target them to poor students. In this bill, we \nstate that if a State takes funds, they must test students from grades \n3 to 8. So it is not radical for us to say that if the States receive \nFederal funding, they should coordinate that spending so that it works \nwith the State's education spending.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that Congress supplies only 7 percent of \nthe education funding in America. This amendment only addresses that 7 \npercent. Why wouldn't we want that 7 percent to be coordinated with the \n93 percent that are State and local funds? However, the substitute \namendment offered by my colleague from New Mexico does not ensure \ncoordination.\n  Currently, in some States, politics and personalities create \ndifferences between Governors and State school officers. This is again \nsomething that is not talked about in this country, but there are many \nStates where the Governors and their State chief school officers rarely \nspend time together discussing education. In my State, I was fortunate \nthat we developed a good interpersonal relationship with each other, \nbut in many cases that is not the situation. In other words, what my \namendment would do is require that the Governor sign off, unless it is \nin violation of a State constitution or State law.\n  I believe that requiring a joint signoff on education plans by the \nGovernor and the chief State school officer enables the Governor to \nleverage and ensure coordination of State education funding to work \nwith the Federal dollars Congress allocates. And the only way to fully \nleverage Federal funds is to ensure the coordination of those funds \nwith State efforts.\n  Our modified amendment preserves State authority and ensures the \ncoordination of Federal and State roles to promote education reform and \nthe efficient expenditure of education dollars to the maximum benefit \nof our students.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the Bingaman substitute amendment and \nto vote for what I consider to be a very commonsense approach and one \nthat recognizes that today in our States--if we are going to get the \nkind of education we want for our children, if we are going to get the \nkind of coordination of our Federal dollars with our State dollars, and \nto make the maximum use of them for the benefit of our kids--it is \nimportant that the Governors of our respective States sign off on the \napplications that are submitted by their States to the Secretary of \nEducation for the use of Federal funds under ESEA.\n  I thank you, Mr. President. With the Chair's permission, I yield the \nremainder of my time to the Senator from Indiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson  of Florida). The Senator from \nIndiana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise to add my voice to that \nof my distinguished colleague from the State of Ohio on behalf of the \nVoinovich amendment. I do so because I believe this amendment is \nnecessary to make the most of the historic opportunity that lies before \nus to improve the quality of education for all of America's \nschoolchildren.\n  This amendment is important. It is needed to make sure that our \neffort is comprehensive. One of the good things about the bill that has \nbeen authored to date is that it includes all the stakeholders \nnecessary to improve the quality of public education. It includes \nteachers, administrators, those in higher education, parents, and \nothers who are important to improving the quality of America's public \nschools.\n  It will be strange if we do not include the chief executive officers \nof the States, those who are charged with the welfare and well-being of \nthe citizens within their States. Most of the time--the vast majority \nof the time--there is no more important issue for the States' chief \nexecutives--the Governors --than the quality of education for America's \nschoolchildren. For this to be a comprehensive effort including all \nstakeholders, we must include the Governors of the 50 States.\n  It is important for this amendment to be adopted in order for this \neffort to be coordinated. We will not reap the full fruits of our \nefforts if Federal policy heads in one direction which is completely \nuncoordinated and irrelevant to State policy heading in another \ndirection.\n  To maximize the potential of the reforms we seek to enact, to truly \nmake historic progress, it is important that the State and Federal \nefforts dovetail together in a coordinated manner to give America's \nschoolchildren the very best opportunity to get the education they so \nrichly deserve. Adoption of the Voinovich amendment is important for \nthis ESEA reauthorization to maximize its effectiveness.\n\n  I would like to observe that even with the additional funding we hope \nto achieve--which is so vitally important--still no more than 6 or 7 \npercent of the funds provided to America's local schools will come from \nthe Federal level. Fully 94, 93 percent will continue to come from \nState and local governments.\n  We are instituting, as a part of this process, historic \naccountability provisions. I anticipate they will identify many schools \nthat need substantial improvement. They will identify many students who \nare at risk of being left behind if we do not give them the education \nthey so desperately need.\n  State and local governments will continue to be at the forefront of \nmaking that progress possible since they provide the bulk of the \nresources. It is vitally important that we include Governors in this \nprocess for the following reason: I have not seen a single State \neducation reform effort anywhere in this country succeed without the \nactive, vigorous participation of the Governor of the State. In real \npractical terms, it simply does not happen.\n  It is the Governor who submits the State budget requesting more \nfunding for education. It is the Governor who, very often working with \nthe State legislature, and with the cooperation of the chief State \nschool official, puts together the programmatic parts of any education \nreform effort.\n  If we hope to use this opportunity to catalyze meaningful reform and \nprogress at the State and local level, we simply must have Governors \ninvolved because, as a practical matter, it is the Governors who get \nthe job done.\n  As I said, I am not aware of a single major State education reform \neffort in this country that has been accomplished without the active \ninvolvement and participation of the Governor. That is why they at \nleast need to be involved in the applications that are being submitted \nfor the use of Federal funds as well.\n  Finally, let me say a few words with regard to States rights. This \namendment does not give the Governors unfettered discretion. It does \nnot put the Governors in charge. It simply says that Governors must \nwork, consult and cooperate with the State chief school officers. That \nis as it should be if we are going to reap the full fruits of this \neffort.\n  It says to the States, with respect to their constitutions and laws, \nyou do it as you see fit, but at least we would like to have the \nGovernor consulted, if that does not run counter to a provision of \nState constitutional or statutory law.\n  I have been interested over the last couple of years I have been \nprivileged to serve as a Member of this body, having been a Governor \nfor 8 years--just as my colleague from Ohio was the Governor of his \nfair State for 8 years--to occasionally hear the skepticism and the \nconcern with which some members of the Federal Government view State \ngovernments in general and Governors in particular. This is \ninteresting, considering a growing number of Members of this body \nhappen to have been Governors once upon a time themselves.\n  It was also interesting for me to observe and to listen, when I was a \nGovernor in the Governors' meetings, to the skepticism and concern with \nwhich many Governors view the Federal Government and Washington, DC.\n  Surely, in the spirit of the moment, when we are seeking more \nbipartisan\n\n[[Page S5858]]\n\ncooperation between the parties--surely, at a time we are seeking more \ncooperation between the executive and the legislative branches--perhaps \nat this moment we can seek a new spirit of federalism as well, ensuring \nthat the chief executives of the States, working in cooperation with \nthe chief State school officers, make the most of this historic moment \nto truly have a reform of America's education system of which we can be \nproud and which will serve our children well.\n  In order to accomplish that, Governors must be involved. That is what \nthe Voinovich amendment will accomplish. That is why I am pleased to \nspeak on its behalf.\n  I thank my colleagues for their patience, and I am pleased to yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly oppose the Voinovich amendment \nand its attempt to change the role of the Governors in Federal \neducation policy. The amendment would require Governors and chief State \nschool officers to sign off jointly on any title I plan or consolidated \nESEA plan. As a result, the Governor would have veto power over all \nFederal ESEA funding and reform. For the first time, the Governor would \nhave a veto over all Federal ESEA funding and reform.\n  The Voinovich amendment would supersede current State law by giving \nthe Governor the veto power, regardless of the State constitution or \ncurrent State law.\n  The proponent, Senator Voinovich, asked for a modification of the \namendment and in the modification, he provides, under ``Nonapplication \nof Provisions'':\n\n       The requirements of this section shall not apply to a State \n     where compliance with such requirements is expressly \n     prohibited by State constitution or a State law.\n\n  Find a State constitution that prohibits activities. State \nconstitutions guarantee. They authorize and they protect rights and \nliberties. But they don't basically prohibit. He is saying that this \nwill go into effect unless it is prohibited. That is basically an \nentirely new concept in terms of many States.\n  States have made decisions about how they are going to administer \ntheir education law, and we have, to date, worked in the development of \nthis legislation, with the language that we have that permits \nconsulting with the Governors. But now this will change that particular \nprovision.\n  The Federal Government has a strong role to play in ensuring that the \nneediest children get the support they need to obtain a good education. \nBy superseding State law and giving veto power to the Governor over \nFederal education policy, the amendment would concentrate greater power \nin the government and would unfairly tilt the balance against other \nauthorities in the States.\n  Under the current law, State education agencies in every State \nimplement Federal and State education policy. We want to ensure that \nthere is a strong coordination among all education programs so that \nlocal schools obtain the best support available. The Voinovich \namendment would distort the control of education policy in each State, \ncausing confusion and unnecessary burdens on States and local \ncommunities.\n  We have all worked together to create a bill that focuses on strong, \nurgently needed reforms, especially in areas of testing, \naccountability, and targeted support for students in failing schools. \nWe have also worked together to create the right overall structure for \neducational policy in the Federal system. Under the bill's pilot \nprograms on performance agreements, the Governor is required to consult \nwith the State education agency. That is an appropriate role for the \nGovernor and one that I support.\n  I, therefore, urge the Senate to approve the amendment offered by \nSenators Bingaman and Hatch and to ensure that Governors consult with \nState education agencies in implementing Federal education policy. \nTheir amendment gives the State Governor an expanded role without \nundermining the State law or constitutions by giving the Governors a \nveto.\n  We have seen in the past where title I programs that have gone into \nthe States effectively have gone to the local communities. We have \nother education programs that go to the States and are administered at \nthe State level. And we have respected those, the way that the States \nhave worked out their administration of it. But this changes action in \nthe States which the States have not indicated they wanted to change in \na number of different States. We have not had any hearings on this. We \ndon't know. We can go through the various States which this legislation \nwould effectively override. There are many. But we haven't given that \nconsideration.\n\n  We are glad to give it some consideration at some time, but we are \neffectively overriding the authority for the distribution of the \nresources at the State level by Federal fiat. That is the effect of \nthis program of Senator Voinovich.\n  Under the Bingaman proposal, we are taking the responsible action of \nensuring that there will be a consultation, but we are respectful. If \nit is handled one way in a State under the Governor, that is the way it \nought to be. If it is handled under the State education authority, that \nis the way it ought to be.\n  I am just wary of the Senate overriding State decisions about how \nthat will be distributed. That would be the effect of it. The Bingaman \namendment addresses this and is the way we ought to follow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I appreciate the words of the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts. I rise to make a couple of points with regard to \nhis remarks.\n  No. 1, if we think about it, when the State constitutions were \nadopted, there was no contemplation at all of a Federal role in \neducation. As a matter of fact, up until the last couple of decades, \neducation was primarily the responsibility of State and local \ngovernment. The education arena has changed dramatically.\n  As I pointed out in my remarks a few minutes ago, the Governors have \ntaken a much larger role in education than ever before in this country. \nThey started to play a role in 1983, when we had the report on the \ncrisis in education, ``A Nation at Risk.'' As I mentioned, it was \nGovernor Clinton who brought all of the Governors together to deal with \nthe challenge of education in their respective States.\n  Since that time, Governors have become much more involved in \neducation. If people were asked whether their Governor would sign off \non an application from their respective States for the use of Federal \nmoney, they would be shocked to know that their Governors are not \nrequired to sign off on that application. My amendment is not intended \nto be a veto. It is intended for the Governors who are being held \nresponsible by the citizens in their respective States for education \npolicies to have an opportunity to participate in putting the plan \ntogether as to how those Federal dollars are going to be used in their \nStates.\n  Rather than a veto, having the Governor involved is going to enhance \nthe application and make it more meaningful because it is the Governor \nwho is responsible in most of the States for the budget that is \nallocated for education and it is the Governor who takes the leadership \nrole.\n  I can tell my colleagues, in Ohio today there is a discussion going \non about whether or not Ohio is meeting the standards of the State \nsupreme court. It is not the superintendent of public education that is \nbeing held responsible by the Supreme Court of the State of Ohio. It is \nthe Governor of the State of Ohio and the State legislature that are \nbeing held responsible.\n  This amendment is not going to do any harm whatsoever to what is \nhappening in our States in terms of Federal money. Rather, it is going \nto enhance the utilization of those Federal dollars because it is going \nto require the coordination and cooperation of the Governors and the \nchief State school officers to utilize those moneys on the State level.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, some States have made a judgment that \nthey want the Governor involved. This legislation respects that. In \nother States, they have made the judgment that they don't want it, that \nthey want the State educational agency to be in charge. We respect \nthat.\n  Under the amendment of the Senator from Ohio, he overrides that State \ndecision. What we are saying is, with this\n\n[[Page S5859]]\n\nlegislation, even the State authority ought to consult.\n  Let me just wind up, and I will list the various groups opposed to \nthis legislation. They make this point:\n\n       We oppose the amendment because it makes a very fundamental \n     change in a time-honored separation of powers for education \n     between the Federal and State governments. The governance and \n     administration of education is clearly the responsibility of \n     the States. The Federal Government is recognized as the \n     authority in all the Elementary and Secondary Education Acts \n     for 50 years by providing that whatever each State has \n     determined to be its administrative agency for elementary and \n     secondary education will be the agency responsible for the \n     Federal education programs. The Federal Government must \n     continue to rely on that agency without imposing added \n     conditions.\n\n  Now, the Voinovich amendment does alter that and changes those \nconditions. That is why these 28 groups are against it.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 791 to Amendment No. 389\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, momentarily, I will send a second-degree \namendment to the Voinovich amendment. At the appropriate time, we will \nmove toward a vote on these two proposals. I believe the leadership has \nmade that request. It will be at approximately 4:30 this afternoon. I \nnow send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], for Mr. \n     Bingaman, for himself and Mr. Hatch, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 791 to amendment No. 389.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 7 line 21 insert ``after consultation with the \n     Governor'' after ``agency''.\n       On page 8 line 1 insert ``after consultation with the \n     Governor'' after ``agency''.\n       On page 35, line 10, strike the end quotation mark and the \n     second period.\n       On page 35 between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n       ``(c) State Plan.--Each State educational agency, in \n     consultation with the Governor, shall prepare a plan to carry \n     out the responsibilities of the State under 1116 and 1117, \n     including carrying out the State educational agency's \n     statewide system of technical assistance and support for \n     local educational agencies.''\n       On page 35 line 20, insert the following: ``prepared by the \n     chief State school official, in consultation with the \n     Governor,'' after ``a plan''.\n       On page 706 line 8, insert ``, after consultation with the \n     Governor,'' after ``which''.\n       On page 707 line 16, insert ``fter consultation with the \n     Governor, a''.\n       On page 707 line 2, insert ``fter consultation with the \n     Governor, a''.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 431 to Amendment No. 358\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment, and I call up amendment No. 431.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment seeks to help parents \nmeaningfully become involved in the education of their children. We all \nbelieve--every individual in this Chamber--that parents are essential \nparts of the educational process. Our challenge is to translate that \nfeeling and that rhetoric into real involvement by parents in the \nschools of America.\n  We know that research has shown us that regardless of economic or \nethnic or cultural background, parental involvement is a major factor \nin the academic success of children. Parental involvement contributes \nto better grades, better test scores, higher homework completion rates, \nbetter attendance, and greater discipline. When parental involvement is \na priority in a school, those schools do exceptionally well. It \nimproves not only the performance of children, it improves staff moral, \nand it creates and helps engender a climate where educational \nexcellence is the norm, not the exception.\n  We know this through research and through our own observations. \nParents themselves have declared invariably in survey after survey that \ntheir participation in the school is critical to the success of their \nchildren.\n  A 1999 American Association of School Administrators nationwide \nsurvey found that 96 percent of parents believe that parental \ninvolvement is critical for students to succeed in school. Eighty-four \npercent believe in parental involvement so strongly that they are \nwilling to require such involvement on a mandatory basis.\n  However, in the midst of all of this support--our observations, the \nresearch, and the expression of parents themselves--parental \ninvolvement is something that is not found frequently enough in our \nschools. Over 50 percent of the parents surveyed thought that schools \nwere not doing enough to inform them, not doing enough to involve them. \nIn fact, they felt they didn't even have basic information about their \nchildren's studies and the issues confronting their children's school.\n  A recent bipartisan survey sponsored by the National Education \nAssociation ranked the lack of parental involvement in children's \neducation as the No. 1 problem in schools today. We understand that \nthis is a critical issue.\n  The finding of the NEA was echoed recently by a poll cited in a \nDemocratic Leadership Council Update from December, 2000. This \nnewsletter pointed out that:\n\n       Parental involvement is critical to the success of both \n     individual students and their schools.\n\n  It concluded that we must get serious about ``schooling'' parents and \nmaking sure that parents understand how they can access their schools \nand how critical it is that they be involved in the lives of their \nchildren and how important it is that they are a part of the \neducational process in a very real way.\n  Now, to succeed in this endeavor, we have to work collaboratively \nwith everybody. We have to get school administrators and teachers \nprepared to respond to parents. We have to get parents prepared to \nassume the responsibility of being a major force in the educational \nlives of their children.\n  For many of us, this seems obvious. But that is not the case across \nthe country. We should recognize that. We have to prepare in this \nlegislation to make parents real partners in the education of their \nchildren. We need to train schools leaders, teachers, and\n\n[[Page S5860]]\n\nparents; and we have to make the climate in schools welcoming to \nparents. All of these tasks require our support, encouragement, and our \nleadership.\n  I am pleased to say the bill before us today contains many of the \nelements that will help us along this path to successful parental \ninvolvement. Many of these elements were included in legislation that I \nintroduced earlier in the session called The Parent Act. These elements \ninclude ensuring that title I families can access information on their \nchildren's progress in terms they can understand--not education-speak, \nnot technical jargon, but in terms they can all understand.\n  It would also involve parents in school support teams that would help \nturn failing schools around--recognizing that they, too, are part of \nthe education of their children.\n  It would also require technical assistance for title I schools and \ndistricts that are having problems implementing parental involvement \nprograms. Again, we think this is obvious, easy, simple. But when you \ngo into a typical school today, you have problems such as transient \npopulations, people coming into this country from other lands where \nEnglish is not the first language, and a host of other problems--\nschools have to be better prepared to involve the parents.\n  The legislation before us would also authorize, indeed require, the \ncollection and dissemination by the States of information about \neffective parental involvement programs. We know the models work, and \nwe want them disseminated across the full spectrum of schools in the \nUnited States.\n  The legislation would require involvement by parents in the violence \nand drug prevention efforts because we know that is a critical part of \nthe challenge today in many schools across the country.\n  It would also require an annual review by States and districts to \nlook at the parental involvement and professional development \nactivities for the school to ensure that these activities are \neffective, and that teachers are being trained to involve parents, and \nthat the involvement efforts are working.\n  Finally, it would require each local educational agency to make \navailable to parents an annual report card which explains whether \nschools are succeeding or not. These very meritorious initiatives are \nincluded in the legislation.\n  So I come today to say we have made some progress working together \nwith my colleagues on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee. But I believe we can do more, and I believe we must do more.\n  We are raising the stakes dramatically in schools throughout this \ncountry by requiring every child in grades 3-8 to take annual tests. \nWhen we raise the stakes, we also have to recognize that we have to do \nmore to make sure these children have an opportunity--a real \nopportunity--to succeed and to pass these examinations.\n  My amendment, quite simply, would build on an existing structure of \nlaw and increase the revenue stream going to schools so they can \nactually implement these parental involvement programs. They can move \nfrom rhetoric to real practice, from sentiment to accomplishment. I \nhope that is what we can do today with respect to this amendment.\n  Already, title I of the existing legislation--legislation that has \nbeen on the books for years now--in section 1118, requires districts \nall across this country to develop written parental involvement \npolicies and requires schools to develop school-parent compacts.\n  It also requires that schools hold annual meetings for parents, and \nit would require that parents be involved in school review and \nimprovement policies. That is the law today, but the reality is not \nenough schools are doing this because the funds are not there because \nother priorities, as they always seem to, intrude.\n  Districts are actually required to spend 1 percent of their title I \nallotment for the purposes I just discussed--school compact \npreparation, annual meeting with parents, involvement in school \nreviews--unless that 1 percent amounts to less than $5,000. In many \nschool districts, this 1 percent is less than $5,000. In fact, in Rhode \nIsland, 25 out of my 34 school districts are not required to spend any \nmoney because the total would be less than $5,000. As a result, this \nlegislative standard is seldom achieved. In fact, 4 years after they \nwere required by law, a quarter of the title I schools throughout the \nUnited States have not yet developed a school-parent compact.\n  As Secretary Paige testified--and he came from the Houston school \nsystem after working there and doing his best to improve and \nreinvigorate that school system--he indicated at the confirmation \nhearing that ``increased assistance will be needed''--his words--to \nenhance parental involvement.\n  We know what we want to do. We actually improved the legislative \nframework in this legislation, but we have to provide more assistance.\n  My amendment, which is strongly supported by the National PTA, does \nnot add to these mandates, but what it does is add resources. It gives \nlocalities flexibility. It does not require what is in the school-\nparent compact, it does not tell them there is only one method to \ncontact the parent, but what it says is we are serious. We are not just \ngoing to talk about parental involvement. We are going to give them the \nmeans to involve parents.\n  I believe this is a very powerful way to enhance education, and \ncertainly it is a concept that no one here would argue against.\n  The question comes down to, in my mind, Will we give these schools \nthe resources to do the job we want them to do?\n  My amendment provides the resources so parents can get more involved, \nas recommended by the Independent Review Panel in the Final Report of \nthe National Assessment of Title I.\n  We will adopt legislation that emphasizes accountability, but \naccountability without the resources to do many things, including \ninvolve parents, is not going to improve the educational process of the \nUnited States.\n  My amendment is critical to ensuring that we can develop a \ncoordinated focus that works in the schools for parental involvement. \nIt elevates parental involvement from something nice to do and maybe \nsomething you want to do if the money is available to something you can \nand should do because the language is clear and the resources are \navailable.\n  I strongly hope my colleagues will support this amendment and give to \nthe schools of America the resources to do what we all want them to do: \nimprove the education of children by involving parents, by ensuring \nthat the parent as the first teacher does not surrender that critical \nrole when that child enters school.\n  I will at the appropriate time ask for the yeas and nays when it is \njudged to be in order. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is in order at this time, if the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island wishes to make that request.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Chair repeat the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator was asking when it would be in \norder to request the yeas and nays. Does the Senator make that request?\n  Mr. REED. I make that request now pending the decision as to when a \nvote will be scheduled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Rhode Island, \nSenator Reed, for his perseverance on this issue over a long period of \ntime. He has been an enormously active, involved, informed, committed \nmember of our Education Committee. Not only does he have that \ncommitment in the Senate, but he had it in the House of Representatives \nas well.\n  When he talks about what we did in 1994 with title I, he knows \nbecause he was in that conference. Those of us who served with him know \nhis strong and sensible commitment on involving parents in the \neducation of their children, as well as on the issues of libraries. \nThere are many others, but those always spring up when I hear him talk \nabout education policy.\n  He is absolutely correct about the importance of parental \ninvolvement. I am not going to take the time of the Senate this \nafternoon, but there is an\n\n[[Page S5861]]\n\nexcellent report of the Department of Education of several years ago \nthat reaches the conclusion that there is significant academic \nimprovement by involving the parents in the educational learning \nprocess of children. The studies at that time happened to be in the \nfifth grade and earlier.\n  It is fairly self-evident--as a father, as well, of a senior who will \nbe graduating this Friday, and of a daughter who is in high school--\nevery parent who does involve themselves in that opportunity can make \nan extraordinary difference in the children's understanding as well as \ntheir desire to learn. I certainly have seen that through personal \nexperience, and I think most parents do.\n  The problem, as the Senator has pointed out, is that the teachers \nthemselves do not receive training in the techniques of involving the \nparents in the classroom and classroom work. With very limited \nresources, that effort can produce significant and profound results.\n  That is what the Senator is advocating this afternoon: that we take a \ntried and tested concept, which is parental involvement, and give \nadditional life to that concept in resources and build on what we did \nin the 1994 title I education legislation.\n  This builds on what we have attempted to do, and what we have \nattempted to do in this legislation is to understand better what is \nworking across this country and to give these menus to local \ncommunities and permit local communities to make decisions based upon \nlocal needs, and then to hold them accountable in how these funds are \ngoing to be invested and have an evaluation of these programs so we \nknow what is working in terms of our participation and our support of \nthese initiatives.\n  This one makes a great deal of sense. It is about as intuitive as any \namendment. Every parent who has a child in school understands the value \nof involvement. If more teachers reach out and involve the parents, \nthis will add an additional dimension.\n  We will build particularly on a number of the existing programs, most \nobviously in literacy, helping children to read and give new value to \nbooks and help them work with children in a very productive way.\n  I thank the Senator. I am hopeful this amendment will be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I also acknowledge, as did Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Reed's intense interest and efforts to address the issue of \nparental involvement in the school system. His mark is on this bill as \na result of that. Parents are mentioned literally hundreds of times in \nthis bill, and there are initiatives to try to give local school \ndistricts more resources to assist in bringing parents into the effort \nof the schoolday. In fact, there is a 1 percent setaside in the title I \nfunds money to carry forward parental involvement initiatives. This can \nadd up to a lot of money. That is where my concern is.\n\n  Essentially, the Senator from Rhode Island has suggested we create \nwhat amounts to a new $500 million program for parents and parental \nactivity in the school systems. It is pretty liberal in its structure. \nIt could be for coffees, in order to get parents involved; it could be \nfor mailers involving parents or for parent peer groups. It is hard for \npeople at the Federal level to be everything to everybody in education.\n  There are important needs in the area of education. But we need to \nremember that the Federal dollars in education are only 6 to 7 percent \nof the total dollars spent in local and elementary schools. To get the \nmost value for those dollars, we must focus those dollars in specific \nareas. We have chosen to focus those dollars on special needs children. \nWe have chosen to focus those dollars in this bill on children from \nlow-income families, and specifically on trying to raise the academic \nstandards of those children to make sure they are not left behind as \nthey move through the school system.\n  There are a lot of other issues that involve schools. There are good \nlanguage programs; there are good sports and computer science \nactivities. Equally important--and I do not deny it--is the need to \nhave parents involved with their children in the school system. \nHowever, we cannot be everything to everybody. If we create a new $500 \nmillion program for that, we are taking away from the initiatives being \ndirected at the areas where the Federal Government has chosen to set \naside priorities, the special needs programs and the actual academic \neducation of the low-income child. Because of the appropriation \nprocess, there will have to be a prioritization, and money will be \nmoved from place to place. Inevitably, somebody wins and somebody \nloses.\n  This program, No. 1, although well intentioned, is far too expensive \nfor the Federal Government to pursue; and, No. 2, it is inappropriate \nfor the Federal Government to pursue. We have to look seriously at the \ncost of this bill as we continue to add any more of these well-\nintentioned programs on to the bill.\n  The bill presently, by my estimations, over the life of the \nauthorization, is nearly $400 million over where it started. That is a \nlot of money. This is another $500 million on top of that. It may be an \nappropriate thought, but I do not think we need a new Federal program \nto accomplish this.\n  The issue of parental involvement is a local issue, probably the \nultimate local issue. Shouldn't parents get involved in the schoolday? \nAbsolutely. Should the Federal Government create the mechanisms to do \nthat? No. That is the local responsibility of the parent and the parent \nstructures within the local community and the local school systems \nwhich spend 93 percent of the education dollars in this country.\n  As well intentioned as this amendment is, I oppose it because I think \nit takes away from the main thrust of the bill. Therefore, it draws off \npotential resources we need to focus on, including the academic day and \nthe special needs child. This is simply an addition of $500 million on \ntop of what has already become an extraordinarily expensive bill, \nmoving beyond the availability of Members to support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my colleague \nfrom New Hampshire. He is exactly right. We have to be very careful \nabout picking our shots with respect to Federal policy and recognize \nthe predominance of the State and local community in education policy. \nEssentially, we have already made that decision. We made it years ago \nin the structure of title I. We passed laws requiring parent-school \ncompacts, we required a whole host of parental involvement issues, \nbecause we recognized, as we do today, parental involvement is \nabsolutely critical. It was not being performed, it was not being \nincorporated into the life of the schools, as it should be.\n  The question today is, Are we going to simply once again engage in a \nmore general rhetorical exercise, or are we going to put up real \nresources? I guess we could go into these title I schools, the quarter \nof them that have not yet even completed, after 4 years, their parent-\nschool compact, and perhaps order them to do it. Perhaps we could \nthreaten to remove funds. That, to me, is not helping accomplish what \nwe want to accomplish, which is making sure that these legislative \nrequirements are, in fact, in place in the schools of the United \nStates. The answer is providing them the resources to do what they want \nto do and what we want them to do but, because of conflicting \npriorities, are not being done.\n  In affluent communities, that typically don't have many title I \nstudents, for a variety of reasons--one spouse is not working and is at \nhome and able to participate; it is not difficult to communicate with \nschools because of the existence of the Internet; because the parents \nare college graduates--there are a host of reasons that we find there \nis parental involvement.\n  Our challenge is to go where it is harder to get the parental \ninvolvement: Parents may not have English as a first language or be \ncollege graduates; parents may not be a couple; rather, a single \nparent; parents might be forced to move periodically throughout the \nschool year from school to school. It is a difficult challenge. We \nrecognize that, and we have for years. We have said: Listen, schools, \nyou have to develop these plans, these compacts. You have to reach out, \nyou have to do better.\n\n[[Page S5862]]\n\n  In this legislation, and the work of Senator Kennedy, Senator \nJeffords, and Senator Gregg, we have incorporated even more the \nrecognition of parental involvement in our schools.\n  The question we face today, the classic question, is: Will we match \nour words with dollars? Will we match our requirements on schools to \naccept title I funds with real dollars to do what we want to do? I hope \nwe answer that question in the affirmative.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, our Nation is less literate today than it \nwas at the time of its founding. That might startle people, but that \nhappens to be a fact. We are moving in the wrong direction with regard \nto literacy.\n  My State of Massachusetts is recognized, by most of the various \neconomic evaluators and indicators, to be one of the top States from an \neducation point of view, and a third of our workforce is at level one. \nA third of our workforce is at level one on literacy. That means they \nhave difficulty reading a phone book. Those workers have children. \nThose children are going into title I schools, by and large. They may \nbe above the minimum wage, but many are going into schools that are \nhard pressed.\n  We now have results. We find adult literacy works, but that is more \ncomplicated because these are parents who have to go to class after a \nlong day's work, perhaps one or two jobs. This effort in bringing the \nfamily into the educational system has a proven, established record of \npositive results with regard to the parents and with regard to the \nchildren. All we are trying to do is make sure, if we have something \nthat we know works, we put that out before the local communities and \nlet them make the judgment as to whether they want to participate in \nthat program. That is what this amendment is all about.\n  Finally, it is true there has been a substantial increase in the cost \nof the legislation. It has been done in this way. To make sure the \nbenefit of this legislation has accountability--it has an enhancement \nof teacher professional development and mentoring, it has an expansion \nin the literacy programs and accountability programs, the science and \ntechnology afterschool programs--we are going to make that available \nnot just to a third of the children but to all the children. That has \nbeen done with the votes, particularly the bipartisan vote on Dodd-\nCollins and also the significant increase because of the bipartisan \nvote on Hagel-Harkin with regard to funding special needs.\n  Frankly, those were bipartisan efforts and I think they do reflect \nnational priorities. We are moving along.\n\n\n   Amendments Nos. 412, As Modified; 416; 444, As Modified; 449, As \n Modified; 454, As Modified; 485, As Modified; 488; 507, As Modified; \n        603, As Modified; 645, As Modified, to amendment No. 358\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have amendments which have been cleared \non both sides, and therefore I ask unanimous consent it be in order for \nthese amendments to be considered en bloc and any modifications, where \napplicable, be agreed to, the amendments be agreed to en bloc, and the \nmotions to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask if the impact aid amendment is in this group.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. No, it is not included in this group.\n  Mr. INHOFE. However, there is a pretty clear understanding it will be \nincluded?\n  I understand it has been agreed to on both sides. I will not object.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to talk with the Senator in the next few \nminutes and give him an update on that issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about my amendment \nsupporting National Technology Initiatives. I'd like to thank my \ncolleagues for accepting this amendment. My amendment seeks to ensure \nthat a program of research be conducted to identify and disseminate the \npractices under which technology is effectively integrated into \neducation to enhance teaching and learning and to improve student \nachievement, performance and technology literacy.\n  During a period when technology has fundamentally transformed \nAmerica's offices, factories and retail establishments, we have come to \nunderstand that if America is to maintain its place in the global \neconomy, we must transform our Nation's classrooms by infusing \ntechnology across the curriculum. One common element that almost \neveryone agrees upon for improving the Nation's schools has been the \nmore extensive and more effective utilization of educational \ntechnology. We have\n\n[[Page S5864]]\n\nmade progress. In large part, thanks to Federal funding under the e-\nrate program and the educational technology funds provided under a \nprogram that I sponsored during the 1994 reauthorization of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, student to computer ratios--\neven in the Nation's poorest schools--have improved and Internet access \nis no longer reserved just for schools in middle-class or wealthy \ncommunities. More and more classrooms are equipped with computers and \nother kinds of educational technologies. Teachers and students are \nbeginning to make use of the enormous learning potential that \neducational technology provides. In many schools and classrooms the use \nof educational technology has contributed in substantial ways to \nstudent learning.\n  We know that the use of educational technology in our schools is \nrelated to favorable educational outcomes but we need to know more. In \n1997, David Shaw, the Chairman of the President's Committee of Advisors \non Science and Technology (PCAST) outlined critical focus areas for \neducational technology research. Long term research designed to \nilluminate how technology might best be used to support the learning \nprocess was described. My amendment provides for such longitudinal \nresearch conducted through the Office of Educational Research and \nImprovement. In keeping with my ongoing interest in providing \naccountability for educational efforts, the research seeks to identify \nthe conditions and practices under which educational technology is \neffective in increasing student achievement. Further, the research \nauthorized under my amendment seeks to identify the conditions and \npractices that increase the ability to teachers to effectively \nintegrate technology into the curriculum and instruction, enhance the \nlearning environment and opportunities and increase student \nperformance, technology literacy and related 21st century skills. \nResearch of this nature is deemed critical to guiding our continued \nefforts to effectively infuse technology into our classroom activities. \nMy amendment provides that the findings of this research be made widely \navailable and sets aside a rather modest .5 percent of the federal \ntechnology funds for this purpose.\n  Recommendations from PCAST and other important stakeholder groups, \nincluding the Web-Based Commission and the CEO Forum, continue to \nemphasize the importance of conducting research about how educational \ntechnology works to enhance student learning. It seems likely that \nfurther experience with the use of educational technology in our \nschools will result in significant improvements over time in \neducational outcomes. However, such improvements are critically \ndependent on long-term rigorous research aimed at assessing the \nefficacy and cost-effectiveness of various approaches to the use of \neducational technology in actual classrooms. The questions that remain \nno longer relate to whether or not technology can be used effectively \nin schools. Rather the questions relate to how approaches to technology \nuse in the classroom are in fact most effective and cost-effective in \npractice. I believe that this amendment will ensure that we will \ncontinue to find answers to these questions.\n  Thank-you.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. For the information of the Senate, we expect the vote on \nthe amendment of the Senator from Rhode Island sometime in the later \nafternoon. There will be a proposal on behalf of the leadership that \nwill indicate the exact time, but it will be sometime around 5 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to make a couple of comments \nabout the amendment to which I alluded with the Senator from \nMassachusetts just a moment ago. It has to do with impact aid. I think \nthat is a very misunderstood issue.\n  Back in the 1950s when various Government programs and military \ninstallations and other land operations came in and took land off the \ntax rolls, that had a negative impact on our schools. I know in my \nState of Oklahoma we have five major military installations. While the \namount of money that would be generated from the taxes is taken off the \ntax rolls, we still have to educate the children. For that reason, back \nin the 1950s a program was set up to replenish the money that otherwise \nwould have gone to schools.\n  This is something everyone supports. However, since the 1950s, there \nhas been this insatiable appetite for politicians to take money out of \nthe system, and they have done this, so impact aid has dropped down to \nabout 25 percent of funding.\n  Starting 3 years ago, I had an amendment to incrementally build that \nup. Hopefully, 4 or 5 years from now, we will reach the point where it \nwill be 100 percent funded. This is the right thing to do. It is not \npartisan, liberal or conservative. It is something that has to be done. \nWe have an amendment, and, I say to the Senator from Massachusetts as \nwell as the Senator from New Hampshire, I appreciate their cooperation \nand willingness to include this in the managers' amendment.\n  As I say, we have passed this now for 2 consecutive years. We are \nslowly getting up to where we can properly take care of school \ndistricts that have been unfavorably impacted by the reduction in the \ntax rolls. I thank them for that and for their assurance this will be \nin a managers' amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand the impact aid amendment, \nI am going to urge the support of that amendment. It will be included \nin the next group for consent. It is in the pipeline, and I have every \nexpectation it will be so included and I thank the Senator for his \ncooperation on that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am delighted to rise today to address \nanother amendment, if the Senator from Massachusetts is ready for that?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes. We are ready.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I move to lay aside the pending amendment temporarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 517 to Amendment No. 358\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Earlier in this debate, I came to the floor with \ncolleagues from both sides of the aisle to focus on what I believe is \none of our greatest national crises; namely, the shortage of teachers \nin our highest need schools. By that I mean schools that do not have \nqualified teachers, whether they are in inner cities, in older suburbs, \nor in our rural areas. I was very pleased we passed a bipartisan \namendment incorporating many of the ideas that I and others brought to \nthe floor, to provide needed resources to recruit and retain teachers, \nthat will help our children meet high academic standards.\n  Along with qualified teachers and up-to-date resources, all students \nneed to attend schools where we have high-quality principals who will \nwork together with teachers and parents to create a learning \nenvironment that will maximize the achievements of every single child. \nBut too many schools around our country open their doors every school \nyear without principals in place or without the kind of high-quality \nprincipals every school should be able to have.\n  I really believe we would be remiss if we did not recognize that our \nschools are struggling to find principals, just as they are struggling \nto find qualified teachers. In fact, more than 40 percent of public \nschool principals are expected to retire in the next 10 years. The \nproblem is especially severe in our urban and rural areas, with 52 \npercent of rural districts reporting a shortage and 47 percent of urban \ndistricts.\n  In public schools in New York City, for example, 65 percent of our \ncurrent principals are eligible to retire. In New York State overall, \n50 percent of all principals are expected to retire in the next 5 \nyears.\n\n  In any business, in any walk of life, if we thought we were going to \nlose half of our leaders, I think we would be quite concerned. I bring \nthat concern to the floor because we simply cannot afford to lose the \npeople who are supposed to be providing instructional leadership and \ndirection to our teachers. That is why earlier this year I introduced \nthe National Teacher and Principal Recruitment Act.\n  Today I am offering an amendment that reflects part of my bill \nfocused on recruiting principals. It authorizes the Secretary of \nEducation to offer grants to recruit and retain principals in high-need \nschool districts through such activities as mentoring new principals,\n\n[[Page S5865]]\n\nproviding financial incentives or bonuses to recruit principals, and \nproviding career mentorship and professional development activities.\n  I believe if we are serious about educational reform, we have to be \nserious about recruiting and retaining qualified principals. If we are \ngoing to have a system that holds our students and our teachers \naccountable, we have to have somebody who is responsible for \nimplementing those accountability measures. That, to me, leads us to \ncall for the CEOs, if you will, of our schools. Those are our \nprincipals.\n  We need school leaders to guide our teachers and help our students to \nachieve high academic standards.\n  A 1999 report issued by the National Association of State Boards of \nEducation characterized effective principals as ``the linchpins of \nschool improvement'' and ``the gatekeepers of change.''\n  We know a similar study conducted by the Arthur Andersen consulting \nfirm, of high- and low-performing schools in Jersey City and Patterson, \nNJ, found that the one attribute of all the high-performing schools we \nvisited is a dedicated and dynamic principal.\n  I have been going in and out of schools, I guess, ever since I was in \none myself but, as an adult, for nearly 20 years. And I know from my \nown observation and experience that the principal is the key. We can \nhave great teachers, but if they are in a system or in a school that \ndoesn't value their contributions and that doesn't work with them to do \nthe very best they can, we are not going to get the results that we \nneed.\n  In 1999, New York City schools opened their doors with 165 \nuncertified principals. In Buffalo last year, the school district faced \n10 principal vacancies and only received 11 applications.\n  So they basically will put a warm body in wherever they can find one. \nAnd that is not a problem that is unique to New York. In Vermont, one \nout of five principals had retired or resigned by the end of the last \nschool year. In Washington State, 15 percent of principals retired or \nresigned. And in Baltimore, 34 of 180 principals left in the last 2 \nyears alone.\n  I absolutely would agree that an amendment is not going to turn this \nproblem around, but we have to recognize the problem, be willing to \nadmit its extraordinary depth around our country, and then try to put \ninto place at the local, State, and Federal level efforts to try to \nfill the need.\n  We need efforts such as the one that is currently going on in New \nYork City where the chancellor is providing additional training and \nsupport to principals who are new to the profession to help them \nbelieve they can make that kind of commitment to difficult schools that \nreally need their leadership. The nonprofit New Leaders for New Schools \nProject is also trying to attract talented teachers into the ranks of \nour principals.\n  This amendment is a small step to support local and State efforts to \nrecruit and retain the next generation of school leaders. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote in favor of our principals and in favor of \nrecruiting and retaining them.\n  In New York, Norman Wechsler, a former principal of Dewitt Clinton \nHigh School in the Bronx, illustrates the importance of this problem. \nHe helped to lead that school from failure to success by raising the \nstandards and holding students and teachers accountable for results.\n  It is very important that we recruit and keep such principals in our \npublic schools or else the work we are doing so diligently, attempting \nto forge the kind of consensus we need to pass this education bill, \nwill not have the results it should have.\n  This bill holds a lot of promise. It puts the Federal Government \nsquarely on the side of accountability. It sets forth measurements that \nwe will use to make decisions about schools. Yet if we don't have our \nteachers and principals in place to do this work, then it is just going \nto be another piece of legislation. It won't have the effect that we \nall want it to have.\n  I hope we will agree to this amendment that it is aimed at helping us \naddress the Nation's principal shortage.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Does the Senator wish to go to a vote at this time?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I don't believe the amendment is pending just \nyet.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I call up amendment No. 517.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we just completed the acceptance of \napproximately 10 or 12 amendments. We had a series of amendments that \nwere accepted last evening, and we will have additional ones later in \nthe afternoon.\n  At the request of the leaders, we have put off the votes hopefully \nuntil 4:30 this afternoon where we will have several votes on matters \nwhich have been debated. It is not the way I would like to proceed nor, \nI am sure, the way my friend and colleague from New Hampshire would \nwish to proceed. However, there are other considerations.\n  We have been able to move a number of these. We have disposed of a \nnumber of amendments. We have had some amendments which have been \nwithdrawn, and we are going to talk to other colleagues. I have, \nthrough the staff, talked to each Member two or three times on their \namendments. We are under a lot of pressure to reach a time definite for \nfinal passage of this legislation. We have tried to respect the fact \nthat our colleagues have offered these amendments--they are important \nto them--and to accommodate their interests.\n  Quite frankly, we are reaching the point where I will join with \nthose--I know this has been the position of my friend from New \nHampshire--who believe that we ought to set a time definite and then go \ninto a vote-athon, if people want to vote in that way, every 2 minutes. \nThe Senate will have to work its will.\n  What is completely unacceptable is for Members, who have been on \nnotice prior to the time we went on the Memorial Day recess, to now, in \nthe midafternoon, believe they are not quite ready to deal with these. \nWe want to put everyone on notice that we are getting to the point \nwhere we are going to urge that we have a time definite for final \npassage. There will be objection. They will come to the Chamber and \nobject, and then they will go off. And when they are off, we will make \nthe motion again. So they are going to have to come. That is the way it \nused to be done.\n\n  We want to accommodate our colleagues, but we want to be clear that \nthis is serious business. If Members have amendments and they are \nserious about them, which I believe they are, they ought to be serious \nenough to come and offer and debate them. We are running into the \nsituation where too many of our colleagues have been unwilling to do \nso.\n  Everyone understands there are a lot of different activities going \non, particularly today. But there are always a lot of different \nactivities every single day.\n  This is about education. It is about our children. It is about their \nfuture.\n  Senator Reid will go back and call those who have the amendments. We \nshould not have to do it. We should be hearing from our colleagues \nabout the time. We will do the best we can to arrange it. But we are \ngetting into the position now, after this week, where we are going to \nmove towards reaching a time definite for final consideration. Then we \nwill have an opportunity to dispose of these amendments.\n  I would like to support a number of them. A number of them would be \nhelpful to the bill. But if we get into that kind of situation, it \ndoesn't serve the cause, the amendments, or those who are offering the \namendments well.\n  We will put in, starting tomorrow at least, the amendments that \nremain and the authors of those amendments and try, by publishing those \namendments, to indicate which ones are remaining so that the American \npeople know what the amendment is and who is offering it. Hopefully, we \nwill be able to move this process forward. We have every intention of \ndoing so.\n  It is a disservice to the children and to the parents in the country \nthat we don't meet our responsibilities in this very important \nlegislation.\n  I know my colleague, the Senator from Connecticut, will be here in a \nfew moments. The good Senator from Wisconsin has a matter of great \nimportance to bring to the Senate's attention.\n  I yield the floor at this time. Hopefully, we will have enough time \nto dispose of the Dodd amendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD.

The modification extends the time under which the \nprovisions of this amendment ask the States to provide an additional 2 \nyears for a waiver period.\n  I ask unanimous consent our colleague from Rhode Island, Senator \nReed, be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from Delaware, Senator Biden, for \njoining in this effort. I thank our colleague in the other body, a \nMember by the name of Chaka Fattah, of the city of Philadelphia, for \nbeing the source and inspiration of this amendment. He is behind this \namendment, and he has very eloquently made the case.\n  This amendment has value and importance. I begin my brief comments by \nthanking the distinguished member from the city of Philadelphia and the \nState of Pennsylvania for his contribution in what I think is a \nworthwhile idea.\n  I expect this to provoke debate and even significant opposition. It \nmay not pass, but at some point this issue must be addressed if we are \never going to effectively deal with some of the incredible inequities \nthat exist across this great land of ours in servicing the 50 million \nchildren who enter our public schools as elementary or secondary school \nstudents.\n  I thank Senator Biden, Senator Reed, and Congressman Chaka Fattah. \nThe amendment encourages States to ensure that all students receive a \ncomparable education as measured by class size, teacher quality, \ncurricula, technology, and school safety. I note, of course, that the \nPresiding Officer is a former Governor. He will add particular value to \nthis discussion and debate as someone who has had to grapple with these \nvery issues.\n  The amendment allows States 4 years to comply and allows for a waiver \nof up to 2 years for extraordinary circumstances, such as the \nprecipitous decline in State revenues or other circumstances that the \nSecretary of Education determines are exceptional that prevent a State \nfrom providing comparable education services to all students.\n  Equal opportunity, as we all know, is a very fundamental right in our \nsociety. It is why people from around the globe have dreamed of coming \nto this land, why thousands every day circle U.S. embassies all over \nthe world seeking visas to come to the United States, seeking permanent \nstatus as residents. For over 200 years, the notion of equal \nopportunity has been a hallmark of our society. We don't guarantee \nsuccess; we guarantee everyone an equal opportunity to achieving \nsuccess. This amendment goes to the very heart of that discussion and \nthat debate.\n\n  In 1965, we created the Elementary and Secondary Education Act--that \nwas more than 35 years ago--to make equal opportunity the centerpiece \nof our educational laws. It is making a difference. A 1999 study found \nstudents receiving title I funds increased their reading achievement in \n21 of 24 urban districts in America and increased their math \nachievement in 20 of 24 urban districts. I quickly add, while this is \nan improvement, it is not yet success. Clearly, we are heading in the \nright direction. Our common hope is that this bill, once adopted, adds \nto that success.\n  A study published earlier this year concluded:\n\n       Whenever an inner city or poor rural school is found to be \n     achieving outstanding results with its students by \n     implementing innovative strategies, those innovations are \n     almost invariably funded primarily by title I.\n\n  Title I is not making enough of a difference because we are still not \nproviding school districts with sufficient resources, in my mind and in \nthe mind of a majority of our colleagues, to close this achievement \ngap. During the debate, the Senate overwhelmingly adopted, by a vote of \n79-21, an amendment I offered, along with my colleague from Maine, \nSenator Collins, to establish the goal of fully funding title I within \nthe next 10 years. This education bill will require States to set a \ngoal of having children be proficient in reading and math in 10 years. \nThe least the Congress can do is to set a goal of providing school \ndistricts with the resources that will help children achieve those \ngoals. That is the reason behind the amendment adopted so \noverwhelmingly just a few weeks ago.\n  Title I means more teachers, more professional development, more \ncomputers, textbooks, more individualized instruction, more preschool \nand afterschool programs and other reforms that will be necessary, if, \nin fact, these students are going to continue to improve and achieve \nthe accountability standards.\n  As the vote on the Dodd-Collins amendment demonstrated, even a strong \nmajority of both parties support devoting more resources to education, \nparticularly to the neediest students in our country, so those \nresources can be included in a budget resolution which could be \nstripped out by those who seek to reduce the support for title I.\n  No one questions the need to hold schools accountable for student \nachievement. Accountability without resources is an empty shell. This \nis a problem with virtually every State in the Nation.\n  According to the Department of Education, when comparing all \ndistricts in this country, high-minority districts receive less than \nother districts on a combined cost and need-adjusted basis. This means \nhigh-minority districts which may often have greater concentrations of \nhigh-need students, have less buying power, thus fewer resources to \nmeet the needs of students in their schools.\n\n[[Page S5868]]\n\n  Since high-minority districts in most States are operating with less \ntotal revenue than low-minority districts, these districts have less \nrevenue to provide the educational programs and services their students \nneed to achieve the high standards and prepare to enter higher \neducation or the workforce.\n  In 42 of 49 States recently studied by the Education Trust, school \ndistricts with the greatest number of poor children had fewer resources \nper student than districts with fewer poor children. During the 1980s \nand 1990s, 43 States faced legal challenges to their school financing \nsystems, calling for equity of resources and services. Many State \ncourts held their systems violated State constitutions.\n  I do not intend to suggest by my remarks here for this amendment that \nStates should unnecessarily become the targets of some opposition. That \nis a difficult problem that States are facing. My State is a classic \nexample of one that has wrestled with this disparity of educational \nopportunity. These problems have deep roots, they go back a long way, \nand they affect States all across the country.\n  But we are going to say in this bill that in school districts, if \nthere are schools there that are not performing and there is a series \nof steps and criteria they must meet, then we the Federal Government \nare saying to those districts: You are going to have to shut them down.\n  We have also even suggested at the national level that we might get \nrid of the Department of Education.\n  We are saying to local communities, do the following things or you \npay a price. We even suggest at the national level, if we do not do \ncertain things, something else may happen here. The one political \nequation that is sort of left out of all of this is at the State level. \nThat is the one political entity that has an awful lot to do with \ndetermining what happens in terms of equality of opportunity within our \nrespective 50 States. That is what this amendment is designed to do.\n  It says in this bill: Communities, you have to do a better job. It \nsays the Federal Government has to do a better job.\n  What my amendment says is the third party to all this, the States, \nthey also have to do a better job in seeing to it that there is \nequality of opportunity.\n  Let me cite, if I can, the example of my home State, Connecticut. In \nthe 1980s, Connecticut, with an increasingly low-income, minority, and \nlimited-English population, has pursued a constant strategy to try to \nensure all its students are taught by high-quality teachers.\n  Just to put this in perspective, Connecticut is a relatively small \nState. It is about the size of Yellowstone National Park, if you want \nto use that as a comparative model. Yet within that same State, I have \nsome of the most affluent Americans in the country. In fact, my State \nis often identified as the most affluent State on a per capita basis. I \nwould quickly add that the city of Hartford, our capital, is the eighth \npoorest city, and Bridgeport and New Haven and Waterbury are not very \nfar behind. In the midst of this very small piece of territory, I have \ngreat affluence and I have significant poverty.\n  My State is willing to try to provide some sharing of resources, if \nyou will. As we know, in most of our States, education is funded \nprimarily by local property taxes. So a child growing up in one of my \nmore affluent communities--obviously there are more resources there to \nprovide the full educational opportunity. In my poorer communities, \nthat has not been the case. States wrestle with this. But I think it is \nnot too much for us at the Federal level, since we are demanding so \nmuch of school districts, to also ask this of our States. We know it is \nnot easy. We know it is going to be very hard for school districts to \nlive up to this and meet all the obligations we are going to be \ndemanding in this bill. But people like Chaka Fattah and Joe Biden and \nJack Reed of Rhode Island and myself believe it is also not too much to \nsay to our States: We want you to do a better job at this as well \nbecause so much of the resources and determination are going to come \nfrom States.\n\n  Remember, the Federal Government contributes about 6 cents out of \nevery educational dollar. Mr. President, 94 cents for the education of \nelementary and secondary school students comes from the States and \nlocalities, the bulk of it coming from localities in most \njurisdictions. So we are saying to our States, as we are saying to our \ncommunities, we want you to do a bit better.\n  Today I point out my State, Connecticut, regularly receives top \nrankings in assessments of reading, math, science, and writing. \nConnecticut has also increased its targeting of resources to low-income \nschool districts. The State provides 27 times more resources per \nstudent to the lowest income districts compared to the highest income \ndistricts.\n  Nevertheless, by and large we enter the 21st century with a 19th \ncentury system of providing resources for our educational system. In \nlarge part, we still do this, as I mentioned a moment ago, with local \nproperty taxes. That may have made sense in the 19th century, even in a \ngood part of the 20th century when children in Hartford competed with \nchildren in New Haven, or maybe with children in New York--occasionally \nsome child in Pennsylvania. That was true in the 19th century.\n  In the 20th century, of course, children growing up in my State or \nanyplace else across the country are not just competing with each other \nor neighboring States. They will be competing with children in Beijing, \nin Moscow, in Paris, in Sydney, Australia. It is a global economy and \nwe have to have an educational system in this country that prepares all \nchildren to compete effectively in that kind of marketplace.\n  It is no longer enough in the 21st century to say we are going to \nleave this up to whatever the resource allocation may be in some rural \ncounty in the West, or some urban district in the East or Far West. We \nat the Federal level, I think, have to do more if we are going to be \ndemanding greater accountability of students and school districts in \nrural and urban settings--then it should not be too much to ask it as \nwell of our States. It made less sense, of course, as the 20th century \nprogressed in this era of competition, but certainly it makes no sense \nas we enter the 21st century and children from Hartford, Chicago, and \nLos Angeles compete with children all over the globe.\n  The children today will be the first generation born, raised, and \neducated in truly a global economy. This amendment recognizes that by \nasking States, along with the Federal and local government, to share \nthe responsibility--share it, so ensuring children's access to quality \neducation is not dependent on how much money their parents make or \ntheir race or whether they live in a city or a suburb or rural area. \nUnfortunately, because of our current system, that is the case de \nfacto. That is the case. Children growing up just a few short miles \nfrom each other have entirely different educational opportunities based \non the total coincidence of their birth. In one locality that is poor, \nand one that is affluent, opportunity is not equal. It is not equal.\n  If we are going to truly talk about an Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act from a Federal perspective, a national perspective, then \nit seems to me we have to recognize that fact. There is not equal \nopportunity of education in America. So, if we do not begin to demand \nthat more steps are taken to achieve that equal opportunity of \neducation, then these resources, as we send them around the country \nwithout regard to what the States may be doing, ends up, I think, \nproducing little improvement in the results we have seen over the last \nfew years.\n\n  Schools with the highest concentrations of minority students have \nmore than twice as many inexperienced teachers as schools with the \nlowest concentration of minority students. Schools with high \nconcentrations of minority students are four times as likely as schools \nwith low concentrations of minority students to hire teachers not \nlicensed to teach in their main teaching field. Urban and rural \nschools, poor schools, are twice as likely to hire unlicensed teachers, \nor teachers who had only emergency or temporary licenses.\n  Of course, subject matter knowledge and experience make for better \nteachers and higher student achievement. We all know that. Yet \naccording to a recent report, there is pervasive, almost chilling \ndifference in the quality of teachers in schools serving poor,\n\n[[Page S5869]]\n\nurban, and rural students than those serving children in the more \naffluent communities in our country. Urban districts and poor rural \ndistricts suffer in the quality of curriculum. For example, they are \nsignificantly less likely than suburban districts to have gifted and \ntalented programs to provide challenges beyond the regular curriculum. \nAccording to the Department of Education, white students are \nsignificantly more likely than African-American students or Hispanic \nstudents to use a computer in a school.\n  According to Education Week, students in the highest poverty schools \nare barely half as likely to have Internet access in their classrooms \nas students in the lowest poverty schools. Internet access is also a \nproblem in rural areas, where it is expensive for companies to lay \ncables necessary for access. The director of technology for one rural \ndistrict said: Not only is there a digital divide, but we live in it in \nrural America.\n  These disparities affect not only these children's educational \nachievement but their ability to find a job in an increasingly \ntechnological workplace when they finish school. Not surprisingly, \nthese inequities also persist in the quality of school buildings that \nserve different children.\n  Schools with higher concentrations of minority students generally are \nin worse condition than those with lower concentrations of minority \nstudents.\n  Schools with more than 50 percent minority enrollment are twice as \nlikely as schools with 5 percent minorities to be in temporary \nbuildings or to be in inadequate condition.\n  Research has shown a direct relationship between the quality of the \nschool's facilities and student achievement. Again, this goes to the \naccident of a child's birthplace: Two children, usually in the same \nState, with very different opportunities for achievement.\n  What we are asking in this amendment is for school districts to do \nbetter. We are asking ourselves to do better. Is it really some \noutrageous leap for the Federal Government to be asking the States to \ndo better as well in seeing to it that there is a better allocation of \nresources to provide a greater equal opportunity for education?\n  We can't simply impose accountability, as I said earlier, on a system \nthat allows one school to have lower class sizes, better teachers, more \ntechnology, and better materials and another school that has none of \nthose things and expect that equal opportunity to exist.\n  President Bush and Secretary Paige have often said that every child \nhas the ability to learn. I could not agree more. Every child has the \nability to learn. Without question, the achievement gap is not the \nresult of our children's failings. It is not their fault, not as they \nstart out in school. It is not because poor kids or minority kids or \nurban kids or rural kids are any less smart or any less ambitious or \nany less determined to do well than their counterparts in more affluent \ndistricts.\n  No. It is largely because we have not supplied the same support to \nthese poor children, and urban and rural children, and minority \nchildren in school districts around this country. It is the result of \nour failure to spend more than one penny of every Federal dollar for K-\n12 education. One penny of every Federal dollar--less than that--goes \nfor the education of our children in this country. It is also the \nresult of an outdated system of allocating resources at the State and \nlocal level.\n  This bill is about responsibility. We have heard that word used often \nduring the debate on this legislation over the last number of weeks--\nabout everyone who is involved in our children's education taking \ngreater responsibility for their education. We are asking more from \nstudents, parents, teachers, schools, school districts, and the Federal \nGovernment. There is one word missing from that list. I have mentioned \neveryone responsible but one: States.\n  I know that my colleagues, from time to time, are reluctant to go \nback and talk about what Governors need to do. We are lectured all the \ntime by Governors about what we can do at the Federal level. We are not \nafraid of talking about local mayors or school superintendents or PTA \ngroups or school boards. Why should we be reluctant to talk to our \nGovernors? They are not shy about asking us to do a better job. Is it \ntoo much to ask them to do a better job?\n  If we are going to withhold funds, as this bill does, from local \nschool districts that do not perform better, is it too much to say to \nStates, ``If you do not perform better, then we are going to withhold \nadministrative costs''? We are not going to deny children title I \nfunds, but let the States pick up the tab on the administrative costs. \nThat is what this amendment says.\n\n  We give them about 6 years to achieve that. I am not pushing it. And \nthere are cases pending all across the country. I know States are \ntrying hard in many cases, but I also know school districts are trying \nhard. This is not about whether or not you are trying hard. We are \nsaying to people: Try harder, because our kids deserve better than they \nare getting today.\n  So as we lecture school superintendents and school boards and parents \nand kids--and everybody else--I do not think it is going too far to say \nto the States: We want you to do better. That is what this amendment \ndoes.\n  In the 1960s, Dr. Martin Luther King asked: How long will it take? \nHow long for an end to segregation? How long for an end to inequality \nunder the law?\n  I ask today: How long will it take for us to refuse to tolerate an \neducational system in which educational opportunity--which is the \nfoundation of all opportunity--is determined by a child's family \nincome, or race, or accident of birth in a piece of geography that does \nnot have the resources to support the tools a child needs to achieve \nhis or her maximum potential?\n  The States need to do a better job. This Federal Government--this \nbody--ought not to shy away from asking the States to meet that \nresponsibility, just as we have asked children. If we can ask an 8-\nyear-old child to do a better job, we can ask a Governor to do a better \njob as well. Those who are doing it need not fear this amendment. But \nthose States that are not doing anything about it need to know there is \na price they will pay if they neglect this issue.\n  I am not going to penalize a local mayor who is trying hard despite a \nGovernor in a State who refuses to bear their share of the burden.\n  That is what the amendment does. That is what Chaka Fattah has talked \nabout. That is what others have suggested over the years that we ought \nto say today. If we are going to be tough on kids, and tough on \nparents, and tough on school districts, and tough on mayors, and tough \non the Secretary of Education, then let's also be a little tough on our \nStates.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am a great admirer of the Senator from \nConnecticut. I enjoy working with him and always appreciate his \ncreativity.\n  Mr. REID. Could I ask the manager of the bill to withhold briefly?\n  Mr. GREGG. Surely.\n  Mr. REID. Just so everyone knows--I have spoken to the manager of the \nbill, and Senator Kennedy is aware of this--we are going to try to \nprepare a unanimous consent agreement immediately so we can have a vote \nat or about 4:30 on the Voinovich and Bingaman amendments.\n  Mr. GREGG. We might also vote on the Reed amendment at the same time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, there is no UC request pending, but I will \nask a question. I would like to speak to this amendment for about 8 to \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. We will make it 4:45.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Whatever.\n  Mr. DODD. Senator Corzine wants to be heard.\n  Mr. REID. We will make it 5 o'clock. We will try do all three \namendments.\n  Mr. DODD. Then you can do all three.\n  Mr. GREGG. All right. We are not doing this amendment; just the Reed \namendment and the Voinovich amendment and the Bingaman amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. We could do this one, too, and we would be done with it.\n  Mr. GREGG. I do not believe we can.\n  Mr. DODD. All right.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the Senator yielding.\n  Mr. GREGG. This amendment which is brought forward by the Senator \nfrom Connecticut, although benign in its phraseology, is pervasive in \nits effect. In fact, I am not sure there is another\n\n[[Page S5870]]\n\namendment that is pending before this bill--although the Senator from \nConnecticut has one which is pretty pervasive in its effect--but I am \nnot sure there is another one that would have a larger impact, a more \nsubstantive impact, a more dramatic impact on the educational system of \nour country than this amendment right here.\n  The unintended consequences of it are, I am sure, overwhelming. I am \nnot going to even try to anticipate them. I just read the amendment a \nlittle while ago, so I am not totally up to speed on the unintended \nconsequences. I can tell you what the obvious intended consequences are \nof what amounts to essentially a nationalization of the educational \nsystems of this country.\n  Education has always been a local and State responsibility. But when \nthe Federal Government takes the role of saying that the local and \nState governments shall have comparable educational systems, and will \nbecome the enforcer of those comparable educational systems across the \nNation, it is no longer the function of the local and State \ngovernments, it is the function of the Federal Government. The Federal \nGovernment has taken that power.\n  Comparability, as it is defined in this bill, would mean that every \ncommunity in every State in the country would have to comply equally \nand be the same as every other community on all sorts of issues. I \ncannot even anticipate all the issues--but all sorts of issues: The \nnumber of kids in the classroom would have to be exactly the same or \ncomparable, the number of teachers would have to be exactly the same or \ncomparable, the types of teachers would have to be exactly the same or \ncomparable, the computer equipment in the school would have to be \nexactly the same or comparable, the size of the classroom would have to \nbe exactly the same or comparable, the size of the library would have \nto be exactly the same or comparable, size of the parking lot, size of \nthe playing fields, schoolday, use of the schoolday, courses offered, \nwhether Latin is offered, whether English is offered in advanced cases, \nwhether advanced calculus is offered, whether Spanish is offered, \nwhether Japanese is offered, free time within the schoolday, whether \nstudents had clubs that were the same, whether all the schools had a \nclimbing club, whether all the schools had a social outreach club, \nwhether all the schools had an African-American society, whether all \nthe schools had a historical society.\n\n  Comparability under this language means that essentially the Federal \nGovernment would suddenly become the arbiter of how every school in \nthis country would operate in every piece of detail within that school \nsystem. This is the single most pervasive amendment I have ever seen at \nthe Federal level in the area of education.\n  Some might argue the President's suggestion that every student in \nAmerica should be tested is a pretty pervasive step. What the President \nsaid was that those tests would be decided at the local level. They \nwould be designed by the State. Each State could have its own testing \nsystem, its own regime, and set its own standards. That is still pretty \npervasive, I have to admit. But this goes a radical step beyond that. \nThis essentially says that the Secretary of Education shall be informed \nby the States that every school in every system in every part of that \nState has a comparable capability in every function.\n  The impact of this is just really quite staggering. I have to wonder, \nfor example, what it means to organized labor agreements. What happens \nif a labor union in one community in the State has negotiated for a \ndifferent workweek for its teachers than the labor union in another \npart of the State or for a different ratio for its teachers or for a \ndifferent certification of capability for its teachers. Are all those \nlabor agreements suddenly out the window? It appears that way. It \nappears that either they are out the window, or the Federal support \ncoming into the State is out the window because they aren't comparable \nand there is clearly not a comparable event there. It is pretty hard to \nmake them comparable unless you are going to supersede collective \nbargaining as a concept in our society.\n  It is one thing for us, with 6 percent of the Federal budget of \neducation at the local and State level, to expect them to deal \neffectively with low-income kids by requiring that those low-income \nkids not be left behind, which is what we have done in this bill as it \nis structured today, and to set up an output system where essentially \nwe say we are going to leave it to you, the local school systems, to \ndecide how you educate your children, but we are going to expect that \nlow-income kids especially achieve and that they achieve at a level \nthat is comparable with their peers and, if they happen to adopt the \nStraight A's Program under this, they actually achieve at a level that \nis better than their peers.\n  It is entirely something else for us to say because we are putting 6 \npercent of the funds in here, we are suddenly going to require that \nevery community in every State be comparable. And if they are not \ncomparable, they will not get the Federal support. That is a huge step \ntowards the nationalization of our educational system. It is pretty \nspecifically outlined in the amendment.\n  We need to read this because it is so overwhelming. Let's begin here:\n\n       In General.--A State that receives funds under this part \n     shall provide services in schools receiving funds under \n     this part that, taken as a whole, are at least comparable \n     to services in schools that are not receiving funds under \n     this part.\n       A State shall meet the requirements of subparagraph (A) on \n     a school-by-school basis.\n\n  That means every school, every school in the State must be the same \nas every other school in the State as defined by the schools that are \nnot title I schools.\n\n       A State shall be considered to have met the requirements of \n     paragraph (1) if such State has filed with the Secretary a \n     written assurance that the State has established and \n     implemented policies to ensure comparability among schools \n     in--\n       (i) class size and qualifications of teachers (by category \n     of assignment, such as regular education, special education, \n     and bilingual education) and professional staff, through \n     programs such as incentives for voluntary transfer and \n     recruitment;\n       (ii) curriculum, the range of courses offered. . .\n\n  How expansive is this? This is just the most incredibly expansive \nintrusion into the actual operation of the local school system that you \ncould possibly conceive of. We are demanding at the Federal level, \nbecause we decided to put 6 percent of the money into the local school \nsystem, that every local school shall have a comparable curriculum, a \ncomparable staffing structure, a comparable qualification structure for \nits teachers. There are a lot of schools in this country that don't \nneed comparable situations that deliver pretty good education and are \nnot the same as their neighbor. And, in fact, that is what choice is \nall about, public charter schools. You create a charter school because \nyou don't think that the school down the street, which is doing the \npublic school work--and they are both public schools, by the way; I am \nnot talking private schools here--but you create a public charter \nschool because you think the public school down the street is not doing \nsuch a good job.\n  Under this amendment, I honestly think we can't have a charter school \nprogram anymore. Charter schools is probably the most creative and \nimaginative activity that is occurring in the public school system \ntoday. Across this country, parents and teachers are getting together \nto start charter schools because they see them as an opportunity to \nbreak out from the straitjacket of specific requirements that they get \nfrom their State school districts as to how to run their schools and \ncreate schools that teach, which is the option and the obligation, of \ncourse, of the school systems, and to teach well.\n  Across this Nation, you can go to city after city, especially urban \nareas, where the charter school is the one that is delivering the \nquality education to kids who before were getting very little in the \nway of education. I honestly think under this amendment, charter \nschools would essentially be wiped out. Either that or everybody has to \nbe a charter school, but you can't have everybody being a charter \nschool because charter schools by definition are different. That is the \nwhole concept behind charter schools.\n  Then there is something called a magnet school. It was started in \nNorth Carolina. The magnet education school is in the area of math/\nscience. It was\n\n[[Page S5871]]\n\nsuch a huge success that a lot of States have used it.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield on this point for a little \ndiscussion?\n  Mr. GREGG. I will yield when I finish. I will be happy to discuss \nthis further.\n  Magnet schools is the concept where you take a school that is a high-\nquality school and you draw kids into it who have special interests--\nmath, science. Bedford-Stuyvestant in New York is a magnet school. \nThere is one in Virginia in Arlington called Thomas Jefferson. And \nthen, of course, there is the one in North Carolina that started the \nwhole system.\n  I am wondering if under this amendment you can have magnet schools \nanymore, especially a magnet school that was a low-income, funded \nschool because it would not be comparable. It would be too good. If you \nhad a magnet school like they have in Houston, where it is, I think, 85 \npercent low-income kids, but it is excelling at an extraordinary level, \nthat might not be able to function under this bill, or maybe it could, \nbut the State would not meet the comparability standards here.\n  Comparability may sound like a benign word, but its practical \nimplication is that we at the Federal level are demanding that we \ncontrol the manner in which States develop their school systems--in a \nvery precise way and in a way which creates a control system that is \nfrom the top down and that is focused on minutia, not on results.\n  The whole theme of the President's proposal, which was worked out and \nnegotiated and passed out of committee 22-0, was that we would give \nflexibility to local school districts, flexibility to States to design \nprograms that would address the needs of low-income kids specifically. \nAnd in exchange for that flexibility and the additional resources, we \nwould expect results.\n  This amendment goes in the exact opposite direction. This says that \nin exchange for a small amount of money, you, the States and local \nschool districts, are going to have to do everything the same, have \neverything be comparable. Comparability doesn't really have that much \nrelevance to quality, as we have seen over the years.\n  So I find this amendment to be probably one of the most intrusive \namendments I have seen come forward on this bill. If it passes, it \nwould have the practical effect, in my humble opinion, of fundamentally \ndamaging this bill and changing the entire course of its purpose. I am \nhappy to yield to the Senator from Connecticut for what I know will be \na thoughtful question.\n  Mr. DODD. I want to pick up on this radical idea of equal opportunity \nof education. I know this is terribly radical----\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I didn't yield for a statement. I yielded \nfor a question.\n  Mr. DODD. I want to get to the point of radicalness, which my friend \nraised as the hallmark behind this amendment. I address this to my \ncolleague.\n  Under existing Federal law, the question is, Do we not require State \nstandards for curricula that are the same for every child, and any \nchild who brings a weapon to school--by the way, you lose Federal funds \nif you don't--is automatically expelled by Federal law, or you lose \nfunds? In addition, an individual education plan is required for every \nchild with a disability, or you lose Federal funds. There must be \ncomparable educational services within the school districts, or you \nlose Federal funds. That has been on the books, by the way, since 1965. \nThe word ``comparable'' is not synonymous with identical. We are trying \nto do comparable opportunities or comparable curricula to achieve equal \nopportunity. We are not breaking new ground. My question is with this \nsince we do it already in five or six areas. We have identified one \nthat goes back at least 36 years.\n  Mr. GREGG. I respond by saying that you are breaking new ground. The \napplication of the word is the manner in which you break new ground. \n``Comparable'' applied in one manner means one thing, but applied to \nanother manner means something else. If you are applying ``comparable'' \nto a school system within a city, that is one thing. When you say \n``comparable'' within an entire State, it is entirely different. \nFurthermore, if you are, specifically within the terms of comparable, \ndefining what comparable means by saying class size, qualification of \nteachers, curriculum, range of courses offered, you are essentially \nsetting up the standards in a very top-down, directive manner of what \nis going to happen in the school systems across the State. You are \nsaying that they essentially all have to be the same.\n\n  Now, if we are talking about opportunity, what the underlying bill \ndoes is create opportunity. That is the whole concept of this bill. \nThis bill is dedicated to giving all the children in America--but \nespecially the low-income child--the opportunity to succeed. We have \nnow been through 25 or 35 years of an experiment in helping title I \nkids, and it has failed. One-hundred twenty-six billion dollars has \nbeen spent, and the average title I child is reading at two grade \nlevels behind his or her peers. We know it hasn't worked.\n  So the President has said let's try a different approach, an approach \nfocused on the child, giving that child an opportunity to learn.\n  That is exactly what this bill does. It says to the school systems: \nAll right, we are going to give you flexibility, but in exchange we are \ngoing to expect success and we expect academic success equal to or \nbetter than what a child who doesn't come from a low-income family \nobtains. If you don't obtain that success, then there are sanctions. \nAnd there are accountability standards that are very aggressive to \nassure that we do obtain that success.\n  This bill supplies opportunity. I think to imply that it does \nanything else is to mischaracterize the bill. What this proposal does \nis essentially nationalize the system. It essentially says, from here \non out, the Federal Government is going to be put in a position of \nsaying that if every school district in a State isn't doing everything \nin a comparable way--I won't use it exactly, and you are right; they \nare not the same words--with class size, qualification of teachers, \ncurriculum, range of courses offered, then we, the Federal Government, \nare going to stop sending you money and probably we have set up a \nlawsuit for you, the students, and the parents in those States.\n  You have to ask yourself, why is ``comparable'' better? What is \nbetter is to say we are going to give children a better chance to \nsucceed, and we are going to find out if they are succeeding \nacademically. That is what the bill does. Why is ``comparable'' better? \nIs it comparable to have the same number of Spanish teachers in Nashua, \nNH, and in Berlin, NH? Maybe Berlin doesn't need second language \nteachers and Nashua, NH, does. Is it better to have a comparable number \nof technical teachers in the area of some local industry, where the \nkids are being trained to be able to participate in one part of the \nState or another part of the State, when maybe their industries are not \nthe same?\n  Comparability doesn't lead to quality. What it leads to is \nmediocrity. So I just say to my colleague from Connecticut that I \nunderstand the desire to produce quality education. I think the way you \nget there is by focusing child by child, not by taking a broad brush \nand applying it to the entire universe of education and saying the \nFederal Government is going to tell you how to do it.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know there are a number of Senators we \nhave danced around today trying to figure out a time to vote. Prior to \nthis unanimous consent agreement, which will require beginning 5 \nminutes of discussion at 5:10, the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Biden, \nwishes to speak for about 15 minutes of the approximately 30 minutes \nthat we have on this Dodd amendment.\n  With that in mind, I ask unanimous consent that at 5:10 p.m. the \nSenate resume consideration of Bingaman amendment No. 791, that the \nBingaman amendment be modified to be a first-degree amendment, and that \nfollowing 5 minutes of closing debate, equally divided in the usual \nform, the Senate vote in relation to the Bingaman amendment at 5:15.\n  Further, following disposition of the Bingaman amendment, there be 4 \nminutes of debate divided in the usual form on the Voinovich amendment \nNo. 389, as modified, followed by a vote in relation to the Voinovich \namendment.\n  Further, that no second-degree amendments be in order to these\n\n[[Page S5872]]\n\namendments. I say to everybody within the sound of my voice that we \nwill have two votes, first at 5:15, and the other following that.\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object, did the Democratic \nassistant leader decide he didn't want to do the Reed amendment?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. We are going to try in the morning to dispose of the \nDodd and Reed amendments.\n  We are unable to do that because of the lateness of the hour.\n  Mr. GREGG. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I believe I reserved the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I understand the Senator from Delaware wishes to speak. I \nwill not go much further, but only to say, for what it is worth, \nrelative to this education bill, it appears to me we have wandered into \nan extremely difficult situation. This amendment is, in my humble \nopinion, a significant blow to the underlying purposes of the bill \nwhich have been worked through involving a lot of compromise and a lot \nof effort. Obviously, we are not going to vote on it tonight. I am \nhopeful it will be reconsidered before any time we even consider voting \non it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for \nallowing me the opportunity to speak to this amendment.\n  With all due respect, I think the arguments of the Senator from New \nHampshire would be better reserved for the New Hampshire Supreme Court \nthan for the U.S. Senate. We are not nationalizing anything. There is \nnothing in the Dodd-Biden amendment that requires a national standard. \nWe do require a State standard.\n  My friend says this bill is all about flexibility. It reminds me of a \ntrack meet. The rich kids can have brandnew track shoes and starting \nblocks for running the 100-meter race, and the poor kids can have \nflexibility. They can decide to run in long pants or short pants. They \ncan decide whether or not they want to wear a sweat shirt or T-shirt. \nThey can decide whether they want to run frontwards or backwards. They \ndo not get track shoes and starting blocks, but they have flexibility. \nYou can wear whatever color you want. You can wear long pants or short \npants. You can run backwards or forwards. You can do cartwheels on the \nway down the track. But you do not get those spikes. You do not get \nthose starting blocks. Guess what. You get judged. You get judged where \nyou finish, and if you do not finish 1, 2, or 3, you are out.\n  That is the track standard set. The NCAA of track says: Hey, here's \nthe deal. If you don't finish 1, 2, or 3, go home. You don't get to run \nanymore. You don't get to go on to the next step. But we gave you \nflexibility, all the flexibility you want, man. You could have done \nthis with a dashiki on or you could have done this with a T-shirt on. \nYou could have done this in a suit, or you could have done this in \nshort pants. You have flexibility.\n\n  Not only flexibility matters. Maybe I have been doing this criminal \njustice stuff too long. I realize I do not know as much as my friend \nfrom Connecticut does about education, nor my friend from New \nHampshire, whom I do not know as well, but I know my friend from \nConnecticut knows so much more. He has made a career of knowing this. I \nhave made a career of understanding the criminal justice system--how \nyou deal with crime, stop crime, affect it, and so on.\n  After all the years I have done it, it comes down to a few basic \nfacts. If there are four corners, three cops on one corner, no cop on \nanother, and there is going to be a crime at the intersection, it will \nbe committed where the cop is not.\n  We also know when you are engaged in armed robberies or engaged in \npurse snatching, you tend not to do that when you get to be 40 years \nold because it is hard as heck to jump over that chain link fence with \nthe cops chasing you. As you get older, you slow down and tend to get \nless violent. We know that. What we ate for breakfast, where we were \nraised, how we related to our mothers, what our education was--we have \na lot of theories about how that impacts on crime, but we do not know.\n  What we do know about education is basic. We know if you get two kids \nof comparable talent or lacking in talent and you put them in a \nclassroom with 70 kids and 1 teacher, they are not going to do as well \nas if you put them in a classroom with 3 kids and 1 teacher. We know \nthe more focused the attention, the closer to one on one you can get, \nthe product being the same, the better chance you have of succeeding.\n  We also know if you have books that are legible and available and \nevery student has one--same students, same IQ, same background, same \neverything--the kids with the good books are going to do better than \nthe kids with the bad books.\n  My Walter Mitty dream was to be a professional athlete. A phrase my \ncoach used was: A good big man can always beat a good small man. A \nphrase in athletics is: A good fast woman can always beat a good slow \nwoman. There are certain truisms.\n  Two kids with the same talent, whether they have a 90 IQ or 190 IQ, \nwhether they are creative, not creative, put them in a large class with \na comparable group of people, and they are not going to do as well as \nwhen you put them in a small class of a comparable group of people. If \nyou put them in the same classroom with a good teacher versus a bad \nteacher, they are going to do better with a good teacher. There are \nbasics.\n  What do we know about how education works? My friend says we are \ngoing to nationalize. What we are trying to do is what States are \ntrying to do right now and what my State has already done. We are \ntrying to do what title I now requires.\n  I am going to use the word ``comparable'' comparably. Right now, \n``comparable'' is used in the statute that exists to say that if you \nget title I money, every school in that school district has to have a \ncomparable educational system. That is all the Senator from Connecticut \ndid.\n  Why did he do it? Why did I join him? Why did I ask him to do it? I \nwas going to offer this amendment because my friend, Chaka Fattah, with \nwhom I worked for a long time in the House of Representatives--I am not \non the committee, so I went to my friend from Connecticut and said: I \nwant to do this.\n  He said: I am already going to do it.\n  Why did he decide to use that word ``comparable''?\n  Guess what. My friend from the State of New Hampshire says he wants a \nnational standard. We did not say we want a national standard. The \nPresident said he wanted a national standard. My friend from New \nHampshire wants a national standard. They want to judge how fast every \nkid can run. They want to judge how fast every kid can read. They want \nto judge how well every kid can write.\n  OK, fine, but do not do to those kids the same thing as my fictitious \nexample on the track. Do not judge the kid who comes from a school \ndistrict where they spend $5,000 per pupil, with teachers who have \ntheir teaching certificate in the area in which they teach--do not \njudge them by the same standard that you are going to judge kids who \nhave $1,500 spent on them per pupil, who have a majority of teachers \nwho are not certified in the area they teach, who teach in classrooms \nthat are leaky, some of them unsafe, and without an adequate number of \ntextbooks.\n  As my dad would say: Give me a break. I do not think the Federal \nGovernment can or should, or any government should, decide to equalize \neverything. As one former President said, life is unfair. Certain \nthings Government cannot do.\n  The Government cannot dictate you to be 6 foot 2, if that is what you \nwant, or 5 foot 9. The Government cannot dictate that everybody will \nhave the voice of Barbra Streisand or some famous male singer--whoever \nthe heck you like. Life is unfair.\n  I was born with no talent musically and maybe with nothing else. The \nFederal Government cannot say: You know what: Guaranteed, Joe Biden \ncannot do what he wants to do, be a flanker for the New York Giants. \nThat is truly what I wanted to be. Life was unfair. At 6 foot 1, 155 \npounds, I did not have the talent of Tommy McDonald who was that small \nand played for the Philadelphia Eagles in the sixties. They cannot fix \nthat.\n\n[[Page S5873]]\n\n  Let me tell you what we can fix. We have an obligation to fix the \nthings we can fix. If you are going to hold a kid to a standard, darn \nit, give him an equal opportunity, at least in his own State. Give him \na shot.\n  Do my colleagues know what this reminds me of? The first African \nAmerican ever admitted to the bar in the State of Delaware was Louis L. \nRedding. He took the bar in 1928. There were 13 or 14 people who took \nthe bar that year. Twelve took it in one room with one test, and Louis \nL. Redding took it in another. They gave him a completely different \ntest. No one on this floor today would say that is fair. I don't think \nanybody would say that is fair.\n\n  In a public system with one school district, and I don't care whether \nthe kid is black or white, whether the child is Hispanic or Asian, if \nthe child is slow or smart, it is unfair to take a very bright white \nkid in a school district where they spend $1,000 or $2,000 less per \npupil than the other school where the bright white kid gets $2,000 more \nspent on him--that may be the difference between going to my State \nuniversity and Harvard University--it is clearly not fair for the kid \nborn into the district that has no tax base, where the businesses have \nmoved out, where the average home is one-fourth the value of the \nneighboring school district, and say: judge them by the same standard.\n  There is enough inequity built into life. I will never forget when I \nwas a widowed father; it was the first time it came to me: why it is so \nincredibly important there is diversity on the floor, including women, \nwith a woman's perspective. I found women to be no slower, no brighter, \nno less venal, no more generous, no less generous, than men. I know I \nwill get in trouble for saying that, but it is true.\n  I used to not understand why we didn't hold the kid who came out of \nthe ghetto accountable, the mother with two kids making, by today's \nstandard, $16,000 or $18,000 a year. We hold her kids to the same \nstandard that we hold a kid who comes from a family with a combined \nincome of a couple hundred thousand bucks, living in a great area, and \nattending great schools. The government can't do anything about that. I \nwish life were fair.\n  I remember as a single father raising two kids. I was a Senator. My \nsisters helped me raise my kids; my mother was available; my brother \nmoved in to live with me. I had great help, and I had trouble. It is \nthe first time I thought about my secretary raising kids by herself. I \nthought, my Lord, what an inequity.\n  We are not asking the government to fix that. We are asking the \ngovernment along the way to make it equal and give leave for when your \nchild is sick and things such as that. But here government is \nmandating. Depending on where one stands is how one views things. My \nfriend views this piece of legislation as intrusive, nationalization of \nthe school system. I view this legislation as an unfunded mandate. We \nare mandating that every school in America meet a standard, every \nschool in the State meet a minimum standard. We are mandating that. We \nare telling them if they don't, they don't get Federal money. I am \noversimplifying in the interest of time.\n  If I said to my friend from New Hampshire, you have to mandate that \nevery drinking water system in the State of New Hampshire meet a \ncertain standard, he would be the first one, with his colleagues on the \nfloor, screaming about unfunded mandates, unfunded mandates, setting \nhealth standards, setting environmental standards, and not giving us \nany money.\n  This is not an unfunded mandate? I don't get this. How is this not an \nunfunded mandate?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. First, I thank both of my colleagues, Senators Dodd and \nBiden.\n  I will clarify a few of the key points. The Senator from New \nHampshire, Mr. Gregg, said Senator Dodd and Senator Biden were \nintroducing an entirely new concept and throwing this bill away from \nthe direction it was heading. Then the Senator from Delaware showed \nthat the word ``comparable,'' which Senator Gregg said was a new word \nin this debate, is already in the law, and we expect comparability \nwithin school districts or the States lose some of their Federal \nfunding. Am I not correct on that point?\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is exactly correct. Reading from the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, the Committee on Education in the Workforce, \nU.S. House of Representatives, page 54, under section 1120(c):\n\n       (c) Comparability of Services.--\n       (1) In general.--(A) Except as provided in paragraphs (4) \n     and (5), a local educational agency may receive funds under \n     this part only if State and local funds will be used in \n     schools served under this part to provide services that, \n     taken as a whole, are at least comparable to services in \n     schools that are not receiving funds under this part.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield, since the Senator used my name?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have another question.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will yield after the Senator asks her next question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. What the Senator has established is that Senator Gregg's \ncritique that the word ``comparability'' is, in fact, a new word and \nnew concept, is not true? It is blatantly false?\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. If I can follow up to finish, and taking it another step, \nit seems to me the current law is pretty darned tough, saying the \ndistricts lose all title I funding if we don't have this comparability \nwithin a school district.\n  I say to my two friends who have offered----\n  Mr. GREGG. I take it the Senator is not yielding?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will be happy when she finishes the question to yield to \nyou.\n  Mr. GREGG. Since my name has been addressed two times, inaccurately, \nI think it would be appropriate to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If I could ask just this question, is it not a fact in \nyour amendment what you are merely saying--frankly, I think it is a \npretty weak excuse for being critical; it is a pretty modest \namendment--the Senator is saying that the government has to send a \nletter indicating, in fact, that the kids are being treated pretty \ncomparably, whether they are born in an urban area, rural area, or \nsuburban area. Whatever area they are in, whatever they look like is \nimmaterial, just that they are getting a comparable education. If the \nGovernment doesn't send such a letter, as I read this legislation, only \n1 percent or so of administrative funds will be withheld because we \nwant to hold the States accountable to each child. Am I correct in that \nsynopsis?\n  Mr. BIDEN. The answer to the question is yes.\n  I am happy to yield to the Senator for a question without losing my \nright to the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask the Chair the situation relative to the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At 10 minutes after 5 o'clock, 5 minutes will \nbe equally divided, and that precedes a vote on the Bingaman amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thought the Senator from Delaware had 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That was not part of the formal agreement.\n  Mr. GREGG. I simply note that I believe it is the proper decorum of \nthe Senate when a Senator's name is used, and especially when a \nSenator's position is misrepresented, for a Senator to yield.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I did yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate that. Unfortunately, the Senator from \nCalifornia did not appear to be inclined to participate in that \nyielding.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I was asking a question. I said I would be \nhappy to stop when I finished asking the second question. I didn't even \nhave the floor. Senator Biden had the floor and was graciousness enough \nto yield to me to clarify some of the comments made against his \namendment by the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I will simply ask the Senator from Delaware a question. Is \nit not appropriate when a Senator uses a Senator's name and \ninaccurately characterizes a Senator's position, that Senator have an \nopportunity to respond?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, this is getting kind of silly. If the \nSenator wants to respond, respond. I am delighted to yield to him to \nrespond. There was no intention to in any way affront the Senator.\n  The Senator from California asked me a question. She did not have the \nfloor; I had the floor; and I yielded to her for a question. You walked \non the\n\n[[Page S5874]]\n\nfloor. As soon as she finished, I yielded to you because your name was \nmentioned.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am delighted that the Senator is yielding, but in \naccordance with the rules, I believe I must formulate my response in \nthe form of a question.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I do not want to lose my right to the floor for the next \n10 minutes. The Senator spoke for the last 25 minutes. I want to speak. \nGive me an idea. I will be happy to give you the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will remind the Senators they should \naddress one another in the third person or through the Chair.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Delaware to yield 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am delighted to do so, reserving my right to the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to the floor afterward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from California on two different occasions \nmisrepresented my position on this floor. My position is that the term \n``comparable'' exists in the law. In fact, I referred to that when I \nspoke with the Senator, when we exchanged discussion with the Senator \nfrom Connecticut.\n  I pointed out, however, in the terms it is used in the law as it \npresently exists, it is a much more confined word than the manner in \nwhich it is being applied in the amendment of the Senator from \nConnecticut. Under the proposal of the Senator from Connecticut, he has \ntaken the term ``comparable'' and expanded it in a manner which \nessentially amounts to the Federal Government taking over the ability \nof school systems across this country to be independent, to act in an \nindependent way and to create a curriculum, class size ratio, and the \noperation of the regular day for the student in a manner that is \nindependent and maintains local control.\n  That is the issue here, whether or not we are controlling from the \ntop or whether we are controlling at the end. What the President has \nproposed is to bring all American students who are under title I up to \na level of proficiency that is equal to or better than that of their \npeers, and to assure the accomplishment of that, to allow the local \nschool districts the flexibility to accomplish that. But in the end, to \nexpect that to be obtained by having the local student subject to a \ntesting regime which shows the student has accomplished those goals. \nThat is the purpose of the President's proposal.\n  The opposite is being accomplished, if this amendment is agreed to, \nwhich is basically to have the Federal Government come in and control \nthe input of the school day, school curriculum and the classes.\n  I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from Delaware for allowing \nme to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has the floor.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am sorry the Senator from New Hampshire \nwas not here when I was speaking. If you give me just a second, in case \nhis name comes up again so he understands the context in which I used \nhis name, the Senator says--which is, on its face, a sound argument--\nthat ``comparable'' may not in fact be comparable. We are using the \nlanguage, in our amendment, ``comparable,'' which is on line 5 of page \n1 of the amendment, in ``comparability of services.'' We are using the \nwords ``comparability of services'' in a comparable comparison. That \nis, it is the exact language used in the existing law relating to title \nI, which says ``comparability of services'' in Section 1120A subsection \nc.\n  The second point I would like to make to my friend is that we are not \nnationalizing anything. Let's understand what this does. Right now, if \nHouston or North Carolina has a charter school, that charter school has \nto have comparable services that exist within that school district, or \nthey could not have the school. It could not be a public school. So all \nwe are saying is you should do--and I apologize for saying this--what \nwe do in Delaware.\n  In Delaware, the State funds 70 percent of the funding of every \nschool district, every school in the State. Not just the district, \nevery school in the State. We have comparable funding, comparable \neducation, required by our law. It is not unlike what the Supreme Court \nin the State of New Hampshire said, in the decision I have in my hand, \nif I am reading it correctly, saying that your Supreme Court dictated--\nthey didn't use the word ``comparable,'' but dictated that there be \n``essentially equal services.''\n  So there is nothing new about this. I view this as an unfunded \nmandate. You view it as national intrusion. If you are going to insist \non a testing regime which I think does not make a lot of sense, and \nforce my State to have to comply in order to get any Federal funds, \nthen it seems to me I have a right to say you are dictating an unfunded \nmandate because you are requiring some of the kids in the States in \nthis country, where 20, 30, 40, 50 percent less is spent and where 70 \npercent of their teachers are not certified in the area for which they \nteach, in classrooms which leak, in buildings which are in some cases a \ntrap, and say to them we are going to hold you to the same standard or \nyour State is not going to get money. That is an unfunded mandate to \nme. To me, that is an unfunded mandate.\n  All we are saying is, as we did when we talked about title I, you are \nmandating to a State what they have to do. I am saying: OK, mandate to \nthe State but fund it. Fund it. Make it fair.\n  Again, I realize time is getting close here for our vote. I am going \nto have to yield the floor, not my right to the floor but yield for the \nvote. It seems to me, if you take a look at the facts, what we are \ntalking about here is just simple, basic fairness. If you take two \nchildren from the same background, same intellectual capability, same \namount of gray matter, same everything, and you give one kid less \nattention, you give one kid books that are not as good, you have one \nkid taught by an inferior teacher and one by a good teacher, those two \ncomparable kids will end up scoring differently. They will score \ndifferently on the test.\n  They may both pass it. They may both do extremely well. But the one \nwith the better teacher, the one who had more attention lavished on \nhim, the one with the better materials, the one in the safer \nenvironment, is almost surely going to score better.\n\n  So it seems to me all we are talking about is simple fairness. I view \nthis as a value issue. The Senator from New Hampshire and I have a \ndifferent value system on this issue. I respect his. He is not wrong. \nHe just has a different value system than I do. I value the notion that \nall children, if they are held to the same standard, should have the \nsame opportunity. If the Government is going to impose a standard, then \nthe Government should see that they have the same opportunity. That is \na basic value I have.\n  He thinks the value of the State schools being able to have one group \nof kids in one school where they have lousy teachers, where they have \nlousy buildings, where they have little money spent on them compared to \nanother, that what he values most is the right of the State to do that. \nI respect that. I respect that. I disagree with it. We have a different \nvalue system. This is the debate about values.\n  Parliamentary inquiry. When is the Senator from Delaware to cease so \nwe can begin the next vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has 35 seconds.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Parliamentary inquiry. After the two votes, does the \nSenator from Delaware retain the floor on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Not automatically.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will not ask unanimous consent to do that, but I will be \naround to continue this debate. I thank my friend from New Hampshire \nfor whom I have great respect. We just have a different value system \nabout education.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 791, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). There are now 5 minutes evenly \ndivided before the vote with respect to the Bingaman amendment.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. As I understand \nit, following the vote on the Bingaman amendment, the next item of \nbusiness is the vote on the Voinovich amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me describe to the other Senators \nwhat\n\n[[Page S5875]]\n\nthe choice is on these two amendments. I have offered the amendment on \nbehalf of myself, Senator Hatch, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Domenici. \nI ask unanimous consent that all of those Senators be added as \ncosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The amendment I am offering makes it clear that \nGovernors should be consulted with regard to the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act plans which are involved in this legislation \nbut that the Congress is not going to override the provisions States \nhave adopted in their constitutions and in their statutes for \norganizing and administering their educational programs.\n  The Voinovich amendment--which is the second vote--in my view, is \nobjectionable because it will give a veto to the Governor over any \nState plan for the expenditure of the Federal funds in that State. My \nState does not allow the Governor a veto. It has a provision for the \nGovernor to appoint five members of our State school board--to be \ninvolved in that way. But the State school board has the responsibility \nunder our constitution.\n  I want to see to it that Congress does not try to override my State's \nconstitution and the constitutions and statutes of quite a few States \nwhich have their own ways of administering their educational programs.\n  For that reason, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment that, \nagain, I am offering on behalf of myself, Senator Hatch, Senator \nKennedy, and Senator Domenici. I believe this will preserve the \nexisting arrangement we have between the Federal Government and the \nStates. It will allow the States to exercise their sovereign right to \ndetermine how they will administer their educational programs.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. And when the time \ncomes, I or Senator Kennedy or somebody will urge that the Voinovich \namendment not be adopted, which is the vote following this vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Ohio, Mr. Voinovich, is recognized for 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, the Senate has before it two approaches \nto giving the Governors of our respective States an opportunity to \nparticipate in having some input in the plan that a State submits to \nthe Secretary of Education as to what will be done with the Federal \nmoney under ESEA.\n  When I originally offered my amendment, there was some concern on the \npart of my colleagues that this amendment might violate State law or \nthe constitutions of the States. Earlier today I modified our amendment \nto provide that the signature of the Governor would not be required on \nthe application to the Department of Education in the event there was a \nState constitution or State law that prevented it.\n  It has been argued by the Senator from New Mexico, and the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, that this legislation would be a veto on the part \nof the Governors of the States over the wishes of the State \nsuperintendents of education. I think that by requiring the signature \nof the Governor, as contrasted to consultation, you are going to have a \nsituation where you enhance the application because it will force the \nGovernor and the chief State superintendent to work together in \npromoting the plan for the spending of that money. In too many States, \nthe Governors and the State superintendents of education do not speak \nto each other on such matters.\n  When we came up with ESEA in 1965, the Governors were not as involved \nas they are today. But, I say to my colleagues, if you go to your State \nand ask your citizens, do you believe that the Governor of your State \nsigns the application to the Secretary of Education for Federal money? \nthe answer 95 percent of the time will probably be yes and they would \nbe wrong, even though the Governors are being held responsible for \neducation.\n  All we are saying is, rather than taking the approach as suggested by \nSenator Bingaman and Senator Kennedy, rather than consulting, we \nrequire that the Governor's signature be on that application. Most of \nus know that if we have to consult with somebody, and they know our \nsignature isn't necessary, there ``ain't'' much consultation that takes \nplace.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Ohio has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 791, as modified, \noffered by the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo) and \nthe Senator from Utah (Mr. Hatch) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting, the Senator from Utah \n(Mr. Hatch) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 59, nays 39, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 172 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--59\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith (OR)\n     Stabenow\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--39\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bayh\n     Campbell\n     Carper\n     Cleland\n     Craig\n     DeWine\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Crapo\n     Hatch\n       \n  The amendment (No. 791), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 389, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are 4 minutes \nevenly divided under the Voinovich amendment No. 389, as modified. The \nSenator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, the Voinovich-Bayh amendment \nfundamentally requires the Governors of the 50 States to sign the \napplication that is submitted to the Secretary of Education for the \nexpenditure of funds under the ESEA. It is in contrast with the \nBingaman amendment that was just adopted which says consultation should \ntake place with the Governor rather than having the Governor's \nsignature.\n  I argue there is not much consultation that will take place unless a \nGovernor's signature is also required on that application.\n  Most Senators know that the Governors of the 50 States are the ones \nwho are held responsible for the education programs in their States. \nOur amendment recognizes some State constitutions and laws preclude \nparticipation by the Governor, and we exempt any State with a \nconstitution or law which does not allow the Governor to participate.\n  This amendment is supported by the bipartisan National Governors' \nAssociation unanimously. They have asked for it because they believe \nconsensus on education in the States is needed. It will make it easier \nto leverage State resources, and it also will provide more \naccountability.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Bayh.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized for 25 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BAYH. Twenty-five seconds, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n[[Page S5876]]\n\n  Mr. BAYH. I need to be briefer than normal.\n  I support this amendment for the practical reason that States will \ncontinue to pay for 94 percent of State and local education \nexpenditures. If we are going to make the progress we need to make for \nAmerica's schoolchildren, we need States leading the way along with the \nFederal Government. That means Governors cooperating and leading the \nway. I have never seen a major State education reform effort enacted \nwithout the aid and assistance of the Governor.\n  This amendment will require the Governor and chief State school \nofficer to work together. We need that to make this reform work.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I must oppose the amendment to S. 1, the \nBEST Act, offered by the Senator from Ohio, Mr. Voinovich.\n  This amendment would require the State educational agencies, SEAs, to \n``jointly prepare a plan to carry out the responsibilities of the State \n. . . including carrying out the State educational agency's statewide \nsystem of technical assistance and support for local educational \nagencies.'' This would clearly supercede the Wisconsin State \nConstitution.\n  Article X, Section 1 of the Wisconsin Constitution states: ``The \nsupervision of public instruction shall be vested in a state \nsuperintendent and other officers as the legislature shall direct; and \ntheir qualifications, powers, duties and compensation shall be \nprescribed in law. The state superintendent shall be chosen by the \nqualified electors of the state at the same time and in the same manner \nas member of the supreme court, and shall hold office for 4 years. . . \n.''\n  The Federal Government should not supersede the Wisconsin \nConstitution by requiring the duly elected Superintendent of Public \nInstruction to have the Governor sign off on proposals submitted to the \nfederal Department of Education.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. I supported the \namendment offered by the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, which \nwould provide for coordination between the SEA and the Governor without \ninfringing on the independence of the SEA.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, those who voted for the last amendment \nwhich I offered on behalf of myself, Senator Hatch, Senator Kennedy, \nand Senator Domenici, voted to allow States to continue to make the \ndecision as to how they administer their education programs and their \neducation funds. In my view, that is the appropriate position for us to \ntake in the Senate.\n  The amendment the Senator from Ohio is now offering would, in fact, \ngive the Governors a veto over any State plan, regardless of whether \nthat is the way a State has decided to administer their State \neducational funds. It would totally override the State constitution in \nmy State. It would override the State constitution in many States. I \nurge my colleagues to oppose it.\n  I yield the rest of my time to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senator from Ohio said the Governors \nsupport his amendment. All the State, local, and county officials \nsupport the Bingaman provisions. We are saying if the State has made \nthe decision to let the Governor run education, then they ought to be \nthe ones to make that decision. If the State makes the decision to let \nthe State educational agency make that decision, the Bingaman amendment \nalso makes that decision but permits the Governor to be consulted.\n  Talk about States rights. We are letting the States make the decision \nwho is going to make the judgment. The Voinovich amendment overrides \nany State decision that says they are going to let the State agency do \nit and insists the Governor do it. We have not had a hearing on it. \nNaturally, the Governors are for it, but the State and local educators \nare strongly opposed to it.\n  The Bingaman amendment permits consultations. That is the way we \nought to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 389, as modified. The yeas and nays have been \nordered.

Mr. President, I have conferred with the manager of the \nbill, Senator Gregg. I ask unanimous consent when the Senate resumes \nconsideration of S.1, the ESEA bill, on Thursday, June 7, that there be \nan hour for debate with respect to the Dodd amendment No. 459, \ncontrolled between Senators Dodd and Gregg; that upon the use or \nyielding back of that time the amendment be set aside and the Nelson-\nCarnahan amendment No. 385 become the pending business, with 45 minutes \nof debate equally divided and controlled in the usual form with no \nsecond-degree amendments in order thereto, with a vote occurring upon \nthe use or yielding back of time.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that upon disposition of the Nelson-\nCarnahan amendment No. 385, Senator Smith of New Hampshire be \nrecognized to call up amendment No. 487; that there be 40 minutes for \ndebate with the time equally divided and controlled in the usual form, \nand that no second-degree amendments be in order, with a vote occurring \nupon the use or yielding back of the time.\n  Finally, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that upon \ndisposition of the Smith amendment, Senator Wellstone be recognized to \ncall up amendment No. 466, with 4 hours for debate equally divided and \ncontrolled in the usual form, with no second-degree amendments in order \nthereto, and that upon the use or yielding back of time the Senate \nproceed to vote on that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Order Of Procedure\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nstatement of the Senator from Connecticut in relation to this bill, the \nSenate proceed to a period of morning business, with Senators allowed \nto speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 459\n\n  Mr. DODD. Just to inform my colleagues, and the managers of the bill, \nmy intention is to take about 6 or 7 minutes to discuss the Dodd \namendment, and then there will be time tomorrow, obviously, to go into \nthis a bit further.\n\n[[Page S5877]]\n\n  I do not know if any agreement has been reached on when we can vote \non this amendment. I have no intention of delaying action on this \nlegislation. I do not know if my colleague from Massachusetts or my \ncolleague from New Hampshire would like to agree on a time, but we can \nvote on the Dodd amendment at a time that is convenient for the \nmanagers of this bill.\n  I know there are other amendments that need to be considered. My \ndesire is to get to a vote and not to delay consideration of the bill.\n  But let me go back a bit, if I may, and try to make clear that my \ngood friend--he is a wonderful friend, and there are very few Members \non either side of the aisle whose intelligence I respect more than the \nSenator from New Hampshire, Mr. Judd Gregg. He is extremely bright, \nknowledgeable, and cares a lot about these issues.\n  He suggested that my amendment is one of the most intrusive \nsuggestions by the Federal Government in the area of elementary and \nsecondary education in maybe the history of mankind, I guess. He is \nnodding in the affirmative, so I guess he probably agrees with that \nstatement of mine.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is close.\n  Mr. DODD. This is anything but that. If you had to apply one word to \nthe underlying proposal, if you had to pick out one word in the English \nlanguage that is supposed to be the hallmark of this Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, I would suggest the word would be \n``accountability.'' That is the one word we have heard repeated over \nand over and over again.\n  This bill, if adopted, will require accountability of students \nbecause we will mandate a Federal test at the local level. It is Uncle \nSam, the Federal Government, mandating a Federal test, a Federal \nstandard. So accountability can be achieved at the student level.\n  We demand accountability of the local school districts. And if those \ndistricts do not achieve a level of achievement or performance, then \nthere is the danger of losing Federal dollars.\n  We demand accountability of teachers in this bill. We are insisting \nupon certain standards of performance, Uncle Sam saying that teachers \nat the local level must perform at a certain level.\n  In a sense, we are demanding accountability of parents by insisting \nthat their children do better and that parents be involved.\n  My point simply is this: We are demanding accountability of children, \nof parents, of teachers, of local school boards, of mayors, of schools \nthemselves, and ourselves in a sense, but the one entity that escapes \nany accountability at all is States.\n  I know States are wrestling with this issue. But requiring comparable \nefforts to achieve equal opportunity of education is not a radical \nidea. If we are demanding that an eighth grade or third grade student \npass a test, should a Governor of a State or a school board or some \nentity at the State level escape any less accountability of whether or \nnot our States are doing what is necessary for our schools and our \nschoolchildren to do better?\n  So that is what this amendment does. It says, look, after 4 or 5 \nyears, we want to know that States are insisting upon a comparable--not \nidentical--comparable educational opportunity in schools. The word \n``comparable'' is carefully selected. The word is 36 years old in the \ncontext of education. In 1965, we said there must be comparable \neducational opportunity within school districts.\n  I come from a State of 3\\1/2\\ million people. There are school \ndistricts in this country that have more children than in all of my \nState: Los Angeles, Houston, New York. I do not know about Detroit, the \nmajor city of the Presiding Officer, but there are school districts in \nthis country that have more children in them than exist in many of our \nStates, where we have mandated, for 36 years, comparable educational \nopportunity.\n  Is it such a quantum leap to say that States ought to provide \ncomparable educational opportunity at the State level? We are demanding \nit of kids. We are demanding it of districts. Shouldn't our States meet \na similar standard? That is all we are doing with this amendment. And \nif they fail to do so, the penalty is to be determined by the Secretary \nof Education, which would only involve administrative funds.\n\n  This is not some sword of Damocles hanging over students. We are not \ncutting off title I funding. We are saying, if you do not meet these \nstandards, then the Federal Government will not provide administrative \nfunds. We leave that up to the Secretary to determine the extent of \nthat penalty.\n  My colleague from New Hampshire is no longer in the Chamber, but I \nwant to read a statement, if I may, that sort of explains what I am \ntrying to do. This statement reads as follows:\n\n       There is nothing fair or just about taxing a home or other \n     real estate in one town at four times the rate that similar \n     property is taxed in another town to fulfill the same purpose \n     of meeting the State's educational duty. Compelling taxpayers \n     from property-poor districts to pay higher tax rates and \n     thereby contribute disproportionate sums to fund education is \n     unreasonable. Children who live in poor and rich districts \n     have the same right to a constitutionally adequate public \n     education.\n\n  That radical statement is from a decision by the Supreme Court of the \nState of New Hampshire. The Supreme Court of the State of New Hampshire \nis saying property taxpayers in that State ought not to be \ndisproportionately burdened, rich versus poor, to provide an equal \nopportunity for education. That is all this amendment is saying.\n  It does not federalize education. It does not say to New Hampshire or \nto Connecticut or to Michigan how you ought to do this. It just says: \nDo it any way you wish. You decide what comparable educational \nopportunity ought to be. But whatever it is in your respective States, \nthen it ought to be available to every child in that State whether they \nlive in a rich town or a poor town. That is all this says.\n  Madam President, I refer my colleagues to the New Hampshire Supreme \nCourt case at 123 Ed. Law Rep. 233.\n  The New Hampshire Supreme Court decision says it better than I could, \nthat you should not ask towns of disparate wealth to have their \nchildren get a disparate educational opportunity. That is not any great \nleap of logic. In a sense, this idea that the Federal Government is all \nof a sudden reaching into our States or our local districts at a level \nunprecedented in the history of our country is to deny the reality. \nSince 1965, we have said: Comparable educational opportunity in school \ndistricts. We have said: If a child brings a gun to school and is not \nautomatically expelled, we cut off your Federal money in local \ncommunities.\n  We have said that an individual education plan for every child with a \ndisability must be in place. That is the Federal Government mandating \nthat. If you don't, we cut off all your money. Comparable educational \nservices within the district goes back to 1965. There must be State \nstandards for curricula that are the same for every child or you lose \nFederal funds.\n  This is already the law of the land. I am just suggesting that the \nStates must submit these plans and take steps to implement them. And I \ndo it over the next 6 years, by the way, the life of this bill, the \nsame period of time we are going to be testing every child in America \nbased on this bill. We are going to test apparently every teacher based \non this bill. We are going to threaten title 1 funds to local districts \nunder this bill. We are threatening parents with untold problems if we \ncut off funds to rural and urban schools and there is no other \nalternative for them.\n  We are asking of everybody in the country to be more responsible. I \nwould like to add States to that list of political entities and \nindividuals from whom we are seeking a higher degree of responsibility. \nCall that radical if you will. I don't think it is. Why should they get \nby? Why do the States or the Governors get a pass on this? If you are \ngoing to test a kid, why not test a Governor or a State? If you are \ngoing to test a teacher, why not test whether or not a State is doing \nits best to provide comparable educational opportunity?\n  Many States are trying. Regrettably, some are not. The Governors and \nthe State authorities across this country know of whom I speak with \nthis amendment. If we are saying to some school districts that many \nfeel are not doing an adequate job--and there are many who have told \nanecdotal stories throughout the debate on this bill about school \ndistricts that are failing to meet their responsibilities; I accept \nthat as the truth. There are school districts not doing what they ought \nto be\n\n[[Page S5878]]\n\ndoing when it comes to children's educational opportunities. I accept \nthe fact there are teachers out there who are not teaching very well \nand superintendents and school boards that are failing in their \nresponsibilities and parents who are as well.\n  If all of that is true, don't stand there and tell me that every \nState is meeting its obligations because they are not. This amendment \nmerely says they ought to. If this bill is going to be fair to \neverybody, if 94 cents of the education dollar comes from local \nproperty-tax payers or State funds and only 6 cents from the Federal \nGovernment, and if we are demanding a standard of ourselves on 6 cents, \nthen we ought to demand at least some accountability from our States \nwith the 94 cents they are responsible for when it comes to educational \nneeds at the elementary and secondary level.\n  As I said a moment ago, many States are doing their best. They are \nachieving comparable educational opportunity. This is not identical. I \nam using the words that have been on the books dealing with education \nissues since 1965. Comparable educational opportunity must exist within \nschool districts. There are school districts that have student \npopulations in their districts which exceed the student populations of \nmost States.\n  If we demand accountability of school districts numbering hundreds of \nthousands of kids--that comparability, not identical, comparable--why \nnot ask the States to do that? They lecture us all the time. I have \nlistened to Governors tell us about one problem after another \nconcerning what needs to be done. Is this somehow an immune class from \nconsideration? I don't think so.\n\n  This amendment is reasonable. It is not excessive. If we are asking \naccountability, if that is the mantra on this bill, accountability for \neverybody--and I agree with that; it is overdue--then States ought to \nalso get in line when it comes to taking that test that we are going to \ndemand of everybody. Over the next 6 years, let everybody become more \nresponsible. Let everybody become more accountable--every child, \nparent, teacher, school board, superintendent, principal, and, yes, \nGovernor and State as well.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask consent that the time for debate \non the Nelson-Carnahan amendment No. 385 be increased from 45 minutes \nto 60 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut for \nhis very generous comments relative to my role in the Senate. I \nreciprocate. I admire the Senator from Connecticut immensely. I enjoy \nhim as a colleague, especially his sense of humor and his ability to \nfashion thoughtful policy with which I sometimes agree and sometimes \ndisagree. It is nice to have him as a colleague and especially to claim \nhim as a fellow New Englander.\n  He raises an issue that is one of the major debates revolving around \nthe issue of education, both here at the Federal level and at the State \nlevel, as he pointed out in citing the New Hampshire Supreme Court \ndecision in the Claremont case which has had a significant impact on \nNew Hampshire's approach to education. I have always believed that \ndecision was wrongly decided, but whether it was wrongly decided or \nnot, it was still the Supreme Court of New Hampshire and, therefore, it \nis the law of the land in New Hampshire. It was decided based on the \nNew Hampshire Constitution, not on the Federal Constitution. And as \nsuch, it is unique to New Hampshire, although there are other States \nthat take the same decision.\n  This concept that every part within a State must be equal in their \napproach\n\n[[Page S5879]]\n\nto education is something that the New Hampshire Supreme Court has \nfound to be true, or at least to be the law of New Hampshire. But it is \nnot necessarily the law everywhere.\n  Furthermore, the logic of that, if you were to carry it to its \nnatural extreme, would be that everywhere in the Nation must be the \nsame. If you carry that to its logical conclusion, it would be that in \nNew Hampshire, if town A has a higher property tax base than town B, \ntherefore some of town A's money must go to town B to support town B, \nthus reducing the money for town A but increasing the money for town B \nin order to reach equality of funds, which is essentially what the \nClaremont decision held in its practical application, unless you find \nnew sources of revenue, which is what our State is trying to do right \nnow. Then if you take that to its next logical step, which the Senator \nfrom Connecticut appears to be promoting as a concept, this idea of \ncomparability, then why just New Hampshire?\n  Logically wouldn't the next step be that New Hampshire's funding \nshould be the same as Connecticut, or Connecticut's funding should be \nthe same as Mississippi, that all State districts, all States, all \ncommunities across the country should have exactly the same funding or \nat least comparable funding in their school systems in order to be \nequal, in order to get quality education, in order to leave nobody \nbehind, in order to have equality of opportunity as has been defined in \nthe law?\n  I don't think anybody is suggesting that, but that is the logical \nextension of the logic behind this amendment. Why stop it at the State \nlevel? Why stop at the community level? Why go community to community, \nor county to county? Why wouldn't you step it up to State to State and \nend up with Connecticut sending money, I presume, to Mississippi, for \nexample, or to Louisiana so that Louisiana standards would come up in \nthe amount of funding, and Connecticut's would go down in the amount of \nfunding?\n  It doesn't make any sense. Why? Because it doesn't necessarily \nimprove education. Why doesn't it improve education? Because there has \nbeen study after study after study--some of the best ones have been \ndone out of the University of Rochester where they have actually \nstudied studies, 300 or so--which have concluded that education is not \na formula where more dollars equal better results.\n  In fact, there are a lot of instances where more dollars simply have \nnot equaled better results. And you don't have to look too far from \nwhere we are holding this debate to find that case.\n  Here in the city of Washington, regrettably, more dollars are spent \nper pupil than any place in the United States, or for that matter than \nat any place in all these other industrialized countries that are \nalways listed as being better than the United States in education.\n  More dollars per student are spent right here in Washington. Yet the \nquality of the education, the student achievement levels here in \nWashington are some of the lowest achievement levels of any urban area \nin the country. So it is not an issue of more dollars produces better \neducation. It has been shown, after innumerable studies--and I have to \nalso say just through common sense, just looking at the situation--that \nwhat produces better education is a lot of different factors:\n  Parental involvement, parents who care about education; teachers who \nhave flexibility in their classrooms to teach the way they think best; \ngood teachers; principals who have flexibility to run their schools the \nway they think is important; superintendents who have the flexibility \nto run the school systems; community involvement, with businesses in \nthe community that adopt a school and make it better by committing \ntheir employees and their employees' commitments to time and tutorial \nactivity, with support groups such as Big Brothers and Big Sisters \nsupporting people after school so the kids, when not in school, can \nlearn things to help them get through the day when they are in school.\n  The formula is complex. It is not just more dollars equals better \neducation. So when you set up standards that say everybody has to be \npaid the same, everybody has to have the same amount of money and you \nare going to produce better education, that simply doesn't fly. But \nthat is a big argument that we have in this Senate and which is \noccurring across the country, and also certainly in New Hampshire.\n  But I think it is one of those red herrings; that if you put more \nmoney in the system and bring everybody up to the same money level, you \nwill get better education. That is not true at all. It has been proven \ntime and again.\n  Unfortunately, one example is right here in Washington, DC. There is \nno particular reason to pick on Washington, but Washington is a \nregrettable example of that. So the practical argument, first, is that \nit doesn't hold water because its logical extension is that every State \nacross the country should have the same funding. Maybe that is the goal \nin the end. Maybe we are seeing the early steps of an attempt to \nactually evolve a national system where everybody gets the same amount \nof money and is targeted the same. But I don't think too many people \nwould follow that course of logic. That would be the practical logic of \nthis amendment carried to its full extreme.\n  Secondly, the underpinning purpose of the amendment, which is to \nequalize dollars within a State because that produces better education, \nalso doesn't hold a lot of water because nothing proves that is the \ncase. In fact, just the opposite happens when you use a system that \nsays everybody has to do everything the same. When you put everybody in \na cookie-cutter system of education, you end up with mediocrity; you \nend up with school systems that, rather than producing quality, end up \nproducing to the lowest common denominator and they fail. They fail the \nkids. That is what we have seen in our school systems recently.\n  One of the prior speakers on the other side of the aisle attempted to \ndefine my value systems for me. He said my values are to support a \nsystem that supports dilapidated schools--or something to that effect--\nbecause a community with a dilapidated school doesn't have enough money \nto support that school and a rich community can have a good school.\n  That is not my value system. I am sorry it was characterized that way \nby the Senator from Delaware. My value system on education is that no \nchild is left behind; that the low-income child doesn't get a second-\nrate education in our system because they go to a second-rate school or \nthey go to a school that failed year in and year out.\n  What we have done in this country is to have spent $126 billion on \neducation directed at low-income children and we have not improved \ntheir performance at all in 35 years. In fact, the children continue to \nfail in our system. The average low-income child in the fourth grade \ntoday reads at two grade levels less than his or her peers in the same \nschool and across this country.\n\n  The simple fact is that we have failed those children. We continue to \nfail those children because we use this system which believes that a \ncommand-and-control system from Washington can actually improve the \neducational system in local communities. That is not true at all. We \nneed the creativity and imagination and commitment and involvement of \nthe local community leadership--the parents, teachers, principals, and \nthe support systems to focus on making their schools better and do it \nin a unique way that makes them special.\n  Every community across the country is going to probably have some \noriginal way of doing this. There will be consistencies in text or \nmaybe curriculum in some schools and maybe teaching styles, but each \nschool will be as different as the teachers who are in the schools, the \nindividuals who deal with these kids.\n  So to try to impose on them a cookie-cutter system that says \neverybody has to be comparable--they have to do it all the same way or \nelse they don't get their Federal dollars--is to fundamentally \nundermine the engine that will give these kids opportunities, which is \nthe creativity, originality, and the enthusiasm of the local community, \nthe teacher, the parents, and the principals.\n  This bill that we have been debating today understands that fact. \nPresident Bush has proposed a bill that basically says four things: One \nis that we are\n\n[[Page S5880]]\n\ngoing to focus on the child and stop focusing on the school system, on \nthe bureaucracy, and on a cookie-cutter comparable standard. We are \ngoing to focus on every individual child, especially the low-income \nchild who has been left behind. That is where the dollars are going to \nflow.\n  Two, we are going to give the teachers, the community, the local \nschool system flexibility in how they deal with that child and improve \nthat child's capability. In exchange for that flexibility, we are going \nto require academic achievement by the low-income child. We are not \ngoing to let that child be left behind any longer.\n  Three, we are going to have accountability standards to show that \nthat academic achievement has been accomplished. It is at this point \nwhere we put the testing in place, where the President suggested \ntesting in six grades instead of three, as is presently required, to \nwhich the Senator from Connecticut feels he has the logic to pursue a \ncomparable standard. He says, if everybody is going to have to be \ntested--and this was the argument by the Senator from Delaware--then \nthe systems that will bring the child up to a standard of ability to \nmeet the test also have to be comparable.\n  If everybody is going to be put to one test, then everybody should \nhave comparable support facilities necessary to reach the ability to \ncompete on that test.\n  The problem is you are essentially saying there can be no creativity \nin the local school systems, and instead of giving local school systems \nflexibility in exchange for academic achievement, you are saying we are \ngoing to require academic achievement and we are also going to require \nthat we have a bureaucracy that tells you exactly what to do--at least \nin this amendment--right down to curriculum, range of courses, \ninstructional material, instructional resources--I mean, everything \nfrom the time you walk into that classroom is going to have to be \ncomparable with everybody else in the system.\n  This is a country that takes great pride in individuality, not in \nbeing uniform. That individuality is what produces our creativity and \nstrength, whether it is in education or in the marketplace or whether \nit is in higher learning. Yet this amendment asserts that we should \nhave everything comparable. If you are not comparable, you don't get \nany Federal money, which says that the Federal Government is coming in \nand we are going to take the State standard, whatever it is, and force \nit on every community in that State if they want to get Federal money.\n  You can call that anything you want, but to me that is a \nnationalization of the system. You are essentially saying local school \nsystems will be required to do a whole set of activities, from \nclassroom size, to qualifications of teachers, professional staffing, \ncurriculum, range of courses, instructional material--right down the \nlist. They are going to be required to meet a set of standards which \nthe State may initially set but which the Federal Government enforces. \nThe Federal Government is enforcing this because it is demanding it be \nmet or else the Federal funding doesn't come through--or a portion of \nit does not come through.\n  So it is a huge expansion of the role of the Federal Government in \ndeciding exactly what is going to happen at the local school districts. \nI don't think any of the debate on the other side of the aisle denies \nthat fact.\n  I think it confirms that fact because basically what the other side \nof the aisle has been debating--not the whole other side of the aisle \nbut those presenting this amendment and defending it--is, yes, that is \nright, we have to require that every local community does everything \ncomparable with the other communities in the State to assure equality \nof opportunity, as they define it.\n  It is the wrong approach. The President's approach is you get \nequality of opportunity by assuring the school has the resources but \nletting the school, the parents, the teachers, and the faculty make the \ndecision as to how the child is educated, and then you test whether or \nnot the child has achieved the goals set out.\n  If the child has not achieved those goals, then we start putting \nsanctions on the school systems and start giving the parents some \nopportunities to give their child additional help through supplemental \nservices in this bill or the States with Straight A's.\n  The issue of achievement is not done by some arbitrary input system; \nit is done by actually figuring out in what children are succeeding. As \na result, we hopefully change this system which has produced 36 years \nof failure generation after generation of children who have not had a \nfair break.\n  I find it ironic that the Senator from Delaware tried to characterize \nmy values as being for failed schools, dilapidated schools, schools \nwhere kids were not learning, when what we propose in this bill is an \nattempt to reverse what is a clear, undeniable, factual, confirmable \npoint, which is that generation after generation of low-income kids \nhave been left behind.\n  Even today, after spending $26 billion, the average low-income child \nin this country simply is not getting an education that is competitive \nwith their peers in the school system.\n  While we are on it, let me mention a couple points we put into this \nbill to give that child a little more opportunity because they have not \nbeen talked about much and should be talked about because this bill has \ninteresting and creative initiatives.\n  There was a package pulled together, negotiated, and agreed to by \nboth sides. It took a long time to do that. It was done under the \nleadership of Senator Lott and Senator Daschle. Many of us met for many \nmonths to work it out.\n  I mentioned we had four goals: Child centered, flexibility, academic \nachievement, and accountability. We set up a structure to accomplish \nthe goals.\n  A couple things we did I think are creative. We took all the teacher \nmoney and merged it and said to the school districts: You pick how you \nwant to improve your teachers. You can hire more teachers; you can \nimprove their educational ability; you can improve their technical \nsupport or simply pay the good teachers more. It is your choice. You \ndecide how you do it. We are not going to tell you.\n  That is a big change because it is giving local districts flexibility \nover those teacher dollars.\n  We also said to the small districts in the small school areas, the \nrural districts, we are going to give you all this money that comes \nfrom the Federal Government that comes with these categories, and there \nare literally hundreds of them. There is a category for arts in some \nspecific area or for language in some specific area.\n  Most of these little school districts in States such as New Hampshire \nand Maine--this was an idea of Senator Collins--or even in upstate New \nYork or, I suspect, parts of California, cannot access these \ncategorical programs. Why? Because they simply do not have the staff, \nplus they do not have enough students to draw down enough money to make \nit worth their time.\n\n  We suggested we merge that. We have something called rural ed flex \nwhere all this money will flow into these school systems without the \nstrings attached where they can actually get a bang for the dollar, \nusing it effectively.\n  We also set up something called Straight A's, which is an attempt to \ngive a few States the opportunity to show some creativity with low-\nincome kids. We say we are going to take the formula programs, merge \nthem and you, the State, can take those dollars and spend them however \nyou want, but at the end of the year you have to prove that your low-\nincome children, who are today, remember, not achieving at all--in \nfact, they are achieving at two grade levels less than most kids--\nactually achieve a standard that exceeds other kids in their class.\n  This is an attempt to give a real incentive to States and communities \nwhich are willing to be creative to do something about improving the \nlifestyle and the educational ability of their low-income kids.\n  Another area we addressed was if a child is in a school that has \nfailed--remember, the States designate whether a school has failed; the \nFederal Government does not. If the school fails 1 year, we go into the \nschool system under this bill and give it a lot of resources and try to \nturn it around. If it fails 2 years, we go into the system, start to \nreplace people--under the bill, we give authority to the school system \nto do that--and put in more resources.\n\n[[Page S5881]]\n\nIf after 3 years a child is in a school that fails--and by failing, \nthat is defined by the State but essentially it is going to mean that \nschool is not educating the children up to the standards to which the \nother schools in the community are educating their kids--if a child is \nin that school for 3 years, if you are a parent, you are pulling your \nhair out because for 3 years in a row you know your child has fallen \nbehind because they are in a school that does not work. It has been \ndesignated as not working by the State or by the community.\n  What is your option under present law? Nothing. You have to stay in \nthat school unless you happen to be wealthy enough to go to a private \nschool. It is especially a problem for inner-city moms, single mothers \nraising kids in the inner city, where their kids are going to schools \nthat are filled with drugs and violence, and they have more fear of \ntheir life than they have opportunity to learn. Those kids are trapped.\n  Under this bill, we propose something called supplemental services \nwhere, after 3 years in a failing school, a parent is going to have \nsome authority of their own. They are going to be able to take a \nportion of the money which goes to title I and some other programs and \ntake their child and get services outside the school system. They still \nhave to stay in the public school, but they are going to get services \nout of the public school system to get their children up to speed \nacademically.\n  They can go to Sylvan Learning Center, or the Catholic school across \nthe street has a tutorial program in math, they can do that. It will be \nthe parent's discretion to get decent support services. That is going \nto be a good change for a lot of parents. It is going to be an \nopportunity for a lot of parents.\n  There is a lot of good in this bill directed at trying to give low-\nincome kids a better break and a better chance. But the surest and \nfastest way to undermine the purposes of this bill is to subject it to \nthe cookie-cutter event and to what I think would be a nationalization \nof that, of requiring comparability from school district to school \ndistrict to be asserted as a precondition of whether or not you get \nFederal funds or a portion of Federal funds.\n  Obviously, I think this amendment represents a very significant \nundermining of the President's proposal and the agreement we reached \nthrough literally hours of intense and very constructive negotiation.\n  Madam President, I thank you for your courtesy. I especially thank \nthe staff for their courtesy. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/06/senate-section/article/S5881-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5881-S5882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         DEDICATION OF THE D-DAY MEMORIAL IN BEDFORD, VIRGINIA\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today along with Senator George \nAllen and two Members of the House, Representatives Bob Goodlatte and \nVirgil Goode, to place in today's Record a moving speech delivered by \nPresident George W. Bush in recognition of the 57th anniversary of the \nhistoric landing by U.S. and Allied Forces on the beaches of Normandy, \nFrance.\n  The Commonwealth of Virginia was honored when the President selected \nthe small town of Bedford, where a magnificent memorial has just been \ncompleted in honor of the extraordinary bravery and sacrifice of the \nmilitary men and women at Normandy, as the site to deliver this very \nimportant speech.\n  This memorial will serve as an eternal salute to those who so bravely \nand selflessly fought for freedom. It is often said that June 6, 1944, \nD-Day, forever changed the course of history. So it is only fitting \nthat such a magnificent structure be erected to remind future \ngenerations of that epic chapter in the long European struggle to \nrestore freedom.\n  The citizens of and soldiers from Bedford earned a unique, but tragic \nplace in history that day. In 1941, the 29th Infantry Division, a \nNational Guard division, was mobilized largely with citizen-soldiers \nfrom Virginia and Maryland. Although the division changed over three \nyears, by D-Day, many Virginians took part in the Normandy landing.\n  The 29th Division's 116th Infantry mounted the first wave together \nwith the 1st Division's 16th Infantry Regiment. They suffered \nextraordinary casualties. The State of Virginia sustained nearly 800 \ncasualties during the overall landing sequences.\n  The Bedford National Guard component had formed ``A'' Company of the \n116th and by D-Day, 35 Bedford soldiers were still in the 170-man unit. \nNineteen of those young men gave their lives in the first assault wave, \nand several more died shortly thereafter from wounds. The devastating \nloss of these young men from a small town of 3,200 left Bedford with \nthe highest per-capita loss on D-Day from any single community not only \nin Virginia, but the entire United States.\n  Bedford is a living example of our Nation's many communities who \nshare a common heritage of ``Homefront'' roles, sacrifices and stories. \nThis community and its citizens serve as a particularly fitting home to \nthis national memorial in recognition of all who participated in this \nbattle and their loved ones back in the United States.\n  Today's dedication of the National D-Day Memorial was a truly moving \nceremony that will long be remembered by those in attendance and those \nwho viewed it by television. The President delivered thoughtful, \nheartfelt words, truly befitting this solemn, reverent day. On behalf \nof the Virginian delegation, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the \nPresident's remarks be printed in the Record for all America to share.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Remarks by the President at Dedication of the National D-Day Memorial\n\n       The President. Thank you all very much. At ease. And be \n     seated. Thank you for that warm welcome. Governor Gilmore, \n     thank you so very much for your friendship and your \n     leadership here in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Lt. Governor \n     Hager and Attorney General Earley, thank you, as well, for \n     your hospitality.\n       I'm honored to be traveling today with Secretary Principi, \n     Veterans Affairs Department. I'm honored to be traveling \n     today with two fantastic United States Senators from the \n     Commonwealth of Virginia, Senator Warner and Senator Allen. \n     (Applause.) Congressman Goode and Goodlatte are here, as \n     well. Thank you for your presence. The Ambassador from \n     France--it's a pleasure to see him, and thank you for your \n     kind words. Delegate Putney, Chaplain Sessions, Bob \n     Slaughter, Richard Burrow, distinguished guests, and my \n     fellow Americans.\n       I'm honored to be here today to dedicate this memorial And \n     this is a proud day for the people of Virginia, and for the \n     people of the United States. I'm honored to share it with \n     you, on behalf of millions of Americans.\n       We have many World War II and D-Day veterans with us today, \n     and we're honored by your presence. We appreciate your \n     example, and thank you for coming. And let it be recorded \n     we're joined by one of the most distinguished of them all--a \n     man who arrived at Normandy by glider with the 82nd Airborne \n     Division; a man who serves America to this very hour. Please \n     welcome Major General Strom Thurmond. (Applause.)\n       You have raised a fitting memorial to D-Day, and you have \n     put it in just the right place--not on a battlefield of war, \n     but in a small Virginia town, a place like so many others \n     that were home to the men and women who help liberate a \n     continent.\n       Our presence here, 57 years removed from that event, gives \n     testimony to how much was gained and how much was lost. What \n     was gained that first day was a beach, and then a village, \n     and then a country. And in time, all of Western Europe would \n     be freed from fascism and its armies.\n       The achievement of Operation Overlord is nearly impossible \n     to overstate, in its consequences for our own lives and the \n     life of the world. Free societies in Europe can be traced to \n     the first footprints on the first beach on June 6, 1944. What \n     was lost on D-Day we can never measure and never forget.\n       When the day was over, America and her allies had lost at \n     least 2,500 of the bravest men ever to wear a uniform. Many \n     thousands more would die on the days that followed. They \n     scaled towering cliffs, looking straight up into enemy fire. \n     They dropped into grassy fields sown with land mines. They \n     overran machine gun nests hidden everywhere, punched through \n     walls of barbed wire, overtook bunkers of concrete and steel. \n     The great journalist Ernie Pyle said, ``It seemed to me a \n     pure miracle that we ever too the beach at all. The \n     advantages were all theirs, the disadvantages all ours.'' \n     ``And yet,'' said Pyle, ``we got on.''\n       A father and his son both fell during Operation Overlord. \n     So did 33 pairs of brothers--including a boy having the same \n     name as his hometown, Bedford T. Hoback, and his brother \n     Raymond. Their sister, Lucille, is with us today. She has \n     recalled that Raymond was offered an early discharge for \n     health reasons, but he turned it down. ``He didn't want to \n     leave his brother,'' she remembers. ``He had come over with \n     him and he was going to stay with him.'' Both were killed on \n     D-Day. The only trace of Raymond Hoback was his Bible, found \n     in the sand. Their mother asked that Bedford be laid to\n\n[[Page S5882]]\n\n     rest in France with Raymond, so that her sons might always be \n     together.\n       Perhaps some of you knew Gordon White, Sr. He died here \n     just a few years ago, at the age of 95, the last living \n     parent of a soldier who died on D-Day. His boy, Henry, loved \n     his days on the family farm, and was especially fond of a \n     workhorse named Major. Family members recall how Gordon just \n     couldn't let go of Henry's old horse, and he never did. For \n     25 years after the war, Major was cherished by Gordon White \n     as a last link to his son, and a link to another life.\n       Upon this beautiful town fell the heaviest share of \n     American losses on D-Day--19 men from a community of 3,200, \n     four more afterwards. When people come here, it is important \n     to see the town as the monument itself. Here were the images \n     these soldiers carried with them, and the thought of when \n     they were afraid. This is the place they left behind. And \n     here was the life they dreamed of returning to. They did not \n     yearn to be heroes. They yearned for those long summer nights \n     again, and harvest time, and paydays. They wanted to see Mom \n     and Dad again, and hold their sweethearts or wives, or for \n     one young man who lived here, to see that baby girl born \n     while he was away.\n       Bedford has a special place in our history. But there were \n     neighborhoods like these all over America, from the smallest \n     villages to the greatest cities. Somehow they all produced a \n     generation of young men and women who, on a date certain, \n     gathered and advanced as one, and changed the course of \n     history. Whatever it is about America that has given us such \n     citizens, it is the greatest quality we have, and may it \n     never leave us.\n       In some ways, modern society is very different from the \n     nation that the men and women of D-Day knew, and it is \n     sometimes fashionable to take a cynical view of the world. \n     But when the calendar reads the 6th of June, such opinions \n     are better left unspoken. No one who has heard and read about \n     the events of D-Day could possibly remain a cynic. Army \n     Private Andy Rooney was there to survey the aftermath. A \n     lifetime later he would write, ``If you think the world is \n     selfish and rotten, go to the cemetery at Colleville \n     overlooking Omaha Beach. See what one group of men did for \n     another on D-Day, June 6, 1944.''\n       Fifty-three hundred ships and landing craft; 1,500 tanks; \n     12,000 airplanes. But in the end, it came down to this: \n     scared and brave kids by the thousands who kept fighting, and \n     kept climbing, and carried out General Eisenhower's order of \n     the day--nothing short of complete victory.\n       For us, nearly six decades later, the order of the day is \n     gratitude. Today we give thanks for all that was gained on \n     the beaches of Normandy. We remember what was lost, with \n     respect, admiration and love.\n       The great enemies of that era have vanished. And it is one \n     of history's remarkable turns that so many young men from the \n     new world would cross the sea to help liberate the old. \n     Beyond the peaceful beaches and quiet cemeteries lies a \n     Europe whole and free--a continent of democratic governments \n     and people more free and hopeful than ever before. This \n     freedom and these hopes are what the heroes of D-Day fought \n     and died for. And these, in the end, are the greatest \n     monuments of all to the sacrifices made that day.\n       When I go to Europe next week, I will reaffirm the ties \n     that bind our nations in a common destiny. These are the ties \n     of friendship and hard experiences. They have seen our \n     nations through a World War and a Cold War. Our shared values \n     and experiences must guide us now in our continued \n     partnership, and in leading the peaceful democratic \n     revolution that continues to this day.\n       We have learned that when there is conflict in Europe, \n     America is affected, and cannot stand by. We have learned, as \n     well, in the years since the war that America gains when \n     Europe is united and peaceful.\n       Fifty-seven years ago today, America and the nations of \n     Europe formed a bond that has never been broken. And all of \n     us incurred a debt that can never be repaid. Today, as \n     America dedicates our D-Day Memorial, we pray that our \n     country will always be worthy of the courage that delivered \n     us from evil, and saved the free world.\n       God bless America. And God bless the World War II \n     generation.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy last month. The \nLocal law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to current \nhate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred May 23, 2000 \nin Salt Lake City, Utah. A 19-year-old woman working for the Southern \nUtah Wilderness Alliance was beaten and robbed because her attackers \npresumed she was a lesbian. The woman was taking opinion polls when a \nmale attacker in his 20s--one of two white men with shaved heads--\nallegedly came running up behind her, punched her in the face, knocking \nher down. The woman said the suspect then kicked her in the face while \nhe yelled ``dyke'' and ``queer.''\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/06/senate-section/article/S5884-2", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, on Sunday, June 30, 2001, family, \nfriends, colleagues, and former parishioners will gather to memorialize \nReverend Doctor Leon Howard Sullivan--to celebrate his life, and \nrecognize his accomplishments as one the most outstanding and effective \ncivil and human rights leaders born in the 20th century. I rise today \nto lend my thoughts and reflections as I was privileged to know Rev. \nSullivan, and to have worked with him on initiatives important to \nPhiladelphia, as well on African trade and development issues.\n  Reverend Sullivan was born into poverty in an unpaved alley in an \nunpainted clapboard house in Charleston, WV on October 16, 1922. From \nsuch humble beginnings began a life's journey that was to last seventy-\neight years.\n  Sullivan was born in a State that practiced ``Jim Crow Laws,'' and \nwhile still in grade school, he started in his own way to fight against \nracial discrimination. By the time he was in the tenth grade, he had \nsat-in and been told to leave every drug store and eatery where ``only \nwhites'' were allowed to sit in the city of Charleston, WV. At the age \nof sixteen, he won a basketball and football scholarship to West \nVirginia State College.\n  Sullivan graduated from West Virginia State College at the age of \ntwenty, and at the invitation of the Rev. Adam Clayton Powell, traveled \nto New York City. He was successful in winning a scholarship to the \nUnion Theological Seminary. Rev. Powell also helped him secure his \nfirst job as a coin collector for the Bell Telephone Company. Leon H. \nSullivan became the first African-American in the United States to hold \nthat position.\n  In 1941, at the age of twenty-one, Sullivan was elected President of \nthe March on Washington organized by A. Phillip Randolph, President of \nthe Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters,\n\n[[Page S5885]]\n\nthe first African-American recognized and controlled union in America. \nA few days before the march was scheduled to take place, President \nRoosevelt acted on the demands of the march organizers to end \ndiscrimination against African-Americans on Army and Navy industrial \ninstallations. From the first march on Washington that never took place \ncame Executive Order 8802. This action ended discrimination against \nAfrican-American workers in government ordnance plants.\n  Sullivan's career path continued when he accepted the position of \nassistant pastor to Rev. Powell. It was here that he learned first-hand \nabout church administration and the art of running a political \ncampaign. During this time, Rev. Powell campaigned for and won his seat \nin the U.S. Congress. It was also during this period of time that \nSullivan met his life partner, Grace Banks.\n  In 1944, in Philadelphia, PA, Leon and Grace were married. Not long \nafter marrying, Leon Sullivan was called to lead The First Baptist \nChurch of South Orange, NJ. While serving as pastor, he started a \nnumber of outreach ministries and continued his education at Union \nTheological Seminary and Columbia University.\n  In 1950, Sullivan was called to be the pastor of the Zion Baptist \nChurch of Philadelphia, where he would serve as pastor for the next \nthirty-eight years. The church membership grew from 600 to 6,000 and \nmany outreach ministries were born. It was during his pastorship of \nZion Baptist Church that Rev. Sullivan became locally, nationally and \ninternationally known for his civil rights and human rights activities. \nOne of these outreach programs was the Citizens Committee that worked \nwith the police in the community to actively reduce crime.\n  In 1955, Rev. Sullivan was chosen as one of the Ten Most Outstanding \nMen in America and presented the award by Vice President Richard M. \nNixon. His achievements would also be recognized by Presidents George \nBush in 1992 and Bill Clinton in 1999 when he received the Presidential \nMedal of Freedom and the Eleanor Roosevelt Award respectively.\n  Rev. Sullivan founded the Youth Employment Service, and in 1957, it \nwas cited by the Freedom Foundation as the most effective, privately-\ndeveloped employment program in the nation.\n  A year later, Rev. Sullivan would undertake a great challenge that \nconfronted African-Americans in the city of Philadelphia and across the \nNation. Encouraged by his wife, Rev. Sullivan set out to bolster \nemployment opportunities for African-American Philadelphians. This \neffort would prove to be a turning point in the civil rights movement \nfor the Nation. With the assistance of 400 ministers in Philadelphia, \nRev. Sullivan began the movement called ``Selective Patronage.'' The \nmovement had one message, ``if the company won't hire blacks, don't buy \ntheir products.'' That movement became very successful in Philadelphia \nand led to the employment of thousands of African-Americans who were \npreviously unwelcome as employees.\n  In 1962, at the request of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Rev. Sullivan \ntraveled to Atlanta to explain to King and the black ministers working \nwith him, about Selective Patronage and how it worked. A few months \nlater a similar program was started by Dr. King.\n  Rev. Sullivan went on to make one of his greatest contributions by \ncreating the Opportunities Industrialization Center, OIC. This job \ntraining and retraining program, initially started in Philadelphia, \nexpanded operations to more than 100 cities throughout the United \nStates and in 19 countries. OIC job training programs have enabled \nthousands of people to acquire the tools needed to secure skilled jobs \nwith good wages. The OICs of America, in conjunction with OIC \nInternational, have trained more than 2 million men and women.\n  Further building on Rev. Sullivan's philosophy of self-help and \nempowerment, he founded the International Foundation for Education and \nSelf Help, IFESH, in 1983. IFESH is a non-governmental, non-profit \norganization with a mission of reducing poverty, promoting literacy, \nproviding skilled job training, and providing basic and preventive \nhealth care. Specifically, IFESH designed programs to train 100,000 \nskilled workers; prepare 100,000 people for the farming profession; and \nhelp five million people achieve literacy. IFESH programs are \ninternational in scope with a strong emphasis on fostering social, \ncultural and economic relations between Africans and Americans.\n  Rev. Sullivan's vision of and dedication to empowerment, equality and \nfairness touched many lives throughout the world. One of his celebrated \naccomplishments is the establishment of a code of conduct for companies \noperating in South Africa. These principles, known as the Sullivan \nPrinciples, are the standard for social responsibility and equal \nopportunity, and are recognized to be one of the most effective efforts \nto end workplace discrimination in South Africa.\n  Rev. Sullivan built a bridge between America and Africa by organizing \nthe five African/African-American Summits that were held in Africa. The \nfirst summit was in the Cote d'Ivoire and drew 2,000 people and the \nlast was in Accra, Ghana with 4,200 people attending from throughout \nthe United States and Africa. The last summit included 12 African heads \nof state, five vice presidents and prime ministers, and 14 delegations \nled by ministers of state. From the business community, more than 300 \nAmerican businesses were represented.\n  The life's work of Rev. Leon Sullivan charted a course and paved the \nway for hope, opportunity, and fulfillment for many African-Americans \nin Philadelphia, across the Nation, and throughout the world. In \nmemorializing Rev. Sullivan, we celebrate his monumental contributions \nand achievements as a civil rights leader and a human rights \nadvocate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/06/senate-section/article/S5885-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5885-S5886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    DR. STEPHEN R. PORTCH: CHANCELLOR, UNIVERSITY SYSTEM OF GEORGIA\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise before you on this day to \nrecognize the outstanding achievements, hard work, and dedication of \nDr. Stephen R. Portch, the ninth Chancellor of the University System of \nGeorgia. This day should be both celebrated and lamented, for it is a \ndelight to honor my good friend, Chancellor Portch, yet saddening to \nbid the Chancellor farewell.\n  John Stuart Mill, a revered philosopher, political scientist, and \neducator, left an indelible mark on his students at the University of \nSt. Andrews in Scotland, where he once said, ``There is nothing which \nspreads more contagiously from teacher to pupil than elevation of \nsentiment: Often and often have students caught from the living \ninfluence of a professor a noble ambition to leave the world better \nthan they found it;'' This is just what Chancellor Portch has done; he \nhas helped make the world a better place. As a professor of English \nLiterature Dr. Portch has enriched and inspired the lives of many \nindividuals. He has awakened students' dormant interest in literature \nand the world around them. Together with the Georgia Board of Regents, \nthe governing body of the University System, Dr. Portch has continued \nto promote education and has made tremendous improvements to the \nGeorgia University System.\n  Chancellor Portch, a native of Somerset, England, earned his \nBachelor's Degree in English from the University of Reading in England, \nand a Master's and Ph.D in English from Penn State. Richmond University \nin England granted Dr. Portch an honorary doctorate, and he was named \nby Change, The Magazine of Higher Learning as one of its ``21 Most \nInfluential Voices.'' Georgia Trend magazine has repeatedly identified \nDr. Portch as one of the most powerful and influential citizens in our \nState, and the Atlanta Business Chronicle placed Dr. Portch on its list \nof the ``100 Most Influential Atlantans.'' Dr. Portch served on former \nU.S. Education Secretary Richard Riley's National Commission on the \nHigh School Senior Year. Stephen R. Portch has been a familiar and \nlauded name in the literary world and has become a very well recognized \nand respected name in Georgia.\n  The University System and the Georgia Board of Regents are committed \nto improving higher education, and in 1994, under Dr. Portch's \nleadership, the Board adopted the program, ``Access to Academic \nExcellence for the New Millennium.'' In 1995, Chancellor Portch\n\n[[Page S5886]]\n\nintroduced another new policy directed at the need for reform in an \neffort to recognize that all sectors of education are vitally linked \nand that improvement in one sector requires a reciprocal effort in all \nother sectors. Dr. Portch implemented a new admissions policy, raising \nthe bar for admissions in all 34 public institutions in Georgia. The \nwork of Chancellor Portch has helped elevate the average SAT score in \nGeorgia public institutions, increase member school salaries by over 35 \npercent, and has raised overall quality of education throughout the \nstate.\n  Henry Brooks Adams once said, ``A teacher affects eternity; he can \nnever tell where his influence stops.'' Although Dr. Portch is stepping \ndown as Chancellor of the University System, I assure you that we will \ncontinue to feel his presence and benefit from his service well into \nthe future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/06/senate-section/article/S5886-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  MR.

Mr. President, I rise today with great pride to \nhonor my friend and a friend of working families, Mr. George C. \nSpringer, who is retiring as president of the Connecticut State \nFederation of Teachers. For more than 20 years, George fought valiantly \nto ensure that our educators had the tools and resources necessary to \nprovide the best possible education to our most prized possession, our \nchildren.\n  Widely known for his leadership, George united teachers and \nadministrators in seeking ways to improve our schools. His innovative \nstyle led to compromise and understanding and opened a dialogue that \ngenerated ideas aimed at helping our children. During his tenure, \nConnecticut's public schools have attained a reputation of excellence \nthat continues today.\n  George's calm, well thought out ways of handling the issues facing \nour teachers and schools is testament of his visionary leadership \nstyle. Further, his abilities in bringing people together to work for \nan important goal serve as a model for labor union leadership across \nour nation.\n  On behalf of the people of Connecticut, I thank George for his \nleadership in making Connecticut's schools better places to teach and \nlearn and for making our community a better place for everyone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/06/senate-section/article/S5886-2", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      RECOGNITION OF THE DISTINGUISHED CAREER OF JOHN C.

Titchner, Vermont's State Resource \nConservationist, who is retiring after thirty-six years with the United \nStates Department of Agriculture.\n  John Titchner's career is among the most distinguished in the history \nof the Soil Conservation Service and the Natural Resource Conservation \nService, NRCS. He began his work with the USDA in 1965, and has served \nas Vermont State Conservationist since 1981. At the time of his \nretirement, he was the longest serving among all active State \nConservationists.\n  John has guided the Natural Resource Conservation Service in Vermont \nthrough many changes in agricultural policy and administration. Under \nhis direction, the NRCS has handled an ever increasing number of \nprograms and special projects to support farmers and conserve our \nnatural resources. The lakes and streams of Vermont are clearer and \ncleaner today as a result of his work.\n  For many years, Senator Leahy and I have each looked to John as an \nadvisor on agriculture and conservation. In this role, he has had a \nsignificant impact on national agricultural policy.\n  John has assumed many leadership roles in his profession and in his \ncommunity. These include serving as a member of the Lake Champlain \nSteering Committee, Chairman of the Vermont Food and Agricultural \nCouncil, and President of the Vermont Federal Executives Association.\n  John C. Titchner's career stands as an outstanding example for all \nwho choose to serve their community and their country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/06/senate-section/article/S5886-3", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:53 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1183.

A bill to prohibit racial profiling; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I rise along with the Senator from \nNew Jersey, Mr. Corzine, and the Senator from New York, Mrs. Clinton, \nand others, to introduce the End Racial Profiling Act of 2001. This \nbill is a package of steps to eliminate racial profiling once and for \nall. Congress should protect the rights of all Americans to walk, \ndrive, or travel on our streets and highways and through our airports \nfree of discrimination. It is time for us to act.\n  I am very pleased to be joined by a number of distinguished \ncolleagues. I simply have to point out that I think almost minutes \nafter Senators Corzine and Clinton were sworn in, they were already \ntalking to me and Representative Conyers of the House about how we \ncould introduce a strong bill to deal with this problem. I thank them \nand appreciate the strong work and support they have given. They have \nmade significant contributions and have offered good ideas to \nstrengthen the legislation.\n  I also acknowledge our long-time leader on this issue, Representative \nJohn Conyers, the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee. He \nis introducing the companion bill in the House today. This is the third \nCongress in which Representative Conyers has introduced legislation on \nracial profiling. He has fought long and hard to educate the Congress \nand all Americans about racial profiling. Before he took on the issue, \nI don't think many of us knew what racial profiling was. I thank \nRepresentative Conyers for his tremendous leadership. It is an honor to \nbe working with him on this bill.\n  Those who have experienced racial profiling suffer great harm. They \nare unfairly treated as suspect, humiliated, and can feel fear, anxiety \nor even anger. It is a grave indignity.\n  U.S. Army Sergeant Rossano Gerald testified during a hearing in the \nJudiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution last year about his personal \nexperience as a victim of racial profiling. Sergeant Gerald is a \nveteran of the Persian Gulf war and a law-abiding citizen. In August \n1998, he was driving along a major highway in Oklahoma with his 12-\nyear-old son when he was pulled over and handcuffed. Both he and his \nson were thrown into the back seat of a state trooper's car while the \ntrooper extensively searched Sergeant Gerald's car. When the entire \nepisode was over, the trooper gave Sergeant Gerald a warning ticket for \nchanging lanes without signaling and left his car with over $1,000 of \ndamage.\n  In moving testimony before the subcommittee, a hearing which then-\nSenator Ashcroft chaired and has said influenced his thinking on the \nissue, Sergeant Gerald said,\n\n       I was very humiliated by this experience. I was embarrassed \n     and ashamed that people driving by would think I had \n     committed a serious crime. It was particularly horrible to\n\n[[Page S5892]]\n\n     be treated like a criminal in front of my impressionable \n     young son.\n\n  Robert Wilkins also testified before the subcommittee. He and his \nfamily were stopped along a highway in Maryland. He described his \nexperience as ``humiliating and degrading.'' He said:\n\n       So there we were. Standing outside the car in the rain, \n     lined up along the road, with police lights flashing, \n     officers standing guard, and a German Shepard jumping on top \n     of, underneath, and sniffing every inch of our vehicle. We \n     were criminal suspects; yet we were just trying to use the \n     interstate highway to travel from our homes to a funeral. It \n     is hard to describe the frustration and pain you feel when \n     people presume you to be guilty for no good reason and you \n     know that you are innocent. I particularly remember a car \n     driving past with two young children in the back seat, noses \n     pressed against the window. They were looking at the \n     policemen, the flashing lights, the German Shepard and us. In \n     this moment of education that each of us receives through \n     real world experiences, those children were putting two and \n     two together and getting five. They saw some black people \n     standing along the road who certainly must have been bad \n     people who had done something wrong, for why else would the \n     police have them there? They were getting an untrue, negative \n     picture of me, and there was nothing in the world that I \n     could do about it.\n\n  Mr. President, as Americans, we take great pride in our freedom and \nindependence. Central to our sense of who we are is our firm belief \nthat we are free to walk the paths of our own choosing, free to move \nabout as we please, and free from the intrusion of the government in \nthat movement.\n  Immigrants came to our nation's shores to escape arbitrary \ngovernment. Fleeing the British Government's discrimination based on \nreligion in the 1600s, Puritans came to Massachusetts, Quakers came to \nNew Jersey and then Pennsylvania, Catholics came to Maryland, and Jews \ncame to Rhode Island.\n  And responding to indiscriminate searches and seizures conducted by \nthe British, our Founders adopted the fourth amendment, which states: \n``The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, \npapers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall \nnot be violated . . . .''\n  It is thus fundamental to American history and rooted in American law \nthat the officers of the state may not arrest or detain its citizens \narbitrarily or without cause.\n\n  But this is not the case for all Americans today. Some Americans \nstill cannot walk where they choose. Some Americans cannot travel free \nfrom the harassment of the government. Some Americans still do not \nreceive the full benefit of their civil rights.\n  Although many did come to these shores as immigrants, many came in \nchains, because of the color of their skin. They and their descendants \nendured our nation's long struggle against slavery and discrimination. \nSadly, even now, skin color alone still makes too many Americans more \nlikely to be a suspect, more likely to be stopped, more likely to be \nsearched, more likely to be arrested, and more likely to be imprisoned.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the vast majority of law enforcement \nagents nationwide discharge their duties professionally, without bias, \nand protect the safety of their communities. But I also believe that \nracial profiling is a very real problem. The use by law enforcement \nofficers of race, ethnicity or national origin in deciding which \npersons should be subject to traffic stops, stop and frisks, \nquestioning, searches and seizures is a problematic law enforcement \ntactic.\n  Mr. President, the bill that Representative Conyers first introduced \nin the 105th Congress, and which we introduced again in the 106th \nCongress, was a traffic stops study bill. It would have required the \nAttorney General to conduct a nationwide study of traffic stops based \non existing data and a sampling of jurisdictions that would provide \nadditional data to the Attorney General. We proposed a study bill \nbecause, at that time, there was still very much education that needed \nto take place in Congress and America. We thought that a study would \nprovide the facts to show people that racial profiling indeed is very \nreal in America today.\n  Mr. President, we no longer need, just a study. We now have facts \nthat show us that racial profiling is a problem. Statistical evidence \nfrom a number of jurisdictions across the country demonstrates that \nracial profiling is a real and measurable phenomenon. For example, data \ncollected under a federal court consent decree revealed that between \nJanuary 1995 and 1997, 70 percent of the drivers stopped and searched \nby the Maryland State Police on Interstate 95 were black, while only \n17.5 percent of drivers and speeders were black.\n  A 1992 study of traffic stops in Volusia County, Florida revealed \nthat 70 percent of those stopped on a particular interstate highway in \ncentral Florida were black or Hispanic, although only 5 percent of the \nmotorists on that highway were black or Hispanic. Further, minorities \nwere detained for longer periods of time per stop than whites, and were \n80 percent of those whose cars were searched after being stopped.\n  We also know that racial profiling is a problem not only for \nmotorists on our nation's highways. Racial profiling, unfortunately, \nextends to racial and ethnic minority Americans as pedestrians or \ntravelers through our nation's airports.\n  A December 1999 report by New York's Attorney General on the use of \n``stop and frisk'' tactics by the New York City Police Department \nrevealed that between January 1998 through March 1999, 84 percent of \nthe almost 175,000 people stopped by NYPD were black or Hispanic, \ndespite the fact that these two groups comprised less than half of the \ncity's population.\n  A March 2000 GAO report on the U.S. Customs Service found that black, \nAsian, and Hispanic female U.S. citizens were 4 to 9 times more likely \nthan white female U.S. citizens to be subjected to X-rays after being \nfrisked or patted down.\n  Many of those who deny that racial profiling is a problem have argued \nthat these discrepancies can be justified by the fact that blacks and \nother minorities are more likely to commit crimes--especially drug-\nrelated crimes--than whites, and that profiling therefore amounts to a \nrational law enforcement tactic. The statistics refute this argument.\n  Although black motorists were disproportionately stopped on I-95 by \nthe Maryland State Police, the instances in which police actually found \ndrugs were the same per capita for white and black motorists.\n  In Volusia County, Florida, where 70 percent of more than 1000 \ntraffic stops of motorists on an interstate highway were of minority \ndrivers, only 9 stops resulted in so much as a traffic ticket.\n  The New York Attorney General's report on NYPD stop and frisk tactics \nrevealed that stops of minorities were less likely to lead to arrests \nthan stops of white New Yorkers--the NYPD arrested one white New Yorker \nfor every 8 stops, one Hispanic New Yorker for every 9 stops, and one \nblack New Yorker for every 9.5 stops.\n  The General Accounting Office found that while black female U.S. \ncitizens were nine times more likely than white female U.S. citizens to \nbe subjected to x-ray searches by the Customs Service, black females \nwere less than half as likely to be found carrying contraband as white \nfemales.\n  In my home state of Wisconsin, racial profiling has touched the lives \nof many law abiding citizens, including African Americans, Latino \nAmericans, and Asian Americans. My state is home to one of the largest \nHmong and Lao populations in the country. They came to our country \nseeking safety and freedom. But their dreams of freedom have somehow \nbeen tarnished by unfair stops by police officers.\n  I am very pleased that during the last year, a Task Force appointed \nby former Governor Tommy Thompson developed a set of recommendations \nfor combating racial profiling and restoring the important trust that \nmust exist between law enforcement officials and the communities they \nare charged to protect and serve.\n  Because, as we know, racial profiling undermines the willingness of \npeople to work with the police. As one victim of racial profiling in \nGlencoe, Illinois, said: ``Who is there left to protect us? The police \njust violated us.''\n  Mr. President, current efforts by state and local governments to \neradicate racial profiling and redress the harms it causes, while \nlaudable, have been limited in scope and insufficient to address this \nproblem nationwide.\n  During his confirmation hearing, Attorney General Ashcroft said:\n\n       I think racial profiling is wrong. I think it's \n     unconstitutional. I think it violates the 14th Amendment. I \n     think most of the men and women in our law enforcement are \n     good\n\n[[Page S5893]]\n\n     people trying to enforce the law. I think we all share that \n     view. But we owe it to provide them with guidance to ensure \n     that racial profiling does not happen.\n\n  This February in his Address to Congress, President Bush said, ``It's \nwrong, and we will end it in America.'' At remarks marking Black \nHistory Month this February in Washington, DC, President Bush said that \nhe would ``look at all opportunities'' to end racial profiling.\n  Attorney General Ashcroft then wrote Congress to say that the traffic \nstops statistics study bill that we wrote and supported in the last \nCongress ``is an excellent starting place for such an enterprise.''\n  While I welcome the administration's statements, it is now no longer \ntime simply to study. It is time to move beyond studying whether racial \nprofiling exists. We know it exists. Now, let's take the right steps to \neliminate it and protect the rights of all Americans to walk or travel \nfree of discrimination. It is time to act. I urge the Attorney General \nand President to support this bill as the best opportunity to translate \nour nation's promises into action.\n\n  Representative Conyers and I have taken a fresh look at the role \nCongress can play in eliminating racial profiling by all law \nenforcement agencies. Our bill reflects the President's and Attorney \nGeneral's view that racial profiling is wrong and should end. This bill \nhas two major components. First, the bill explicitly bans racial \nprofiling. Second, the bill sets out several steps for federal, state, \nand local law enforcement agencies to take to eliminate racial \nprofiling. The bill takes a ``carrot and stick'' approach. It \nconditions federal funds to state and local law enforcement agencies on \ntheir compliance with certain requirements, but also authorizes the \nAttorney general to provide incentive grants to assist agencies with \ncomplying with this Act. The bill requires federal, state, and local \nlaw enforcement agencies to adopt policies prohibiting racial \nprofiling; implement complaint procedures to respond to complaints of \nracial profiling effectiely; implement disciplinary procedures for \nofficers who engage in the practice; and collect data on stops.\n  Grants awarded by the Attorney general could be used for training to \nprevent racial profiling; the acquisition of in-car video cameras and \nother technology; and the development of procedures for receiving, \ninvestigating, and responding to complaints of racial profiling. \nFinally, the bill would require the Attorney General to report to \ncongress two years after enanctment of the Act and each year thereafter \non racial profiling in the United States. These are the right steps to \ntake in the interest of better police practices and increased \naccountability.\n  Mr. President, this bill is a priority for the civil rights \ncommunity. It has the support of the Leadership Conference on Civil \nrights and its member organizations like the NAACP, National Council of \nLa Raza, and ACLU. This bill reflects a new political reality: both \nRepublicans and Democrats can agree that racial profiling is wrong and \nshould be eliminated. Congress can play a role in ensuring that all \npolice departments do their part and give them the financial assistance \nthey may need to get the job done. I urge my colleagues to join with \nme, Senators Corzine, Clinton, Kennedy, Torricelli, Schumer, Durbin, \nand Stabenow in supporting the End Racial Profiling Act of 2001.\n  We Americans take great pride in our freedom and independence. \nCentral to our sense of who we are is our firm belief that we are free \nto walk the paths of our choosing, free to move about as we please, and \nfree of the intrusion of the Government in that movement.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord immediately following my statement.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 989\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The vast majority of law enforcement agents nationwide \n     discharge their duties professionally, without bias, and \n     protect the safety of their communities.\n       (2) The use by police officers of race, ethnicity, or \n     national origin in deciding which persons should be subject \n     to traffic stops, stops and frisks, questioning, searches, \n     and seizures is a problematic law enforcement tactic. \n     Statistical evidence from across the country demonstrates \n     that such racial profiling is a real and measurable \n     phenomenon.\n       (3) As of November 15, 2000, the Department of Justice had \n     14 publicly noticed, ongoing, pattern or practice \n     investigations involving allegations of racial profiling and \n     had filed five pattern and practice lawsuits involving \n     allegations of racial profiling, with four of those cases \n     resolved through consent decrees.\n       (4) A large majority of individuals subjected to stops and \n     other enforcement activities based on race, ethnicity, or \n     national origin are found to be law-abiding and therefore \n     racial profiling is not an effective means to uncover \n     criminal activity.\n       (5) A 2001 Department of Justice report on citizen-police \n     contacts in 1999 found that, although African-Americans and \n     Hispanics were more likely to be stopped and searched, they \n     were less likely to be in possession of contraband. On \n     average, searches and seizures of African-American drivers \n     yielded evidence only eight percent of the time, searches and \n     seizures of Hispanic drivers yielded evidence only 10 percent \n     of the time, and searches and seizures of white drivers \n     yielded evidence 17 percent of the time.\n       (6) A 2000 General Accounting Office report on the \n     activities of the United States Customs Service during fiscal \n     year 1998 found that black women who were United States \n     citizens were 9 times more likely than white women who were \n     United States citizens to be X-rayed after being frisked or \n     patted down and, on the basis of X-ray results, black women \n     who were United States citizens were less than half as likely \n     as white women who were United States citizens to be found \n     carrying contraband. In general, the report found that the \n     patterns used to select passengers for more intrusive \n     searches resulted in women and minorities being selected at \n     rates that were not consistent with the rates of finding \n     contraband.\n       (7) Current local law enforcement practices, such as ticket \n     and arrest quotas, and similar management practices, may have \n     the unintended effect of encouraging law enforcement agents \n     to engage in racial profiling.\n       (8) Racial profiling harms individuals subjected to it \n     because they experience fear, anxiety, humiliation, anger, \n     resentment, and cynicism when they are unjustifiably treated \n     as criminal suspects. By discouraging individuals from \n     traveling freely, racial profiling impairs both interstate \n     and intrastate commerce.\n       (9) Racial profiling damages law enforcement and the \n     criminal justice system as a whole by undermining public \n     confidence and trust in the police, the courts, and the \n     criminal law.\n       (10) Racial profiling violates the Equal Protection Clause \n     of the Constitution. Using race, ethnicity, or national \n     origin as a proxy for criminal suspicion violates the \n     constitutional requirement that police and other government \n     officials accord to all citizens the equal protection of the \n     law. Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development \n     Corporation, 429 U.S. 252 (1977).\n       (11) Racial profiling is not adequately addressed through \n     suppression motions in criminal cases for two reasons. First, \n     the Supreme Court held, in Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. \n     806 (1996), that the racially discriminatory motive of a \n     police officer in making an otherwise valid traffic stop does \n     not warrant the suppression of evidence. Second, since most \n     stops do not result in the discovery of contraband, there is \n     no criminal prosecution and no evidence to suppress.\n       (12) Current efforts by State and local governments to \n     eradicate racial profiling and redress the harms it causes, \n     while laudable, have been limited in scope and insufficient \n     to address this national problem.\n\n[[Page S5894]]\n\n       (b) Purposes.--The independent purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to enforce the constitutional right to equal protection \n     of the laws, pursuant to the Fifth Amendment and section 5 of \n     the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States;\n       (2) to enforce the constitutional right to protection \n     against unreasonable searches and seizures, pursuant to the \n     Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States;\n       (3) to enforce the constitutional right to interstate \n     travel, pursuant to section 2 of article IV of the \n     Constitution of the United States; and\n       (4) to regulate interstate commerce, pursuant to clause 3 \n     of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the United \n     States.\n\n                TITLE I--PROHIBITION OF RACIAL PROFILING\n\n     SEC. 101.

Mr. President, I rise on this special day to talk about \nan issue that I think defines our health as a society--the issue of \nracial profiling. I thank my colleagues, Senator Feingold and Senator \nClinton--particularly Senator Feingold, for his tremendous leadership \non this issue over several Congresses. During the last session he held \na number of hearings on racial profiling, and he and his staff have \nworked tirelessly to elevate the importance of this issue on to the \nnational agenda as a matter of civil rights. I also would be remiss if \nI didn't mention Congressman Conyers, who has taken an equally valiant \nand effective role in presenting this issue on the floor of the House. \nIt is one about which I think we all feel passionately.\n  The practice of racial profiling is the antithesis of America's \nbelief in fairness and equal protection under the law. Stopping people \non our highways, our streets, and at our borders because of the color \nof their skin tears at the very fabric of what it is to be an American.\n  We are a nation of laws, and everyone should receive equal protection \nunder the law. Our Constitution tolerates nothing less. We should \ndemand nothing less. There is no equal protection, there is no equal \njustice, if law enforcement agencies engage in policies and practices \nthat are premised on a theory that the way to stop crime is to go after \nblack and brown people on the hunch that they are more likely to be \ncriminals.\n  Let me add that not only is racial profiling wrong, it is also not \neffective as a law enforcement tool. There is no evidence that stopping \npeople of color adds to catching the bad guys. In fact, there is \nstatistical evidence which points out that singling out black and \nHispanic motorists for stops and searches doesn't lead to a higher \npercentage of arrests. Minority motorists are simply no more likely to \nbe breaking the law than white motorists.\n\n  Unfortunately, racial profiling persists. In the last wave of \nstatistics from New Jersey, minority motorists accounted for 73 percent \nof those searched on the New Jersey Turnpike. Even the State attorney \ngeneral admitted that State troopers were twice as likely to find drugs \nor other illegal contraband when searching vehicles driven by whites.\n  Take the example of the March 2000 General Accounting Office report \non the U.S. Customs Service. The report found that black, Asian, and \nHispanic women were four to nine times more likely than white women to \nbe subjected to x rays after being frisked or patted down. On the basis \nof x ray results, black women were less than half as likely as white \nwomen to be found carrying contraband.\n  This is law enforcement by hunch. No warrants, no probable cause. \nWhat is the hunch based on? Race, plain and simple.\n  Nowhere was this more evident than in my own home State 3 Aprils ago. \nFour young men on the New Jersey Turnpike in a minivan--on their way to \nNorth Carolina, hoping to get college basketball scholarships--were \nstopped by two State troopers. Frightened, the driver lost control of \nthe van, and two dozens shots rang out and struck the van. Three out of \nthe four young men were shot.\n  I spoke to those kids a while ago. One of them told me he was asleep \nwhen his van was pulled over. He told me, ``What woke me up was a \nbullet.''\n  Stories such as this should wake us all up in America. The practice \nof racial profiling broadly undermines the confidence of the American \npeople in the institutions on which we depend to protect and defend us. \nDifferent laws for different people do not work.\n  Now we know that many law enforcement agencies, including some in my \nhome State, have acknowledged the danger of the practice and have taken \nsteps to combat it. I commend them for those efforts. Many law \nenforcement officials believe this is the step we need to take. It is a \nnational problem. It is not a local problem, it is not a State problem, \nit is a national problem, and it requires a Federal response applicable \nto all. That is why my colleagues and I have introduced this \nlegislation to end this practice. We want to be sure there are no more \nexcuses, no more bullets waking folks up on questions about what racial \nprofiling means.\n\n  This bill defines racial profiling clearly and then bans it; no \nroutine stops solely on the basis of race, national origin, or \nethnicity.\n  We will also require a collection of statistics to accurately measure \nwhether progress is being made, whether problems exist. By collecting \nthis data, we will get a fair picture of law enforcement at work.\n  We use statistics in every aspect of our life. I came from the \nfinancial services industry. We collected statistics. If you go to a \nhospital, they collect statistics. We need to do that with regard to \nlaw enforcement so we have the information to detect problems early on.\n  It is not our intention to micromanage law enforcement. Our bill does \nnot tell law enforcement agencies what data should be collected. \nInstead, we direct the Attorney General to develop the standards for \ndata collection, and he presumably will work with law enforcement in \ndeveloping those particular standards for particular situations.\n  Our legislation also specifically directs the Attorney General to \nestablish standards for setting benchmarks against which the collected \ndata should be measured so that no data is taken out of context that \nsome in law enforcement rightly fear.\n  No, it is an indication, a benchmark, not an absolute. If the numbers \nreveal a portrait of continued racial profiling, then the Justice \nDepartment or independent third parties can seek relief in Federal \ncourt ordering that remedies be put into effect to end racial \nprofiling.\n  Our bill will also put in place procedures to receive and investigate \ncomplaints of alleged racial profiling. By the way, this mirrors \nlegislation that is now going through the New Jersey State Legislature \non a bipartisan basis. It will require procedures to discipline law \nenforcement officers engaging in racial profiling.\n  Finally, we will encourage a climate of cultural change in law \nenforcement with a carrot and stick. We are not trying to say that this \nall be done through the law; part of this has to come from a real \ncultural change.\n\n[[Page S5896]]\n\n  First the carrot. We recognize that law enforcement should not be \nexpected to do this alone. It is a bigger problem. We are saying if you \ndo the job right, fairly and equitably, you can be eligible to receive \na best practices development grant to help pay for the programs dealing \nwith advanced training, to help pay for the computer technology \nnecessary to collect the data, such as hand-held computers in police \ncars, so statistics can be collected. We will help pay for video \ncameras and recorders for patrol cars, which protects the person who is \nstopped and also the law enforcement officer. It has been very well \nreceived across this country where it has been applied.\n  It will help pay for establishing or improving systems for handling \ncomplaints alleging ethnic or racial profiling and will help to \nestablish management systems to assure supervisors are held accountable \nfor subordinates.\n  If they do not do the job right, there is a stick. If State and local \nlaw enforcement agencies refuse to implement procedures to end and \nprevent profiling, they will be subject to a loss of Federal law \nenforcement funds.\n\n  Let me be clear. This bill is not about blaming law enforcement, but \nwe do believe we need to see change. It is not designed to prevent law \nenforcement from doing its job, it is to encourage them to do a better \njob. In fact, we believe it will help our law enforcement officers in \nthis Nation maintain the public trust they need to do their jobs.\n  If race is part of a description of a specific suspect involved in an \ninvestigation, this law does not prevent them from using that \ninformation or having that information distributed, but stopping people \non a random, race-based hunch will be outlawed.\n  Race has been a never-ending battle in this country. It began with \nour Constitution when the Founding Fathers argued over the rights of \nsouthern slaves. Then we fought a war over race. We fought a war that \nripped our country apart. Our country emerged whole, but discrimination \nand Jim Crow laws continued for decades--discrimination sanctioned in \npart by our own Supreme Court.\n  Our country's history has always been about change, about growth, \nabout getting better, about recognizing things that weaken us from \nwithin. A generation ago, we began to fight another war, a war founded \non peaceful principles, a war that killed our heroes, burned our \ncities, and shook us, once again, to the very core. But we advanced \nwith important civil rights initiatives, such as the Voting Rights Act, \nthe public accommodation laws. We demanded and gained like laws to \nfight discrimination in employment, housing, and education.\n  It is time for us to take another very important step. Racial \nprofiling has bred humiliation, anger, resentment, and cynicism \nthroughout this country. It has weakened respect for the law by many, \nnot just the offended.\n  I close by putting it in simple words: Racial profiling is wrong, and \nit must end. Today Senator Feingold, Senator Clinton, I, and others in \nthe House pledge to do just that: to define it, to ban it, and then \nenforce that ban.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I cannot help but notice, as I look at \nthe Presiding Officer and the Senator from New Jersey, how fortunate we \nare to have new Members who have immediately come to the Senate and \nexerted leadership--the Presiding Officer on education, as well as \nother issues; and the Senator from New Jersey, his determination and \nhard work on this has been truly striking. I am just delighted to be \nworking with him on this.\n  I also thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his courtesy in \nallowing us to interrupt the education bill for this purpose.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be an original \ncosponsor of this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nbipartisan End of Racial Profiling Act of 2001. I believe it is a \nthoughtful and balanced effort, designed to bring people together, not \nto divide. I also want to express my sincere gratitude to my esteemed \ncolleagues, Senator Feingold and Senator Corzine, for their leadership \nand tremendous efforts in crafting this legislation that affects so \nmany communities throughout this country.\n  I also want to acknowledge the efforts of Representative Conyers, the \nRanking Member of the House Judiciary Committee, and a leader on this \nissue. Representative Conyers has worked to obtain the support of both \nDemocrats and Republicans alike, including Republican Representatives \nAsa Hutchinson, Chris Shays, Tim Johnson, Constance Morella, and Jim \nGreenwood. I thank them for attending the bipartisan press conference \nthis morning and showing their support for this legislation. I hope we \nwill be able to build upon this strong bipartisan support in the \nSenate.\n  I am also pleased that we were joined by Chief Bruce Chamberlin, an \nesteemed and experienced member of the national law enforcement \ncommunity, who is the Chief of Police of Cheektowaga--in the western \npart of the great state of New York.\n  It was important for Chief Chamberlin to be here with us today to \nexpress his support for the bill because he recognizes, as we all do, \nthat racial profiling is wrong and that this bill is an important step \nin bringing this practice to an end.\n  Racial profiling is unjust. It relegates honest, law-abiding citizens \nto second-class status when they suffer the embarrassment, the \nhumiliation, the indignity, of being stopped or searched, and in some \ncases even physically harmed simply because of their race, ethnicity or \nnational origin.\n  Racial profiling is not an effective law enforcement tool. The \nexperts at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and elsewhere will tell \nyou that the evidence is unquestionably clear, for example, that the \nvast majority of Blacks and Hispanics who are stopped or searched have \ncommitted no crime.\n  Indeed, racial profiling has an insidious and devastating effect on \nentire communities because it increases the level of mistrust between \nlaw enforcement and the communities it is charged with the heavy burden \nto protect. That result serves no one. It fails to serve law \nenforcement because a critical component of truly effective law \nenforcement is strong community-police relations, partnerships in which \nlaw enforcement and our communities are working together to reduce \ncrime and to make our communities as safe as they can be.\n  Racial profiling fails to serve prosecutors, because law-abiding \npeople who don't have faith that their law enforcement will protect \nthem properly and treat them with dignity will not have faith in law \nenforcement when sitting on juries and assessing the credibility of \npolice officers who often play a key role in getting convictions for \ncriminals.\n  What does this bill do and what doesn't it do?\n  As you, my colleagues consider this legislation, understand that this \nbill is not about blaming law enforcement or saying that law \nenforcement is bad or doesn't do a good job. We know that this is \nsimply not true.\n  Those who uphold our Nation's laws on the streets where we live are \nmen and women of courage. They go to work each day without the same \ndegree of certainty that most of us have that they will return home \nsafely, because they never know when the next traffic stop, the next \ndomestic dispute, the next arrest will explode in their face. There is \na memorial here in Washington with the names of more than 14,000 \nAmerican heroes who gave their lives to make ours a safer country.\n\n  What this bill does do is make very clear that racial profiling is \nwrong and that law enforcement agencies that haven't done so already \nshould adopt policies and procedures to eliminate and prevent racial \nprofiling.\n  Some might ask, how can adopting policies and procedures help stop \nracial profiling? Well, the experts at John Jay College will tell you \nthat in the 1960s and early 1970s, most police departments in this \ncountry left it up to the individual officer to decide when to shoot to \nkill. During that time, the racial disparity among persons shot and \nkilled by police was as high as eight African-Americans for every white \nperson, and very much higher among victims who were neither armed nor \nin the process of assaulting a police officer.\n\n[[Page S5897]]\n\n  During the 1970s and early 1980s, police departments promulgated and \nenforced strict standards, basically decreeing that deadly force could \nbe exercised only in defense of the life of the officer or another \nperson. In the large police departments in this country, these changes \nwere accompanied by reductions of as much as 51 percent in the number \nof civilians killed by police. It also resulted in the significant \nreduction in the number of officers killed in the line of duty. This is \njust one example of how good policies and procedures can actually save \nlives without reducing the effectiveness of law enforcement.\n  Recognizing the importance of policies and procedures to eliminate \nand prevent racial profiling, this bill provides incentives for law \nenforcement to promote such policies by providing grants to state and \nlocal law enforcement agencies to use in ways they believe will be most \neffective for their communities--whether to purchase equipment and \nother resources to assist in data collection or to provide training to \nofficers to improve community relations and build trust.\n  Chief Chamberlin spoke eloquently this morning about the importance \nof training and building relationships between law enforcement and \ncommunities. His actions, however, have spoken even louder than his \nwords. He has taken the lead in Western New York in forming the Law \nEnforcement and Diversity Team or ``LEAD'' program, which exists to \nenhance communication and understanding between suburban law \nenforcement agencies and the diverse citizenry of Western New York. The \nLEAD team, sponsored by the National Conference for Community and \nJustice and the Erie County Chiefs of Police, developed one of the \nNation's leading programs--``Building Bridges'' to start a dialogue \nbetween police officers and people of diverse cultural and racial \nbackgrounds.\n  The U.S. Department of Transportation has utilized excerpts from the \nLEAD Team's ``What to do When Stopped by Police'' brochure for the \ndepartment's national publication. The program has been adopted by the \nBuffalo and Cheektowaga school systems in the curriculum for high \nschools students. It provides an important educational opportunity for \nthe entire community and assists in the development of positive \nrelationships between police and community by eliminating some level of \nfear, distrust, and skepticism.\n  Other New Yorkers have also worked to improve the relationship \nbetween communities and law enforcement. New York's Attorney General, \nElliot Spitzer, has instituted training programs in an effort to try \nand prevent racial profiling. In fact, just this past February through \nApril, the Attorney General's office conducted in-service training of \nall members of the New Rochelle, New York Police Department at the \nrequest of that department. The training took place on Thursday \nmornings and focused, among other things, on what is meant by ``racial \nprofiling'' and the perceptions of community members of police \nencounters in order to raise awareness. The training also reported on \ndata collection efforts taking place across the country and the results \nof those efforts.\n  Academia can also play a role in promoting trust between law \nenforcement and the community. For example, the John Jay College of \nCriminal Justice--whose Master of Public Administration Program was \nranked first in the nation among graduate schools with specializations \nin Criminal Justice Policy and Management by U.S. News and World Report \nfor the second year in a row--has begun to conduct a six-week free \ncourse for members of the New York City Police Department on the racial \nand cultural diversity of New York City. More than 600 police officers \nfrom across New York City have enrolled in a course entitled: ``Police \nSupervision in a Multiracial and Multicultural City.''\n  With this bill, efforts like those currently led by Chief \nChamberlain, Attorney General Spitzer, and John Jay College will be \nexpanded throughout the country.\n  More than a year ago when I spoke about this issue at the Riverside \nChurch in New York City, I said, ``we must all be on the same side.'' I \nam so proud that today--we are all here together--on the same side, \ncitizens, officers of the law, Republicans and Democrats--to say that \nracial profiling is wrong and must end.\n  We are here to say that in fighting racial profiling, we can at the \nsame time forge even better relations between police and the \nneighborhoods they patrol, as we wage a common effort to reduce crime \nand make our communities safe.\n  In closing, I hope that as we move forward with the consideration of \nthis legislation, it will engender a positive and thoughtful dialogue \nbetween and among members of Congress, the President, law enforcement, \nand the civil rights community. And that by eliminating the practice of \nracial profiling, we can begin to restore the bonds of trust between \ncommunities and the law enforcement officers that serve them.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire:\n  S. 990. A bill to amend the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration \nAct to improve the provisions relating to wildlife conservation and \nrestoration programs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \na comprehensive wildlife conservation measure, the American Wildlife \nEnhancement Act of 2001. This bill will help to increase conservation \nefforts by promoting local control and State partnerships through \nflexible, incentive driven conservation programs and increased \npartnerships with local land owners. The true conservationists are \nthose who live on and work the land, and it is my intention to provide \nthe incentives to help them continue those efforts. People don't come \nto New Hampshire for the malls. They come to kayak, bike, fish, swim, \nhunt, hike trails, ski, and more. That's our industry. We cannot, and \nshould not, turn away from that. I believe that when we conserve our \nwildlife and wildlife areas, we affirm our long-standing tradition of \nhonoring our natural American heritage. This bill is about achieving \nthat goal in a cooperative, partnership approach, something that \nunfortunately, the Federal Government has too long neglected.\n  This bill will accomplish these goals by infusing additional funds \ninto the popular Pittman-Robertson program; establishing a new \ncompetitive matching grant fund that would allow private landowners to \napply for assistance to protect endangered and threatened species on \ntheir land; and establishing a new competitive grant fund that would \nallow one or several States to apply for a grant to protect an area of \nregional or national significance through the purchase of an easement \nor acquisition. This measure represents our best, and most effective, \nchances of addressing the growing needs for wildlife conservation in \nour Nation.\n  Title I of this bill authorizes $350 million a year to enhance the \nPittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration program. Unlike the existing \nPittman-Robertson program, which is funded through a tax on hunting \nequipment, the enhanced program would be authorized for a specific time \nperiod, would have to compete for funds through the appropriations \nprocess and would be held in an account that is separate from the \nalready established Wildlife Restoration Fund.\n  Funds for this enhanced program would be distributed to the States \nthrough a formula based on land area and population, with no State \nreceiving less than one percent of the available funding. Projects \neligible for funding through the new program would include: acquisition \nand improvement of wildlife habitat; hunter education; wildlife \npopulation surveys; construction of facilities to improve public \naccess; management of wildlife areas; recreation; conservation \neducation; and facility development and maintenance. States would pay \nfor a project up front and would be reimbursed up to 75 percent of the \ntotal cost of the project. Similar language was included in last year's \nCommerce-State-Justice appropriations measure, but was authorized for \none year, at a level of $50 million. The program has been successful \nsince its inception, and should continue past this fiscal year. My bill \nwould authorize this program for five years at a level of $350 million \neach year.\n  The State of New Hampshire ranks 44th out of 50 States in land area \nand\n\n[[Page S5898]]\n\n41st in population. Still, the State received $487,000 out of the money \nappropriated in last year's Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill. \nIf my bill were enacted and fully appropriated, even a small State like \nNew Hampshire would be eligible to receive $3.5 million. Believe me, \n$3.5 million would make an incredible difference not only for New \nHampshire, but nationwide. There is not only a demonstrated need for \nthese additional funds, but a keen interest in seeing this infusion of \nappropriations within a time-tested program, the Pittman-Robertson \nWildlife Restoration Program, popular with sportsmen and women and \nconservationists alike.\n  The second title of my bill establishes a new competitive matching \ngrant fund that would allow private landowners to apply for assistance \nto protect endangered and threatened species on their land through the \ndevelopment and implementation of recovery agreements. A recovery \nagreement would provide an economic incentive to protect habitat for \nthreatened and endangered species, list specific recovery goals, \nschedule an implementation plan, and monitor the results. In return for \nagreeing to carry out these activities, the landowner would receive \nfinancial compensation. Currently any effort that a private landowner \nundertakes to conserve an endangered species is paid for out-of-pocket. \nUnder this bill though, for the first time, private landowners will be \nable to apply for a grant to assist in the recovery of endangered or \nthreatened species on their property. In other words, they would be \neligible to get compensation for some of the conservation measures that \nthey now have to pay for themselves.\n  That is a big step forward. Since approximately 90-percent of the \nlisted endangered and threatened species inhabit non-federal lands, one \nof the keys to the successful recovery of our endangered and threatened \nspecies is the increased participation of private landowners. This is \nbest achieved through a collaborative, not combative, process that \nprovides landowners with an incentive to participate.\n  This title is an amendment to the Endangered Species Act. This title \nshould not be interpreted as a vehicle for comprehensive reform, but as \na great opportunity to get dollars to those land owners who want to \nprotect species today. I welcome the opportunity to work with all of my \ncolleagues on comprehensive reform to the Endangered Species Act \nthrough hearings, debate and bipartisan legislation. However, in the \nmeantime we need to provide private land owners the opportunity to \nprotect the habitat of endangered species.\n\n  The final title of my bill would establish a new competitive grant \nfund that would allow one or more States to apply for a grant to \nprotect an area of regional or national significance through the \npurchase of an easement or acquisition. Without a source of flexible \nFederal funds such as this, States and local communities alone will be \nunable to protect some of the Nation's most important natural areas. I \nhighlight the Northern Forest that spans the states of New Hampshire, \nMaine, Vermont, and New York; the Central Appalachian Highlands; the \nMississippi Delta, just to name a few. This flexible funding will allow \nStates and communities to protect vital natural, cultural and \nrecreational areas without creating or expanding Federal units. Such a \nfunding program promotes local control and multi-state partnerships, \nand is also cost-effective.\n  I am a firm believer in preserving our national treasures for future \ngenerations to enjoy. I also believe that the States, local communities \nand individual property owners are in the best position to identify and \nprotect the species and areas that are in the greatest need of \nconservation. But they also need financial assistance from the Federal \nGovernment to effectively conserve and manage the natural resources \nthat need either protection or restoration. This belief is strongly \nreflected in my bill.\n  I have received a very positive response for this bill from the \ninterested constituencies, both in New Hampshire and nationwide. In \ngeneral, there is a growing consensus that we must act now or we will \nlose many of our special places, and if we wait, what is destroyed or \nlost will be gone forever. It is our responsibility to act as stewards \nof the environment. I have said it before and I will say it again: it \nis not anti-conservative to be pro-environment.\n  This bill is one that should attract the interest of both sides of \nthe aisle. On that note, I would like to thank Senator Reid, my \ncounterpart on the Environment and Public Works Committee, for his \nleadership on the issue of wildlife conservation. In April, he chaired \na field hearing in Reno, NV, on State wildlife and conservation issues. \nI know he is engaged in this matter, and I look forward to working with \nhim to advance the goals of the American Wildlife Enhancement Act.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the American Wildlife \nEnhancement Act of 2001 and ask that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 990\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the president to award a gold medal on \nbehalf of the Congress to Andrew Jackson Higgins (posthumously), and to \nthe D-day Museum in recognition of the contributions of Higgins \nIndustries and the more than 30,000 employees of Higgins Industries to \nthe Nation and to world peace during World War II; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I speak today to honor an innovative and \npatriotic American, a logger-turned-boatbuilder, who single-handedly \ntransformed the concept of amphibious ship design when our nation and \nher Allies needed it most. Despite some bureaucratic obstacles in \nAmerica's massive World War II war-machine, Andrew Jackson Higgins \nskillfully designed and engineered landing craft, eventually winning \ncontracts to build 92 percent of the Navy's war-time fleet of landing \ncraft. Andrew Jackson Higgins' story exemplifies the American Dream, \nand merits this body's recognition for his ingenuity, assiduous work, \nand devotion to our country.\n  In the late 1930's, Higgins was operating a small New Orleans work-\nboat company, with less than seventy-five employees. He quickly earned \na reputation for fast, dependable work by turning out specialized \nvessels for the oil industry, Coast Guard, Army Corps of Engineers, and \nU.S. Biological Survey. Despite this reputation, when he presented his \nplans for swift amphibious landing crafts, he met hard resistance. The \nU.S. Navy had overestimated French and British abilities to secure \nFrance's ports from German encroachment, and overruled decisions to \ncreate landing boat crafts. When the U.S. Marine Corps finally \nidentified the need for mass production of amphibious vessels for use \nin both the Pacific and European theaters, Marine leadership began to \nlobby the Navy to abandon its internal contracting, and procure ships \nfrom Higgins Industries, which boasted high performance quality and \nunprecedented speed in producing boats. In 1941, the Navy finally asked \nHiggins to begin designing a landing draft to carry tanks. Instead of a \ndesign, Higgins designed, built and delivered a complete working boat. \nIt had only taken 61 hours to design and construct this first Landing \nCraft, Mechanized (LCM). The Navy was so impressed that they awarded \nthe contract and the Higgins firm grew to seven plants, eventually \nturning out 700 boats a month, more than all other shipyards in the \nNation combined. By war's end, Higgins had produced 20,000 boats, \nincluding the 46-foot LCVP, Landing Craft, Vehicle & Personnel, the \nfast-moving PT boats, the rocket-firing landing craft support boats, \nthe 56-foot tank landing craft, the 170 foot freight supply ships and \nthe 27-foot airborne lifeboats that could be dropped from B-17 bombers.\n  Able to conceive various ship designs and mass-produce vessels \nquickly at affordable prices, Higgins not only transformed wartime \nshipbuilding acquisition, but also sustained the universal faith in \nAmerican invention and global power projection. Higgins boats landed on \nthe shores of Normandy on June 6, 1944, 57 years ago today, the key \nenablers in the greatest amphibious assault our world has ever seen. In \naddition to his contributions to Allied war efforts abroad, Higgins' \nmanufacturing further changed the face of my own city of New Orleans, \nhome to most of the firm's business. I urge my colleagues to support \nprovisions to award Andrew Jackson Higgins the Gold Medal of Honor, in \nthe tradition of our great institution.\n  In 1964, President Dwight D. Eisenhower was reflecting on the success \nof the 1944 Normandy invasion to his biographer, Steven Ambrose. He \nremarked that Andrew Jackson Higgins ``is the man who won the war for \nus. If Higgins had not developed and produced those landing craft, we \nnever could have gone in over an open beach. We would have had to \nchange the entire strategy of the war.'' Mr. Higgins and his 20,000-\nmember workforce embody American creativity, persistence, and \npatriotism; they deserve to be recognized for their distinguished place \nin history.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5903]]\n\n                                 S. 991\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) Andrew Jackson Higgins was born on August 28, 1886, in \n     Columbus, Nebraska, moved to New Orleans in 1910, and formed \n     Higgins Industries on September 26, 1930;\n       (2) Andrew Jackson Higgins designed, engineered, and \n     produced the ``Eureka'', a unique shallow draft boat, the \n     design of which evolved during World War II into 2 basic \n     classes of military craft, high speed PT boats, and types of \n     Higgins landing craft (LCPs, LCPLs, LCVPs, LCMs and LCSs);\n       (3) Andrew Jackson Higgins designed, engineered, and \n     constructed 4 major assembly line plants in New Orleans for \n     mass production of Higgins landing craft, and other vessels \n     vital to the Allied Forces' conduct of World War II;\n       (4) Andrew Jackson Higgins bought the entire 1940 \n     Philippine mahogany crop and other material purely at risk \n     without a Government contract, anticipating that America \n     would join World War II and that Higgins Industries would \n     need the wood to build landing craft, and Higgins also bought \n     steel, engines, and other material necessary to construct \n     landing craft;\n       (5) Andrew Jackson Higgins, through Higgins Industries, \n     employed a fully integrated assembly line work force, black \n     and white, male and female, of up to 30,000 during World War \n     II, with equal pay for equal work;\n       (6) in 1939, the United States Navy had a total of 18 \n     landing craft in the fleet;\n       (7) from November 18, 1940, when Higgins Industries was \n     awarded its first contract for Higgins landing craft until \n     the conclusion of the war, the employees of Higgins \n     Industries produced 12,300 Landing Craft Vehicle Personnel \n     (LCVP's) and nearly 8,000 other landing craft of all types;\n       (8) during World War II, Higgins Industries employees \n     produced 20,094 boats, including landing craft and Patrol \n     Torpedo boats, and trained 30,000 Navy, Marine, and Coast \n     Guard personnel on the safe operation of landing craft at the \n     Higgins' Boat Operators School;\n       (9) on Thanksgiving Day 1944, General Dwight D. Eisenhower \n     stated in an address to the Nation, ``Let us thank God for \n     Higgins Industries, management, and labor which has given us \n     the landing boats with which to conduct our campaign.'';\n       (10) Higgins landing craft, constructed of wood and steel, \n     transported fully armed troops, light tanks, field artillery, \n     and other mechanized equipment essential to amphibious \n     operations;\n       (11) Higgins landing craft made the amphibious assault on \n     D-day and the landings at Leyte, North Africa, Guadalcanal, \n     Sicily, Iwo Jima, Tarawa, Guam, and thousands of less well-\n     known assaults possible;\n       (12) Captain R.R.M. Emmett, a commander at the North Africa \n     amphibious landing, and later commandant of the Great Lakes \n     Training Station, wrote during the war, ``When the history of \n     this war is finally written by historians, far enough removed \n     from its present turmoil and clamor to be cool and impartial, \n     I predict that they will place Mr. (Andrew Jackson) Higgins \n     very high on the list of those who deserve the commendation \n     and gratitude of all citizens.''; and\n       (13) in 1964, President Dwight D. Eisenhower told historian \n     Steven Ambrose, ``He (Higgins) is the man who won the war for \n     us. If Higgins had not developed and produced those landing \n     craft, we never could have gone in over an open beach. We \n     would have had to change the entire strategy of the war.''.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe provision taxing policy holder dividends of mutual life insurance \ncompanies and to repeal the policyholders surplus account provisions; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to simplify \nthe taxation of life insurance companies, along with Senator Conrad and \nseveral of our colleagues.\n  Our legislation repeals section 809 and section 815 of the Internal \nRevenue Code. Due to significant changes in the life insurance industry \nand their taxation over the years, these provisions are no longer \nrelevant and their repeal will simplify the tax code.\n  Section 809 was enacted in 1984 as part of an overhaul of the \ntaxation of life insurance companies. At the time, mutual life \ninsurance companies were thought to be the dominant segment of the \nindustry, and Congress sought to ensure that stock life insurance \ncompanies were not competitively disadvantaged. However, today, mutual \nlife insurance companies comprise only about ten percent of the \nindustry. Section 809 raises little revenue, but is very complex and \nburdensome. Since the reason for its enactment no longer exists, our \nbill repeals it.\n  Section 815 has an even longer history, dating back to 1959. Tax \nchanges in 1959 created an accounting mechanism called a \n``policyholders surplus account'' for stock life insurance companies. \nThese companies were allowed to defer tax on one-half of their \nunderwriting income so long as it was not distributed to shareholders. \nThis income was accounted for through the policyholder surplus account. \nIn 1984, Congress eliminated the deferral of income, but they did not \naddress the issue of the policyholder surplus accounts. The amounts in \nthose accounts remain subject to tax if certain triggering events \noccur. Since no company is willing to ``trigger'' the account, this \nprovision also raises little or no revenue, but it directly inhibits \nbusiness decisions of these companies. Our bill would also repeal this \nprovision.\n  Congress has worked hard over the last few years to modernize laws \ngoverning the financial services industry to encourage its growth and \nenhance its competitiveness. Elimination of these old, complicated tax \nprovisions will complement this effort and provide greater certainty to \nthe taxation of these companies.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in this initiative.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CARNAHAN (for herself and Mr. Bond):\n  S. 993. A bill to extend for 4 additional months the period for which \nchapter 12 of title 11, United States Code, is reenacted; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN.

Res. 106\n\n       Whereas 40 percent of children who live in fatherless \n     households have not seen their fathers in at least 1 year, \n     and 50 percent of the children have never visited their \n     fathers' homes;\n       Whereas approximately 50 percent of all children born in \n     the United States spend at least \\1/2\\ of their childhood in \n     families without father figures;\n       Whereas nearly 20 percent of children in grades 6 through \n     12 report that they have not had a meaningful conversation \n     with even 1 parent in more than 1 month;\n       Whereas 3 out of 4 adolescents report that they do not have \n     adults in their lives that model positive behaviors;\n       Whereas many of the leading experts on family and child \n     development in the United States agree that it is in the best \n     interest of both children and the United States to encourage \n     more 2-parent, father-involved families;\n       Whereas it is important to promote responsible fatherhood \n     and encourage loving and healthy relationships between \n     parents and their children in order to increase the chance \n     that children will have 2 caring parents to help them grow up \n     healthy and secure and not to--\n       (1) denigrate the standing or parenting efforts of single \n     mothers, whose efforts are heroic;\n       (2) lessen the protection of children from abusive parents;\n       (3) cause women to remain in or enter into abusive \n     relationships; or\n       (4) compromise the health or safety of a custodial parent;\n       Whereas children who are apart from their biological \n     fathers are, in comparison to other children--\n       (1) 5 times more likely to live in poverty;\n       (2) more likely to be abused; and\n       (3) more likely to--\n       (A) bring weapons and drugs into the classroom;\n       (B) commit crime;\n       (C) drop out of school;\n       (D) commit suicide;\n       (E) abuse alcohol or drugs; and\n       (F) become pregnant as teenagers;\n       Whereas the Federal Government spends billions of dollars \n     to address these social ills and very little to address the \n     causes of such social ills;\n       Whereas millions of single mothers in the United States are \n     heroically struggling to raise their children in safe, loving \n     environments;\n       Whereas millions of men do act responsibly and could serve \n     as role models for absent fathers;\n       Whereas responsible fatherhood should always recognize and \n     promote values of nonviolence;\n       Whereas child support is an important means by which a \n     parent can take financial responsibility for a child, and \n     emotional support is an important means by which a parent can \n     take social responsibility for a child;\n       Whereas children learn by example, and community programs \n     that help mold young men into positive role models for their \n     children need to be encouraged; and\n       Whereas Congress has begun to take notice of this issue \n     with legislation introduced in both the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate to address the epidemic of \n     absent fathers: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates Father's Day 2001, as ``National Responsible \n     Father's Day'';\n       (2) recognizes the need to encourage active involvement of \n     fathers in the rearing and development of their children;\n       (3) recognizes that while there are millions of fathers who \n     serve as a wonderful caring parent for their children, there \n     are children on Father's Day who will have no one to \n     celebrate with;\n       (4) urges fathers to participate in their children's lives, \n     both financially and emotionally;\n       (5) encourages fathers to devote time, energy, and \n     resources to their children;\n       (6) urges fathers to understand the level of responsibility \n     required when fathering a child and to fulfill that \n     responsibility;\n       (7) is committed to assisting absent fathers to become more \n     responsible and engaged in their children's lives;\n       (8) calls upon fathers around the country to use the day to \n     reconnect and rededicate themselves to their children's \n     lives, to spend ``National Responsible Father's Day'' with \n     their children, and to express their love and support for \n     their children;

For the information of all Senators, the Senate will \nconvene on Thursday, June 7, at 9:30 a.m. and resume consideration of \nthe ESEA bill with a rollcall vote in relation to the Nelson-Carnahan \namendment at approximately 11:30. Additional rollcall votes are \nexpected throughout the day on Thursday.\n  Mr. REID. Will the distinguished majority leader yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding the majority leader is going to have \na 20-minute time limit on the casting of votes in the Senate. Is that a \nfair statement?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, this has been a constant lament of both \nSenator Lott and myself. He has attempted to address it on occasion. I \nhave always been supportive of the effort, to try to be as managerial \nwith these votes as we can be. He and I have talked about it as \nrecently as just prior to the break.\n  My intent, in answer to the Senator from Nevada, is to do all that we \ncan to terminate the vote at the end of 20 minutes. I think that is \nample time. If we are going to be efficient in the use of our time, we \ncannot allow these votes to drag on. This has been a source of \nincreasing concern to me personally. So we will do our utmost--in fact, \nI will ask that the votes be terminated at the end of 20 minutes.\n  I hope Senators can be made aware that will be the policy and we will \nimplement it. If there is an emergency, we can accommodate that. But I \nalso will attempt to impose some discipline with regard to the votes. \nWe will attempt to implement that beginning tomorrow. I put all \nSenators on notice in that regard.\n  Let me also say I have discussed the schedule with Senator Lott with \nregard to both Friday and Monday. I know that there were a number of \nSenators who indicated they had conflicts of some consequence on \nFriday. Because, as I understand it, some consideration had already \nbeen given to those conflicts, I want to respect the decisions made \nwith respect to that consideration. And so in keeping with my \nunderstanding of the conversations the Republican leader had with some \nof our colleagues, there will be no votes on Friday.\n  It is my intention, however, to be in session on Monday and to at \nleast have one, if not more, votes beginning at 5:30. So there will be \nvotes on Monday; no votes on Friday.\n  I hope we could respect the agreement Senator Lott and I had with \nregard to votes on Fridays and Mondays through the month of June. We \nlaid out a calendar that we expected both of our caucuses to \nappreciate. I am not going to divert from that. I will respect the days \nthat were committed to with regard to concerns raised about schedule \nwith our colleagues. But I will also insist, on those days that are not \non that list, that we have votes Fridays and Mondays.\n  We have to finish the elementary and secondary education bill next \nweek. We will stay for whatever length of time it takes to finish our \nwork. We have been on it now for several weeks. Senator Lott has been \naccommodating in his effort to address the issues of schedule raised by \ncolleagues, but I think next week we must culminate our work with a \ncompletion of the bill and a vote on final passage.\n  So that will be the schedule next week. Votes on Monday, votes \nthroughout the week, with an expectation that we will not complete the \nweek until the bill has been finished. We will have additional comment \nabout the schedule on Monday at a later date.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/06/senate-section/article/S5905-5", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
