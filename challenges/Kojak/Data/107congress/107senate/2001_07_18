The Senate may also consider several Executive Calendar \nnominations after we finish energy and water.\n  We have had good bipartisan activity in the Senate in recent days. We \nhave worked our way through some difficult bills. Senator Stevens and \nSenator Byrd worked through the contentious supplemental appropriations \nbill, and Senator Burns and Senator Byrd, again, worked through the \nInterior appropriations bill. We are now on the energy and water bill. \nLast week we cleared almost 60 nominations. When we finish the energy \nand water appropriations bill today, whatever time that might be, we \nare going to go to the nomination that has an assigned time, the \nnomination of John Graham. It is a contentious issue. When we finish \nthat item, we will go to the Transportation appropriations bill.\n  I hope all Members work together. As Senator Daschle and I talked \nlast night, these appropriations bills don't belong to the Democrats or \nthe Republicans. They are ours. The President is leaving for Europe \ntoday for a very important set of meetings. He needs these \nappropriations bills as much as anybody in the country, if not more.\n  I hope we will have people offering amendments. Yesterday we had one \namendment offered. That was accepted by the managers of the bill. We \nneed to move forward. I hope we can do that today around 10:30.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/18/senate-section/article/S7831-7", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I will take a few minutes to talk about Paul\n\n[[Page S7832]]\n\nCoverdell. There were a number of occasions in Washington, and once at \nthe Democratic National Convention in Chicago, that someone walked up \nto me and said: Senator Coverdell.\n  Now, I always pictured myself as more of a Robert Redford type--that \nis what I expect to see in the mirror, but it never turns out that way. \nFactually, I am not the Paul Coverdell type, not a real big bruiser of \na person. I guess that is why, perhaps, Paul Coverdell and I got along \nso well. We were a lot alike. When we think of the great orators of the \nSenate, Daniel Webster and Everett Dirksen, we don't think of Paul \nCoverdell. But when we think of those Senators who were able to get \nthings done, he was one of those. That is why when Senator Lott had a \ndifficult legislative and dangerous assignment on the Senate floor, we \nwould see Paul Coverdell.\n  He was almost a shy man. He was not boisterous, loud, or aggressive \nin his actions, but he was effective in his actions. I spent lots of \ntime on the Senate floor trying to work issues out with him. When we \nhad the bankruptcy bill or the education bill, with scores of \namendments, he and I would try to work through them, trying to move the \nlegislation along.\n  Paul and I worked on many difficult pieces of legislation together. \nWe spent a lot of time trying to hammer out differences on bills. We \nrarely had differences. We were not as much interested in the substance \nas procedure, moving things along. We began negotiations knowing we \nwere confident we could help move things along.\n  Senator Coverdell believed we could civilly and respectfully discuss \nopposing points of view, which, after all, is what the Founding Fathers \nenvisioned when they saw the Senate. Paul Coverdell was in the best \ntradition of the Senate, someone who believed in legislation, \nrecognized that legislation was the art of compromise, legislation was \nconsensus building. He was a very graceful man without being forceful. \nHe was confident and determined without being obnoxious and \ncondescending. Maybe that is because he knew what it was like to be in \nthe minority, having been the Republican leader in Georgia when the \nSenate Republicans numbered 5 and the Democrats numbered 51.\n  Senator Coverdell's evenhanded touch, no question, was the reason \nSenator Lott and Republican leadership depended on him time and time \nagain to help them work their way out of difficult situations. The \nDemocrats who knew Paul Coverdell best had the highest regard for him. \nI spent a lot of time with him. That is why I was flattered and honored \nwhen I received a call from Phil Gramm asking if I would be one of the \nDemocratic Senators--there are two of us, Zell Miller and me--to meet \nwith Phil Gramm and Senator DeWine to talk about things we could do to \nrecognize the service of this very fine man.\n  I was flattered and have appreciated being involved in the group. We \nhave done some things to recognize Paul Coverdell: the Peace Corps \nbuilding, a facility in Georgia. But those Democrats who have worked \nwith Paul Coverdell on the State and Federal level know what a good \nperson he was. Senator Zell Miller had so much confidence in Paul \nCoverdell's judgment that Paul Coverdell's chief of staff is Zell \nMiller's chief of staff.\n  I miss Paul Coverdell. He wasn't somebody with whom I socialized. We \ndidn't go out to ball games together or movies or dinner, but we spent \na lot of time being Senators together. I will always remember the \nservice of that shy, somewhat reserved man, the Senator from Georgia, \nPaul Coverdell.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and celebrate the life \nof a dear friend, the late, able Senator Paul Coverdell of Georgia. I \nam pleased to see in the Chamber this morning his successor, an \noutstanding Senator, Zell Miller. I appreciate the courtesy that he \nwould allow me to speak first this morning as we remember this dear \nfriend. I thank Senator Miller and Senator Reid, Senator Gramm, and \nSenator DeWine who have been involved in trying to find a fitting \ntribute to the memory of this outstanding public servant.\n  Just last night legislation was sent to the White House for the \nPresident's signature that will name the Peace Corps Headquarters the \nPaul D. Coverdell Peace Corps Headquarters. I know this and other \nefforts are being made both here and in Georgia to appropriately \nrecognize the service that Paul rendered to his State and to our \ncountry, and to do it in a way that does not involve a scattergun \napproach but accomplishes that which would really mean an awful lot to \nPaul if he were here.\n  The Senate still grieves and mourns the passing of one of its most \ntalented Members. I certainly feel his absence every day. I think about \nhim an awful lot. After decades in Washington, I know how rare it is to \nfind a Senator or Congressman who works equally well with individuals \non both sides of the aisle. In fact, in many ways he always reminded me \nof Senator Reid of Nevada, and they worked together very closely: \nSomewhat reserved, understated, but tremendously effective--both of \nthem--in the way they dealt with legislation, how hard they worked, and \nhow they dealt with their fellow man and woman and how they dealt with \ntheir colleagues in the Senate.\n  Paul had a deep sense of humility, tireless spirit, and ready humor. \nIn fact, whenever I think of him, I always smile, not only in \nappreciation for what he did but the meetings we had almost always \nended with a laugh because I liked to pick at him, actually. As many \npeople recall, I even had a nickname for him because as a Senator and \nas a member of our leadership--actually after only having been in the \nSenate for 4 years he was elected to the Republican leadership--we kind \nof had a rule that if there was a job to be done that no other leader \nwanted to do, we could always call on Paul. He reminded me of the \ncommercial about the little boy named Mikey. The other kids wouldn't \neat the cereal and they would shove it over to Mikey; and say, ``Give \nit to Mikey, he'll try anything.'' Well, I called him Mikey because I \nknew he would try anything and he would do it with great spirit and \nenthusiasm. That is the kind of utility player he was. That is the kind \nof commitment, that is the kind of willingness to work and do the jobs \nthat other Senators would not do that makes this place really function \nthe way it should.\n  Paul was a Senator and legislator in Georgia, but he was from \nMissouri where he received a journalism degree. I guess that served him \nwell. He joined the Army and left as a captain in the early 1960s. I \nnever thought of Paul as being an infantryman, but maybe that is really \nwhat he was. He was on the line, doing the heavy duty every day. He \nhelped run his family's small business when his father's health failed. \nHe soon turned that small business into a very successful marketing \nfirm, Coverdell & Co.\n  Paul was always compelled to want to serve others, going back to \nearly activity in government and activities in Georgia. He was elected \nto the Georgia State Senate as a Republican in 1970, at a time when \nmost Georgians had not even seen a live Republican. But there he was, \nand he was in the legislature in the Senate. And his peers elected him \nthe Senate minority leader, a position he held for the next 15 years. \nOf course, there were only three Republicans. So there was the leader, \nthe whip, and the whipee, I guess. At least Paul was not the whipee. He \ngot to be the leader. He did a lot to make the Republican Party \ncredible in Georgia. But beyond that--I am sure Senator Miller will \nremember this--he learned there to work across the aisle. When you are \nin those small numbers, you have to, to survive. But he became a major \nplayer in the legislature even in those limited numbers.\n  In 1989, he entered the national political stage when he became \nDirector of the Peace Corps under President George H.W. Bush, where he \nworked for 2 years. I remember I used to harass him about that, too. He \nparticularly worked with emerging democracies in Eastern Europe. But he \nhad a vision for the Peace Corps, too.\n\n[[Page S7833]]\n\n  That this small guy from a small town in Missouri, and a Georgian who \nserved in the Army, then wound up with a world vision was quite an \nachievement.\n  Paul had fundamental beliefs in America, the great Republic. He \nbelieved in free trade, free markets, and freedom for all the \ncitizens--not only for the people of his State but people around the \nworld. He worked at making it available and accessible to everybody \nevery day.\n  He spent a lot of time in the Senate working on education. He was \ninnovative from the beginning. He was one of the early ones talking \nabout the need for some flexibility in how funds are used in education. \nHe worked across the aisle to help solve that problem.\n  He was really committed to allowing parents of children in elementary \nand secondary education to have some way to be able to help their \nchildren. That is what I like to call the Coverdell savings accounts. \nHe had a broad base of support for that.\n  He was very aggressive in seeking safe and drug-free havens for \nlearning in our schools.\n  I met him way back in the 1970s when I made trips into Georgia, and I \nalways appreciated his tenacity and the work he did there. But I really \nwill miss him the most in our leadership because I came to rely on him \nso much.\n  Some people have written about, yes, one of the majority leader's key \nplayers and that he misses him. I don't deny it for a minute. In life, \nyou lose friends and you see good men and good women pass on. You \nmourn. You learn lessons from working with those people, and then you \nfind others who try to fill the void. But in some respects, you never \nfill the void left by a person such as Paul Coverdell. He was loyal. He \nwas sensitive. He really cared. He made a difference in his State, in \nour party, in the Senate, and in our country.\n  So I think it is appropriate today that we honor his memory, after \nhaving lost him 1 year ago, and to celebrate the things he did to make \nit a better place for all of us to live and learn.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished Republican \nleader for his eloquence and for his heartfelt expressions of fond \nremembrances of a very special U.S. Senator. Those of us who watched \nthe relationship flourish over the years as we served in the Senate are \nreminded again today of the friendship and joy Senator Lott and Senator \nCoverdell had. It was a rare friendship, a special friendship, one that \nwas evident to all of us as we watched and as they worked.\n  So it comes as no surprise that Senator Lott would be the first on \nthe floor today to talk about a man about whom he cared deeply. While \nwe were not as close and did not enjoy that wonderful proximity in \nfriendship, we certainly had a great deal of admiration for the Senator \nfrom Georgia. It was 1 year ago that we were stunned and saddened by \nthe sudden death of our colleague. On that day, we lost not only a \nfriend but, as Senator Lott noted, a gifted leader.\n  A while back, I came across the story of a hot Saturday he spent at a \ncounty fair in north Georgia. Despite the casual setting, he was \nwearing a coat and tie. When a long-time aide asked him why, Senator \nCoverdell responded, ``Well, I've noticed that if there's ever any kind \nof emergency and people are trying to figure out what to do, they \nalways go to the guy with the tie on.''\n  A year after his death, we still miss being able to go to Paul \nCoverdell.\n  Although Paul and I didn't see eye to eye on a lot of matters, I \ncan't think of a single time that he was not fair, that he was not \ndecent, that he was not honest. He was a reminder to all that we can \ndisagree without being disagreeable.\n  While I may not have agreed with him on every detail, I never \nquestioned his deep commitment to the people of Georgia and the \nprinciples that he and we hold dear.\n  One of the principles in which Paul Coverdell believed most deeply, \nof course, was the right of every child to go to a good school. So it \nis fitting that we are creating a living tribute to him by seeing to it \nthat the educational accounts for which he fought so hard will now bear \nhis name.\n  There is another way in which Paul Coverdell's spirit of kindness, \nfairness, and bipartisanship live on today in the Senate. That is the \nwork of his fellow Georgians, Zell Miller and Max Cleland.\n  In the final years of his life, I am told that Senator Coverdell \ndeveloped a passion for gardening as well. I think that is entirely \nfitting because so much of his work in public life was about nurturing \nand about helping things grow. That was evident in his leadership of \nthe Peace Corps and in his commitment to educational opportunity. These \neducational savings accounts, which now will bear his name, will help \nensure that the seeds he planted continue to take root and his work \ncontinues to blossom.\n  We miss him, and we thank him for his public service.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I may ask the Senator from Georgia and \nothers to allow 1 minute to follow up on what Senator Daschle \nmentioned, we have an agreement on this initiative. I thank Senator \nDaschle for his comments and for doing this. This is the kind of thing \nthat brings us together in many possible ways.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/18/senate-section/article/S7833-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7833-S7834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COVERDELL EDUCATION SAVINGS ACCOUNTS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the time allotted \nfor the remembrances for Senator Coverdell be extended for an \nadditional 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, at a time in my personal life when I am \nfeeling the pain of the loss of a family member, I reflect upon the 1 \nyear which has passed since the loss of a member of our Senate family, \nPaul Coverdell.\n  As frequently happens in politics, I first met Paul as an adversary. \nA good friend of mine, who came to the Senate at the same time I did in \n1986, Senator Wyche Fowler, had become embroiled in an unusual runoff \nelection in the fall of 1992. Georgia had a provision, which I \nunderstand has subsequently been revised, that unless a candidate \nreceived an absolute majority in the general election in November, then \nthere was a runoff between the two highest candidates.\n  Senator Fowler had narrowly failed to get the majority vote and was \nin a runoff with Paul Coverdell. A number of colleagues went to Georgia \nto help Senator Fowler in his campaign. It was in those circumstances \nthat I first met Paul.\n  There has always been somewhat of a special tension between Georgia \nand Florida, going back at least to the Revolutionary War, where \nFlorida remained loyal to George III and provided troops to fight \nagainst the rebels from Georgia who were supporting the new \nrevolutionary government that was to become the United States of \nAmerica.\n  More recently, in the 1930s, the then-Governor of Georgia came to \nJacksonville to give a speech about how good things were in Georgia in \nthe middle of the Depression. At the end of the speech, one of the \nJacksonville members of the audience asked Governor Talmadge: If things \nare going so well in Georgia, why is it that so many Georgians are \nmoving to Florida? To which the Governor's response was: We like it; \nevery time it happens, it raises the IQ level of both States. So that \ndescribes the nature of the special relationship between our States, \nwhich continues now with the close friendships that exist between \nSenator Nelson and myself and Senator Cleland and our newest colleague, \nSenator Zell Miller, as it did with Senator Coverdell.\n  I came to know Paul as a friend in his too short Senate career. In \nevery sense of the word, Paul Coverdell was a gentleman. He was a man \nwho had strong personal views and a wide array of characteristics to \nput those views into effect. But he always did so with a graciousness \nand a politeness and a respect for others.\n  Paul Coverdell was a man who cared about using Government as a means \nto improve the lives of the people that he represented and the people \nof the United States of America.\n  As has been previously indicated, education was his passion. I \npersonally had the opportunity to work with Senator Coverdell on a \nnumber of education issues, including how to make higher education more \naffordable, by providing a means through which families could begin to \nprepare to finance the cost of college, and to provide school districts \nwith a wider array of means by which they could finance school \nconstruction. Those are examples of the creativity that Paul brought to \nhis senatorial service.\n  Paul Coverdell was a strong Republican. As indicated, he came to the \nGeorgia Legislature when they were few in number. He helped build the \nRepublican Party in that State. But he always operated with a clear \nunderstanding of the importance that if you were to build sustaining \npublic support for your idea, it would emerge from the roots of \nbipartisanship. So he reached out across the aisle to explain, \nadvocate, and bring to his causes Members of both political parties.\n  Paul Coverdell has been and will be missed but he leaves a proud \nlegacy, a legacy added to today with the naming of a portion of the \nInternal Revenue Code, for which he was particularly responsible, in \nhis honor, as well as the naming of the Peace Corps offices in his \nhonor. These are appropriate recognition of a proud and distinguished \npublic career, which we, on the 1-year anniversary of his being taken \nfrom us, recognize and honor.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, my grandmother used to say as long as \nanybody remembers you, you are not dead. We are proving today that my \ngrandmother was right, as I suspect she was on so many things, that \nPaul Coverdell is not dead. In fact, as long as I live I am going to \nremember Paul Coverdell. Who could forget a person as thoroughly \nlovable as Paul Coverdell?\n  It was my great honor to work under the leadership of Zell Miller and \nto work with Mike DeWine and Harry Reid in trying to come up with a way \nto properly honor Paul Coverdell. We put together a bill introduced by \nSenator Lott. I was proud to introduce it with him and Senator Miller. \nThe bill had two major features: first, it named the headquarters of \nthe Peace Corps in Washington after Paul Coverdell, who was proud \nthroughout his life to have served as one of the great Directors of the \nPeace Corps; and, secondly, it created an authorization to fund the \nPaul Coverdell Building for Biomedical and Health Sciences at the \nUniversity of Georgia.\n  Senator Miller and I had the honor of going to the University of \nGeorgia, meeting with the university president, the provost, and Nancy \nCoverdell, and going to the site to look at the plans, and we decided \nthat there was no better way to honor Paul Coverdell than to build this \ngreat edifice and to name it after Paul Coverdell. It is not just a \nbeautiful building, but a building that will be alive with bioscience \nresearch, and will contribute not just to Georgia but to America and to \nthe world.\n  I am proud to say that we adopted that bill in the Senate in February \nand yesterday it was adopted in the House. It will go to the President \nand be signed.\n  The headquarters here in Washington of the Peace Corps will be named \nafter Paul. We have authorized the building of this major research \nfacility in Georgia. I would like to remind my colleagues who do not \nremember the debate on the original bill, that we are going to put up \n$10 million at the Federal level; the State is going to match that \nmoney; and the University of Georgia is going to provide the bulk of \nthe funding.\n  The State of Georgia has already acted in providing the money. The \nuniversity is out raising their part of the money. When we come to the \nproper appropriations bill this year, we will complete our action in \nterms of providing this most significant honor. We added to the honors \nthat Paul Coverdell's work bestowed on his life today when we named the \neducation savings accounts that were part of our tax bill after Paul \nCoverdell.\n  I still see evidence every day of Paul's good work. As many of you \nwill remember, he was very active in forensic sciences and providing \nfunding for\n\n[[Page S7835]]\n\nthe States. We authorized a bill which is now named after him, \nproviding $512 million to get rid of this backlog we have all over the \ncountry with DNA evidence, to modernize our State labs, and to build a \nnational DNA database. Senator Byrd named the classroom building at the \nLaw Enforcement Training Center in Georgia after Paul. And Paul's work \non teacher liability and volunteer liability is still very much debated \nin Congress, and I am convinced will eventually become the law of the \nland.\n  So a year after Paul Coverdell's death, his stature continues to grow \nin the Senate. He is still fondly remembered by his colleagues. I do \nnot think we will soon be forgetting Paul Coverdell. His gentleness \nreminds us all as to how we should behave. I feel blessed that I had \nthe opportunity to get to know and to work with Paul Coverdell.\n  Let me conclude by thanking Zell Miller for his leadership on these \nefforts to properly honor Paul. I think Paul would be proud of what we \nhave done. I think the investments we have made in honoring him will \nyield a good return to the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, in a culture and in an institution \nwhere the word ``friendship'' is used so casually that it often has \nlittle meaning, it is difficult to express on this anniversary of Paul \nCoverdell's death what he meant to each of us and the nature of our \nrelationships with him. I am left with few words other than to simply \nclaim that he was a friend, a friend that I admired.\n  I rise today in recognition of his loss because of the injustice of \nit, and that all of us probably recognize that as much as Paul did, it \nwas but a downpayment on what his life was to be.\n  This is not a man who had made his final contribution. His life had \nnot run its real course. Paul Coverdell was an enormously talented man. \nHe was a very good man.\n  From almost the moment I joined this institution, I came to know Paul \nand work with him on a very close basis, unlike, perhaps, the \nrelationship I have had with many or maybe all Members of the other \nparty. We fought together for education savings accounts and we failed \nfor years. But it is the best thing I could say about Paul Coverdell, \nthat every time we failed on the education savings accounts, he took \nout his piece of paper, he worked the list again, and we came back.\n  Few may ever remember that indeed the massive tax reduction plans \nvoted upon and passed by the Congress this year closely resembled the \ntax plan that Paul Coverdell introduced in 2000 in the midst of the \nPresidential campaign. I joined with him in that effort. I believe they \nbecame an inspiration for what President Bush later proposed himself. \nThis was a creative man.\n  History is filled with what might have been. It is enough for Paul \nCoverdell's family to live with the notion that he made a great \ncontribution and was a good and decent man, but in truth, many of us \nwill always wonder, had his life lived its natural course, the \nleadership positions he would have filled and the contributions he \nmight have made.\n  Life was finished with Paul Coverdell, but he was not finished with \nlife.\n  I, like Phil Gramm, believe it is still special that all of us \nremember him. In that way, he never dies. It also leaves us, in an \ninstitution where humility is so rare, to remember that no matter what \ntitles we give to each other, no matter how powerful the institutions \nmight be in our own minds that we build, we are all ultimately so \npowerless in this life of ours.\n  Paul Coverdell, you were a good man. Wherever you are, we remember \nyou. We thank you. Generations of Americans who may never know your \nname--because, indeed, history will never have a chance to truly record \nall that you might have done--will live better lives because of the \nall-too-brief life that you lived yourself.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues and those who loved \nPaul so much for their moving and heartfelt remarks this morning.\n  We find it hard to believe that a year has passed since our friend \nand colleague, Senator Paul Coverdell, died so very unexpectedly. I \nremember that day vividly. I was at home in Young Harris. When I heard \nit, I immediately turned on the television, and I watched many in this \nChamber, in tears and in disbelief, pour out their hearts in tribute to \nthis good man and this great public servant.\n  I will never forget one of the things Senator Gramm said about that \nfrail body that had within it the heart of a lion. That described Paul \nCoverdell so very well.\n  The shock and the sadness I felt on that day a year ago remain with \nme until this day. Georgia, and America, lost one of its greatest \npublic servants in Paul Coverdell--as has been said, a decent, soft-\nspoken workhorse who was always there and who always put people first \nand politics second. In a public career spanning more than three \ndecades, from the Georgia Senate, where I served with him for 12 years \nand knew him so well, to the Peace Corps, and then the U.S. Senate, in \nall of those positions, Paul served with great dignity. He served with \ngreat ability, and he earned the respect of everybody who knew him or \nsaw him or watched him along the way.\n  I also will never forget sitting up there in that gallery a year ago \non the morning that I was to be sworn in as Senator Coverdell's \nsuccessor. Once again, I listened to the overwhelming outpouring of \nlove and tears for Paul. The heartfelt sentiment and the high praise \nfrom this Chamber were a tremendously moving tribute to one of \nGeorgia's finest sons. I had never felt so inadequate in my life. Here \nI was. How in the world was I ever, even in the most remote way, going \nto come anywhere close to filling those shoes? The Lord knows, I have \ntried.\n  Immediately upon Senator Coverdell's death, folks in Washington and \nin Georgia began to think how we could remember this great Georgian in \na worthy and enduring way. In a bipartisan fashion befitting Senator \nCoverdell, Senator Lott appointed two Republicans, Senators Gramm of \nTexas and DeWine, and two Democrats, Senator Reid and myself, to sort \nthrough the many good ideas for memorializing Paul. They have been \nmentioned this morning already on the floor. I will not go into them. \nWe wanted to make sure that whatever we decided on was fitting and, \nvery importantly, that it was something of which Nancy Coverdell would \napprove.\n  We thought one very important way to honor Paul's commitment to \neducation, research, and agriculture in a grand way was at the State's \nflagship school in Athens, the University of Georgia. The Paul D. \nCoverdell Building for Biomedical and Health Sciences will be a $40 \nmillion state-of-the-art science center where scientists from different \nfields will collaborate under one roof to improve our food supply, \nclean up our environment, and find cures for disease. It is a joint \nproject, as Senator Gramm mentioned, with the university itself raising \n$20 million, the State of Georgia appropriating $10 million, and the \nFederal Government providing the remaining $10 million.\n  I am pleased that the bill authorizing Congress to approve this \nmemorial for Senator Coverdell has been passed in the Senate and in the \nHouse, and the President is expected to sign it next week. It is our \nhope that the scientists who gather in this center named for Senator \nCoverdell will do great things and will make discoveries that will \nimprove people's lives in Georgia and around the world for years to \ncome.\n  A day does not go by that I don't think of Paul Coverdell. And I \nremain honored and humbled to have succeeded such a great man in the \nSenate. I believe in life after death. I believe in a loving Heavenly \nFather. And I believe that Paul is up there watching what we do, \nwatching what I do. That is why I try every day to live up to the high \nstandards of dignity and integrity and bipartisanship that were the \nhallmarks of Paul Coverdell's distinguished career.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, when I was preparing for this morning's \ntribute, I could not help but reflect on the year that has passed since \nthe untimely departure of our friend and colleague, Paul Coverdell.\n  What a year this has been--and what he would have made of it all.\n  We used to joke that the Senate schedule had become ``All Coverdell,\n\n[[Page S7836]]\n\nall the time,'' because his fingerprints were everywhere: education, \ntax reform, fighting for peace, standing for freedom.\n  It was my privilege to work with him on the Republican leadership \nteam, and to see firsthand that phenomenal energy that kept him working \nbehind the scenes long after the Senate had shut down for the night or \nbefore it convened. Descriptions of him nearly always include the word \n``workhorse''--and that is a name he certainly earned over and over. He \nwas an idea generator with a boundless enthusiasm for public service \nand a willingness to undertake any chore, no matter how thankless, to \nmove the agenda forward.\n  He would have relished the many challenges that our party has faced \nover the past year, because he was a loyal partisan. Years ago, when he \nwas one of only four Republicans in the Georgia State Senate, he took \non the task of rebuilding the State's Republican Party. Later, his \nfirst run for the U.S. Senate was an uphill battle against an \nincumbent. This was a man who looked for big challenges and never \nfaltered in advancing his party's standard.\n  Yet despite his partisanship, he was known for his civility and his \nability to get along with members of both parties--and I might add, his \nability to get along with the variety of temperaments that abound in \nthis institution. Paul Coverdell had a warmth that many people felt on \neven a short acquaintance. Those who regarded him a friend are legion.\n  The shock we felt at this time a year ago may have passed, but the \nbereavement remains. Georgia lost an ardent and effective spokesman, \nthe Nation lost a patriot, and the Senate lost a true friend.\n  Many have talked about the legacy of Paul Coverdell--the work he did \nfor the party, the stamp he put on the Peace Corps, the legislation he \nwrote and speeches he gave in the Senate. But I think his lasting \nlegacy is written on the hearts of those who knew him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia, Mr. Cleland, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Miller from \nGeorgia, for his eloquent words. As he describes our dear friend Paul \nCoverdell, I am reminded that Paul Coverdell was a kinder, gentler \npolitician and person before ``kinder, gentler'' was in vogue.\n  Proverbs tells us, ``Good men must die, but death cannot kill their \nnames.'' In the year since Paul Coverdell has passed, I continue to see \nthe evidence of his hard work everywhere. I see it in the success of \nthe Georgia Project in Dalton, GA, an immigrant education project in \nthe north Georgia mountains that we worked closely together on. I see \nhim in the education savings account amendment that passed as part of \nthe President's tax package, something so close to his heart throughout \nhis career in the Senate. And most of all, I see it in my colleagues \nfaces as they continue to honor him through their work on issues that \nwere important to him.\n  Paul and I were sworn into the Georgia State Senate on the same day \nin 1971. We were elected in the election of 1970. He sat just in front \nof me. In Georgia, we sit by numbers of senatorial districts. We did \nnot sit across the aisle, party to party. So, in effect, we were all \ntogether in that State senate. So Paul sat right in front of me; and \nwhat an appropriate position for him to be in, because I followed his \nlead in so many ways, just as I have tried to do in the years in the \nSenate. He worked quietly; he worked tirelessly. But he had a single-\nmindedness of purpose that belied his mild manner. He would toil away \non a project for months, even years, then submit his results, and leave \nthe judgment and praise for others.\n\n  When I came to the U.S. Senate, I felt as if I was following behind \nPaul Coverdell again. Paul was with me as I was sworn in right here in \nthis Chamber. After that day, he helped me, he guided me, and he \ntutored me in the ways and rhythms of the Senate, this body he loved so \ndearly. We were on different sides of the aisle, but we were still \ngreat personal friends. He helped me learn because he was a good man \nand a good friend, and because he knew it was good for our country and \nfor Georgia. He always fought for our State, our farmers, our \nbusinesspeople, and the average citizen.\n  From his time in the Georgia Legislature to his post as head of the \nPeace Corps under President Bush, to his quiet and demonstrative \nleadership in the Senate, Paul had a peaceful and resolute efficiency \nabout his work that I hope we can all emulate.\n  Alphonse de Lamartine once said, ``Sometimes, when one person is \nabsent, the whole world seems less.''\n  That is the way I feel today. I share this feeling with my \ncolleagues. That is certainly the case as we remember Paul and absorb \nthe magnitude of this loss in this Senate and the people he served. \nPaul was, indeed, a leader, a legislator, and a dear personal friend. I \nmiss him terribly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment both of our colleagues from \nGeorgia for their statements, and also Senators Gramm and Torricelli \nfor the statements they have made.\n  I have been in the Senate for 20-plus years. A year ago today was \nprobably one of the saddest days of my career because we lost a real \nfriend, a true Senator, an outstanding Senator, Paul Coverdell, a \nperson who achieved a lot in his very brief career in the Senate. He \nwas in the Senate for a little over 8 years. He accomplished a lot. He \nwas elected to leadership in his first term in the Senate. That is very \nunusual on our side of the aisle. That doesn't happen very often.\n  Paul Coverdell was very unusual, very exceptional, very talented, \nvery likable, a very popular U.S. Senator. He did a lot. So we are \ncommemorating the 1-year anniversary of his death and celebrating, to \nsome extent, the contributions that he has made. Naming the Peace Corps \nbuilding after him, the National Peace Corps headquarters building, is \na real tribute to his leadership. The building at the University of \nGeorgia, the Institute of Biomedical and Health Sciences, which will \nconduct research for decades and generations to come and will save \ncountless lives, no doubt, will be a real contribution in recognition \nof his service to the country.\n  The education savings account that bore his name, as Senator \nTorricelli said, after years of battle--unsuccessful at first, but \nfinally successful--was signed into law this year. Naming those the \n``Coverdell savings accounts,'' where individuals can put in up to \n$2,000 a year and use that for education K-12, hails a very significant \nachievement; it showed real tenacity, real forcefulness. It was \nsomething that Paul Coverdell would not give up on, and it is now the \nlaw of the land. It will enable thousands of people to be able to \nprovide for, save for, and improve their education. Because of his \nforesight, leadership, tenacity, and his perseverance, it is now the \nlaw of the land.\n  Paul Coverdell had a very positive impact on countless millions of \npeople in the United States and across the world. It is only fitting \nthat we pay him a proper tribute.\n  I remember the memorial services in Georgia when our colleagues Phil \nGramm and Zell Miller, our newest colleague, made statements that were \nas moving as any I have heard when they talked about the contributions \nPaul Coverdell has made to the State of Georgia, our country, and the \nSenate. So it is with regret that we recognize the 1 year passing of \nPaul Coverdell, but it is only fitting and proper that we recognize and \nsay thank you to Paul Coverdell and wish Nancy Coverdell all of our \nbest in the years to come.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I join in the tribute to Senator \nCoverdell. As a Senator from California, I found him to be a remarkable \nman. He was a humble man. In a way, he was a prototype of the Southern \ngentleman. He was a determined man; he was a skilled legislative \ncraftsman. I was really delighted to have the pleasure to work with \nhim.\n  Paul had a profound interest in improving the education of our young \npeople. I worked with him closely as an original cosponsor of his \nEducational Savings and School Excellence Act, and during that time, I \nfound him to be energetic. He was determined and,\n\n[[Page S7837]]\n\nmost importantly, I found him to be very easy to work beside. He was \nalso very much above political correctness, and he strived to do what \nhe thought was really doable, practical, and would help people.\n  Another common interest we shared was in reducing the amount of \nillegal drugs on the streets of America. In fact, we worked together on \nseveral antinarcotics efforts. We debated together in this Chamber the \nissue of certification. I was his Democratic cosponsor of the Foreign \nNarcotics Kingpin Designation Act. This law made it easier to crack \ndown on leaders of the major drug cartels operating in Latin America. I \nbelieve these efforts are paying dividends today because U.S. law \nenforcement is more able to close in on some of the cartel leadership.\n  Paul Coverdell knew these were important debates, and I will never \nforget because the Republican Party was in the leadership, and every \ntime he called me, he asked if he could come to my office to talk with \nme. It was a very interesting effort on his part because the fact that \nhe was willing to come to my office and sit down to have a discussion \non an issue that we would work on together made me even more dedicated \nto the success of that effort.\n  I had a wonderful across-the-aisle relationship with Paul Coverdell. \nThe Narcotics Kingpin Act, the educational savings account, and \nExcellence in Schools Act are a few specific tangible pieces of \nlegislation on which he put his leadership stamp.\n  All I can say is: Paul Coverdell is missed in the Senate of the \nUnited States. I truly wish all of God's blessings on him. He was a \nwonderful man.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I believe everyone is aware that Senators do \na certain amount of posturing. We are a political body. People who are \nwatching us, however, I am sure, cannot get a sense that none of this \nis posturing. Everything that has been said by Republicans and \nDemocrats alike is heartfelt. We miss Paul Coverdell very much and, as \nsomeone said, it does not seem it has been a year he has been gone.\n  The outpouring of affection for Paul is very real because of the kind \nof individual he was. Most people can never know what Paul Coverdell \nmeant to the Senate, to his home State of Georgia, and to people on \nboth sides of the aisle. Unless you were a part of this body and worked \nwith Paul on a daily basis, it would be impossible to know what he \nmeant to all of us. I hope, though, by this tribute today, people will \nget a little bit of a sense of what Paul meant to all of us.\n  He was a friend. He was a counselor. He made things happen in the \nSenate, and it was never with any personal aggrandizement or publicity \non his part. There was no fanfare when Paul did his work.\n  He will be known, even though only having served a relatively short \nperiod of time in the Senate, as one of the most effective Senators who \never served here.\n  It is instructive that the person who took his place in the Senate, a \ngreat public servant in his own right, former Governor and now Senator \nZell Miller, asked how he could ever begin to fill Paul Coverdell's \nshoes. The reason he cannot and none of us can, of course, is that Paul \nCoverdell was unique and no one can ever do exactly what Paul Coverdell \ndid. We can each aspire to have his attitude, selflessness, friendship, \nand helpfulness to others. If we all aspire to do that, this Senate \nwill be a better place.\n  We do hear every week: We need a Paul Coverdell to solve this problem \nor solve that problem. That is how Paul is remembered: as a person you \ncould always turn to, to get something done when no one else could \nquite figure out how to do it, and frequently, by the way, that was \nbecause of personalities.\n  Paul had a way of bridging the gap between people who were of strong \nminds on something; he would find a way to bring them together.\n  As Senator Feinstein just said, we miss Paul Coverdell very much. We \nlove him. We love his wife, Nancy. We wish her and the family the very \nbest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will never forget this day last year \nwhen it was announced that we had lost our friend and colleague, Paul \nCoverdell. His death was a shock to all of us. It was something that \nmost of us were so emotional about that we could not speak in the first \nfew days after learning of his death because we knew that we would not \nbe able to get the words out. Those who did speak will be remembered; \nthey did, indeed, have a hard time getting through the words they \nwanted to say.\n  It is very rare that after a year from losing a Senator or a Member \nof Congress that loss is still so vivid, but that is the case with Paul \nCoverdell. I miss him today just as much as I missed him a year ago \ntoday. He had that kind of impact.\n  The interesting thing is he accomplished so much in a very short \ntime. And there is not anyone who knew him who did not like him.\n  He was also a leader. In his career in public service, which he \nactually did after a very successful private sector career, he made a \ndifference wherever he was.\n  In 1989, Paul Coverdell took the reins of the Peace Corps. He looked \nat the Peace Corps in 1989 and said: What should be the mission? He did \nnot just take the reins of the agency and do more of the same. He \nstepped back and said: What does the world need today from the Peace \nCorps?\n  Of course, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia at the time were emerging \nfrom the Iron Curtain. So Paul Coverdell said: We have these countries \nnow emerging from the cold war, trying to seek democracy. Maybe the \nPeace Corps can play a part in keeping the peace.\n  He began to send volunteers from the Peace Corps into Eastern Europe \nand the former Soviet Union countries. He blazed a new trail for the \nagency that made a difference, maybe in a small way, but a lot of small \nthings build, to Poland and Hungary where the first Peace Corps \nvolunteers went after the fall of the Iron Curtain. Those are two \ncountries now firmly in the democratic camp. They are countries that \nhave just joined NATO.\n  Paul Coverdell made a difference because he stepped back and was \nthoughtful. He was a leader in the truest sense.\n  The Coverdell education savings accounts were an extension of his \nleadership at the Peace Corps and his interest in education. He said: \nWhat can we do to help parents who have a hard time buying a band \nuniform, a computer, or something that will give a child that extra \nopportunity to excel and succeed? He came up with the concept of \neducation savings accounts.\n  As usual in Congress, it does not happen easily, even if it is a \ngreat idea. But Paul Coverdell was dogged in his determination that \nbeing able to save tax free to buy your children the things that would \nhelp them succeed in their educational experience was worth a fight. He \nfought and he won. It is fitting that we named the education savings \naccounts the ``Coverdell education savings accounts.''\n  The other thing that is significant about Paul Coverdell is that he \nbuilt the two-party system in Georgia. Georgia, like Texas, 15 years \nago was an entirely Democratic State. They did not have Republican \ncounty officials in very many counties in Georgia or Texas. They did \nnot have Republicans in numbers in the State legislature. In fact, Paul \nCoverdell was the minority leader of the State senate in Georgia, and I \nbelieve there were three Republicans in the entire State senate. He was \nthe person who came in and said I think democracy works best when there \nis a strong two-party system. He became the first Republican every \nelected to the Senate from Georgia.\n\n  At the same time, Paul Coverdell was respected and liked by \nDemocrats. At his funeral, Governor Barnes, the Democratic Governor of \nGeorgia, made a wonderful presentation about his friendship with Paul \nCoverdell from their days in the legislature. He said Paul Coverdell \nwas his mentor in politics.\n  We have heard former Governor Zell Miller, now Paul Coverdell's \nsuccessor, speak eloquently about his relationship and the impact that \nPaul Coverdell had on Georgia, as well as Senator Cleland and other \nDemocrats who have spoken in the Chamber about what a wonderful person \nPaul Coverdell was.\n\n[[Page S7838]]\n\n  He was a leader through being creative and innovative. He was a \nfighter for what he believed was right. He persevered. He usually won. \nHe built the Republican Party while having a loyal following of \nDemocrats. He had the kind of respect it took to walk that kind of very \nfine line.\n  He could bring people together. He could calm the waters. When \ntempers flared, he would tell a joke and dissolve the tension. He was \nan extraordinary person.\n  The most telling of all the things one could say about Paul Coverdell \nis he is truly talked about and missed every day, even a year later. \nThe vacuum left by Paul Coverdell's sudden death last year at this very \ntime has not been filled. I am glad we are taking time to pay tribute \nto this extraordinary man. I am proud I was able to be his friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I can safely say, unless it is the \ndeath of a family member, usually by a year after someone's passing you \nsort of have gotten over it and moved on. Yet here we are a year after \nthe death of our good friend, Paul Coverdell, and Senator after Senator \nafter Senator on both sides of the aisle is making the point that we \nhave not gotten over it. We still miss him. We think about him almost \nevery day because he was such an indispensable part of this Senate \nwhich people have come and left for over 200 years.\n  I met Paul back in 1988. I was one of the people trying to help \nPresident Bush get the Republican nomination--the first President \nBush--and I was traveling in the South. It was not a pleasant week. The \nformer President had lost the Iowa caucus. This was between Iowa and \nNew Hampshire. His potential to be nominated was very much in doubt at \nthat point. Part of my travels took me to Georgia where I met State \nSenator Paul Coverdell, obviously an intimate friend of the Vice \nPresident, and I was involved in his campaign in 1980, 8 years before \nthat, prior to the nomination of President Reagan.\n  Our paths continued to cross. He came to Washington as Director of \nthe Peace Corps. I was a member at the time of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee and had a chance to deal with him. Then my wife, Elaine Chao, \nsucceeded him as Director of the Peace Corps when Paul went off to have \nthe most extraordinary experience in getting to the Senate. Paul has to \nbe in the Guinness Book of Records for having won the most elections to \nget to the Senate.\n  He ran in Georgia in 1992. I don't know what the law of Georgia is \ntoday, but in 1992 you had to win a majority of the votes for your \nparty to win the primary. If you didn't, there would be a runoff. So \nPaul had a very close primary election and had to have a runoff, an \nadditional election, to get the nomination. So it took him two \nelections to become the Republican nominee in 1992. Then Georgia also \nhad a curious law with regard to the general election. I don't know \nwhether it is still the law of Georgia or not, but at that time in 1992 \nin order to be elected to the Senate you had to get 50 percent of the \nvote, plus one. Paul, in his contest against former Senator Wyche \nFowler, had gotten about 47 percent of the vote. Wyche Fowler came up \nshort of 50 percent, and there was a third party nominee, so that was \nthe third election.\n\n  The fourth election was a runoff, a month after the regular election, \nafter President Clinton had been elected, after everybody else who was \ngoing to serve in the Senate, if that Congress had been chosen. There \nwas yet another election going on in Georgia, 30 days after the first \nelection. Paul managed to win that election and came to be sworn in to \nthe Senate, having had to win four elections in 1 year to get here.\n  I cite that not just to recount his resume but to make the point of \nwhat incredible tenacity it took to go through all of that to make it \nhere.\n  As all of our colleagues have indicated, once he arrived, his \npersonality, his work habits--he was peripatetic; he was everywhere. No \nmatter what the issue might be, no matter what little group might be \ndiscussing a particular matter, Paul was always there in a \nnonthreatening way in a body in which people have a tendency to compete \nwith each other constantly. His personality was such that no one ever \nthought of him as a competitor. His interests were vast, across the \nboard, everything my colleagues have said, everything from education to \nforeign policy. He had wide interests.\n  He was elected to our leadership in the first term which, as Senator \nNickles said earlier, is quite unusual in our party. He was unfailingly \npolite, competitive but polite, and had a way of engaging in politics \nto make friends rather than enemies. So many people in politics acquire \nnumerous enemies in the process of participating in the business in \nwhich we are all engaged. Paul, quite the opposite, tended to add \nfriends. He was a truly remarkable man, a leader not just for Georgia \nbut for all of America. It was a great tragedy his life was cut short. \nHe would have had many more years in the Senate making an enormous \ncontribution to his State and the Nation and enriching the lives of all \nof us who had the privilege of getting to know him.\n  We still miss you, Paul, and we are confident we will see you again \nsome day in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment in \nremembrance of my good friend and our colleague, Senator Paul \nCoverdell, who passed away a year ago today.\n  It hardly seems an entire year has passed since Paul was with us on \nthe Senate floor. Paul served the State of Georgia and our Nation nobly \nfor almost 40 years, in the Army, in the Georgia State Legislature, as \na respected businessman, as the head of the Peace Corps, and as a \nmember of the U.S. Senate. Paul believed, as do I, that people flourish \nwhen they have the freedom to work and make their own decisions, and he \nworked day after day to ensure these freedoms for all Americans.\n  Last year as we were preparing the Treasury and General Government \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 2001, we were shocked to learn of \nthe passing of our colleague, Senator Coverdell. As we moved forward \nwith that bill, S.2900, I inserted a provision requiring the naming of \na building at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Glynco, \nGA, in honor of Paul Coverdell. Our House colleagues agreed and we \nincluded this language in the conference report which was signed into \nlaw. I am pleased to let my colleagues know today that the ceremony to \nname the building will be conducted next month.\n  There is an American Indian saying, ``When legends die, there are no \nmore dreams. When there are no more dreams, there is no more \ngreatness.'' Well, I can assure you that Paul's dreams are alive in us \nand his greatness will transcend the years.\n  Mr. President, I respectfully request this body take a moment to \nremember our colleague and his family.\n  Mr. FRIST. I rise today to honor the memory of our colleague, Senator \nPaul Coverdell of Georgia. It's had to believe a year has passed since \nhe left us, but his legacy of integrity, compassion and commitment \nremains a model for us to emulate.\n  Throughout his long career in public service, Paul Coverdell was a \ntireless champion of freedom. He believed in America and the power of \nthe American spirit. Paul Coverdell knew what was right and he fought \nfor it with all his might. He was a husband, a citizen, a Senator, a \npatriot, and he is sorely missed.\n  For me, as a newcomer to the U.S. Senate now seven years ago, Paul \nCoverdell was a mentor. I had the honor and privilege of watching his \ncourage up close working on Medicare and education in particular where \nhis expert guidance helped us communicate our message to the American \npeople. Whether on the practicalities of how to structure a U.S. Senate \noffice to broader policy implications on the issues of the day, Paul \nCoverdell was the conscience and guide to whom we turned for advice and \ncounsel.\n  To help honor the life and work of Paul Coverdell, I am drafting \nbipartisan legislation authorizing two new initiatives--the Paul \nCoverdell Stroke Disease Registry and the Paul Coverdell Health Care \nCorps. The untimely death of our friend points to the need to provide \nmore comprehensive stroke care and to learn more about providing a \nbetter quality of care to the more than 700,000 people who suffer a \nstroke\n\n[[Page S7839]]\n\neach year. Our first step in doing so is introducing the STOP Stroke \nAct, which requires the Department of Health and Human Services to \ndevelop a national disease registry.\n  The Paul Coverdell Health Care Corps is a tribute to the values \nincorporated into the Peace Corps while he was Director and further \ndemonstrates our dedication to providing American expertise to \ndeveloping nations. This new Corps would provide skilled health care \nprofessionals for countries dealing with the crises of HIV/AIDS, \ntuberculosis and malaria. The Paul Coverdell Corps would be an \nextension of the changes made in 2000 in which all Peace Corps \nvolunteers serving in Africa must be trained as educators of HIV/AIDS \nprevention and care.\n  I believe both of these pieces of legislation are a fitting tribute \nto the late Paul Coverdell. It is my hope that these two bills will \nreflect the compassion and commitment that he demonstrated time and \ntime again in his service to our Nation and indeed, to the world. \nSenator Paul Coverdell was a champion of liberty and freedom, and with \nhis wife, Nancy, he knew instinctively that love and freedom are the \ngreatest gifts God has planted in the human heart. His legacy charges \nall of us with the task of doing everything we can to preserve our \nfreedoms and to demonstrate in every way the indomitable American \nspirit.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, one year ago today, Senator Lott had the \nsad duty of coming to the floor of the Senate to announce to this body \nthat Paul Coverdell, Senator from Georgia, had suddenly and \nunexpectedly died. While his absence was felt immediately and deeply, \nonly now with the benefit of time can we develop a full sense of the \ncontributions and legacy of this quiet statesman.\n  Few Americans these days take to heart so completely the notion of \npublic service as Paul Coverdell did. From the Peace Corps to his years \nin the Georgia Legislature to his time in the Senate, he was a model of \ndedication and sincerity, unwilling to substitute style for substance. \nHe was a serious student of policy and a consistent advocate of deeds \nover words. Paul was a tireless leader in the effort to reform our \neducation system and I am proud to support legislation renaming \neducation IRAs as Coverdell education savings accounts. His concern for \nthe young people of this country was also demonstrated by his \ncommitment to the fight against the trafficking of illegal drugs. But \nperhaps above all, he was a great champion of civility. Each time I \nhear of the need to ``change the tone in Washington,'' I think of Paul \nCoverdell.\n  It is fitting that Congress has now sent legislation to the President \nthat will rename the Washington headquarters of the Peace Corps for \nPaul Coverdell. I was honored to support that legislation, and I was \nhonored to serve alongside Senator Paul Coverdell of Georgia. He is \nstill deeply missed.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my dear \nfriend and beloved colleague, Senator Paul D. Coverdell, who, as we all \nknow, passed away a year ago today.\n  Paul was a dear friend, who meant so much to each and every one of us \nhere in the Senate. He was our friend, and we loved him very much. Paul \nwas a kind man--a gentle man--a sweet man. The Senate is not the same \nwithout him. It is not the same because we miss his kindness, his \nspirit, and his unbelievable energy--energy that he brought to every \ntask he undertook.\n  Whatever it was, Paul would do it and do it effectively. He was one \nof the key people running this Senate. Candidly, he was that person not \nbecause of his leadership position, which was significant, but because \nof the fact that he just got things done. His effectiveness came \nbecause of his energy, because of his drive, because of his \ndetermination. It also came because he could get along with people on \nboth sides of the aisle. He knew people. He understood them. He liked \npeople, and people liked him back. That is what made Paul Coverdell \neffective.\n  All of us have different stories and remember different things about \nour friend Paul. I worked with him on Central American issues, \nCaribbean issues, and Latin American issues. He cared passionately \nabout the safety, security, and prosperity of our hemisphere. He paid \nparticular attention to this hemisphere, because he understood that \nwhat happens here in America's backyard affects the people of Georgia, \nand it affects the people of this country. He brought this kind of \nthought and passion to all of the issues he tackled.\n  On the first anniversary of Paul's death, we honor what he stood for, \nwhat he believed in, and what he accomplished here in this Senate. As a \npublic servant, Paul touched the lives of his family, his friends and \ncolleagues in the Senate, his constituents in his home State of \nGeorgia, and the lives of millions of people throughout the United \nStates and abroad. He is deeply missed and will always--always be \nremembered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/18/senate-section/article/S7839-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7839]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MORNING BUSINESS CLOSED\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report the pending business.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2311) making appropriations for energy and \n     water development for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2002, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to talk a little about \nenergy. Of course, the appropriation before us is on energy and water, \nbut the broader topic I think we are going to talk about here in the \nnext couple of days as well is the whole notion of an energy policy and \nthe implementation of a policy for this country.\n  We have, as you know, gone now for a number of years without an \nenergy policy. It has resulted in some things that we have felt \nrecently. Frankly, I think we are very likely to feel them some more in \nthe future. We felt it in California, of course, and continue to feel \nit, although it is a little less pressing now. We felt it in the price \nof gasoline and continue to feel it, although the price is down. But if \nwe do not do something about the causes of this crisis, we will have it \nagain.\n  I come from a State, Wyoming, of course, where we are big in the \nproduction of energy. We are the No. 1 producer of coal. We are \nproducing natural gas, methane gas--a grand, new operation there. So we \nalso feel the up and down, in and out, of energy. Frankly, selfishly, I \nhope we can level things out a bit and get away from this boom-and-bust \nkind of economy that seems to be inherent in energy.\n  To do that, it seems to me, we need to really take seriously this \nidea of having a national energy policy. I am very pleased the \nPresident and the Vice President have put forth an energy policy, as I \nsaid, for the first time, really, in a very long time. Now it is up to \nus in the Congress to take up the portions of that policy that have \nbeen laid out that need to have congressional action. Not all of it \ndoes, but a great part of it does, and we need to do so.\n\n  The results of the lack of a policy over the years are pretty \napparent in a couple of areas. One, obviously, is our dependence on \noverseas production. I suspect we will continue to have a good deal of \noverseas production, but we have allowed ourselves to become nearly 55-\npercent dependent on OPEC and other countries to fill our needs here, \nso we find ourselves in a position where, if the OPEC countries make a \ndecision with regard to production, make a decision with regard to \npricing, we are simply the victims of that.\n  What is the solution? I suspect at least one of the solutions we need \nto consider seriously is an increase in domestic production. We have an \nopportunity to do that. There is a great deal of reserve energy here. \nThere is a great deal of reserve in coal, for example, that we can \ndepend on for a very long time.\n\n[[Page S7840]]\n\n  One of the impediments to that, of course, in the West particularly, \nhas been access to public lands. In a State such as Wyoming, and even \nmuch more so in Nevada and some of the others, half of our State \nbelongs to the Federal Government. In order to have production on those \nlands where minerals are available, you have to have reasonable access \nto those lands.\n  I am not talking about wilderness. I am not talking about national \nparks. I am not talking about those lands that have been set aside for \nparticular things--even in many cases parts of the forest reserve. I am \ntalking more about Bureau of Land Management lands, the multiple-use \nlands.\n  You have to understand how those lands became what they are before \nyou can really have an idea of how they might be used. Parklands, \nobviously, were set aside. Forest reserves were set aside. BLM lands \nwere simply the lands that remained there after the goals of the \nHomestead Act and so on were accomplished, and they remained in Federal \nhands. So they were never set aside for any particular reason, and \ntherefore they are common land and should be available.\n  Unfortunately, the access to those lands is much less available than \nit was just a small number of years ago. Some of the environmental \ngroups have said: Oh, my goodness, they are 85 percent available. The \nfact is they might be, in terms of their designation, but when you get \ndown to specific requirements that have been placed on the lands, the \navailable lands are much less than they were just 10 years ago.\n  I don't want to get into the ANWR thing, where we have been wrestling \nover that. There are lots of lands that we have shown and will continue \nto show can be explored, where minerals can be produced and those lands \ncan be replaced and put back just as they were.\n  Another problem we have had, that continues to be there and we will \nfeel again, is the lack of infrastructure--the lack of refineries, for \ninstance, for gasoline. We have not produced new refineries for years. \nPart of the reason for that is the indecision, where we are. Part of it \nhas been the regulations that were there--14 or 15 different kinds of \ngasoline that had to be prepared for different areas, which makes it \nmuch more difficult.\n  One of the more pressing problems is the transportation of available \nenergy, whether it be through transmission lines for electricity or \nwhether it be through lines for gas and oil. We have to get the energy \nfrom where it is produced to where it is used in the marketplace. We \nhave not done that. These are some of the things that need to be \nconsidered.\n\n  In addition, we have to take a long look at what we can do on \nrenewables--continue to do more research so wind and solar and hydro \nbecome more and more a part of our future in energy. That can very \neasily happen. One of the things that has to be done, of course, is \nresearch. We have to do more of those kinds of things. The other is \nconservation. Conservation is much a part of where we are. I do not \nthink we can solve the problem in the future with conservation, but \nthat is one of the approaches that must be taken.\n  I hope we continue to press to get the leadership of the Senate and \nleadership of the Congress to come to an accord on taking up the \nspecifics of energy and not letting ourselves be fooled into thinking, \nbecause of this little pullback from the so-called crisis, that the \nproblem has been solved; it has not. In order to avoid that happening \nagain, really in any sort of project, we need to look ahead at what our \nneeds are going to be, what kind of energy do we want available to us, \nand what do we need to have. Then we need to move to implement those \nthings. I hope we hear more about that.\n  I yield to my friend from Alaska, who is the ranking member and has \nbeen chairman of the Energy Committee and is probably one of the most \nknowledgeable of all of our Senators on this area.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I am here today to begin the \ndiscussion on the 2002 energy and water appropriations bill. I want to \nrecognize the hard work of professional staff members on the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources, both the majority and the minority, \nand the hard work of the Members of this body as we address this \ndifficult and often contentious issue associated with nuclear waste and \nthe issue at hand, which is a substantial reduction in funding for the \nnuclear waste program.\n  We have seen lots of good projects funded in this legislation, the \nenergy and water appropriations bill: Flood control, reclamation \nprojects, Indian water settlements such as Animas and Rocky Boys and \nothers. But we also have a very significant obligation at this time, \nand that is the matter of disposing of our high-level nuclear waste \nthat is generated as a consequence of the operation of nuclear \npowerplants that contribute about 20 percent of the power generated for \nelectricity in the United States.\n  I also want to recognize Senator Domenici for his tireless efforts in \nthis area.\n  What we have before us is the current measure which proposes a major \nreduction in funding to allow the Federal Government to select the site \nfor storage of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste.\n  This is kind of a two-headed major environmental issue. We talk a lot \nand express our concerns about global warming. One of the answers to \nglobal warming, of course, is nuclear energy. On the other hand, we \nhave a problem with nuclear waste, and currently the industry is \nclearly choking on its own waste because of our inability to address \nand resolve what to do with that.\n  So on the one hand, we have the positive aspects of the nuclear \nindustry inasmuch as it answers many questions associated with global \nwarming, but the reality is that this industry can never move into its \nfull development capability unless we do something about the waste \nissue.\n  I have been critical of the previous administration for playing \npolitics with the issue, sacrificing the environment and health and \nsafety of the American people for short-term political gain. Here we \nare again with an obligation of what to do about the problem because we \nhave seen a substantial cut in funding in this area. The Appropriations \nCommittee has proposed to make cuts in the Yucca Mountain Waste \nDisposal Program. Specifically, the administration requested $445 \nmillion for the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, the \noffice that oversees the Yucca Mountain projects. The House energy and \nwater bill funded the program at $443 million. While not the \nadministration's full request, it is about $48 million more than last \nyear's funding.\n  Unfortunately, we have before us in the Senate a committee \nrecommendation to provide a total of $275 million to continue the \nscientific and characterization studies already underway at Yucca \nMountain. So we are looking at a cut from $443 million in the House, \nthe administration's request of $445 million, and the committee \nrecommendation to fund at $275 million. There is a question of whether \nor not we are going to offer an amendment at some time to reinstate \nfull funding, but before we address that, I want to discuss this matter \nin depth because it creates, if you will, an obligation for the \nAmerican people and the Congress to face up to reality. I want to \noutline what the reality is, and I could probably best do it by having \na chart and pointer with which we will attempt to explain just where we \nare on the issue of Yucca Mountain and the proposed scheduling.\n  I am going to ask Colleen to go over here with the pointer and help \nme out.\n  What we have, first of all, is a bottom line that will catch the \nattention of virtually everyone who is watching, which is the \ninvestment the American taxpayer has in trying to address what to do \nwith the high-level nuclear waste and what we have expended at Yucca \nMountain because that is the bottom line, and we are going to work \nbackwards from there. We have spent about $8 billion of the taxpayers' \nmoney developing Yucca as a permanent repository. Do we have a picture \nof Yucca?\n  We don't have it with us today. We have it somewhere. It shows the \ntunnel. It is the repository out in Nevada in the proving grounds where \nwe have had some 25 years of extensive nuclear tests--over 800 nuclear \ntests--both above and below ground. It is a pretty hot area in the \nsense of the testing that has taken place in the area, but in any \nevent, it was one of the proposed\n\n[[Page S7841]]\n\nsites and the site that was finally approved for a process. This \nprocess is overwhelmingly complex, but the bottom line is not \noverwhelming.\n  The cost to the taxpayer at Yucca Mountain so far is $8 billion. That \nis only part of the story, Madam President, because the other part of \nthe story is what happened in 1998. In 1998, the Federal Government had \na contract with the industry, the nuclear industry, to take the waste \nthat year.\n  The Federal Government has always acknowledged a responsibility to \ndeal with spent fuel and other waste from civilian reactors as well as \nour nuclear weapons program. As a consequence of the obligation to take \ncivilian spent fuel, the Federal Government signed a contract saying it \nwould take the waste in 1998. You might wonder, well, what is the point \nof this conversation because you have to get the bottom line of what \nhappened.\n  Since 1987, utility ratepayers, the nuclear ratepayers of this \ncountry have been paying a premium to the Federal Government so that \nthe Federal Government could take the waste in 1998. That Fund, the \nNuclear Waste Fund, currently has $19 billion--$19 billion in it. All \nto help the Federal Government meet its contractual obligation.\n  Madam President, 1998 came and went. The Federal Government did not \nhave the proper repository ready, and as a consequence the Federal \nGovernment was in breach of its contract.\n  Nineteen billion dollars is a lot of money. I am not going to stop \nthere because the costs don't stop there. It gets more complex because, \nas you know, any time you breach a contract you expose yourself to \nlitigation. So we have already spent $8 billion on examining Yucca \nMountain.\n\n  The claims filed by the nuclear industry against the Federal \nGovernment total somewhere between $60 and $80 billion for \nnonperformance of the contractual commitments. That is about $90 \nbillion to $100 billion. That is what we are looking at. We are looking \nat the $19 billion that ratepayers have paid into the Nuclear Waste \nFund, $8 billion of which we have spent and then we are looking at $60 \nto $80 billion in litigation associated with the breach of contract. \nAnd here we sit.\n  The point I want to make now with this chart is to show you the \nsteps. Back in 1978, we had the first Yucca Mountain bore hole, the \ntesting. Then in 1982, we went with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. Then \nin 1984, we had the draft environmental assessment. Then in 1986, we \nhad the three candidate sites-selected areas. Well, the one that was \nselected and approved in 1987 was Yucca. We had final environmental \nassessment in 1986. Then in 1988, we had consultation, we had draft \nsite characterization and then in 1989, and so forth, we had site \ncharacterization. Then in 1993, we begin the actual construction. That \nwas the bore hole test. Then in 1998, we had the viability assessments. \nAnd then we had the draft EIS.\n  Now we are in 2001 in the buff-colored area, and we have funding for \nthe science and the engineering report. That is basically funded this \nyear in the 2000 appropriation supplemental, draft EIS, NAS report, and \nthen we have the site recommendations.\n  Moving over in the next year we have suitability evaluation and the \nfinal EIS. Notice the significant portion where we are at risk is the \nsite selection review, and that is proposed in the funding that is in \nthe current water bill at $445 to $443 million. If you cut that to what \nthe committee has proposed, $275 million, you are setting this whole \nprogram back a number of years. How many years? Heaven knows.\n  But let us look at the next scenario because it suggests the \nsignificance of the result of this action.\n  As I indicated, the amendment that might be discussed at a later time \nwould increase the funding to the level that is felt that can keep the \nprogram on schedule. Why do you want to keep the program on schedule? \nWell, for the following reasons: According to the Department of Energy, \nthe cuts would have a significant impact on the program: immediate \nreduction--in other words, layoffs--of about 650 Federal and contract \npersonnel; indefinite delay in license application; renders the 2010 \nspent fuel receipt date unachievable--so basically, at the end of this \nthing, which is out here in 2010 when we are supposed to take the \nwaste, that makes that date unachievable--the loss of 75 percent of \nFederal staff performing oversight, the loss of most quality assurance \noversight; loss of ability to conduct independent technical reviews; \ntermination of the Nye County Early Warning Drilling Program; \neliminates any of the universities that are involved in this process; \nloss of repository surface design support for license application; loss \nof modeling ability; loss of license application design and analysis \ncapability.\n\n  All these activities that are underway--and have been--are necessary \nto achieve this 2010 date, at which time this repository would be \nlicensed and capable of taking the high-level nuclear waste. So this is \nnecessary funding to keep this on a reasonable schedule.\n  That is under the assumption that science will determine that Yucca \nis suitable. I believe it will. If so, then licensing activities are \nkey to getting the repository back on track.\n  There is no question that the Federal Government has the obligation \nto take the waste. There was a contract in 1998 to take the waste. As I \nindicated, the ratepayers have paid in $19 billion. The Federal \nGovernment has breached its contract. And the Federal Government is \nsubject to lawsuits, litigation, somewhere in the area of $60 billion \nto $80 billion. This is serious business. This is serious accounting to \nthe American taxpayers for performance. They expect the Congress of the \nUnited States to perform. We have an obligation to perform; that is, to \nstructure this so it can achieve its purpose as designated by the \nCongress.\n  I can understand the opposition of my friends from Nevada to the \nYucca Mountain issue. They do not want it in their State. They are \nworking very hard to assure that it does not go in their State.\n  On the other hand, if you are not going to put it in Nevada, where \nare you going to put it? You are not going to put it in the other 49 \nStates for obvious reasons. There is another alternative. We could \npursue reprocessing.\n  However, today at the Energy hearing, we asked the Deputy Secretary, \nMr. Francis Blake, if we pursue reprocessing, will we need Yucca \nMountain as a permanent repository? He said yes. And if you don't \ndepend on experts, on whom are you going to depend? Are you going to \nhold a public hearing and make a decision on emotion rather than \nscience? These are scientists speaking.\n  I personally believe there is a place for reprocessing. Perhaps we \nshould have started on that a long time ago. But that was killed under \nthe Carter administration. We had an opportunity. So here we are. We \nhave nearly $100 billion of taxpayers' money at risk. We are hung up \nright on the pinnacle of what to do, and the proposal now is to cut \nfunding--to cut funding without coming up with an alternative of how we \nare going to do this.\n  A lot of people say we are never going to be able to move the waste \nanyway. We have moved military waste all over the country. We have \nmoved high-level waste to South Carolina, to the State of Washington. \nIt is moved by military means. And it is moved safely. We have been \nvery fortunate in the manner in which we handle this waste. I think we \nhave the scientific capability to reduce the risks to a minimum. We \nhave to get this thing off center.\n\n  My appeal to my colleagues and the staffs who are watching this \ndebate is that we have a responsibility to the taxpayers. I hope \neverybody who is listening recognizes that we have spent $100 billion \nof taxpayers' money on this project. If we reduce the funding, we are \ngoing to put it off indefinitely, or we certainly are going to put it \noff after the watch of my good friend, Senator Reid, and others, and \nsimply pass the problem on to others who may come into this body from \nNevada.\n  I do not have a constituency on this in Alaska, but I have a \nresponsibility, as former chairman of the Energy Committee, and the \nranking member, to address the obligation that this body has to address \nthis problem with some finality. We are either going to fund it, keep \nit going, or we should come to grips with the other alternative. And I \nam not conversant necessarily on what that might be.\n  But we have the waste. The nuclear industry produces 20 percent of \nthe\n\n[[Page S7842]]\n\npower in this Nation, and we can't agree on how to solve it. Not only \nis the selection of a repository critical in dealing with our present \nspent fuel problem, but it is essential if we are to build an energy-\nsecure future. I talked a little bit about that in my opening remarks.\n  There is the realization, as we look at global warming, there is \ndefinitely a place, a strong place for nuclear energy. Our future \nenergy security depends on nuclear power if we are ever to meet our \nenvironmental goals. I would say to my colleagues, who are very \nsensitive to the environmental point of view, that those \nenvironmentalists who oppose the advancement of nuclear energy are \nreally sticking their heads in the sand and unrealistically failing to \nrecognize that energy has to be produced from some source, and, as a \nconsequence of that, whether it be coal or oil or gas, we have concerns \nabout global warming and emissions. We do not have that particular \nconcern with nuclear, but we have the concern of what to do with the \nwaste. We have to address that. But the contribution that nuclear \nenergy is making is significant to reducing global warming.\n  We have had hearings on nuclear energy in the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee. We have looked at the future of the industry. We \nhave discussed the reauthorization of Price-Anderson.\n  Nuclear energy, as I have indicated, is 20 percent of our energy mix \nand must continue to play an even greater role in the future if we want \nto meet our energy demands and protect our air quality. The production \nof electricity from nuclear energy, as I have indicated, emits no \ngreenhouse gases, no CO2, no SOX, no \nNOX. It is a baseload power which provides our grid \nstability and reliability.\n  Nuclear energy supplies California with about 16 percent of its \nelectricity supply. Without that in the past year, the California grid \nwould have simply collapsed. High natural gas prices and low uranium \nprices have helped to make electricity produced from nuclear some of \nthe cheapest in the country and some of the most efficient.\n  Safe and efficient U.S. plants are operating today at record \nefficiencies. In 1999, U.S. nuclear reactors achieved close to 90-\npercent efficiency. Total efficiency increases during the 1990s at \nexisting plants was the equivalent--this is just the efficiency--of \nadding approximately 23 1,000-megawatt powerplants. So that gives you \nsome idea of the sophistication of the industry. Keep in mind, it is \nall clean, nonemitting generation.\n  Now we are seeing more acceptance, that the nuclear energy industry \nis on the upswing. Four or five years ago, who would have thought we \nwould have heard about buying plants, selling plants, and, yes, even \nbuilding new plants. That discussion is happening today.\n  The U.S. industry is actually putting its money where its mouth is. \nBy the end of 2001, the Chicago-based Exelon Corporation will have \ninvested $15 million in a South African venture to build a pebble bed \nmodular reactor, new technology, technology that reduces the risk \nassociated with the operation of nuclear reactors and a very exciting \ndevelopment.\n\n  It is fair to say that we are seeing the public becoming more \naccepting in recognizing the role of nuclear energy. This past April \nthe Associated Press commissioned a poll that suggests that half of \nthose polled, nearly half, support using nuclear powerplants to produce \nelectric energy, and 56 percent said they wouldn't mind a nuclear plant \nwithin 10 miles of their home.\n  The problem we still have is what to do with the waste. I believe \nthere has been more of a political problem than a technical one. I \nunderstand the politics of Nevada, and I respect it. Now a funding cut, \nhowever, that impacts the technical program for reasons that we can \nconjecture simply is not acceptable. It is not acceptable for the \nAmerican taxpayer in light of the exposure to that taxpayer already.\n  Again, I cite that exposure in dollars because I think we have a \ntendency to generalize around here. But when we get specific, we have \nspent $8 billion of the taxpayers' money in Yucca Mountain, that hole \nin the Nevada mountain, we have collected $19 billion that we have \ncollected from the ratepayers to have the Federal Government take the \nwaste in 1998, with the realization that the Federal Government broke \nthe contract and now with litigation totaling some $60, $80 billion, \nyou can see the significance of the obligation we have.\n  For those of us who support the Yucca Mountain program, at last count \nthere were 66 Members of this Chamber who indicated support of using \nYucca Mountain as a repository for the storage of spent nuclear fuel--\n66 Members. I don't know how many Members we have today in this body \nwho are willing to support this effort. It suggests that if an \namendment is taken to a vote and the amendment would fund at the \nappropriate level necessary to continue the program, that if that \namendment failed--and there may be a good deal of loyalty on the other \nside in reference to the amendment--then those responsible would have \nto bear the brunt of recognizing the significance of this in basically \nkilling the nuclear program in this country associated with Yucca \nMountain and the disposal of the waste.\n  On the other hand, if some assurances can be made that there will be \nfunding at a level to keep this at a reasonable level, to continue the \nschedule that I have outlined behind me, then, obviously, we could work \ntogether to recognize the necessity of maintaining this program as it \nhas been developed. We can't simply accept this kind of a cut that \nwould set this program back that many years.\n  I don't know where the votes are, but I will let others who are \nresponsible make a determination of where the votes are on this issue.\n  I remind each and every Member, as they reflect on how they might \nvote on an amendment to restore the funding to the appropriate level, \nagain, the taxpayers of this country may be questioning each Member on \nthe validity of basically putting this program off and potentially \nabandoning the program after nearly $8 billion has been expended.\n  I find it ironic, the one hook that the opponents of the site have \nalways hung their hat on. They have said time and time again that \nscience should decide the issue, not politics. Well, this schedule I am \nshowing you is science in action. This is the check and balance system. \nThis is the evaluation of all our environmental considerations in an \norderly process. It is science in action. If politics is going to kill \nthis program by cutting the funding from the roughly $445, $443 million \ndown to $275 million, it will not be science that is making that cut. \nIt will be politics.\n\n  Let me repeat the statement because I think it is important. Science \nshould decide this issue. This is science in action, not only because \nof its importance to the taxpayer but because it may be the only area \nof agreement the opponents and I have on Yucca Mountain. That is, let \nscience determine the disposition. I, too, believe that science should \ndetermine this issue.\n  I hope, as we continue the discussion today on this matter, we \nconsider the significant merits of exposing the American taxpayer to \nupwards of $100 billion in liability. Are we going to stop this program \nin its tracks at this time? If we let science make the determination \nabout Yucca Mountain, then the funding should be restored and the \nprogram should be allowed to reach a determination about suitability \none way or another. That is the orderly way to approach this. That was \nthe general consensus of Members relative to the process which \nauthorized the funding all these years, and we are still in the process \nof reaching a determination on suitability. That should be allowed to \nbe funded at a level so we can make that determination.\n  If the suitability determination is not there, then, obviously, the \nproject cannot go forward; it would have to be terminated. But that, \nagain, should be a decision made by science and not the political \nprocess associated with this body.\n  I hope the Senate conferees will address this at an appropriate time, \nand it may be necessary that we move an amendment to restore the funds \non the floor, but there are other Members who want to talk on this \nissue.\n  I yield the floor, and I will be happy to respond to any questions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, before my friend from Alaska leaves the \nfloor,\n\n[[Page S7843]]\n\nI take this opportunity to briefly respond.\n  In all my dealings with the then-chairman of the Energy Committee, \nnow the ranking member, he has set an example of how one should treat \npeople. He has always been available on difficult issues, on easy \nissues. He has never, as a result of our disagreement on a subject, \ndone anything to be vengeful on something else that was important to \nNevada. I have the greatest respect for the junior Senator from Alaska. \nHe has been, in my estimation, a real role model as to how one should \nbe a legislator.\n  On this issue we disagree. There are so many issues involved with \nthis. Because I am from Nevada, I always consider myself maybe not the \nright person to speak about this issue. Maybe someone else should speak \nabout it. Therefore, I am not going to speak a lot other than to say we \nnot only have the characterization problem with Yucca Mountain but the \nunbelievably difficult problems dealing with transportation.\n  Senator Bryan and I traveled to St. Louis a year or two ago and met \nwith the county commissioners, the legislative body that governs the \ncounty where St. Louis is located. We made a presentation to them. \nThey, a short time after that, passed a resolution saying they were \nopposed to Yucca Mountain and they didn't want any nuclear waste \ntraveling through St. Louis.\n  People feel that way all over the country. The problems dealing with \ntransportation are complex, difficult, and almost impossible. That is \nwhy in Europe they have gone away from the burial of nuclear waste and, \nbasically speaking, to now where they are going to try to do \ntransmutation that we should already be doing in America.\n  We had a program going that was killed in the early 1980s. It was the \nClinch River in Tennessee. Transmutation was terminated. Why? Because \nthere was a belief at the height of the cold war that some of this \nprocessed plutonium could make its way into the hands of the wrong \npeople. In hindsight, that was a very bad choice. Now in this bill we \nhave money to again begin this process. The comanager of this bill, \nSenator Domenici, and I have worked hard to increase that funding.\n  I have not tried to, in any way, be mean spirited with the cuts we \nhave made with Yucca Mountain. These moneys are not just thrown away; \nthey have gone to extremely important programs. I have a little \ndifficulty crying big alligator tears over a program that still has \n$275 million to be spent in 1 year. We are going to conference with the \nHouse. Of course, there would have to be changes made there, I am sure. \nBut the changes are not going to be easy because we have programs for \nplaces in Ohio and we have programs in South Carolina, in Idaho, and in \nWashington, where huge amounts of money are going to clean up the mess \nthat we as a Government made dealing with things nuclear.\n  So I understand from where my friend from Alaska is coming. It is a \ndifficult problem. My personal belief is that we as a country and as a \nworld would be better if we simply said let's leave it where it is, in \ndry cask storage. We will save hundreds of billions of dollars doing \nthat, and we won't have the transportation problems. It would be safe \nfor a hundred years. By then, we will have something to do with the \nproduct.\n  I know that my friend, the senior Senator from Idaho, has indicated \nhe wants to speak on this issue and perhaps offer an amendment. The \njunior Senator from Nevada has indicated that he wants to speak on this \nissue. Perhaps during the day we will do that.\n  Madam President, let me say this. My friend from New Mexico is not \nhere. I am not frustrated, but I am arriving at the point where I am a \nlittle bit frustrated. This is a bill involving more than $25 billion. \nOver $20 billion of this bill goes to defense-related activities, which \nis important for this country. We need to move this legislation along. \nThere are a lot of phantom amendments out there. Bring them on. Let's \nhave a debate and move this legislation along.\n  It is very apparent to me that there is an effort being made to stall \nthis legislation, slow down the progress of what we are doing in the \nSenate. As our distinguished majority leader mentioned last night, this \nlegislation is important to the President of the United States. It is \nhis agencies we are trying to fund--the Bureau of Reclamation, Corps of \nEngineers, Department of Energy. So I really don't know what people are \ngaining by having us accomplish nothing.\n  The majority leader said we are going to work to complete this \nlegislation, and we have an a agreement that after this we will go to \nthe Graham nomination, and we will do Transportation this week. I have \nnot spoken to the majority leader, so I am on my own in saying this. \nBut we don't have to sit around here and do nothing. There can be \nvotes. We can vote on all kinds of things. I think that Thursday and \nFriday, if there is still the view that we are going to do nothing, \nthere would probably be some votes; I would think we would be going \nuntil sometime on Friday.\n  I have tried since last week to get an agreement as to when \namendments would be filed, and we can't get either a finite list or a \nfiling deadline. We can't get those. Yet no amendments are being \noffered. So I hope that later this afternoon we can have a time when we \ncan determine not only what amendments are going to be filed but be \nmore certain to have amendments filed at the desk.\n  It is my understanding that the Senator from Ohio, who has a lot of \nknowledge on things nuclear--and I have worked with him on a number of \ndifferent issues--wishes to speak on energy-related matters generally. \nIs that true?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I have no objection to yielding. It is my understanding \nthere are no time constraints. The Senator wishes to speak for 20, 25 \nminutes; is that correct?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I yield to my friend from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I rise to generally speak about the \nissue of energy in this country and to underscore the fact that one of \nthe sources of energy that we really need to look at is nuclear energy. \nThe sooner we resolve the issue of how we deal with nuclear waste, the \nbetter for this Nation. We ought to do everything in our power to \naccelerate the decision in terms of where that waste is going to be \nlocated if we expect to deal with not only the energy needs of our \ncountry but also with something about which many of us are concerned, \nand that is climate change.\n  Nuclear power is a source of energy that does not produce greenhouse \ngases, and I think it is something that should be a priority for the \nSenate and for this Nation to resolve once and for all.\n  My other remarks will deal with the issue of the fact that in spite \nof much talk and much writing, conservation and alternative fuels are \nnot going to be able to deal with the problem we have in this Nation in \nterms of our energy crisis. We have that crisis because we lack a \nnational energy policy. We haven't had one for 30 years, and it is a \nRepublican and Democrat problem.\n  We have a faulty deregulation law in California. We have \nenvironmental policies that have contributed to a lack of diversity and \ndifficulties in siting new facilities, pipelines, and transmission \nlines. We are too reliant on foreign sources of oil, and we have \ninappropriately demonized nuclear power.\n  Today, we are a fossil-based economy, although there is broad \nrecognition that we are eventually going to shift away from primary \nreliance on fossil fuels to much greater use and emphasis on other \nsources.\n  Several alternative energy sources exist today. They are either \ninexhaustible, i.e. solar, wind and nuclear--or renewed through natural \nprocesses--i.e. hydropower or plant-based fuels such as ethanol and \nvegetable oils.\n  Currently the contribution of alternative energy sources to U.S. \nneeds range from less than one tenth of 1 percent for wind and solar \npower, 3 percent from hydroelectric and biofuels each and 8 percent \nfrom nuclear energy.\n  Today, however fossil fuel reserves appear to be adequate to serve \nthe Nation's current energy needs, with a 70-year reserve for oil and \napproximately\n\n[[Page S7844]]\n\n250 years of reserves for coal, at current consumption rates.\n  One of my colleagues noted a while ago that wind power is the fastest \ngrowing source of electricity in the world and we should look to it \nmore seriously as an alternative energy source.\n  Another one of my colleagues pointed out that solar panels covering a \n100 by 100 mile square would produce enough solar energy to power this \nentire Nation.\n  The truth is that although alternative energy sources are being used \nin some places across the country, we have been subsidizing solar and \nwind power for 25 years now, and combined they only make up one tenth \nof 1 percent of the total energy demand to date.\n  Renewables are now generally costlier than fossil fuels, for example, \nsolar power is currently 8 to 10 times more costly. Even assuming \noptimistic technology scenarios, it will take at least 30 to 40 years \nbefore renewables' energy infrastructure could be built up from its \ncurrent level and start contributing significantly to our energy \nsupplies.\n  As this chart shows, costs have a disproportionate impact on low-\nincome families.\n  Since the beginning of the 107th Congress, I have been holding a \nseries of public meetings across the state of Ohio where I have asked \nindividuals and business owners to relay their experiences as to how \nour energy crisis is impacting them.\n  In Cleveland, I have held a meeting with Catholic Charities, Lutheran \nHousing, and Salvation Army as well as senior citizens, low-income \nparents, and handicapped individuals, and another with some small \nbusinesspeople to talk about the impact energy costs were having on \ntheir businesses.\n\n  Another was with governmental agencies and the increase our heating \nbills had on their budgets. Then I met with some folks who talked about \nthe impact our high cost of gasoline was having on their businesses. \nOne of the things the people of America should note is that when it \ngets to energy costs, the least of our brethren are those who are \nimpacted the most.\n  As this chart shows, the people making under $10,000 in the United \nStates of America spend 29 percent of their income on energy costs, and \nthose making between $10,000 and $24,000 spend 13 percent, and those \nwho are over $50,000, about 4 percent.\n  This energy crisis, quite frankly, is impacting more, as I refer to \nit, the least of our brethren than any other segment in our society. \nFor example, the Catholic diocese said in the year 2000 their help line \nreceived 3,400 calls for basic needs, items such as food, utilities, \nmortgage, or rent. The number of calls the diocese received went up 96 \npercent from 1999 to 2000 and 194 percent from 1998 to 2000--\nattributable to this energy crisis.\n  Let's look at U.S. energy consumption by fuel so we get an idea of \nfrom where our energy actually is coming. As we can see by this chart, \nthe principal sources of energy today are oil, natural gas, and \npetroleum. It goes without saying that these fuels have become \nessential elements in creating our way of life.\n  Despite the fact each year we use energy more efficiently, energy \ndemand rises about two-thirds the rate of economic growth. As we can \nsee, nuclear, hydro, and renewables are at the bottom of the chart, and \nany shortfall created between production and consumption of our three \nmain energy sources--that is, oil, natural gas, and coal--is going to \nbe made up in imports.\n\n  For example, oil imports have risen, as we are all aware, from 1973, \nwhen they were 36 percent, to 2001 at 56 percent. Refined gasoline net \nimports have risen from 1 percent in 1980 to approximately 5 percent in \n2000. The reason for it is we have had to import oil to make up for the \nlack of our own production.\n  Oil and natural gas demand is expected to continue to grow for the \nforeseeable future. Alternative energy sources, such as wind and solar \npower, are being pursued but will not alter this outlook for decades to \ncome, again making the point that for those who say do not worry about \nthese three major sources of energy, we are going to make it up with \nnonrenewables, we can see the large discrepancy.\n  Now that we know how much Americans expect to consume over the next \ntwo to three decades, it is important to look at how that expectation \nwill be met given our current state of resources. This chart shows how \nmuch energy we produce domestically by fuel type.\n  At the top of the list are natural gas, coal, petroleum, and then we \nhave nuclear and renewables at the bottom of the list.\n  According to the Department of Energy, natural gas is expected to be \nthe fastest growing component of world energy consumption. Gas use is \nprojected to almost double to 162 trillion cubic feet in 2020 from 84 \ntrillion cubic feet in 1999. So the world demand for natural gas is \ngoing up.\n  It is that increase in natural gas prices that drove up the cost of \nenergy in my State for my homeowners, my businesses, my farmers, and \nfor the other portions of our economy. If that continues, we can see \ncontinuing high prices.\n  We need to increase our infrastructure. According to a study by the \nnonprofit operator of New England's power grid, New England will be \nincreasing its natural gas demand from 16 percent in 1999 to a \nprojected 45 percent in 2005, but they lack--another thing we need to \ntalk about--the local pipelines to distribute the gas to its market. We \nhave a need for gas. The next question is, How do we get it to folks? \nWe know we do not have the infrastructure to do that.\n  With that in mind, we also know there is an estimated 40 percent of \nundiscovered natural gas that is located on land owned by the Federal \nand State Governments. These resources will need to be tapped to \naccommodate the inevitable increase in natural gas consumption. If not, \nthen we face the hardship of increasing dependence on foreign resources \nthat will have the capacity to cripple our energy economy and again \ndrive up our cost.\n  The challenge to produce more oil and natural gas is greater because \nthe production from our existing resource base is subject to natural \ndecline through depletion.\n  Fuel cells, electric vehicles, hybrids, biomass, solar, and wind \ntechnology, all represented on this chart as nonhydropower renewables, \nare all promising energy sources for the future, but right now there is \nno suitable infrastructure in place that will allow for these energies, \neven combined, as we will see in later charts, to sufficiently supply \ncurrent needs, much less future demands.\n  Energy consumption: As we can see by this chart, Americans consume \nmore energy than we produce and will continue to consume more energy, \nespecially fossil fuels, for decades to come.\n  Although several alternative energy sources exist today, the chart \nreflects that even the combination of those sources, marked \n``renewables'' at the bottom of the chart, through 2020 will not \ncompensate for the need for energy production that will take place over \nthe next two decades.\n\n  Even if we double or triple renewables, we will not make up the \ndifference between production and consumption. The President is right: \nWe need more refineries, more electric powerplants, more coal, and more \nnatural gas pipelines and production. It is plain to see that we will \nnot be able to conserve our way out of this crisis. While conservation \nhelps, it is not going to meet our estimated consumption without \ndrastically changing Americans' standard of living.\n  Looking at this chart, we can see renewable energy sources that \nreflect some of the most promising forms of alternative energy in \nexistence today. However, each is accompanied by extremely realistic \nlimitations that hamper their ability to be viable in the near future.\n  We hear a lot about fuel cells, and I have studied fuel cells \nsubstantially. I met with the president of General Motors. He said it \nis going to be 10 to 15 years before fuel cells will be marketable and \ncommercially viable.\n  Electric vehicles: I visited a facility in Euclid, OH, Alliance \nElectric, a Rockwell Automation subsidiary, and they are working on a \nlittle gismo for hybrid automobiles, but it is going to be 5 to 6 years \nbefore they get that down to a cost where it is going to be \ncommercially viable.\n  We have biomass and solar power to which I made reference.\n  All of these are available, but the practical impact on our needs in \nthis\n\n[[Page S7845]]\n\ncountry in the next 20 years is negligible.\n  World primary energy is another issue at which we ought to look. This \nis not to say that alternative fuels are destined for failure. I agree \nwith the President that we need to diversify our energy sources. I \nbelieve promoting technology of these sources is the right approach to \ntake, not for the near term but for the future.\n  We as a government should continue to invest in providing grants and \nincentives to move forward with some of these alternatives. Over time, \nwe have learned advancing technologies is perhaps the single most \nimportant factor that contributes to long-term productivity and \neconomic growth. For example, we have clean coal technology available \nthat we could use for burning coal. We need to move forward with that.\n  This chart is a little complicated, but it shows how energy sources \nhave peaked in the world: Oil going down, gas going up, and we are \nseeing nuclear at the bottom of the chart. This little bit is the \nincrease in renewables.\n  Again, if you look at the world picture, we have a problem. Today, \nChina imports oil. They used to export oil. We are seeing that all over \nthe world. The economy is getting better for all people. Their standard \nof living is going up and they are using more. We need more energy.\n  On petroleum production, the United States is the world's largest \nenergy producer, consumer, and net importer. It is no secret the United \nStates is becoming more and more dependent on foreign oil imports. This \nchart reflects what we have to look forward to by way of dependence \nthrough the year 2020. This is petroleum production and consumption, \nwhich is going up. Imports in the month of April as a percentage of \npetroleum delivered was 62.4 percent. This time last year it was only \n60 percent. The total petroleum products delivered to the domestic \nmarket in April was over 19 million barrels per day. In the same month \nlast year, it was 18\\1/2\\ million barrels per day.\n  Scarce petroleum resources is not a problem experienced only by the \nUnited States. The energy crisis is being felt across the globe; so \nmuch so that inevitably, as foreign countries realize an increase in \ntheir own energy needs, they will be less willing to accommodate the \ngrowing energy demands our country places on them. With the increased \nreliance on foreign oil, we will not get far if we do not work to \nexpand the current oil and natural gas pipeline system.\n  Our Nation's 200,000-mile pipeline system is the world's largest. \nThese nearly invisible ribbons of steel deliver more than 13.3 billion \nbarrels of crude oil and petroleum products in a typical year. Without \nthem, it will take thousands of trucks and barges clogging the Nation's \nroads and waterways to do the job. The capacity of the system, however, \nis being seriously eroded and the future of oil and natural gas \ntransmission does not appear promising.\n  If we refuse to act, the alternative will be a continued capacity \nsqueeze and higher transmission costs, passed on to the consumer. That \nis one of the problems we had last year with the big spike in gasoline. \nWe had a break in two lines, one coming from the Gulf of Mexico, the \nother coming from Canada. That had a dramatic increase on the cost of \noil to the people living in Ohio and other parts of the Midwest.\n  On conservation and its impact, this chart shows what we can expect \nunder three different energy production scenarios through the year \n2020. The top line assumes constant energy use with respect to economic \ngrowth, and it is going up. Hopefully, the economy continues to grow. \nThis means if a nation continued along the same path we are traveling, \nthrough 2020, with energy demands rising with proportion to growth, and \nthere were no technological advances made, consumption would increase \ndramatically.\n  The bottom line represents energy production growth without \nsignificant change. If we stay the way we are now, we are in very big \ntrouble. The second line shows what the Department of Energy predicts \nwill happen when or if consumers are offered a menu of available \ntechnologies from which to choose. An example would be a family \nreplacing a vehicle after several years of usage for a more fuel-\nefficient automobile. This menu of options makes a big difference when \ncompared to increased energy intensity and consumption in the first \nline. We need to move forward in order to meet our demand.\n  The third path reflects the impact of conservation at its height. \nThis includes nonuse and the use of the most competent and efficient \ntechnology combined. This chart shows an ``available technology'' \nconsumption curve by barely 20 percent. There is still a considerable \ngap between consumption, even at the greatest levels of conservation. \nWe need to be concerned about it.\n\n  The point I am making this morning is that we have a challenge to \nmeet the energy needs of this country. Those people who advocate \nconservation and alternative fuels, renewables and so forth, as the \nanswer to the problem, frankly, are not being intellectually honest or \nfacing reality. That means the Members of this Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives are going to have to face up to the issue of how to \nharmonize this Nation's environmental needs and this Nation's energy \nneeds so we can come up with a realistic energy policy.\n  It is very important for the future of our country. I happen to \nbelieve, in terms of issues that need to be dealt with, we need to face \nthis head on as soon as possible. President Bush should be given a \ngreat deal of encouragement for coming up with a comprehensive energy \npolicy that is being quarterbacked by the Vice President of the United \nStates. It is long overdue to get on with the issue of debating how it \nis that we are going to confront this energy crisis that is having such \na negative impact on the people in my State of Ohio, the people who \nlive in our inner cities, our small businesspeople.\n  I had a meeting this week with small businesspeople, manufacturers. I \nasked the question, How many believe we are not in recession? There was \nnot a hand that went up. Part of the reason they are being negatively \nimpacted is the fact that the energy costs are skyrocketing. We have a \nvery large plastics industry. We have more jobs in plastic than any \nother State. Because of the high cost of natural gas, they are now in a \nnoncompetitive position and are laying off workers. For farmers in our \nState, natural gas is used in fertilizer. As a result, our corn crop \nwill be 25 percent less this year because of the cost of fertilizer.\n  Some fertilizer companies are not manufacturing fertilizer this year \nbut selling their natural gas contracts and are making more doing that \nrather than selling fertilizer.\n  The point I am making is, the energy crisis is cutting across my \nState and, I am sure, the State of the Presiding Officer and all other \nSenators. We owe it to our constituents to make sure we do not duck, \ntake a walk, be unwilling to make the hard decisions we are going to \nhave to make to deal with this problem, including the issue of what do \nwe do with waste from our nuclear energy plants in this country. There \nare still people who demonize nuclear energy, for example, and fail to \nrecognize our entire nuclear fleet has had not one problem since Three \nMile Island, very little problem whatsoever. It is a safe way of \nproducing energy. Europe is into it. We have had it in limbo because of \nthe fact it has been demonized.\n  More important than that is how to deal with the nuclear waste. It is \ntime we moved on with this. I hope this energy appropriations bill puts \nin enough money so we can intellectually move forward in resolving that \nissue. If it is not Yucca Mountain, what are the alternatives? We have \nto come up with a solution for what we do with our nuclear waste, to \ntake advantage of nuclear energy in this country.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Feingold).

Mr. President, I rise to speak to a topic that is very \nmuch on the minds of the American people as well as policymakers in \nWashington, DC; that is, the issue of embryonic stem cell research. The \nissue of embryonic stem cell research is one that has captured the \nimagination of people all over the world in the last 2 to 3 years. It \nwasn't that long ago that the idea of taking cells very early in life \nand having their potential captured and set in different directions to \nhelp treat disease--to help make diagnoses--was really just a \npipedream. Literally, it was 2 or 3 years ago.\n  Now, because of the advances in science, the advances in technology \nand the tremendous research that is being conducted in this country \nand, indeed, around the world, a whole new frontier has opened--the \nfrontier of what is called stem cell research. I will mention a little \nbit about what that is, but what captures people's minds so much is the \npromising aspect of this research. What has inspired such interest in \nthis is the fact that people with numerous diseases, for really the \nfirst time in their lives, can look ahead and say there is the \npotential for a cell at its earliest level to be channeled in certain \ndirections to make the care of that disease easier, and possibly even \ncured.\n  The same hope--I hear it daily--is expressed by people with diabetes, \nAlzheimer's disease, or Parkinson's disease, and for spinal cord \ninjuries. Indeed, this stem cell research--both adult stem cells and \nembryonic stem cells--has opened up a new frontier that is full of \npotential, full of hope, and full of promises.\n  The issue is being addressed by the leaders of our country. It is \nbeing addressed in amendments on the floor of the Senate. It is being \naddressed by groups considering the ethics among the think tanks. It is \nbeing considered by the administration as we speak.\n\n  I would like to make four points.\n  No. 1, in any of these arenas where we are talking about life--and \nindeed I believe upon fertilization--there is a continuum from a sperm \nand an egg, to a blastocyst, to a fetus, to a child, to an adolescent, \nto an adult. That continuum is indeed life.\n  As policymakers, we will be injecting our own feelings and our own \nbeliefs into this debate as we go forward. Therefore, I wish to make it \nclear to my colleagues that from my perspective I do value life and \ngive moral significance to the embryo and to the blastocyst and to that \nfull continuum.\n  I, indeed, am pro-life. I oppose abortion. My voting record on the \nfloor of this body is consistent with that. Those beliefs are based on \nthe very strongly held spiritual beliefs that I have. They are based on \nmy medical understanding, having spent 20 years in the field of \nmedicine, and in science--that medical understanding of this process of \nlife and of living tissues. I do give moral significance to the embryo, \nas I mentioned earlier.\n  Second, I am a transplant surgeon. I had the opportunity to serve on \ncommittees that looked at the ethical considerations surrounding the \nuse of tissues and the transplantation of those tissues. I have served \non committees sponsored by the United Network For Organ Sharing--the \nregistry that oversees transplantation in this country. I have served \non the board of local organizations and tissue procurement agencies. I \nhave served on the ethics committees within hospitals. I have had the \nreal privilege of writing scores of peer-reviewed papers in the field \nof transplantation and scientific papers in the field of \ntransplantation--both basic science and clinical transplantation of \nliving tissues. I wrestle on a daily basis with these decisions \nsurrounding life and death and health and healing. I have had the \nopportunity to routinely deal with many of these end-of-life tissues.\n  I have also been blessed with having had the opportunity and the \ntraining to transplant tissues myself--to take a beating heart out of \nan individual who has healthy lungs, a healthy heart, healthy kidneys, \nand to take that beating heart from that individual that, yes, does \nterminate the living function of the lungs and the kidneys and the \nother organs, but to take that heart and give it to another on really a \nweekly basis before coming to the Senate, and allowing that individual \nto live in a new life, a better quality of life; an individual who \nwithout that transfer of tissue otherwise had no hope.\n  I mention that, because the ethical construct and ethical and moral \ndecisionmaking that we are having to face today in a much earlier point \non this continuum of life is very similar to what we debated and talked \nabout--what our scientists debated and talked about--what our ethicists \ndid--what our medical scientists did about 30 years ago in \ntransplantation. To whom do you give scarce resources? To whom do you \nnot give a heart or a lung because we have this shortage? Which organ \ntissues are suitable for transplantation?\n  I have had the privilege--really the blessing--to be able to see the \nrigorous consent process we have now established in a very solid \nfashion surrounding the use of tissue taken from one source and given \nto another source. Again, it is not an exact parallel, but it is \nsimilar from the large ethical construct in transplantation 30 years \nago to what happens after birth, to the moving of tissues, or cells in \nthis particular case, in a period much earlier along the time line, at \na time 5 to 6 days after a sperm and egg come together.\n  I am convinced, based on this personal experience, based on \nprofessional experience, that we can address this use of living tissue, \nliving tissue that otherwise would not be used. It is critically \nimportant that we understand, and in our moral and ethical framework \nensure, that this tissue otherwise would not be used. It is similar to \nthe fact that when I do a heart transplant, that heart otherwise would \nnot be used for anything useful. That individual would likely be buried \n6 days later or 10 days later.\n  To use that tissue that has no other use--and that is where this \ninformed consent process is important when we are talking about stem \ncell research, to benefit other people, people with diabetes and \nParkinson's disease and Alzheimer's and spinal cord injuries, who may \npotentially benefit from this new research.\n  It was not easy in transplantation 30 years ago, but we did it. And \nthrough organizations such as the United Network for Organ Sharing, a \nnational registry, strong Government oversight, full transparency, full \npublic accountability, discourse among not just the scientists--because \nthey are going to push for it hard--but discourse on the public square, \nwhere you get the input of the theologians and the ethicists and the \nphilosophers and the medical doctors and the clinicians, and the \nparents, as well as the scientists themselves--the consent process; I \nwill come back to it very briefly--but the consent process must be \ncomprehensive.\n  That is the only way we can avoid the potential abuse, the potential \nfor overcommercialization of this process. We have to make sure the \nconsent process protects against coercion. We can look back to that \ntransplant arena because we addressed it 30 years ago. Again, this is \nmuch later in the continuum of life, when we are doing heart \ntransplants and lung transplants, but we must come back and superimpose \na comprehensive consent process much earlier in time.\n  The third issue is research. As I mentioned, this is new research. It \nis exciting. It gives hope to millions and millions of people. But \nlet's not over-sell the potential. This research is new. It is \nuncharted. It is evolving. It is untried and untested. Therefore, we \ncannot predict exactly what is going to come from this research. So \nlet's not oversell the research in order to build public support for \nwhatever position we take.\n  We should not let the potential of this research drive the moral \nconsiderations themselves. Thus, we must set up a very important, \nstrong, transparent, ethical construct in which this decisionmaking can \nbe made, and needs to be made, on an ongoing basis. We do not know what \nthe next great discovery is going to be 6 months from now. We cannot \nlock into place either the moral considerations or the way we consider \nwhether or not it is appropriate to look in a new field of science.\n  So the oversight process has to be responsive, has to be ongoing. It \nhas to\n\n[[Page S7847]]\n\nrecognize that science moves very quickly. The lack of predictability \nmeans there is the potential for abuse of the science itself. Again, \nthat is why we must consider this issue in this body, why politics or \npolicy must be engaged to prevent the potential for abuse. Anytime we \nare talking about the manipulation of life or living tissues at this \nearly point, there is the potential for abuse. Thus, I conclude that \nembryonic stem cell research and adult stem cell research should be \nfederally funded within a carefully regulated, fully transparent, fully \naccountable framework that ensures the highest level of respect for the \nmoral significance of the human embryo, the moral significance of the \nhuman blastocyst.\n\n  There is this unique interplay of this potentially powerful \nresearch--uncharted research--this new evolving science with those \nmoral considerations of life, of health, of healing. That interplay \ndemands this comprehensive, publicly accountable oversight structure I \npropose.\n  I very quickly have addressed this issue in a comprehensive way. The \nreason I am in this Chamber and take this opportunity to speak is for \npeople to actually see that the issue is a complicated issue but one \nthat has to be addressed in a larger framework than just to say: \nFunding, yes or no.\n  There are basically 10 points I think we must consider, and I have \nproposed an answer. Again, I don't know the answer, and I struggle, \nlike every person, on this particular issue to make sure we have the \nappropriate moral considerations. But I will outline what my 10 points \nare.\n  No. 1, we should ban embryo creation for research. The creation of \nhuman embryos solely for research purposes should be strictly \nprohibited.\n  No. 2, we should continue the funding ban on the derivation of \nembryonic stem cells. We need to accomplish this by strengthening and \ncodifying the current ban on Federal funding for the derivation of \nembryonic stem cells.\n  No. 3, we should ban human cloning. We need to prohibit all human \ncloning to prevent the creation and the exploitation of life for \nresearch purposes.\n  No. 4, we should increase adult stem cell research funding. These \nadult stem cells, stem cells that are removed from an adult, that you \ncan back out in such a way that you can capture the potential for using \nthem for treatments for various diseases--we should increase this \nfunding for research on adult stem cells to ensure the pursuit of all \npromising areas of stem cell research, on both adult stem cells which \noccur much later in life and the embryonic stem cells which are derived \nat the 5- or 6-day-old blastocysts.\n  No. 5, provide funding for embryonic stem cell research only from \nblastocysts that would otherwise be discarded. We need to allow Federal \nfunding for research using only those embryonic stem cells derived from \nblastocysts that are left over after in vitro fertilization and would \notherwise be discarded.\n  No. 6, require a rigorous informed consent process to ensure that the \nblastocysts used for stem cell research are only those that would \notherwise be discarded. We must require a comprehensive informed \nconsent process establishing a clear separation between a potential \ndonor's primary decision to donate blastocysts for adoption or to \ndiscard blastocysts and their subsequent option to donate blastocysts \nfor research purposes. Such a process is modeled on this well \nestablished and broadly accepted organ and tissue donation process in \nwhich I have been so intimately involved over the last 20 years.\n  No. 7, limit the number of stem cell lines. I believe we should \nrestrict federally funded research using embryonic stem cells derived \nfrom blastocysts to a limited number of cell lines. This does not mean \nlimiting it to research using stem cells that have already been derived \nto date, most of which would reportedly not be eligible even under the \ncurrent NIH guidelines that need much strengthening. In \ntransplantation, when I remove a heart from an individual and I give it \nto another individual, that one individual benefits. With stem cells, \nit is very different. From a stem cell line, you derive the cells, and \nthat stem cell line can be used for multiple experiments, thousands of \ninvestigations as we go forward.\n\n  No. 8, establish a strong public research oversight system. I believe \nwe should establish an appropriate public oversight mechanism, \nincluding a national research registry, to ensure the transparent, in-\ndepth monitoring of federally funded and federally regulated stem cell \nresearch and to promote high ethical, moral, and quality research \nstandards.\n  No. 9, require ongoing, independent scientific and ethical review. We \nneed to establish an ongoing scientific review of stem cell research by \nthe Institute of Medicine and create an independent Presidential \nadvisory panel to monitor evolving bioethical issues in the area of \nstem cell research. In addition, we need to require the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to report to Congress annually on the status \nof Federal grants for stem cell research, the number of stem cell lines \ncreated, the results of stem cell research, the number of grant \napplications received and awarded, and the amount of Federal funding \nprovided.\n  Lastly, No. 10, strengthen and harmonize fetal tissue research \nrestrictions. Because stem cell research would be subject to new, \nstringent Federal requirements, I believe we must ensure that informed \nconsent and oversight regulations applicable to federally funded fetal \ntissue research be made consistent with these new rules.\n  During the past several months, rarely has a week passed without a \nnewspaper story or scientific publication about possible research \nbreakthroughs involving adult or embryonic stem cells--and the ethical \nissues raised by this research. Today, Americans' thoughts on stem cell \nresearch are debated on Sunday talk shows; photographs of microscopic \nblastocysts grace the cover of our nation's news magazines; and--twice \nin the last week alone--we have been reminded by those on the \nunregulated medical research frontier that human cloning and the \ncreation of embryos for research is no longer relegated only to the \nrealm of science fiction.\n  Across the country, families are discussing the difficult moral \nissues that are raised by stem cell research around their kitchen \ntables. At their offices, co-workers are weighing the potential \nbenefits of stem cell research against its morality. And many of my \ncolleagues are personally grappling with the difficult decision of how \nbest to approach these issues.\n  An explosion of medical and scientific innovations are producing new \ntreatments and hope for patients suffering from a wide range of \ndisease. This has been accompanied by a newfound awareness among \npolicymakers, and the public, of the potential of biomedical research--\nan awareness that has spawned an insatiable appetite for more and \nfaster advances. As a physician and a researcher, I am honored to have \nplayed my part in this movement--helping to foster broad, bipartisan \nsupport for increasing funding for biomedical research and, \nspecifically, for the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n  However, we must always remember that science should not be practiced \nin a vacuum. And, with the ever-increasing pace of progress has come \nnew challenges--posed by a variety of ethical dilemmas--that have, at \ntimes, outraced the ability of public policy and we, as legislators, to \nrespond. Yet, I deeply believe that we have an obligation to do just \nthat.\n  There are those, I believe, who would tell us that ``politics'' \nshould not impinge on the scientific process. As a legislator and a \nmedical researcher, I can tell you that is not the case. Rather than \nleaving the progress and the ethics of science only to be determined by \nresearchers and bioethicists, ``politics'' should, and does have, an \nimportant role in deciding what research is not only scientifically \npromising but also societally acceptable. This role is to determine, as \nthe Washington Post noted several years ago and as I have referred to \nsince, ``is there a line that should not be crossed, even for \nscientific or other gain, and if so, where is it?''\n  Moreover, politics and policy plays a crucial role in guiding and \nensuring the ethical pursuit of science, as well as restraining the \ninclination of science, left unchecked, to move beyond ethically \nacceptable boundaries. That, then, is our challenge.\n\n[[Page S7848]]\n\n  Today we are faced with the issue of embryonic stem cell (ES) \nresearch--research that carries both great promise and great peril. \nMost of us have been made aware, by now, of the tremendous potential of \nembryonic stem cells for therapeutic advances for a variety of \nconditions--diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, \nleukemia, spinal cord injuries, to name a few.\n  Embryonic stem cells are derived from a five to six day old embryo, \nalso called a blastocyst. By this stage, the embryo has formed two \nlayers: the inner cell mass which will form the embryo proper and the \nextra embryonic tissues that form the placenta and supportive cells. \nAlthough these inner cells, roughly 20-30 cells, have lost the ability \nto form supporting tissues, they retain the ability to develop into any \ncell type found in the body and are considered ``pluripotent.'' Over \ntime and if allowed, they continue to multiply and differentiate \nfurther, becoming committed to specific lineages. It is from these \ninner cells found in the blastocyst stage that embryonic stem cells are \nderived. Such pluripotent embryonic stem cells, when properly isolated \nand cultured, appear to contribute to all cell types found in the adult \nand to be capable of indefinite self-renewal.\n  These embryonic stem cells being discussed here are obtained from \nembryos left over following the conclusion of in vitro fertilization \n(IVF). Many of us have known couples who, because of their inability to \nhave children through natural reproduction, have turned to IVF as an \nalternative. Since its introduction to the United States in 1981, more \nthan 45,000 babies have been born using IVF procedures.\n  However, because of the significant implantation failure rate \ninvolved in infertility treatment, current IVF techniques require \ncouples to create more embryos than initially needed as a sort of \ninsurance policy. Typically, physicians will obtain roughly 10 eggs. Of \nthese eggs, only six to eight will become fertilized--producing an \nembryo. Then, in order to avoid producing multiple-fetus pregnancies, \nphysicians will only transfer 2-3 embryos to the uterus. Those not used \nmay be frozen for later use or donated for adoption. In fact, many \ncouples decide to leave embryos frozen, in case they decide to have \nadditional children, rather than beginning the entire process again.\n  Adult stem cells, by contrast, are relatively undifferentiated and \nself-renewing cells that help repair tissues harmed by injury, disease, \nor natural cell death. The most widely known and understood example of \nsuch a cell is the hematopoietic stem cell, found in bone marrow and \nresponsible for the production of blood cells. Other promising cell \ntypes include neural stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells. There have \nalso been publications touting the potential of stem cells found in \nhuman fat tissue as well as umbilical cord blood. Until recently, adult \nstem cells were considered to be very rare, if they even existed, and \ninflexible--only able to form the cell types for the tissue in which \nthey were found. However, recent news suggests adult stem cells may \nhave more plastic properties than previously believed.\n  Both embryonic and adult stem cell research hold tremendous potential \nfor a wide range of uses, including clinical applications of cell-based \ntherapies for a number of diseases and injuries. This research may be \nuseful in providing scientists a better understanding of the human \ncellular growth and differentiation process--allowing researchers to \nseek out and attempt to treat or prevent the causes of birth defects \nand genetic abnormalities and diseases. It may also be useful in \npharmaceutical development, allowing researchers to grow large numbers \nof various cell types in order to test drug effectiveness and toxicity.\n  However, it is important that advocates not over-sell the potential \nof either embryonic or adult stem cell research for medical treatments. \nThis evolving science is relatively new, and much basic research \nremains before we can reasonably expect to see clinical trials and \npossible treatments. In fact, to date, with the exception of \nhematopoietic stem cells that have been used in bone marrow \ntransplantation for many years, none of these sources has yet \ndemonstrated proven therapeutic applications.\n  Some of the challenges that remain for both adult and embryonic stem \ncell research include: learning the signals that control the \ndifferentiation of stem cells into a desired type; overcoming the \nchallenge of immune rejection in cell transplantation; and establishing \nconsistent, effective methods to culture, isolate, and grow the cells \nin a timely manner that is consistent with good manufacturing \nprocesses. Yet the hope that they will someday yield therapies for \nthose suffering from chronic and debilitating and life-threatening \ndiseases is powerful.\n  In my work as a physician and heart and lung transplant surgeon, I \nhave for years wrestled with decisions involving life, death, health, \nand healing. Having taken part in hundreds of organ and tissue \ntransplants, I've experienced the ethical dilemmas involved in end-of-\nlife care on numerous occasions. I have seen families faced with the \nmost difficult decision of saying farewell to a loved one. Yet I have \nalso seen their selfless acts in the midst of this sadness to consent \nto donate living organs and tissues of their loved ones to benefit the \nlives of others.\n  Moreover, having performed surgery in the early days of heart and \nlung transplantation, I know the powerful impact that medical progress \nhas had on each of my patients, many of whom are alive today because of \nthe life-saving treatments developed through medical research.\n  Because of my professional experiences, I have, during my nearly \nseven years in the United States Senate, devoted a significant portion \nof my time to address health policy issues as a way to impact patients \non a broader scale than the one-on-one interaction which I knew \npreviously. However, this effort has remained guided by the same basic \nprinciples that informed my career as a practicing physician and \nscientist--to improve the lives and health of patients and deeply \nrespect the dignity of life.\n  During the past few months, I have read much of the medical, \nscientific, and ethical literature relevant to this debate. I have \nqueried my colleagues in the scientific and medical community who have \nfirst-hand experience with stem cell research, reproductive treatments, \nand the ethical issues enmeshed in each. I have talked with \nbioethicists. I have reviewed my own professional medical experience \nfor guidance. I have examined federal public policy precedents \ninvolving medical research. And I have spent a great amount of time in \nprayer and reflection on this issue.\n  As the Senate's only physician, and its only medical researcher, I \nfeel compelled to explain to my colleagues and the American people my \nviews on the proper public policy approach with respect to stem cell \nresearch. This is a critically important decision--one that cannot be \nleft, as some have suggested, only to scientists--and it is vitally \nimportant that each of us is fully aware of the depth of the \nscientific, ethical, and moral issues involved.\n  I mention that this issue should not be driven totally by the \nresearch community. Nor should it be determined solely by National \nBioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) commissioners or by patient \nadvocates. Each of these stakeholders certainly has its role to play. \nThe NIH has advocated on behalf of what they see as the direction in \nwhich science is heading. The NBAC has debated the issue and determined \nit worthy of Federal support. And patient advocacy groups have rightly \nworked to advance science that could benefit their particular \nillnesses.\n  However, as a researcher, as someone who has participated in scores \nof clinical investigations on the transplantation of human tissues to \nbenefit others, I know that this decision cannot be left to the sole \njurisdiction of the scientific community. It is our responsibility as \nlegislators to determine the proper role of our Federal government in \nthis evolving, new research and to build in appropriate ethical \nsafeguards.\n  After grappling with the issue--scientifically, ethically, and \nmorally--I believe that both embryonic and adult stem cell research \nshould be federally funded within a carefully regulated, fully \ntransparent framework that ensures the highest level of respect for the \nmoral significance of the human embryo. Because the unique interaction \nbetween this promising but uncharted new science with the ethical and \nmoral considerations of life is continually evolving and presenting new\n\n[[Page S7849]]\n\nchallenges, we must ensure a strong, comprehensive, publicly \naccountable oversight structure that is responsive on an ongoing basis \nto moral, ethical and scientific considerations.\n  As a legislator, I have been consistent in my work to ensure that \nhuman life is treated with the utmost respect and dignity. I am pro-\nlife. My voting record in the Senate has consistently reflected my pro-\nlife philosophy. In my 6-plus years in the Senate, I have voted time \nand time again to preserve human life. For instance, I am proud to have \nbeen a leader in the fight to ban the partial-birth abortion procedure. \nAs a physician, my sole purpose has been to preserve and improve the \nquality of life.\n  Throughout my career on the forefront of heart and lung \ntransplantation, I have had to face the ethics of life and death with \nmy patients and their families. As a surgeon, I have frequently removed \na heart from one individual whose brain has died and placed that heart \ninto another patient who would otherwise die. But this requires \ndetermining when brain death has occurred a process that was very \ncontroversial when it was first developed just 33 years ago.\n  A similar dilemma now confronts us in the field of embryonic stem \ncell research, and I have turned to my own experience as a transplant \nsurgeon for wisdom. The question is much like that faced in the early \ndays of organ transplantation--do we remove organs and tissue for \ntransplantation and research from an individual who is brain dead, but \nwhose other organs continue to live and function normally? Do we allow \nresearch using stem cells derived from blastocysts that could, if \nimplanted, become a fetus, but which the parents clearly have \ndetermined to discard? I believe this is the proper course, but only \nunder the strictest of regulations to ensure a clear separation between \nthe decision of whether to discard excess embryos or donate them for \nadoption and the option to donate such embryos for research.\n  Scientifically, I consider human embryonic stem cell research to be a \npromising and important line of inquiry. I am fully aware and \nsupportive of the advances being made each day using adult stem cells. \nHowever, it seems clear that research using the more versatile \nembryonic stem cells does have greater potential than research using \nadult stem cells and may, under carefully considered and appropriate \nconditions, be conducted ethically. The scientifically prudent course \nfor us as policymakers seems to provide for the pursuit of both \nembryonic and adult stem cell--research allowing researchers in each \nfield to build on the progress of the other.\n  Let me make this clear, however. To say that the research may \nethically be conducted is not to say that the guidelines promulgated by \nthe National Institutes of Health (NIH) are sufficient, as some of my \ncolleagues have asserted. To the contrary, they are severely lacking in \nappropriate safeguards. Nor do any of the present versions of \nlegislation pending in Congress to authorize ES research include \nsufficient protections.\n  Therefore, federal funding for stem cell research should be \ncontingent on the implementation of a comprehensive, strict new set of \nsafeguards and public accountability governing this new, evolving \nresearch--to ensure the progress of this science in a manner respectful \nof the moral significance of human embryos and the potential of stem \ncell research to improve health.\n  I transplant hearts and lungs. I spent 20 years in both medical \ntraining and engaged in surgery. I am board certified in two surgical \nspecialties. I have spent countless hours research and publishing this \nresearch in peer-reviewed medical journals. I was active in clinical \ntransplantation. In each case, families of the donor individual has \ncompleted a comprehensive informed consent process giving consent to \norgan donation. I would weekly get calls in the middle of the night \nsummoning me to the operating room, where I would come face-to-face \nwith individuals near death and their grieving families. Through these \nexperiences, I have seen firsthand the impact that medical progress and \ntechnological have had in reshaping legal and ethical criteria, and, in \nturn, I have seen how ethics has shaped the practice of medicine.\n  Historically, death was not particularly difficult to determine or \ndefine. Generally, all vital systems of the body--respiratory, \nneurological, and circulatory--would fail at the same time and none of \nthese functions could be prolonged without the maintenance of the \nothers. With major technological advances in life support, particularly \nthe development of ventilators, it is possible to keep some bodily \nsystems functioning long after others have ceased.\n  Over time, most state laws adopted a neurological standard for \ndetermining when death occurs. Thus, it has become common, accepted \npractice that requires that both the cerebral cortex and the brain stem \nirreversibly cease to function--this is the so-called ``whole brain \ndeath'' standard. There is now broad public support for organ donation \nupon this basis. But the interplay of science, ethics, and policy did \nnot come easily.\n  As we came to no longer face the inevitable simultaneity of systemic \nfailures, it became necessary to define with greater precision which \nphysiological systems are indicators of life and which are not. In \n1968, a Harvard Medical School special committee report first urged \nthat brain death be used rather than the older definition of \nirreversible circulatory-respiratory failure. This was later embraced \nby a Presidential Commission in 1981 as a recommendation for state \nlegislatures and courts.\n  In this context of life and death decision-making, physicians remove \norgans from individuals for the purpose of organ donation based upon \nthe informed consent of families after determination of ``brain \ndeath,'' at which time the individual is considered to be dead. \nHowever, this decision-making process is carefully protected to ensure \nthat the decision to withdraw life support or declare brain death is \nmade entirely independent of any consideration of obtaining the \nindividual's organs for donation. Even though the body and other organs \nand tissues are technically alive with the assistance of ventilators \nand other medical devices, the brain has ceased to function. When I \nremoved a heart--or a heart and lungs--other organs were living and \nstill functioning. Their organs would be used to save the lives of \nothers. If the family consents following a comprehensive and broadly \naccepted consent process, we permit surgeons to remove living organs \nfrom the body of the individual.\n  The decision to donate the organs of brain dead individuals is, as it \nshould be, a decision separate from all other medical decision-making. \nIt is made by informed consent of family to carry out the intent of the \nindividual. It meets both ethical and practical requirements. First, it \nensures that families are not faced with this difficult decision at a \ntime when they are already struggling with saying good-bye to a loved \none. It ensures that the treating physician is not the individual \napproaching the family for consent. On a very practical, public policy \nlevel, it strengthens the organ donation procedure by reassuring the \npublic that decisions of best medical treatment are clearly divorced \nfrom the considerations of organ donation.\n  The example of organ and tissue donation holds one framework to \nreview in fashioning an approach that both respects the human embryo \nand promotes this new, evolving research. I believe that the human \nembryo is inherently valuable and has moral significance regardless of \nwhether it will be implanted in a woman's uterus or is left-over in the \ncolder, artificial setting of an infertility clinic. Because an embryo \nholds a high measure regardless of status, that embryo should be \nafforded a high level of respect.\n  Because embryonic stem cells appear capable of indefinite self-\nrenewal and differentiating into all adult cell types, this research \nhas tremendous potential to provide new, important cell-based \ntherapies.\n  Research using adult stem cells also holds tremendous promise for \ntreating disease, and recent studies have altered long-held conceptions \nabout the abilities and usefulness of adult stem cells. However, there \nappear to be characteristics--in particular, that they appear to have \nmore limited life spans, are presently more difficult to isolate in \nuseful quantities, and may not be able to form all cell types--that may \nlimit\n\n[[Page S7850]]\n\nthe potential of adult stem cell research. However, it does appear that \nadult stem cells may be able to be manipulated on a scale previously \nthought impossible. Moreover, the apparent differentiation limitations \nplaced on adult stem cells may indeed pose an advantage over embryonic \nstem cells.\n  Nonetheless, it appears clear that research using adult stem cells \ndoes not hold the same potential for medical advances as does the use \nof the more versatile embryonic stem cells. But, as in all research \nendeavors, what we are considering is the potential for advancements. \nScientifically, we will see the best advances in both adult and \nembryonic research by allowing the two to proceed along parallel \ntracks, fostering valuable collaboration and interplay between \nresearchers on each side.\n  Some of my colleagues have advocated that the guidelines promulgated \nby the National Institutes of Health provide a sufficient framework to \nensure that embryonic stem cell research can be conducted ethically. I \nstrongly disagree. On the contrary, I find the NIH guidelines lacking \nin appropriate safeguards.\n  Therefore, Federal funding for stem cell research should be \ncontingent on the implementation of a strict new set of safeguards and \npublic accountability governing this new, evolving research. The \nfollowing 10 points are essential components of a comprehensive \nframework that allows stem cell research to progress in a manner \nrespectful of the moral significance of human embryos and the potential \nof stem cell research to improve health.\n  One, require a rigorous informed consent process: To ensure that \nblastocysts used for stem cell research are only those that would \notherwise be discarded, require a comprehensive informed consent \nprocess establishing a clear separation between potential donors' \nprimary decision to donate blastocysts for adoption or to discard \nblastocysts and their subsequent option to donate blastocysts for \nresearch purposes. Such a process, modeled in part on well-established \nand broadly accepted organ and tissue donation practices, will ensure \nthat donors are fully informed of all of their options.\n  As with organ and tissue donation, we must first ensure that health \ncare providers make no mention of the option to donate excess embryos \nuntil completion of infertility treatment and the decision has been \nmade independently by both members of a couple to discard embryos \nremaining in frozen storage at the clinic. Once that decision has been \nmade, the destiny of the embryos is certain. When couples make this \ndecision and authorize a clinic to discard the embryos, it is clear \nthat the embryos will be dead within a short time frame. Only after \nboth members of a couple have made a firm decision to discard these \nadditional embryos should health care providers or researchers be \nallowed to approach them about the opportunity to donate these embryos \nfor use in research.\n  Moreover, the NIH regulations should strengthen the informed consent \nprocess by requiring stronger informed consent. And regulations should \nensure greater oversight and accountability in the derivation process \nby requiring site visits of labs where cell lines are derived and \nprospective approval of line derivations.\n  Two, ban embryo creation for research: The creation of human embryos \nsolely for research purposes should be strictly prohibited.\n  Last week, researchers announced the creation of three ES cell lines \nderived from embryos created for the express purpose of research. \nLimiting federal funding to research using embryos left over after \nbeing created for reproductive purposes will not prevent the creation \nof embryos only for research purposes by unethical researchers. Such an \naction has been nearly universally decried from all quarters. \nTherefore, we should include a comprehensive ban on the creation of \nembryos through IVF for the sole intent of performing research.\n  Three, continue funding ban on derivation: Strengthen and codify the \ncurrent ban on federal funding for the derivation of embryonic stem \ncells.\n  While we find it important to scientific research and ethically \nacceptable that limited and strictly regulated ES research proceed, \nthis does not mean that federal funds should be used in the derivation \nof ES cells. Rather, a continued ban on federal funding for the \nderivation of ES cells is a right and proper indication and \nacknowledgment that the American people are conflicted on the ethical \nand moral propriety of this issue and do not feel that the proper use \nof federal funds is in the derivation process.\n  Four, ban human cloning: Prohibit all human cloning to prevent the \ncreation and exploitation of life for research purposes.\n  Ban all uses of human cloning. Most are agreed in their opposition to \nreproductive cloning. It is important, however, to also ban non-\nreproductive or research cloning both for the practical, implementation \nreason of making it more likely that such a ban on reproductive cloning \nwill be successful as well as for the broader moral reasons shared by \nthe majority of the American people that human embryos should not be \ncreated for the purpose of research and exploitation.\n  Five, increase adult stem cell research funding: Increase federal \nfunding for research on adult stem cells to ensure the pursuit of all \npromising areas of stem cell research.\n  Although not presently as scientifically promising as ES research, AS \nresearch has seen many advancements in recent years and holds important \npotential for treating disease and injury. Many scientists have noted \nthat not enough science has been completed to determine which of the \ntwo lines of inquiry will produce therapeutic applications and that it \nis therefore scientifically premature to limit research to one type of \nresearch only. Accordingly, in funding ES research, it is important to \nsee that this is done in a manner complementing ongoing AS research so \nthat both lines of inquiry are pursued aggressively and that neither is \npursued to the scientific detriment of the other.\n\n  Six, provide funding for embryonic stem cell research only from \nblastocysts that would otherwise be discarded: Allow Federal funding \nfor research using only those embryonic stem cells derived from \nblastocysts that are left over after in vitro fertilization (IVF) and \nwould otherwise be discarded.\n  Specifically, the regulations should allow the use only of embryos \nthat were created but unused for infertility treatment. These may only \nbe donated from IVF clinics following completion of infertility \ntreatment. Regulations should also include safeguards to prevent \nunethical creation of embryos in excess of clinical need.\n  Seven, limit number of stem cell lines: Restrict federally funded \nresearch using embryonic stem cells derived from blastocysts to a \nlimited number of cell lines. In addition, authorize Federal funding \nfor stem cell research for five years to assure ongoing Congressional \noversight.\n  Limiting the number of cell lines would allow Federal funding to \njumpstart the research into the basic properties of ES cells for more \nin-depth discovery of the capabilities, shortfalls, and properties of \nthese cells, while respecting the ethical sensitivity of the research \nto the American people. Moreover, numerous researchers have expressed \nconcern that, because existing embryonic stem cell lines would not be \nin accord with the present guidelines and regulations laid down by NIH, \nadditional cell lines will have to be created. By limiting the creation \nof cell lines, the research will go forward, but under strong \nrestrictions.\n  Eight, establish a strong public research oversight system: Establish \nappropriate public oversight mechanisms, including a national research \nregistry, to ensure the transparent, in-depth monitoring of federally \nfunded and federally regulated stem cell research and to promote \nethical, high quality research standards.\n  A national research registry would serve as a holding and \ndistribution facility that would provide another level of Federal \noversight and control in the process. The registry would also be able \nto serve an important role of tracking the progress of this research as \nwell as providing a strong oversight mechanism to track the research \nand its attention to public regulations.\n  Nine, require ongoing, independent scientific and ethical review: \nEstablish an ongoing scientific review of stem cell research by the \nInstitute of Medicine (IOM) and create an independent\n\n[[Page S7851]]\n\nPresidential advisory panel to monitor evolving bioethical issues in \nthe area of stem cell research. In addition, require the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to report to Congress annually on the status \nof Federal grants for stem cell research, the number of stem cell lines \ncreated, the results of stem cell research, the number of grant \napplications received and awarded, and the amount of Federal funding \nprovided.\n  Stem cell research is so significant both ethically and \nscientifically, that continued Congressional oversight is important. \nAll of this research should be the subject of ongoing scientific and \nethical review.\n  Ten, harmonize restrictions on fetal tissue research: Because stem \ncell research would be subject to new, stringent Federal requirements, \nensure that informed consent and oversight regulations applicable to \nfederally funded fetal tissue research are consistent with these new \nrules.\n  These principles provide for an appropriate amount of research using \nhuman embryonic stem cells but ensure that such research is not \nconducted to the detriment of research utilizing adult stem cells. They \nbalance the desire to move this research forward on a greater scale \nwith the imperative to maintain the highest level of oversight to \nprevent abuses and the importance of continuing Federal oversight as \nthis research advances.\n  These 10 principles help answer the question I posed earlier: ``Is \nthere a line that should not be crossed even for scientific or other \ngain?'' The clear response is ``Yes.'' It is clear to me that the \ncreation of human embryos for research purposes should not be \nundertaken, regardless of the potential for scientific gain. It is \nclear to me that the use of human cloning should be strictly prohibited \nto prevent the commoditization and exploitation of human life. It is \nclear that the present restriction on the use of Federal funds for the \nderivation should be maintained and strengthened to reflect the \nconcerns of the American people.\n  I know that many people with deeply held views on this issue will \ndisagree with some portion of the position I have outlined today. \nOthers may attempt to divorce certain of these issues from \nconsideration of the others.\n  This should not be done. The fact is that these issues--of stem cell \nresearch, the creation of embryos, human cloning, public restrictions \non the scope of research broadly are all pieces of a larger whole.\n  By pursuing the policy framework I have laid out today, we can help \nset the stage for groundbreaking research with the potential to help \nuntold millions of Americans and individuals worldwide. We will have \nlaid a firm foundation for that research to succeed--a foundation \nwithout which the goal of seeing treatments through embryonic stem cell \nresearch will falter on the fears and uncertainties of Americans. This \nframework provides that firm ethical foundation instilling confidence \nin comprehensive and transparent oversight ensuring that such research \nis conducted with close attention to the difficult ethical and moral \nissues involved.\n  We must define the role of the Federal Government in harnessing this \ntechnology for good. Our task as citizens is to exercise responsible \nstewardship of the precious gift of life. This effort represents a \nfirst step in this process.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to continued participation in this \ndialog on embryonic and adult stem cell research.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Tennessee if he \nneeds further time to finish his statement. His statement was very \nthoughtful, and this is a crucial issue facing our country. If he would \nrequire added time, I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I appreciate the offer of the Senator from \nTexas. I believe my statement will complete my thoughts. I do look \nforward to continued participation of all of us. She and I were both in \na hearing a few minutes ago talking about this very issue.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I appreciate very much what Senator \nFrist, who is the only physician in the Senate, is contributing to the \nissue of stem cell use for research purposes. We have just spent \nseveral hours in a hearing learning from scientists and many others \nabout the differing viewpoints on the need for the use of stem cells \nfor research into many diseases where it is hoped we can find an answer \nthrough the use of these embryonic stem cells. The debate is valid.\n  Senator Frist has pointed out some of the legitimate ethical \nquestions. I hope we can move forward in a way that does increase the \nability to use these types of stem cells and cord blood for looking \ninto the causes and, more importantly, even the treatment of some of \nthe cancers and diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease, \nmultiple myeloma, many forms of cancer where there is great hope that \nwe might have treatment that would allow people to live healthy lives, \nnormal lives, with this kind of treatment, even though they have these \ndiseases.\n  I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his thoughtful contribution to \nthis debate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/18/senate-section/article/S7851-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7851-S7871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2002--Continued\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the Nation's lack \nof an energy policy. Many have spoken earlier today about the fact that \nwe have not taken up an energy policy for our country. It doesn't seem \nto be a priority for the Senate.\n  I disagree with that. I think it is the highest priority for the \nSenate, and I urge the majority to let us debate an energy policy. It \nis time that we have a long-term strategy. We know from what is \nhappening in California right now, where the energy shortage has hit \nvery hard the people of California and the economy of California, that \nwe can't wait and try to do something quickly because quickly doesn't \nwork when you are dealing with something that is so long range.\n  For instance, one of California's big problems is they don't have a \ndistribution system. They have a shortage. Even if they could get the \nenergy into their State, they don't have an adequate distribution \nsystem.\n  President Bush has put forward an energy policy that would address \nlong term some of these issues. As our economy is growing, they are \ngoing to become even more acute.\n  The Congress also has put forward a plan. Senator Murkowski has been \na leader in this effort, as past chairman of the Energy Committee. We \nneed to be able to debate these issues and see where our country is \ngoing.\n  The interesting thing is, our country is going to increase its oil \nconsumption by 33 percent in the next 10 years. It is expected that our \nforeign oil imports will go from 55 percent to 67 percent by the year \n2020.\n  Natural gas consumption will increase by 50 percent. Demand for \nelectricity will rise 45 percent in the next 20 years. We cannot sit on \nantiquated, unreliable, and inadequate distribution systems if we are \ngoing to be able to keep our economy strong, to keep the businesses \ngoing, to keep the jobs in America, and so consumers have good and \nadequate sources of energy. We must address this policy.\n  I call on the majority to make this a priority. Yes, appropriations \nbills are important, but that does not address the long-term needs of \nour country.\n  What would a good energy policy entail? It would entail modernization \nand expansion of our energy infrastructure. That is the distribution \nsystem. We need more pipelines. We need more powerplants. We need to be \nable to get the electricity into the homes and businesses of our \ncountry.\n  We must have diversification of our energy supplies. I have been \ntrying for 3 years, with support across the aisle, very bipartisan, for \ntax credits for small drillers, people who drill 15-barrel-a-day wells. \nWhen prices go below $18 a barrel, those people cannot stay in \nbusiness. Yet all of those little bitty producers together can produce \n500,000 barrels of oil a day, the same amount we import from Saudi \nArabia. But they can't stay in business when prices fall to $18, $17, \n$16 a barrel. We had $9-a-barrel oil just 2 and 3 years ago, and those \npeople went out of business. They kept their wells, and they will never \nbe able to reopen their wells because they are too small. The margins \nare too thin.\n\n[[Page S7852]]\n\n  We want to encourage our small producers of oil and gas by saying \nthere will be a leveling off and a stabilizing when prices go so low \nthat you can't break even. It is the same thing we do for farmers. When \ncrop prices fall below break even--we value having farmers make the \nfood for our country--we stabilize the prices. If we don't open markets \nfor our farmers, we give them subsidies so they can stay in business so \nthey won't have to sell the family farm to a real estate developer.\n\n  That is the same concept we need for the smallest energy producers, \nso we can keep the jobs in America, not send them overseas, and so we \ncan keep the prices at a stable level so that the little guys can stay \nin business and keep their employees employed when prices go below a \nbreak even.\n  This has been supported by Democrats and Republicans. We have \nactually passed it. It has been in other legislation that has been \nvetoed previously. I believe President Bush will sign a bill that \nincludes this kind of tax incentive if we can pass a bill that is \nbalanced, a bill that will give our country a long-term energy policy \nto which we can work for energy sufficiency for our country.\n  We must modernize our conservation and efficient energy use programs. \nI am going to introduce an amendment, if we ever make energy policy a \npriority, that will give incentives to people who buy cars that have \nmore gasoline mileage efficiency. It may be a $250 credit if you buy a \ncar that has a 25-mile-per-gallon efficiency level. These are the kinds \nof things that will encourage people to conserve energy so that it will \nbe more available.\n  A good energy policy has three prongs. It has consumption energy \nefficiency as one leg of the stool, and we should make sure that we \nhave an incentive that encourages that kind of energy consumption \nefficiency, and hopefully education so that people will want to do the \nright thing.\n  Secondly, we need diversification of our energy supplies. We need \nmore oil and gas. We need nuclear power that is safe and clean. We need \nto have more dependence on our own resources rather than depending on \nforeign imports. We cannot be a secure country if 67 percent of our \nenergy needs are imported, not to mention what that does to the jobs \nthat go overseas rather than staying in America.\n  The third part of a good energy policy is expanding the \ninfrastructure, making sure we have the ability to efficiently and \nsafely get the energy into the businesses and into the homes.\n  I think it is high time--it is beyond time--that we should address \nthe energy crisis in this country. The average price of gasoline is \nabout $1.50 now. That is down from what it was, but it is not great; we \ncan do a whole lot better. We can make the price of gasoline less if we \nhave stability and if we have our own resources developed in our \ncountry.\n  Clean burning coal--it seems as if sometimes when I hear people \ntalking about oil, gas, and coal, they are talking about technology 50 \nyears ago, not today. When you talk about drilling at ANWR, you are \ntalking about a little part of a vast area. It is the size of Dulles \nAirport and the State of South Carolina. That is what ANWR in Alaska is \nthe size of--South Carolina. What you would need to drill, because of \nthe new technology, is the area the size of Dulles Airport because the \nnew technology allows you to go underground and drill without putting \nan oil well in every place.\n  We have new technology in coal. You can now have coal extraction with \ntechnology that does not disrupt the environment. We need to talk about \nthe new technology, not the old technology, and we need to discuss an \nenergy policy for this country. I think we can get a bipartisan \nagreement on the three prongs of a good energy policy--self-sufficiency \nof production and diversification and jobs in our country, conservation \nand incentives to conserve, and an infrastructure that gets the product \nfrom business to consumer in a safe and efficient way. But we can't \ncome to a conclusion if we don't bring it up.\n  So I call on the majority to make this a priority and to say our \nenergy policy is one of the areas that we must address before Congress \ngoes out in August, and if we don't, we are not doing the job for the \npeople of this country and for the long-term future of this country \nthat we were sent here to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the provision that funds \nYucca Mountain in this appropriations bill. The senior Senator from \nNevada has cut the funding that the President has requested, but Yucca \nMountain is still being funded at somewhere around $275 million. \nAnybody who has been out to Yucca Mountain will see that they have \nspent a tremendous amount of money out there, to the tune of a little \nover $7 billion to this point. Most of the time people in this body are \nsaying: Send more money to our State; build us more projects because \nthey create economic opportunities.\n  But both Senators from Nevada, and the majority of the people in \nNevada, believe that the Yucca Mountain project is misguided. We feel \nthis way for many reasons. One is, we believe it is not meeting the \nsafety requirements that are necessary to have a permanent repository.\n  Secondly, nuclear waste rods are really not just nuclear waste; they \nare partially spent nuclear fuel rods. They have a lot of valuable \nenergy still in them.\n  I applaud, first of all, Senator Domenici, for putting into this bill \nresearch money for accelerated technology for something called \ntransmutation, which is a modern recycling technology for nuclear \nwaste. The administration has also said we need to, perhaps, look at \nreprocessing or other alternatives for disposing of the waste, other \nthan just burying it in a mountain. Doing that is the worst thing we \ncan do instead of unlocking this untapped energy from these partially \nspent nuclear fuel rods buried in the mountain--just putting it in \nthere; it is a very valuable resource. I believe it would be nuclear \nwaste at that point because we would be wasting a valuable resource.\n  What we should do instead of trying to build Yucca Mountain--the \nratepayers from around the country have been paying into this fund. \nThey say: Since we have been building this thing at $7 billion, we \nthink the Federal Government should take the waste out there and finish \nthe job. The problem with that is that Yucca Mountain, according to the \nGAO, is going to cost somewhere around $58 billion, and most people \nexpect that number to go up much further than that. It will be the most \nexpensive construction project in the history of the world.\n  This construction project will be borne not just by the ratepayers \nwhen it gets up to those kinds of numbers but by the taxpayers of the \nUnited States. It is a waste of the taxpayers' dollars to bury a \nvaluable resource in a mountain in the middle of the desert instead of \nrecycling this fuel that is a non-greenhouse-producing fuel when we do \nit.\n  The junior Senator from Texas just talked about the energy problems \nwe have in this country. Let's not bury a valuable resource. Let's look \nat recycling technology to use this resource.\n  I also add that there is no hurry. People say they are running out of \nroom at these nuclear plants around the country. In one sense, that is \ntrue. The cooling pools in which these partially spent nuclear fuel \nrods are sitting today are being filled up, but the easy solution to \nthat is to take them out of the cooling pools and put them in what are \ncalled dry cask canisters. That is being done in several places around \nthe country even as we speak. It is a cheaper thing to do, and it is \nalso a better thing to do. By the way, dry cask storage is safe, by all \nestimates, for a conservative 100 years. That gives our country time to \nlook into these new technologies about recycling.\n  I suggest that the people who are supporting taking nuclear waste to \nthe State of Nevada should look at these new technologies and focus our \nresources there, instead of trying to put more money into really what \nis becoming a white elephant out in the State of Nevada.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to one of \nthe issues we face in protecting our water, our taxpayers, and our \npublic lands. I am talking about the need to strengthen environmental \nmining regulations or so-called 3809 regulations.\n  These regulations protect lands managed by the Bureau of Land \nManagement from the impacts of mining for minerals such as gold and \ncopper. Earlier this year, the Clinton administration made long overdue \nrevisions to the regulations after years of public comments, \ncongressional hearings, and reports and evaluations.\n  Despite the thorough input, the Department of the Interior announced \nin March that they were going to roll back the updated 3809 \nregulations. What they were really rolling back are stronger \nprotections for our environment and public health.\n  My colleagues in the House recognized the importance of maintaining \nstrong environmental mining regulations. With bipartisan support, the \nHouse voted to prohibit the administration from overturning the updated \nregulations. I fully support the House in their effort and hope the \nSenate will accept the House language in conference.\n  Let me clarify the three major issues at risk.\n  First, the new rules would direct mining operators to protect water \nquality. This is a serious problem for the hardrock mining industry. \nJust last May, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recognized the \nindustry as the Nation's largest toxic polluter. The Bureau of Mines \nestimated that 12,000 miles of streams are polluted by hard rock \nmining.\n  Second, the old rules were not interpreted to allow land managers to \ndeny mining operations in environmentally or culturally sensitive \nareas. The updated regulations would allow the BLM to deny mining \noperations that would endanger towns or national parks.\n  Of course, the mining industry is opposed to any authority that would \ncurtail mining operations. Based on their strong opposition one would \nthink that every mining operation will be banned.\n  But the BLM has publicly and repeated stated that they would ``rarely \ninvoke'' this authority. And before they would ever use this authority \nthey would provide full opportunities for evaluation and public \ncomment.\n  This provision is not about shutting down mining businesses. I \nrecognize that they have a role to play in our economy. This provision \nis about responsible hardrock mining and responsible business \npractices.\n  Third, the old regulations too often allowed mining companies to \ndeclare bankruptcy after they finished mining, leaving taxpayers to pay \nfor the cleanup. Independent reports show that taxpayers have a \npotential liability in excess of $1 billion for cleanup costs at \ncurrent hardrock mining operations.\n  Keep in mind that these mining operations are taking place on public \nlands owned by Americans--lands owned by taxpayers. Too many times the \npeople who come into these lands mine them for profit, making rather \nsubstantial profits in the process, pay little or nothing to the \nFederal Government for that right, and leave a mess to be cleaned up \nafterwards. When they leave that mess, the taxpayers have lost twice: \nFirst, when public lands have been exploited for profit; and, second, \nwhen those despoiled lands remain for the taxpayers to clean up.\n  To the administration's credit, they have acknowledged the importance \nof strengthening the financial requirements. But 33 percent was a \nfailing grade where I went to school.\n  I recognize the need for a healthy mining industry. Under stronger \nmining regulations we will have a healthy, environmentally responsible \nmining industry that does not sacrifice the interest of communities for \nthe interest of profit.\n  As my colleagues prepare to conference on the Interior appropriations \nbill, I urge them to support the hard rock mining language as it passed \nin the House.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there is no question that we have to do \nsomething about the bonding of hard rock mines. It has caused problems \nrecently in Nevada. The largest mining company in the world that has \nsignificant operations in Nevada is the Newmont Mining Company. The \nNewmont Mining Company is considering discontinuing the use of \ncorporate guarantees. That is the way it should be. They are setting \nthe example for the rest of the industry in saying corporate bonds \nsimply may not work.\n  As I told my friend from Illinois, we need to be vigilant and do \neverything we can to change this hard rock mining bonding so that when \nmining operations are complete there are adequate resources to follow \nthrough and make sure they complete appropriate reclamation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada. I think \nit is perfectly reasonable, if someone is going to come along on the \npublic lands owned by the taxpayers of this country and mine for \nprofit, they should at least post a bond so if they should leave that \nland despoiled where there is a need for environmental cleanup there is \nmoney to do it and the taxpayers don't end up footing the bill.\n  The House version of this appropriations bill contains that \nprovision. Hopefully, the chairman of the committee, the Senator from \nNevada, will do everything in his power to make sure it is included as \npart of the conference.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S7854]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1013\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, now that our distinguished majority leader \nis here, I send to the desk an amendment on behalf of myself, Senators \nCarnahan, Grassley, and Harkin, and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], for himself, Mrs. \n     Carnahan, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. Harkin, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1013.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To impose additional conditions on the consideration of \n      revisions to the Missouri River Master Water Control Manual)\n\n       On page 11, at the end of line 16, add the following: \n     ``During consideration of revisions to the manual in fiscal \n     year 2002, the Secretary may consider and propose \n     alternatives for achieving species recovery other than the \n     alternatives specifically prescribed by the United States \n     Fish and Wildlife Service in the biological opinion of the \n     Service. The Secretary shall consider the views of other \n     Federal agencies, non-Federal agencies, and individuals to \n     ensure that other congressionally authorized purposes are \n     maintained.''.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this is part of a continuing effort to \nprevent the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service from advancing what we \nbelieve is a very ill-conceived directive to increase springtime \nreleases of water from Missouri River upstream dams in an experiment to \nsee if a controlled flood may improve the breeding habit of the pallid \nsturgeon.\n  House language was added to prevent implementation of the \n``controlled flood'' during consideration in the House Committee on \nAppropriations. The majority leader has entered an amendment, which we \nappreciate, in this bill which says no decision on final disposition of \nthe Missouri River manual should be made this year. I thank him for \nthat. That is one step in the right direction.\n  This, however, goes beyond and makes clear there is a broader policy \ninvolved. Rather than let the Fish and Wildlife Service dictate \nnational priorities to the Congress, the administration, the States, \nand the people, I believe the elected officials in Congress need to \nweigh in to protect human safety, property, and jobs. In sum, we ought \nto be able to do several things at once.\n  The authorizing legislation for the dams and other structures on the \nMissouri River says that they should be to prevent floods, to enhance \ntransportation, provide hydropower, and to facilitate recreation. \nSubsequent to those enacting statutes, the Endangered Species Act was \nadopted with the hope that we would stop the disappearance of \nendangered species and help recover them. My purpose here today, along \nwith my bipartisan colleagues, is to assure that the multiple uses of \nthe Missouri River may be pursued.\n  As so many of my colleagues, I was a great fan of the work by Stephen \nAmbrose, ``Undaunted Courage.'' I had a great-great-grandfather who was \none of the laborers who pulled the boats up the Missouri River. I find \nit fascinating. It was truly a remarkable chapter in our Nation's \nhistory.\n  That chapter has come and gone and people have moved in and live and \nfarm by the river. They are dependent upon the river for water supply, \nwater disposal, hydropower, transportation, and, yes, in the upstream \nStates, for recreation.\n  While we have had continuing discussions throughout my career serving \nthe State of Missouri over the proper uses of the river water between \nupstream and downstream States, I continue to assure my colleagues in \nthe upstream States that if there are things we can do to help improve \nthe recreational aspects of the impoundments on the river above the \ndams, I would be more than happy to do so.\n  This amendment--very short, very simple--says, simply put, that the \nSecretary, meaning the Secretary of the Army, who is the ultimate \nresponsible official, may consider and propose alternatives for \nachieving species recovery other than the alternatives specifically \nprescribed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in the biological \nopinion of the Service.\n  In other words, they have already proposed one thing, controlled \nspring floods. The Secretary may also propose other alternatives. This \ndoesn't say that he has to; it says that he can do it. He may do it. It \nmandates that the Secretary shall consider the views of other Federal \nagencies, non-Federal agencies, and individuals to ensure that other \ncongressionally authorized purposes are maintained.\n  This amendment simply says, we enacted a number of different \nobjectives for the Missouri River. Mr. Secretary, when you select an \noption, you have to take into consideration all of these specific \ncongressionally authorized objectives.\n\n  I believe--and it makes a great deal of sense--that the Federal \nGovernment should prevent floods, not cause them. It should be \nproviding more safe and efficient transportation options, not \nmonopolies for railroads. It should not be curtailing energy production \nfrom an environmentally clean source of energy, water power, during \npeak summer periods of demand during an energy crisis.\n  People in our State of Missouri cannot believe that we need to have \nthis debate. They cannot believe that the Endangered Species Act does \nnot have enough flexibility in it to permit human safety and economic \nsecurity to be considered. They cannot believe that their needs are \nnecessarily subordinate to what the Fish and Wildlife Service said is \nthe only way the pallid sturgeon can be saved.\n  Unfortunately, what the Fish and Wildlife Service says goes. And then \nto add insult to injury, after imposing their plan on the Corps of \nEngineers, the Corps of Engineers has to put the States and the \ncitizens through the hoax--I say hoax advisedly--of a public comment \nperiod that is irrelevant to the Fish and Wildlife Service that has, in \nthe past, demonstrated it will use its dictatorial power under the \nEndangered Species Act not just to put people out of business and \nincrease damage to private property but to threaten human safety of \nurban and rural communities where there will be greater risk of flood \nand flood damage.\n  This amendment on behalf of my colleagues gives the Corps of \nEngineers the opportunity to propose alternative species recovery \nmeasures that help fish and don't hurt people. It requires the \ncontinuation of public input and directs that the Corps preserve the \nother authorized purposes for the Missouri River.\n  The current Fish and Wildlife Service proposal, which they offered as \na dictate to the Corps of Engineers last July, saying you have 7 days \nto implement this plan that will flood Missouri and downstream States \nin the spring, is not some new proposal that just needs a little public \nsunlight to be fashioned into something that is sensible.\n  It represents the ``my way or the highway'' approach to regulatory \nenforcement and the reincarnation of what has previously been rejected \nby the people and the States involved.\n  A spring rise and low flow period was proposed by Fish and Wildlife \nthrough the Corps of Engineers in 1994. It was subjected to 6 months of \npublic comment, and it was ridiculed at public forums from Omaha to \nKansas City to St. Louis to Memphis to Quincy to New Orleans to Onawa, \nIA, and elsewhere. This is what the people of the heartland of America \nsaid about the spring rise. I have a bad hand, and I can only lift a \nthird of the transcripts at a time, but these are the comments that the \nCorps of Engineers received in 1994. Guess what. They didn't think much \nof the plan then for spring rise.\n  President Clinton's Secretary of Agriculture and his Secretary of \nTransportation criticized the plan in writing. The plan was then \nshelved by the Clinton administration because of public opinion. They \nhad their public comment. People did weigh in, and they said this is a \ndisaster. The Clinton administration withdrew it.\n  However, that plan was subsequently resurrected by the Fish and \nWildlife Service, using the force of the so-called consultation process \nsufficient to impose its will on the people in the States.\n  In other words, the Fish and Wildlife Service failed to convince the \npublic\n\n[[Page S7855]]\n\nand the States of the wisdom of their plan, as represented by these \ncomments, so they decided to force their plan by putting a gun to the \nhead of the Corps.\n  If the Fish and Wildlife Service cared about the views of the States \nand the public opinion of those who live in and around the basin and \ndepend upon the Missouri River, we would not be here today. There is \nvery little hope that they would care about next year's comments than \nthey care about the comments people took pains to make in 1994 because \nthey simply don't have to. The Fish and Wildlife Service gets to do \nwhat it wants because while they are required to allow public comment, \nthey are not required to listen. And I guarantee you, when it comes to \nthis plan, they have not listened.\n  This process, as previously orchestrated, is more rigged than a WWF \nchampionship match. But for my citizens, the price of admission is the \ncost of losing a planning season, a levee, an export opportunity, a \nflood, and maybe even the loss of a life.\n  Some may tell you that the Government can control this proposed \nflood. I know they wish that were the case. But wishes are not going to \nprovide accurate weather forecasts in the temperamental heartland \nspring. Unless someone in the Corps can forecast weather accurately 5 \nto 10 days to 2 weeks in advance, there will be accidents, people will \nbe hurt, and it will be because the U.S. Government decided to risk \ntheir safety for an experiment. When the Government releases pulses of \nwater from the dams, that water can't be brought back; it is not \nretrievable. It takes 5 days to get to Kansas City, 10 days to get to \nSt. Louis, and further down the river, even longer.\n  On average, the river never floods. In the real world, though, it \nisn't the averages that hurt us but the extremes. I understand that a \nlot of people have drowned in lakes that average only 3 feet deep. With \ndownstream tributary flow, we already have a natural ``spring rise'' \nevery time it rains, and when that happens, a ``pulse'' released days \nbefore is a tragic gift courtesy of the Federal Government.\n  Just 6 weeks ago, following a series of low pressure systems in the \nbasin, in less than 5 days gauging stations in Missouri went from below \nnormal stage to flood stage. Right in the heart of our State, in \nHerman, MO, the streamflow increased from 85,000 cubic feet per second \nto 250,000 cubic feet per second in 5 days. That is almost a threefold \nincrease in the amount of water coming down that river.\n\n  Now, neither the people of Herman nor the Corps of Engineers expected \nthis dramatic tripling of the flows, but it shows the danger of \nintentionally increasing those flows during the spring season, and it \nshows what people in our State already know: We already have a spring \nrise. It is natural and it is dangerous. If the pallid sturgeon really \nliked spring rises, they would be coming out our ears. After the \nfloods, we should have had little pallid sturgeons all over the place.\n  The second part of the Fish and Wildlife plan is an artificially low \nsummer flow, which inverts the historical natural hydrograph. For those \nwho may be a little concerned about the terms, that means the river \n``ain't'' flowing like it used to flow before dams. The natural \nhydrograph is to have more water in the summer during the snowmelts in \nthe upper basin. This natural pattern would be turned on its head if \nyou had the releases in the spring and then low flows during the \nsummer. It starves the hydropower generators of capacity during peak \nperiods of energy demand, driving up the rates for customers, driving \nup the rates for Native American tribes and other citizens in rural \nareas.\n  According to data from the Western Area Power Administration, ``Risk \nanalysis including river thermal powerplants: Both capacity and energy \nlosses increase exponentially as the summer flow decreases in July.''\n  That means that when you cut the waterflow during the summer in peak \ncooling seasons, you get much greater than a straight line loss in \ncapacity and energy production. The line doesn't go down like this; it \ngoes up like that. That is what happens to power production when you \nreduce summer flows.\n  The plan does call for continued production of energy, just not when \npeople need it. The middle part of the summer is when air-conditioning \nrates are the highest and when there is the greatest drain on \nelectricity. Unless we no longer care about clean energy options, then \nwe should not be taking deliberate steps to increase the cost of power.\n  Additionally, let me point out for our southern neighbors that low \nsummer flows provide inadequate water to continue water commerce on the \nMissouri River and during very low water periods on the Mississippi \nRiver. During the drought years, up to 65 percent of the flow in the \nMississippi River below St. Louis comes from the Missouri River.\n  Water commerce is important for another reason. One medium-sized 15-\nbarge tow can carry the same amount of grain--usually going to the \nexport markets--as 870 trucks. This one medium-sized tow is much better \nfor safety, clean air, fuel efficiency, highway congestion, and the \ncompetitiveness of our shippers in the international marketplace than \nputting 870 trucks on the highway through congested metropolitan areas. \nWater commerce for our farmers, shippers, and exporters is a necessary \ninsurance policy against high rates that occur when the absence of \ncompetition leaves shippers to the mercy of transportation monopolies. \nA key assumption of some is that freight carriers don't raise rates \nwhen they face no competition. That is a nice wish, but it is not a \nrealistic assumption.\n  Other forms of transportation do raise rates when competition is not \npresent. According to the Tennessee Valley Authority, which did a \nstudy, higher shipping costs would add up to as much as $200 million \nannually to farmers and other shippers in Missouri, South Dakota, and \nall the States in between, not including the Lower Mississippi River \nStates. A shipper from the Omaha, NE, region told my office that he \nsecures railroad rates of less than $25 per ton when they go up to \nSioux City, where the river provides competition, but when he ships up \nto Sioux Falls, where the river doesn't go, where river transportation \nis not available, then rates double.\n  I am pleased and proud to say there are many ongoing programs and \npractices to improve Missouri River habitat. I have listened to the \ndiscussions that relate to this matter over the years, and there is \nsome presumption that only the Federal Government should do something \nabout it. That is false. There is that overtone, since Missouri \nstrongly opposes the Federal Fish and Wildlife plan--on a bipartisan \nbasis, I might add--we aren't as dedicated to fish and wildlife as some \nof our friends in the Dakotas, or Montana maybe.\n  Well, Mr. President, no State in the basin dedicates as much money as \nMissouri does to fish and wildlife conservation measures. Most States \njust take payments from the Pittman-Robertson and the Wallop-Breaux and \nlicensing revenue. Some States have appropriations from their general \nfund.\n  The citizens of Missouri have imposed upon themselves by referendum a \nState sales tax for conservation. That has enabled Missouri to spend as \nmuch as California on fish and wildlife. This year that total will be \n$140 million.\n  Our State conservation tax has enabled Missouri to spend twice as \nmuch as Florida, 11 times more than Massachusetts, 11 times more than \nVermont, 9 times more than Nevada, and 3 times more than Illinois.\n  According to the latest data from the Wildlife Conservation Fund of \nAmerica, Missouri spends roughly 50 percent more on fish and wildlife \nthan the Dakotas and Montana combined. Missouri spends 5 times more \nthan South Dakota on fish and wildlife, and 10 times more than North \nDakota.\n  Almost all States raise money from hunting and fishing licenses and \nall States get Federal money. If you go beyond those sources, the \ndifference between what Missouri citizens have set aside for fish and \nwildlife compared to our upstream neighbors, the numbers are \nstaggering. In the latest years, the figures available to me, Missouri \ndedicated 60 times more from State taxes in the general fund than South \nDakota, for example.\n  I will not say anything beyond this except that Missouri citizens are \ndoing their part, and certainly we encourage other States to follow the \nconstructive example that Missouri has set.\n\n[[Page S7856]]\n\n  What have we done? What have we done for wildlife habitat? What have \nwe done to conserve species, to preserve and help restore endangered \nspecies? Our Department of Conservation has acquired 72 properties in \nthe Missouri River flood plain totaling almost 45,000 acres. Senator \nHarkin of Iowa and I and others have requested funding for a number of \nongoing habitat projects, and while two are funded in this bill, one \nwas not funded.\n  We have authorized and we have begun funding for a 60,000-acre flood \nplain refuge between St. Louis and Kansas City. We authorize an \naddition of 100,000 acres of land acquisition in the lower basin to \nrestore habitat, with almost 13,700 acres already acquired.\n  I have been pleased to work with American Rivers and Missouri farm \ngroups to authorize habitat restoration on the river, to create \nsandbars, islands, and side channels. These are the natural structures \nthat support and facilitate species such as the pallid sturgeon.\n  I regret to say this administration, as the last administration, \nrequested no funds to start the project, and the subcommittee this year \ndid no new starts, so a consensus approach is lying in state. We have \nfinanced over 21,740 acres of wetland easements from the Wetlands \nReserve Program in Missouri. Missouri is very active with the \nConservation Reserve Program, and farmers are signing up for filter \nstrips along waterways to reduce runoff.\n  We are working in Missouri on an agroforestry flood plain initiative \nand have demonstrated tree systems that take out nearly three-quarters \nof the phosphorous and nitrogen so it does not reach the waterways \nwhile providing excellent bird habitat.\n  According to our Department of Natural Resources, river engineering \nefforts on the Mississippi River have paid big dividends for endangered \nspecies. For example, at river mile 84 on the Upper Mississippi River, \nthe Corps has created hard points in the river to separate a sandbar \nfrom the bank to create a nesting island for the federally endangered \nleast tern. In addition, larval sturgeon have been collected in the \nresultant side channel.\n\n  Four islands around mile 100 on the Upper Mississippi were created by \nmodifying existing navigational structures without interfering with \nwater transport. Islands have flourished even through the flood of \n1993.\n  At river mile 40 on the Upper Mississippi, the Corps has established \ncritical off-channel connectivity essential as overwintering and \nrearing habitat for many Mississippi River fishes.\n  We know there are better approaches that do not hurt people, and that \nis where the focus has been in Missouri, and that is where the focus \nshould be in Washington. The sooner we table the plan that is risky, \nuntested, and dangerous, the sooner we can get to the plans that are \ntested and broadly supported.\n  Our bipartisan amendment is supported by members across the country: \nthe National Waterways Alliance, National Corn Growers Association, \nAmerican Soybean Association, American Farm Bureau Federation, National \nAssociation of Wheat Growers, National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, \nAgricultural Retailers Association, National Grain and Feed \nAssociation, and others.\n  The Fish and Wildlife Service plan has been opposed strongly by the \nSouthern Governors Association which issued another resolution opposing \nit early this year. The Fish and Wildlife plan is opposed strongly by \nour current Governor, Governor Holden, and his Department of Natural \nResources which is just as knowledgeable and just as committed to the \nprotection of the river they live on as the Federal field \nrepresentatives who live in other regions and States.\n  I say to all the Senators on the Mississippi River that objections \nwere raised to the Fish and Wildlife Service plan in a recent letter to \nthe President signed by nine Mississippi River Governors. These \nGovernors include Governor Patton from Kentucky, Governor Sundquist \nfrom Tennessee, Governor Foster from Louisiana, Governor Musgrove from \nMississippi, Governor Ryan from Illinois, Governor Huckabee from \nArkansas, Governor McCallum from Wisconsin, and Governor Holden from \nMissouri.\n  This plan is opposed on a bipartisan basis by elected officials, by \nour late Governor Carnahan, by mayors, farmers, and the people all \nalong the Missouri River.\n  Our amendment seeks to add some balance in the decisionmaking process \nand attempts to permit the administration to do what is right to find \nways to address species recovery that do not harm people, that do not \nharm property, that do not interfere with the other legitimate multiple \nuses of the Missouri River.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to adopt this bipartisan amendment. I \nthank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from Missouri. \nHe clearly feels as passionate about this issue as I do, and he, like \nI, has tried to find common ground. I have no objection to the \namendment that Senator Bond is proposing this afternoon.\n  What he is saying through this amendment is that in addition to the \nproposal made by Fish and Wildlife, there ought to be consideration of \nother issues, other opportunities to address the problem. I have said \nthat from the beginning.\n  I will support this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support it \nas well. I also urge my colleagues to endorse this position as the bill \nproceeds through conference. This is a position that I think will \nclearly show unanimity on both sides of the aisle and, as a result, I \nhope we can maintain this position rather than the very negative \napproach adopted by the House.\n  I am hopeful as we go into conference that Senator Bond will support \nthe position that he and I now have adopted as a Senate position.\n  While I am in agreement on the amendment, we are in vast disagreement \nabout the issue. I feel compelled to address some of the questions \nraised by the distinguished Senator from Missouri.\n  First of all, it is important to remember, most importantly perhaps, \nit is important to remember that this goes beyond just the pallid \nsturgeon. Obviously, the pallid sturgeon is an endangered species, and \nwe can argue all afternoon about the relevance of the pallid sturgeon \nto the master manual debate, but in my view, this is about more than an \nendangered species. This debate is about an endangered river. This \ndebate and the master manual is about whether or not we can save an \nendangered river.\n  This is not about an endangered species. This debate is about an \nendangered river. This debate and the master manual is about whether or \nnot we can save an endangered river.\n  The distinguished Senator mentioned the organization American Rivers. \nThe American Rivers organization has now listed for the second year in \na row the Missouri River as the most endangered river in America. It \ndoesn't get any worse than that.\n  We talked about the Federal Government's commitments and regulatory \napproach. Citizens of South Dakota know a lot about commitments and \nregulatory approach. We were told if we gave up hundreds of thousands \nof acres of land to build four dams to help downstream States, we would \nbenefit. We would have irrigation projects, and we would have water \nprojects, and we would have an array of special consideration given the \nnew jeopardy within which we find ourselves as a result of the dams' \nconstruction.\n  The first things to go, of course, were all the irrigation projects. \nWe don't have any in South Dakota. That is done. The second thing to \ngo, of course, was the quality of life for people who lived along the \nriver. We had to move communities. That is done. We have moved them. \nUnfortunately, because the master manual is now so out of date, we are \ndrowning communities all along the river as we speak.\n  The Senator from Missouri talks about his concern for spring rise and \nfloods. We are getting that every year. We have already authorized the \nconstruction of new homes for 200 homeowners in Pierre, SD. We will \nhave to commit $35 million to move homeowners because we flooded them \nout because the master manual isn't working.\n  So don't talk to us about spring rise. Don't talk to us about \nflooding. Don't talk to us about sacrifice. We know\n\n[[Page S7857]]\n\nsacrifice. We know the problem because we are living in it every single \nday.\n  Yes, this is about pallid sturgeons. But this is about a lot of South \nDakotans who are living on the river who were told they were safe, who \nwere told they had been given commitments, who were told they would get \nirrigation projects, who were told they would get all kinds of benefits \nwhich we have not seen.\n  This is about an endangered river. It is about a master manual \nwritten 50 years ago when times were a lot different. It is about a \nrecognition that every once in a while, perhaps at least every two \ngenerations, we ought to look at a master manual and whether it is \nworking or not and come to a conclusion about rewriting it so people \nare not flooded out.\n  This has been an effort 10 years in the making. In spite of all the \nassertions made by the Fish and Wildlife and the Corps of Engineers and \nothers that the spring rise proposal provides 99 percent of the flood \ncontrol we have today, that is not good enough for some of our people. \nIn spite of the fact they tell us in any single year there would be \nhigh water, there would be no spring rise, we would not authorize it, \nthat is not good enough for some people.\n  The distinguished Senator from Missouri mentioned a hero of mine, \nSteve Ambrose. I don't know of anybody who knows more about that river \nthan he does. He has walked virtually every mile of it. He knows it \nbackwards and forwards. He knows its history, he knows its splendor. He \nknows the river like no one knows the river. He has been very \ncomplimentary about the efforts made to protect it now. I will not \nspeak for him, but I will say this. Were he here, I think he would \nexpress the same concern about how endangered this river is, as I just \nhave.\n  Steve Ambrose is not the only one. The Senator from Missouri was \ntalking about all the indignation, talking about all those who came out \nin opposition, and he mentioned quite a list of people. I could go on, \ntoo, with lists of organizations, lists of Governors on a bipartisan \nbasis. I think perhaps the most important is the letter we received on \nMay 21 from the Missouri River Natural Resources Committee. The \nMissouri River Natural Resources Committee is made up of people up and \ndown the river, but especially people in the lower regions of the \nriver. Here is what the Missouri River Natural Resources Committee has \nto say. I will read one sentence, and I ask unanimous consent the \nletter be printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit No. 1.)\n  Mr. DASCHLE. ``The MRNRC supports the recommendations contained in \nthe Biological Opinion as biologically sound and scientifically \njustified.''\n  There you have it, perhaps the most authoritative organization on \nriver management dealing with the Missouri River. This sentence is \nunderlined: ``This plan is biologically sound and scientifically \njustified.''\n  I feel this as passionately as the distinguished Senator from \nMissouri. What happens when two people who feel as passionately as we \nboth do, with polar opposite positions, come to the floor on a bill of \nthis import, on an issue of this import? What I did early in the year--\nand I thank my very professional staff, Peter Hanson, and others, and \nmy colleague, Senator Johnson, for his admirable work on the committee \nin working with us, and perhaps most importantly, my chairman on this \nsubcommittee, Harry Reid. I thank them all for their extraordinary \nefforts to work with us to try to find some common ground.\n  Basically, what is in the bill is simply an amendment that says: \nLook, let's continue to look at this; let's see if we can find the \ncommon ground, with the depth of feeling we recognize on both sides. \nLet's not do any damage, but let's keep working.\n  That is what is in the bill. Let's not make any conclusions, let's \nnot insert that somehow the States have to comply prematurely. We \nalready have invested 10 years. What is another year? Let's keep \nworking.\n  That is what is in the bill.\n  What the Senator from Missouri is saying is let's also ensure that \nthere are other options that we look at. I have no objection to that. \nThat is why I support this amendment. If we pass this legislation, we \nwill look at other options, we will not take any specific action right \nnow, but we will not deny, as the House did, the right to continue to \nmove forward. I hope we can all agree this is a legitimate, balanced \napproach.\n  I also hope people recognize this: If we don't solve it, the Fish and \nWildlife and the Corps don't solve us, there is only one other \nrecourse: The courts of the United States will solve this. This will be \ntied up in the courts, and we will see litigation for a long time to \ncome, and it will be North v. South in a new context. I don't want to \nsee that.\n  I want to see a resolution to this problem. I want to see some \nunderstanding of the science that has gone into the solution to this \nproblem. I want to see a recognition that there is pain on both sides \nof this problem. I want to see us not continuing to kick the ball down \nthe field but coming to grips with it, finishing it, and moving on.\n  This master manual is now older than I am. The river has changed a \nlot, as I have, over the last 50 years. I think it is time to update \nit. Probably time to update, me, too. This river is a lot more \nimportant than I am. This river provides a lot more livelihood to \npeople in South Dakota than I do. This river is dying, and we need to \nsave it.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n                                                    Missouri River\n\n\n                                  Natural Resources Committee,\n\n                                Missouri Valley, IA, May 21, 2001.\n     Secretary Gale Norton,\n     Department of the Interior,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ms. Norton: I am writing to express the position of \n     the Missouri River Natural Resources Committee (MRNRC) \n     concerning the biological and scientific merits of the \n     November 30, 2000, final Biological Opinion of the U.S. Fish \n     and Wildlife Service on the Operation of the Missouri River \n     Main Stem Reservoir System, Operation and Maintenance of the \n     Missouri River Bank Stabilization and Navigation Project, and \n     Operation of the Kansas Reservoir System. By way of \n     introduction, the MRNRC is an organization of appointed, \n     professional biologists representing the seven main stem \n     Missouri River Basin state fish and wildlife management \n     agencies. Our agencies have statutory responsibilities for \n     management and stewardship of river fish and wildlife \n     resources held in trust for the public. We were established \n     in 1987 to promote and facilitate the conservation and \n     enhancement of river fish and wildlife recognizing that river \n     management must encompass the system as a whole and cannot \n     focus only on the interests of one state or agency. Besides \n     an Executive Board of state representatives, we also have \n     three technical sections--Fish Technical Section, Tern and \n     Plover Section, and Wildlife Section--consisting of river \n     field biologists and managers which advise the Board on river \n     science, management, and technical matters.\n       The MRNRC supports the recommendations contained in the \n     Biological Opinion as biologically sound and scientifically \n     justified. Implementation of these recommendations will not \n     only benefit the federally-listed pallid sturgeon, interior \n     least tern and piping plover, but also many other river and \n     reservoir fish and wildlife for which our agencies have \n     responsibility and jurisdiction, including river fish species \n     which have declined in many river reaches since development \n     of the system. A sustainable river ecosystem requires \n     restoring as much as possible those hydrological functions \n     and river and floodplain habitat features under which native \n     river fish and wildlife evolved. The scientific community is \n     increasingly recommending restoration of natural flow \n     patterns or some semblance of them to conserve native river \n     biota and river ecosystem integrity (Richter et al., 1998; \n     Galat et al., 1998). The Opinion takes the first, adaptive \n     management step toward accomplishing this task while \n     recognizing that the river has been drastically modified and \n     must continue to meet other human needs for power generation, \n     water supply, recreation, flood control, and commercial \n     navigation.\n       The Opinion contains most of the operating and habitat \n     rehabilitation objectives contained in an alternative \n     submitted by the MRNRC in August, 1999, for the Corps of \n     Engineers' Missouri River Master Manual Environmental Impact \n     Statement Review and Study and in a white paper we developed \n     in 1997 (Restoration of Missouri River Ecosystem Functions \n     and Habitats). These objectives include higher spawning flow \n     releases from Fort Peck and Gavins Point Dams in the spring, \n     warmer water releases from Fort Peck Dam through the spring \n     and summer, lower flows below Gavins Point Dam in the summer, \n     unbalancing of reservoir storage (annual rotation of high, \n     stable, and lower reservoir storage levels among the big \n     three reservoirs), restoration of shallow water aquatic \n     habitat in the channelized river reaches, and restoration of \n     emergent sandbar habitat in least tern and piping\n\n[[Page S7858]]\n\n     plover nesting areas, all of which have been advocated for \n     many years by the MRNRC.\n       The MRNRC also commented on and supported the draft \n     Biological Opinion. A copy of that letter is enclosed. The \n     final Opinion is responsive to our comments on the draft. We \n     are especially pleased to see the commitment to include our \n     agencies in the Agency Coordination Team process for fine-\n     tuning and implementing management actions identified in the \n     Opinion. I am also enclosing a copy of the 1997 white paper \n     and a brochure which explains the function of the MRNRC. I \n     hope this letter and accompanying materials clarify the views \n     of professional biologists responsible for Missouri River \n     fish and wildlife. Please do not hesitate to contact me (712-\n     336-1714) if we can be of further help in this regard.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Thomas Gengerke,\n\n                                                      MRNRC Chair,\n                             Iowa Department of Natural Resources.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator from Missouri will yield for a brief \nstatement.\n  While the leader is here, I want to say this is legislation that is \nbest. The provision in the bill could have been a benchmark for a lot \nof confusion and derision, but the staffs involved, because of all the \nconcern for the river, sat down and did something constructive. I, \npersonally, as well as Senator Domenici, appreciate this very much. \nThis avoids a contentious fight. Because of the good heads of the staff \nand the wisdom of the Senators involved, we have resolved a very \ncontentious issue. Senator Domenici and I are very thankful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for that eloquent \nand enthusiastic support for a solution to the problem we have worked \non for so many years. I love the opportunity to work with him in being \nable to find that solution.\n  Today, I want to speak about an issue that is important to the people \nof Missouri. As you see, my State lies at the confluence of these two \ngreat rivers, the Missouri and the Mississippi. The rise and the fall \nof these rivers has a tremendous effect on Missouri, on its agriculture \nand recreation and environment and economy.\n  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed to shift the flow of \nthe Missouri River so that more water passes through our State in the \nspring and less in the summer. It is called the spring rise. If this \nproposal goes into effect, it could have devastating consequences, \nincluding increased likelihood of flooding and the shutdown of the \nbarge industry on the Missouri.\n  The energy and water appropriations bill being considered by the \nSenate contains language that would prohibit the Army Corps of \nEngineers from expediting the schedule to finalize revisions to the \nmaster manual that governs waterflow on the Missouri River. In effect, \nthis provision would ensure that the decision regarding the flow of the \nriver would not be made until 2003.\n  While I welcome that language as a temporary stopgap for Missouri, it \nis not enough to protect Missourians or other downstream States, for \nwithout additional action by Congress, it is virtually certain that the \nCorps of Engineers will adopt the Fish and Wildlife Service's \nrecommendation for spring rise. That is a condition that will do great \nharm to Missouri and other users of the Missouri and Mississippi \nRivers.\n  The Bond-Carnahan amendment strengthens the bill to provide greater \nprotections for Missourians. It would allow the Corps to propose \nalternatives to assist the recovery of endangered species, but it would \nnot preclude the Corps from adopting the Fish and Wildlife Service's \nproposal for spring rise.\n  Just 8 years ago, Missourians faced one of the worst floods in their \nhistory. The water crested almost 50 feet over the normal level. Entire \nneighborhoods were washed away and damage estimates ran into the \nbillions. This year, we saw communities up and down the river battling \nagainst floodwaters once again.\n  I cannot believe that a government agency would contemplate an action \nthat would put Missourians and residents of other downstream States at \nrisk of even more flooding.\n  The proposal is to release huge amounts of water from Gavins Point, \nSD, in the spring when the risk of flooding is already high. It takes \n10 to 11 days for water from Gavins Point to reach St. Louis. What \nwould happen if we received an unexpected heavy rainfall after the \nwater had been released from Gavins Point? The answer is simple. \nMissourians would face a severe flood. Even the Corps admits that would \nbe the case. That is an unacceptable risk.\n  The change would also damage the region's economy. The barge industry \ncontributes as much as $200 million to our economy and would be \nseverely hurt by the low river levels that would occur in the summer. \nThe economic benefits to upstream users, approximately $65 to $85 \nmillion, pales in comparison.\n  We must also factor in the value of barge traffic on the Mississippi \nRiver. The proposed low summer flow would bring barge traffic to a near \nhalt for at least 2 months during the summer at that area known as the \nbottleneck region of the Mississippi River. This is the portion of the \nriver that stretches just south of the confluence of the Missouri and \nMississippi Rivers, to Cairo, IL. The bottleneck needs the higher \nMissouri River flow to sustain barge traffic.\n  The disruption caused by this proposal would jeopardize 100 million \ntons of Mississippi River barge traffic which generates $12 to $15 \nbillion in annual revenue.\n\n  Finally, there is no reason to believe that the Fish and Wildlife \nService proposal will do anything to help endangered species. The \nService claims that its recommended plan will benefit the pallid \nsturgeon below Gavins Point, but it provides no supporting evidence \nthat any of the claimed benefits will be realized. In fact, the Service \nadmits, in its own Biological Opinion, that enormous gaps exist in our \nknowledge of the needs of the pallid sturgeon. Furthermore, the \nBiological Opinion notes that commercial harvesting of sturgeon is \nallowed in five States.\n  If that is the case, I would think it would be more appropriate for \nthe Service to halt the commercial harvesting, rather than risk severe \nflood and shut down barge traffic, all for unproven benefits to the \nsturgeon.\n  I am also not convinced that the Fish and Wildlife Service plan will \naccomplish the goal of helping two bird species: the interior least \ntern and the piping plover. In fact, many experts believe that the \nhigher reservoir levels upstream resulting from the Service's proposal \ncould actually harm these birds and their habitat at a critical point \nin the year. Fluctuations in the river level could also greatly disrupt \nnesting burdens below Gavins Dam. The Service's Biological Opinion \nfails to address the consequences of these unnatural changes.\n  There are better ways to ensure the continued healthy existence of \nthese species. After the pallid sturgeon was added to the Federal \nendangered species list in 1990, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \nformed the pallid sturgeon recovery team to rebuild the fish's \ndwindling numbers. The Missouri Department of Conservation joined this \neffort by working with commercial fishermen to obtain several wild \nsturgeon from the lower part of the Mississippi River. In 1992, the \nDepartment successfully spawned female pallid sturgeons, which has \nsince lead to the production of thousands of 10- to 12-inch sturgeon \nfor stocking. The pallid sturgeon had never been spawned in captivity, \nbut the Department developed certain techniques to do so. The fish were \nthen released into the rivers.\n  Before the release, the Missouri Department of Conservation tagged \nthem for tracking purposes. They have since been amazed at the number \nof reported sightings of the tagged fish, which has surpassed anything \nthey anticipated.\n  If we are dedicated to preserving these species, we can do so through \nefforts such as those carried out in Missouri.\n  In recent years, this has become a partisan issue. It should not be. \nSome say it is an environmental issue. It is not. The environmental \nbenefits of a spring rise are totally unproven.\n  Some say it is an economic issue. It is not. On balance, it would \nharm our economy. This is an issue of fairness. It is not fair to \nexpose Missourians and other downstream residents to severe flooding, \neconomic loss, and potential environmental destruction.\n  Our amendment, the Bond-Carnahan amendment, will ensure fairness for \neveryone who shares these rivers. I urge its adoption.\n\n[[Page S7859]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I commend and applaud the work of Senator \nCarnahan and Senator Bond on crafting this amendment. We have been at a \ngridlock state on the master manual development now for many years. \nSenator Carnahan's work to try to break that gridlock ought to be \napplauded.\n  Last year, as many recall, this bill wound up being vetoed by \nPresident Clinton over this very issue. For years it has been an all-\nor-nothing struggle between upstream and downstream States over the \nmanagement of the Missouri River. I think we may be moving ahead more \nconstructively now, thanks to a more thoughtful approach being taken in \nthis body.\n  The Missouri River is of utterly profound consequences to my home \nState of South Dakota. It divides the State in two, an East River and \nWest River, as we say in South Dakota. It is central to the economy of \nthe State. It is the corridor by which settlers came to Dakota \nterritory. This Senator grew up on the Missouri River. My hometown is a \ncollege town situated on a bluff overlooking the Missouri River. Its \nwelfare is of great concern to my State. It is of great concern to me \npersonally.\n\n  My colleague, Senator Daschle, noted that the Missouri River has been \nreferred to as ``America's most endangered river.'' I appreciate that \ncould be the criteria you might happen to choose to apply, but, \nnonetheless, the Missouri River has gone through a great many changes \nfrom its pristine early days--largely impounded at least in the upper \nstretches of the river behind huge earthen dams, channelized in other \nstretches, and barge traffic.\n  In my home community of Vermilion, it remains as about as close to \nwhat Lewis and Clark saw as any stretch that remains. But that is only \nfor a stretch of some 60 or 70 miles.\n  This river remains of enormous consequence. The management of the \nriver has always been a matter of great import. For 40 or 50 years now, \nthe existing master manual--the rules for the management of the river \nthat guides the Corps of Engineers--has been in place. When the Pick-\nSloan plan was implemented and these larger earthen dams were \nconstructed, they were constructed with multiple purposes--flood \ncontrol for South Dakota and for our downstream neighbors as well; \nenergy production; and they remain a great source of hydroelectricity \nfor our State and throughout the region; recreation certainly; barge \ntraffic; and drinking and irrigation purposes.\n  The thought at the time was that these huge bodies of water would be \nused for massive irrigation development through the Dakotas, and that \nthere would then, in turn, be a need for reliable barge traffic to haul \nthis amount of grain from the heartland and the Dakotas downstream. For \nmany reasons, irrigation never happened--at least not on a large scale. \nWe have moved on from the irrigation that was envisioned.\n  The Missouri River is used as a significant source of drinking water. \nIn the meantime, recreation, fish, and wildlife purposes have become \nparamount on the Missouri River. Although it is a far, far small \nindustry than it was originally thought, it is of no one's interest to \nunnecessarily drive the barge industry out of existence. It still plays \nan important role in a much smaller way than was originally thought. \nBut, nonetheless, it plays an important role, and to the degree that we \ncan preserve it, that is well and good. But I think there is a very \nstrong consensus that the vision for the Missouri Valley that existed \nat the time of the Pick-Sloan plan was envisioned and then implemented \nis much changed.\n  This master manual no longer serves the interest and no longer \nreflects the contemporary economic realities of the Missouri River--\ncertainly in the upstream reaches of the river but downstream as well.\n  It is the responsibility of the Corps of Engineers to proceed with \nthe study, public input, and with the science that goes into at long \nlast a revamping of the master manual. Up until now, we have been \ncaught up in the question of should we revise the manual or should we \nnot revise the manual.\n  Now, at least in this body, there is an agreement that, yes, the \nmanual should and needs to be revised. It should be done in a careful \nmanner. I am pleased that we have gotten over that hurdle. That hurdle \nstill remains in the other body, the House of Representatives, but I \nthink as the Senate approaches this issue in a more thoughtful and \nwiser fashion, it is important for the Corps to take the best \nbiological science available from the Fish and Wildlife Service.\n  It is also important for the Corps to listen to those who have \nconcerns about flooding. It is important for the Corps to listen to \nthose concerned about energy production. Our rural electrics, and \npublic power in particular, have a great concern about levels of energy \nproduction from these hydrodams. This year more than most, we have had \na lesser amount of waterflow from the head waters of the Missouri than \nin past years. In fact, our water levels are down this year in any \nevent regardless of the master manual. That remains of concern.\n  We have endangered species. We have a great recreation and wildlife \nindustry on the Missouri River. Much of it has been at risk because of \nthe unreliability of the waterflows on the river and the lack of \nconsideration given to this huge industry, the recreation and wildlife \nindustry. In fact, every dollar's worth far exceeds that of the barge \nindustry that has been there for so long.\n  We have concerns about erosion. We have concerns about the supply of \ndrinking water on the Missouri River. We have concerns about the health \nof the Missouri River itself. Steps need to be taken to restore this \nriver to the grand status that it once had.\n  I am pleased we are taking this step today. This does not mean that \nFish and Wildlife's views will be ignored, or that the ultimate plan \ndeveloped by the Corps of Engineers will be contrary to what the Fish \nand Wildlife Service wishes. But it does suggest that there are other \nperspectives that ought to be considered as well, and that the Corps \nwill proceed, that they will move forward finally, at last, with the \nrevision of the master manual--one that I hope will more fully reflect \nthe contemporary economic and environmental realities of the Missouri \nRiver.\n  It is my hope again that as we proceed on with this bill--again, my \ncommendation to Senator Reid, our friend from Nevada, and Senator \nDomenici, our friend from New Mexico, who have done such great work on \nthis bill as a whole--we will proceed with an excellent piece of \nlegislation, so that when we reach a conference circumstance with the \nother body, the views of the Senate on this critical issue will, in \nfact, prevail.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Missouri River is a tremendous \nresource for the Midwest. It is used for recreation and for \ntransportation. It supplies water for drinking, for irrigation, to cool \npower plants, and it can, at times provide far too much water resulting \nin flooding, hurting many farmers and sometimes communities as a whole.\n  It is also the home for a wide variety of wildlife, providing \nexcellent hunting and fishing opportunities. It has many beautiful \nviews to be enjoyed by all. And it is the habitat for a number of \nspecies that, unfortunately, appear to be in very serious difficulty, \nendangered.\n  I believe we have a responsibility to protect endangered and \nthreatened species, and I take that responsibility very seriously. And, \nI take the needs of my constituents to minimize flooding, to maximize \nthe benefits of barge traffic and to use the areas along the river for \ngood hunting and fishing very seriously as well.\n  The Corps of Engineers which manages the large dams on the river is \ncharged with a number of legislative purposes such as navigation, flood \ncontrol, recreation and environmental remediation and enhancement. And, \nmany of those responsibilities are in regular conflict. Doing more to \npromote one priority can and regularly does hurt another priority. Few \nMembers are happy with the Corps in this balancing effort. I understand \nlots of Corps officials are not happy with the Corps either at times.\n  Under the Endangered Species Act, passed in the early 1970s just \nbefore I became a member of Congress, we said that saving endangered \nspecies was a\n\n[[Page S7860]]\n\ntop priority. And, I strongly support that goal. It is often a \ndifficult task. We so often know so little and, at times, can be so \nvery wrong. But we should work in a determined manner to help species \nthat are endangered.\n  In this case, the Fish and Wildlife Service has issued a biological \nopinion of what they think is the best course of action. Is it the best \npath to take? Under the law, there is a process that the Corps is \nsupposed to follow in making the determination of what they will do to \nmove forward towards saving the endangered species. It is a long \nprocess. But, as the language already in the bill notes, under its \ntimetable, the Corps is more than a year away from coming to a final \n``record of decision'' and then more months away from that decision's \nimplementation.\n  I believe that the Corps needs to very carefully consider the input \nit gets during that time. Many, including the state governments, \nlearned professors, organizations representing many sides, have a great \ndeal of resources and expertise. I feel that the comment period is not \nsupposed to be for show, or to allow people to vent. I believe that it \nshould be an opportunity for people to not only forcefully note their \ninterest, but for those with the capability to propose creative \nsolutions, solutions that can both do more to help the endangered \nspecies and more to maintain the historic priorities of the Corps.\n  Do I know what that solution is? No. Is there such a solution? I \ndon't know.\n  I did propose increasing funding in this measure to increase sandbars \nof benefit to birds and towards slow moving water which I am told will \nhelp the endangered fish. And, the committee placed a portion of that \nfunding in the bill. But, I am certainly not sure that it will be \neffective. A Senator is constantly listening to experts who may or may \nnot be correct.\n  I believe the Corps is responsible for truly sifting through all of \nthe ideas and taking the best and melding them, to do what it can to \nfind the best path. Some say the Fish and Wildlife Service has already \nspoken--period. This is only correct to a point. Yes, they have spoken, \nbut that does not mean that they can't learn about new options and \nbecome aware of more information that can, with an open mind, lead to \ndifferent alternatives.\n  Last year, I opposed Senator Bond's amendment because it simply \nprecluded under all circumstances one type of action from being used \nthat might help endangered species. I understand his strong concerns \nabout a spring rise that his proposal of last year was designed to \nprevent under all circumstances. I certainly have considerable doubts \nabout the logic of the Fish and Wildlife Service's proposed spring \nrise. But, frankly, I believe that the best path is not to \nlegislatively say: No, this option shall be excluded. The best path is \nfor knowledgeable parties to propose better alternatives to be \nconsidered on their merits.\n  Frankly, I also was told that last year's amendment would have \nquickly resulted in a strong lawsuit, with a likely judgement that the \nrestrictions on the Corps to implement a spring rise would violate the \nEndangered Species Act. My fear was that a Federal judge, instead of \nthe Corps would have replaced the Corp of Engineers.\n  Today's amendment is a balanced one. Under the already existing \nlanguage of the bill, clearly, the process is not going to come to a \nfinal judgement in the coming year. The amendment adds to that reality, \nsaying to the Corps: look at the need of the endangered species, look \nat the many purposes of the river. Listen to those who come to testify \nand to provide meritorious input. And, put together some options.\n  Ideally, the Corps will do just that. And, a year from now, \nhopefully, something will be presented that provides for the protection \nof the endangered species and the many benefits that are derived from \nits flowing waters.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that I was able to help develop this \nlanguage which has genuine balance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, last year, Mr. Daschle and I fought hard \nagainst efforts to halt the progress of the new Missouri River Master \nManual. As my distinguished colleague from South Dakota pointed out \nboth last year and this year, the Missouri River is a river in jeopardy \nand the manual is long overdue for a revision.\n  We need a more balanced management of this river system, a balance \nthat will, among other things, give more weight to the use of the water \nfor recreation upstream, at places like Fort Peck reservoir in Montana. \nUnder the current river operations, there are times when the lake has \nbeen drawn down so low that boat ramps are a mile or more from the \nwater's edge, all to send water downstream to support the barge \nindustry. Recreation is vital to the eastern Montana economy and to \neconomies of other upper Missouri states. It's time the Army Corps' \nmanagement practices reflected that reality.\n  This year, one of the worst water years in my State's history, the \nproblems started back in March and April. The Corps told me their hands \nwere tied by the old manual as to how much they could protect lake \nlevels at Ft. Peck and at other upstream Missouri reservoirs--in short, \nthey had to keep letting water out even though lake levels were \ndropping fast.\n  Which is why I applaud Senator Bond's decision to search for \ncompromise because we all want a solution to this problem. We all want \nto make sure the river is managed in the best way possible. Mr. Bond \nhas come forward with an amendment that will allow the Corps \nflexibility to work towards that goal. Mr. Reid and Mr. Domenici agreed \nto language in the Energy and Water bill that will make sure the Corps \nwon't accelerate this process, and that a decision on a new master \nmanual won't be made until 2003. The Corps now has breathing room to do \nwhat's right for the Missouri River, for upstream and downstream \ninterests and for fish and wildlife. After more than 50 years, it's \nabout time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to support \nthe Bond-Carranhan-Grassley amendment to the energy and water \nappropriations bill. This amendment will allow the Secretary of the \nArmy to propose alternatives to the decision mandated by the last \nadministration which will unquestionably increase flood risk and limit \nbarge travel on the lower Missouri and Mississippi Rivers.\n  If we do not correct the ill-informed position that was shoved down \nour throats last year by the previous administration, landowners in \nIowa along the Missouri River will face the threat of increased \nflooding. Thanks to a few of my colleagues that have obviously never \nbeen over to Freemont, Mills, Pottawattamie, Harrison, or Monona \ncounties in Iowa, just to name a few, we have let an issue that was \ndecided for political gain put lives and livelihoods at risk.\n  This is not a new issue. Provisions to limit significant changes in \nflow had been placed in five previous appropriations bills by my \ndistinguished colleague from Missouri, Senator Bond. Each of these \nbills had been signed into law by the last administration, except for \nthe legislation last year. Last year a few members let special interest \ngroups drive the agenda and place my constituents in harm's way. It was \nnot acceptable then and it is not acceptable now.\n  Senator Bond's amendment will allow the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \nto propose alternatives to achieve species recovery other than those \nspecifically prescribed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service plan to \nincrease releases of water from Missouri River dams in the spring. \nMajority Leader Daschle championed the Fish and Wildlife Service's \nposition last year which will eventually result in significant flooding \ndownstream given the heavy rains that are usually experienced in my, \nand other downstream states during that time.\n  Last year our opposition described their position as a ``slight \nrevision'' to increase spring flows, known as ``spring rise'' once \nevery three years. They emphasized, ``not every year, but once every \nthree''. When they emphasized that point I guess I'm wondering whether \nthat somehow makes it better or excusable to risk the lives and the \nlivelihood of Iowans and other Americans living on the Missouri once \nout of every three years instead of every year.\n  This issue is exactly what is wrong with our representative \ngovernment. How many times have we heard about special interests having \ntoo much influence and the decisions that are being made not \nrepresenting the majority. Well here is my casebook example.\n\n[[Page S7861]]\n\nHow many Americans would view increasing the flow of the river to scour \nsandbars more important than protecting life and livelihood. There \nmight be a few, and I realize as hard as this is to believe, there were \n45 in the Senate last year. But if we could let the American people \nvote, I bet they would feel protecting Americans is more important than \nscouring sandbars.\n  The opposition's approach is a terribly risky scheme. Keep in mind \nthat it takes 8 days for water to travel from Gavins Point to the mouth \nof the Missouri. Unanticipated downstream storms can make a \n``controlled release'' a deadly flood inflicting a widespread \ndestruction. There are many small communities along the Missouri River \nin Iowa. Why should they face increased risk for flooding and its \ndevastation? They should not.\n  Equally unacceptable is the low-flow summer release schedule. A so-\ncalled split navigation season would be catastrophic to the \ntransportation of Iowa grain. In effect, the Missouri River will be \nshut-down to barge traffic during a good portion of the summer. It will \nalso have a disastrous effect on the transportation of steel to Iowa \nsteel mills, construction materials and farm inputs such as fertilizer \nalong the Missouri.\n  Opponents of common sense argue that a spring flood is necessary for \nspecies protection under the Endangered Species Act, and that grain and \nother goods can be transported to market by railroad. I do not accept \nthat argument.\n  I believe that there is significant difference of opinion whether or \nnot a spring flood will benefit pallid sturgeon, the interior least \ntern, or the piping plover. In fact, the Corps has demonstrated that it \ncan successfully create nesting habitat for the birds through \nmechanical means so there would be little need to scour the sandbars. \nFurther, it is in dispute among biologists whether or not a flood can \ncreate the necessary habitat for sturgeon.\n  This is why it is important to allow the Secretary to propose \nalternatives to achieve the same goals without the same deadly, ruinous \nside effects.\n  One thing I do know for sure is that loss of barge traffic would \ndeliver the western part of America's grain belt into the monopolistic \nhands of the railroads. Without question, grain transportation prices \nwould drastically increase with disastrous results to on farm income.\n  Every farmer in Iowa knows that the balance in grain transportation \nis competition between barges and railroads. This competition keeps \nboth means of transportation honest. This competition keeps \ntransportation prices down and helps to give the Iowa farmer a better \nfinancial return on the sale of his grain. This competition helps to \nmake the grain transportation system in America the most efficient and \ncost effective in the world. It is crucial in keeping American grain \ncompetitively priced in the world market. The Corps itself has \nestimated that barge competition reduces rail rates along the Missouri \nby $75-$200 million annually.\n  If a drought hits during the split navigation season, there will be \neven less water flowing along the Missouri unless we make this \nnecessary change. Low flow will also significantly inhibit navigation \nalong the Mississippi River. We cannot let this happen.\n  Less water flowing in the late summer will also affect hydroelectric \nrates. Decreased flow means less power generation and higher electric \nrates for Iowans who depend upon this power source. This is not the \ntime to be increasing the price of energy. In my opinion, the last \nadministration already accomplished increasing energy costs to the \nbreaking point for consumers, now it is time to start bringing those \nrates down.\n  The corngrowers summed it up best last year when they stated, ``an \nintentional spring rise is an unwarranted, unscientific assault on \nfarmers and citizens throughout the Missouri River Basin. \n``Unfortunately, the past administration felt sandbars were more \nimportant than citizens. Let's fix this. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Bond-Carnahan-Grassley amendment. Vote for common sense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank you. I will be very brief.\n  I remind the Senate how important this Missouri River issue is and \nwas. First of all, I am very grateful to hear that it is going to get \nresolved, which I understand to be the case. I haven't seen the \nlanguage yet, but obviously there are very good Senators who have a \nmore genuine interest than this Senator. So it will be right.\n  But last year, believe it or not, this entire bill that we are \ntalking about was put at risk because Senator Bond sought to protect \nthe river. An amendment passed, which I supported, that made the entire \nenergy and water bill subject to that amendment with reference to not \nmoving ahead too fast with the new ideas. It had a veto threat with it.\n  Believe it or not, since 1979, I think is the case, energy and water \ntypes of appropriations bills had never been vetoed. So we put at risk \nall the things that are needed in this bill and said we would take it. \nIf the President vetoes it, we will find a way to pass the bill one way \nor another.\n  The reason I state that is because, obviously, the issue is a very \nimportant one. It brought down this entire energy and water \nappropriations bill.\n  Incidentally, we found a way to fix it. It became an issue. I am \nhopeful that today it remains an issue, and that, with this amendment \nwhich has been spoken to and about by those who are Missouri River \naffected, we will end up with something that is really an achievement.\n  Last year, I wondered--it is a very important bill--whether it was \nworth putting the entire bill at risk of a veto. My good friend, \nSenator Bond, who is now joined by others--and I compliment them all--\ntold me: It is a worthwhile thing to do, Senator. I don't like putting \nyour entire bill at risk--the one I happened to have managed then; the \none I am ranking member of now--but I willingly did it, and I think \nthat had ultimately a bit to do with resolving this issue in a better \nway. Because the Senate did find out it was a very serious issue and \nthat they would put it at risk, with a veto pen, with reference to the \nissues between the river people and the professional Federal \nbureaucracies and the environmentalists. Hopefully, it has been worked \nout in an amendment that will be agreed to today.\n  I compliment everybody who has worked on it. I can see the fine hand \nof the majority leader. I can see other Senators from the other side of \nthe aisle who got together to do it. I must, with all respect, \ncompliment Senator Kit Bond for not giving up and for his tenaciousness \nlast year in seeing to it that we, as a Senate, understood that some of \nour Government people were busy about changing things and that we ought \nto get ourselves involved.\n  Normally, we would not like to get involved, but we did. Today, \nperhaps, within an hour or so, we will end this issue with a \ncompromise, which will mean we will not have anyone objecting, and \neveryone--whether they are so-called river people or environmental \npeople or commerce interests--will all agree that their Senators have \ndone a yeoman's job.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, while I understand the reason the \namendment was put in the energy and water bill, and understand the \nreason that there has been discussion about a modification of it that \nthe majority leader says he will accept, nonetheless, let me say that I \nwould prefer that we not have this issue in this bill, that the \nrevision of the master manual on the management of the Missouri River \nhas been going on a long, long time--far too long.\n  For 12 years the Corps of Engineers has been wrestling with this \nissue of how to revise the master manual to manage the Missouri River. \nFor 12 years it has been ongoing. The root of all of these amendments \nhas been to try to continue to stall.\n  Let me describe why this is an important issue from the perspective \nof those of us who live in the upstream States. We have a flood in the \nstate of North Dakota--a flood that came and stayed a manmade, \npermanent flood. It is the size of the State of Rhode Island. It \nvisited North Dakota in the 1950s.\n  Why did that happen? Because this Missouri River--this wonderful \n2,500\n\n[[Page S7862]]\n\nmiles of wild and interesting river--was causing a lot of problems for \na lot of people in some springs. On some occasions during the \nspringtime, those downstream reaches of the Missouri River would have \nan awful flood. You could not play softball in the parks of St. Louis \nin the spring because the Missouri River had gone over its banks and \ncaused substantial flooding. It was true, for a substantial portion of \nthe Missouri River. And for flood control, and other reasons, it was \ndecided that there ought to be a plan to see if they could harness, \nsomehow, this river called the Missouri River.\n  A man named Lewis Pick and a man named Glenn Sloan put together a \nplan, as you might guess, called the Pick-Sloan plan of the 1940s. As \nalmost anyone who knows anything about the river understands, the Pick-\nSloan plan was a mechanism by which they would harness the forces of \nthe Missouri River and create six main stem dams. One of those dams was \nin North Dakota, at the time, the world's largest, earth-filled dam. It \nwas dedicated by President Eisenhower. It flooded 500,000 acres of \nNorth Dakota land. It created a manmade, permanent flood the size of \nRhode Island in the middle of our State.\n\n  One might ask the question, Why would North Dakotans, in the 1950s, \nsay: All right, you can do that. You can come to our State and create a \nRhode Island-sized flood? I will tell you the answer to that. The \nanswer to that was, the Pick-Sloan plan was a plan that said: What we \nwould like to do is provide some benefits for everyone. Downstream, we \nprovide the benefits of flood control, the benefits of perhaps \nachieving more stable navigation opportunities. Upstream, you have the \nopportunity to have a substantial shoreline for the recreation, \nfishing, and tourism industries. And then, in addition, and more \nimportantly, what we will do for you upstream is to take from this huge \nbody of water the ability to move water around your State, something \ncalled Garrison Diversion. And by the way, you can use that water to \nirrigate 1 million acres in your State.\n  So those were the costs and the benefits. Our cost? Our cost was the \none-half million acre flood that came and stayed forever.\n  Now we have the cost. Take a plane and fly over it, and you will find \nthe cost. It is there. That big old body of water is there. So we have \na permanent flood. As a result of that permanent flood, some of the \nfolks downstream do not get flooded in the spring. And some of those \nwonderful cities downstream in the springtime, late in the day, when \nthe shafts of sunlight come through the leaves or trees, they can gear \nup and play a good softball game because there is no flooding. Good for \nthem. That is their benefit. They have the benefits. We have the flood. \nBut we never got the rest of what was promised to us.\n  But in addition to all of that, the master manual by which the river \nis managed was created in a way that said to the Corps of Engineers, \nhere are the things we want to do with this river. And then the Corps \nof Engineers went about managing to what they thought was written in \nthe master manual. And they have always insisted, notwithstanding the \nfact that the Government Accounting Office, and others, that have \nstudied this have said they are wrong, that the issues of recreation \nand fishing and tourism--the industries that have spawned upstream, the \nindustries that have spawned in my State--are somehow of lesser \nconsequence to barge traffic and flood control downstream.\n  So as a result of all of that, there has been discussion about the \nneed to revise the master manual. In 1989, we began to have the Corps \nof Engineers work to revise the master manual.\n  No one in America has ever accused the Corps of Engineers of \nspeeding, and I expect they never will. It is as slow and as \nbureaucratic an organization as there is. But 12 years to revise the \nmaster manual? Twelve years? I don't think so. That is not reasonable. \nYet here we are today. We do not have a master manual revision. And we \nhave propositions that need to be delayed further. There needs to be \nintervals that are artificially created.\n  Let me say this about the states that are involved. We have had a \ngroup called the Missouri River Basin Association--eight States, all of \nwhich harbor the Missouri River. All of these States are enriched by \nthe presence of the Missouri River. These eight States together have \ntried to work on plans about how one would manage the Missouri River \nand what kind of a master manual plan one would develop.\n\n  Seven of the eight States have reached agreement. One has not. Seven \nof the eight States have reached an agreement, and one will not. Can \nanyone guess which State is outside of the seven? The only State among \nthe eight States that said, no, we will not agree? That is right, the \nstate of Missouri.\n  Compromise is important. Compromise is an art. But it is not just in \nthis Senate Chamber. In the Missouri Basin Association, there is not \nthe ability to compromise on the fundamental issue of how you rewrite \nthe master manual with respect to the Missouri River.\n  I have talked a little about the Rhode Island-sized flood that came \nand stayed in my State. Let me talk for a moment about this river.\n  Lewis and Clark went up that river. In the years 1804, 1805, they \ntook keelboats and went up that river. It is a fascinating story. My \ncolleague from South Dakota mentioned just a bit of it, but the story \nis really quite remarkable. Captain Lewis, Mr. Clark, and one of the \nworld's great expeditions--what a remarkable thing they did.\n  Thomas Jefferson actually, with an appropriation of $2,000 that was \nnot disclosed, enlisted Captain Lewis to begin this bold venture. He \ntold them: When you get to St. Louis, charge what you need for your \nventure and sign a requisition to the Federal Government, and we will \npay for it. He purchased keelboats. He purchased a whole series of \nthings. In fact, in St. Louis, he purchased 110 gallons of whiskey. \nThink of what they would make of that today. Requisition that to the \nU.S. Government.\n  So he left St. Louis with this band of men, his keelboats, his 110 \ngallons of whiskey, and so many other things to enrich that trip, and \nthey went up the Missouri River. According to their journals, they saw \ntheir first grizzly bear when they got to what is now Williston, ND. \nThey even made notes in their journals about the mosquitoes they \nencountered. You can encounter some of those same mosquitoes or \nrelatives of them.\n\n  They wintered near where the city of Washburn, ND, now exists, and \nspent the winter with the Mandan Indians. Here is what the description \nof that river was and is by Mr. Clark and others: ``A tawny, restless, \nbrawling flood,'' one observer scribbled about the Missouri River. ``It \nmakes farming as fascinating as gambling; you never know whether you \nare going to harvest corn or catfish.'' What an apt description of that \nwonderful river.\n  William Clark, who braved that wilderness, admired the lush swaths of \noak, ash, and cottonwood on the Missouri's floodplain. He said: It is \n``one of the most butifill Plains I ever Saw, open and butifully \ndiversified.'' ``No other river was ever so dead-set against being \nnavigated,'' another Missouri watcher wrote.\n  This river is unique, remarkable, and wonderful in many ways. But the \nriver has suffered. The people who make a living on that river and near \nthat river have suffered as well. We have not done right by that river. \nWe have created the six main stem dams, and a whole series of things \nhave intervened in the way the river is managed. They have upset the \necosystem. They have caused a series of problems for plants and for \nanimals and for mankind.\n  We can do better. That is the purpose of this issue of rewriting the \nmaster manual. It is said that rewriting the master manual will mean \nthat less attention will be paid to downstream barge traffic. The \ndownstream barge traffic is a minnow compared to the upstream tourism, \nrecreation, and fishing industries, which are a whale. We are talking \nabout less than $10 million compared to nearly $80 million in terms of \nimpact. Yet the Corps of Engineers manages this river as if the \ndownstream barge traffic is some colossus. It is not. It is a \nrelatively small amount of economic activity that has been shrinking.\n  Upstream, the interest in recreation, tourism and fishing has been \ngrowing and growing. Yet the river is managed\n\n[[Page S7863]]\n\nas if it was yesterday in terms of economic circumstances and \nconsequences. That is wrong.\n  I have heard the discussions today about the spring rise and split \nnavigation, all the myths about that. The fact is, even with the spring \nrise, most of the navigation traffic would be unaffected, the \ndownstream reaches. Even with the proposed change in the master manual, \nand managing this river the way it ought to be managed, 99 percent of \nthe flood protection would be available to downstream States.\n  Some of us have exhausted our patience. We get all the cost and \nvirtually none of the benefits upstream. Downstream gets all the \nbenefits and almost none of the cost. Somehow they have said to us: By \nthe way, we love having the Missouri River run through our cities, but \nwe don't want the inconvenience of having spring floods. We don't want \nto interrupt the softball games in the middle of our cities. They build \na flood up north and you have the flood forever. And by the way, when \nwe are short of water, we want your water. And when we have too much, \nwe want you to store it because we want you to be the reservoir that \ntakes all of the cost all of the time.\n  Sometimes you almost think that what we really ought to do, if they \ndon't appreciate the flood control downstream and they don't appreciate \nthe benefits they have received, maybe we ought to just dump those dams \nout of there and let that water go where it will. Then see if maybe we \ndo have a master manual that manages this river in a manner that is \nsensible. Maybe everyone will understand there is a ``balance'' between \nthe interests of the downstream and the upstream States.\n\n  In most cases, one would be able to resolve this in a pretty \nthoughtful way. Frankly, the Missouri River Basin Association has some \npretty good people from every State of the eight States involved who \nhave worked pretty hard on this issue. Seven of the eight States have \npretty much reached agreement on how to resolve it. One State has not. \nThat is the State of Missouri.\n  One would hope that perhaps in that venue, and perhaps also here in \nthe Senate, we might find reasonable compromise to understand that the \nbalance between cost and benefits of downstream and upstream States is \nsomething that ought to be a true balance.\n  Again, this issue is critically important to us. Our future relates \nto economic development. Economic development relates to water \nopportunities. If you don't have water, you don't have development. It \nis that simple. We have the development around this flood that came and \nstayed forever in our State, the development of an aggressive, vibrant \ngroup of industries--fishing, tourism, recreation, that of the \ndownstream navigation interests. Yet we are told with this archaic \nmanagement of the river that somehow it really doesn't count for much. \nWe are saying that is not right. So there ensues this revision of the \nmaster manual.\n  Then 12 years later, we are still standing here talking about whether \nor not the master manual ought to be completed. Of course, it ought to \nbe completed. What on earth can we be thinking about. Twelve years is \nfar too long. We ought to be ashamed of ourselves, the Corps and the \nCongress, that it takes more than a few years to revise a master \nmanual. Maybe we will give it 5 years. How about 7? Maybe 10 years or \n11. But you can't do it in 12? You need more time than that? What kind \nof thinking exists that says you need more time than 12 years to revise \na master manual on how to run a river? I hope we don't have to fight a \nwar some day if that is the thinking that exists. We ought to be able \nto do this in a sensible way.\n  I will not object to what has been offered here. The majority leader \nspoke on behalf of all of us that while he would prefer this issue get \nresolved, and that it is critically important to upstream States, I \nwill not object to this amendment. But this issue should not even be \nhere. This is not where this issue should be considered. This issue \nshould have been behind us, not in front of us. I hope one of these \ndays all of the States, all eight States and not just seven in the \nMissouri River Basin Association, will get together and help to resolve \nthe balance in terms of how to deal with the intricate, simple, and \ncomplex issues dealing with the management of the Missouri River.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate vote \nin relation to the Bond amendment No. 1013 at 4:45 p.m. this day, with \n4 minutes for closing debate prior to the vote, equally divided between \nSenators Bond and Daschle or their designees and that no second-degree \namendment be in order prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, I inquire, has the Bond \namendment not been accepted or at least is this a controversial \namendment?\n  Mr. REID. No, this is not. From everything we have heard from \neverybody we have heard it from, the answer is no. It is just felt it \nwould be appropriate for some to have a vote.\n  Mr. DORGAN. So there is a requirement of a recorded vote on a \nnoncontroversial amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I won't object, but I did maybe leave a \nmisinterpretation a while ago when I spoke about being pleased that we \nhad reached consensus after all of these difficult times, including \nlast year. I may have left the impression that there was not going to \nbe a vote required. That was not my prerogative. I should not have said \nit. The Senator who is the prime sponsor has indicated he wants a vote. \nWe will have one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator is absolutely right. There has \nbeen such significant progress made. This vote is more of a celebration \nof the great progress made. I don't know of anyone who is going to \nobject to this vote. There may be someone I don't know. I would say \nthis is just a culmination of days and days of deliberations.\n  As I indicated earlier, there have been staffs working many hours on \nthis matter. I think the vote is more kind of a note of accomplishment, \nand this will be an overwhelmingly positive vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, actually, I don't know what Senator Bond \nthinks it is, a celebration or whatever. What I understand is that I \nhave been around here a while. There are a lot of reasons to seek a \nrollcall vote.\n  I have begun the practice of not trying to speculate as to why \nrollcalls are requested. In some situations, I would not ask for them \nand Senators insist on them. Other times, I wonder why they don't \nbecause it seems to be such a great issue. Senator Bond is entitled to \nhis request.\n  I yield the floor and have no objection to the unanimous consent.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have now a half-hour before the vote, \napproximately. I hope that those who have amendments will come over and \noffer them. I have had conversations with a couple people, and they \nsaid they were thinking about offering them. I wish they would because \nwe have a managers' package we have talked to a number of Senators \nabout, and we have a number of issues on which we are working. We are \nnot going to do that until we have some end in sight on this \nlegislation. If there are issues, bring them over. What we will do at a \nsubsequent time, if enough time has gone by and everybody has had an \nopportunity to offer amendments--and we believe there are amendments \nthat are no longer vital to be offered if people aren't willing to \noffer them--then we will move to third reading.\n  I recognize that I can't do that without the concurrence of the \nSenator from New Mexico; I would not anyway. But that is something we \ncan do when we have waited long enough with nothing happening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n\n[[Page S7864]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. As I understand it, we entered into an agreement to \nvote on the Bond amendment at a time certain. I now speak to Senators \non my side of the aisle. We have the list of the kinds of amendments \npeople are thinking about. I hope that in the next 2 minutes a Senator \nwho has an amendment that he really wants to have us vote on and \nconsider for some extended period of time will advise either this \nSenator or Senator Reid because we ought to go on to another amendment \nor two. The Bond amendment will have its vote, and it will be disposed \nof. We need to have something to do. I urge them to consider coming \ndown to talk about the amendment they would like to offer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know we are on the energy and water \nappropriations bill. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes as \nin morning business with the proviso that if someone shows up and \nwishes to speak on the bill, I will be happy to relinquish the floor.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is here, and I know he is anxious for \npeople to offer amendments. I say to him that if someone shows up and \nwishes to offer an amendment, I will relinquish the floor and finish my \nstatement another time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator. There may well be someone in \nparticular, Senator Bond. I do not want him to have to wait if he \narrives in the next 10 minutes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dorgan are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Could the Presiding Officer inform the body as to the \nunanimous consent agreement entered into with regard to the final \ncomments on the Bond amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 4 minutes evenly divided and \nproceeding to a vote at 4:45.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Since it is now 4:40, I consulted with the distinguished \nSenator from Missouri, and with his permission I will use my 2 minutes \nand accommodate the Senator's desire to speak to the amendment prior to \nthe time we have the vote.\n  Let me say what I said a few moments ago for purposes of emphasis. \nNo. 1, I support this amendment. I think it, again, is a bona fide \neffort to reach common ground. I attempted to do that. Thanks to the \ndistinguished chair and ranking member of the appropriations \nsubcommittee, I felt we had done so in a reasonable way.\n  Senator Bond goes further and says the Corps of Engineers and the \nFish and Wildlife Service ought to look at other options beside spring \nrise, and that is certainly appropriate. We have no objections.\n  My hope is that we can maintain this position in the final conference \non the appropriations bill. I hope on a bipartisan basis, given the \nkind of strength this amendment will clearly demonstrate, that we can \ndo that.\n  Let me just make three points about the issue. The first point is \nthat American Rivers and other organizations have singled out the \nMissouri River as the single most endangered river in the country. This \nissue is not just about pallid sturgeons. It is not just about \nendangered species. It is about an endangered river. It is about a \nfuture for a river that is in great peril.\n  Second, this issue is about a master manual that is over four decades \nold, that needs to be revised to recognize how endangered this river \nreally is. There has been an extraordinary effort made to find a way to \nrecognize the need for change in the way the river has been managed. I \nbelieve they have done a good job. I believe when the Corps asserts \nthey can control 99 percent of the flooding, as they do now, we ought \nto believe them. But I am prepared to go beyond that, to find \nadditional ways to accommodate those downstream even though we are \nbeing flooded out each and every day. There are 200 homes in Pierre, \nSD, that are being flooded out. And the families who own these homes \nare now being moved. So we know about floods.\n  Finally, let me say if we do not resolve this issue, the courts will. \nThis will be tied up in the courts for a long time to come. We are not \ngoing to be able to avoid this issue. This issue will be dealt with. It \nwill be resolved. The question is, ``Do we do it with Fish and Wildlife \nwith the assistance and oversight of the Congress, or do we do it in \nthe courts?''\n  I hope we can move on and recognize that in spite of our passionate, \ndeeply held feelings, it is important for us to find common ground. \nThis amendment, in my view, moves us closer to that goal. While we have \ndifferent positions on the issue of how the master manual should be \nwritten, we certainly do not have different positions on the need to \nresolve this matter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my cosponsors and others for \nsupporting this amendment, which will get us to a final resolution of \nthis very important question.\n  In response to some of the comments that have been made, the record \nshows in 1952, in the authorization, the projection of tonnage was we \ncould have up to 4 million tons on the river by 2010. The latest \nfigures I have are we currently move agricultural products on the \nMissouri River equivalent to 45,000 transport trucks, fully loaded, at \n80,000 pounds each. That is about 9 million tons of agricultural \nproducts moved in a more environmentally friendly and more efficient \nand more economical way.\n  With respect to the work we do to enhance conservation, wildlife \nhabitat, I note Missouri spends about $141 million on fish and \nwildlife. I outlined in my remarks all the steps we have taken. I hope \nthe managers of the bill will find it in their hearts to be able to \nfund the Mississippi and Missouri River Habitat Program that we \nauthorized several years ago that enables us to continue to make \nimprovements in the river that do not affect the multiple uses of the \nriver but make it much more friendly and supportive of the pallid \nsturgeon, the least tern, the piping plover, and other endangered \nspecies.\n  My position is simply that the Government should be preventing \nfloods, not forcing floods on people. We have an opportunity to ensure \ngood transportation for farmers. We expect, under this new rule, we can \nhave the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Corps of Engineers listening \nto the people who are affected and develop a plan that does not force a \nspring rise down our throats, that does not force flooding on the \nMissouri River, that does not take away our potential for hydropower, \nthat does not cut off river transportation that is vitally important \nfor our farmers.\n  I thank all who have worked with us on this amendment. I urge a \nstrong vote because I believe this finally puts us on a path, not where \nwe are saying you cannot resolve the issue this year, but this outlines \na procedure that I believe can allow sound science to give us the right \nanswer that achieves all of the purposes legislated for the Missouri \nRiver, including the preservation and recovery of endangered species.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1013.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska).

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand we are looking for somebody \nto offer an amendment that can be debated tonight and voted on tonight. \nSenator Murkowski is ready to proceed with an amendment. We have one \nscheduled after it, but I will try to determine if we can find some \nadditional amendments.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the majority leader is in the Chamber, if I \ncould have his attention.\n  Senator Domenici just advised that there was an amendment ready on \nwhich we could have a vote tonight. I want to say in the presence of \nthe majority leader that as the manager of this bill and having heard \nwhat he has said the last several days, we really need to do more than \njust one amendment. I am glad we are moving forward. I extend my \nappreciation to the Senator from New Mexico. We need to look at \ncompleting this bill tonight, if it is possible. Would the leader \nagree?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I appreciate \nvery much the work of the chairman and ranking member.\n  We have just had a vote on the first amendment offered. We have been \non the bill all week and the vote was 100-0. I hope we can move to the \nmore substantive issues that have to be resolved before we can bring \nthe bill to closure. But we will be in later this evening and tomorrow \nand tomorrow evening in order to accommodate Senators who wish to offer \namendments.\n  After this, of course, we still have the Transportation bill that we \nhave to bring up. There is a lot of work left to be done for the week. \nIf Senators will cooperate and work with us, we can complete our work \non this bill. This is a very good bill. Senators have done a good deal \nof work to get us to this point. I think it is a fine product, but we \nneed cooperation from Senators in order to finish.\n  As the Senator from Nevada has noted, we are looking for people who \ncan offer amendments. I know the Senator from Alaska is planning to do \nthat now. I am hopeful that we can do more of that tonight before we \ncomplete our work for this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from \nMassachusetts to ask a question.\n  Mr. KERRY. I wanted to ask something of the majority leader. It is my \nunderstanding that the majority leader made it quite clear at the \nbeginning of the week that there was an agenda that needed to be \naccomplished if indeed the Senate intended to not be here on Friday. It \nis my understanding that, at the pace we are moving, there is a clarity \nto the fact that unless this changes, we will be here until late Friday \nand all of Monday voting; is that accurate?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is correct. We will have to be here later \nthan normal on Friday afternoon, and we will be here on Monday as well. \nWe have no choice. We have to continue our work. This will accommodate \nthe consideration of the bills that have to be disposed of.\n  Last year, eight appropriations bills had passed by the end of July. \nThus far, we have only passed one in the Senate. So we have a lot of \nwork to do just to catch up with what we did last year. So our effort \nto do that will go unimpeded, and we will do the best we can, given the \nschedule we have. We have a lot of work to do this week.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the majority leader.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me state in the presence of the \nmajority leader that nobody is more interested in getting the bill \ncompleted than the Senator from New Mexico. I remember one year when \nthis bill was vetoed over an amendment that was debated in this \nChamber. The distinguished majority leader remembers that. It was a \npretty onerous situation to veto an entire bill over the Missouri \nRiver.\n  We have not been on this bill very long because if you want to recall \nwith me, what happened is you carved out big pieces of time for other \nthings during each of the days that this bill has been up, so that on \nMonday we had a little time but no votes; Tuesday, yesterday, we didn't \nstart on this bill until after noon, and this morning we finished our \nmemorials and started at 11 o'clock.\n  So while it may seem that we were here the whole time, we have not \nbeen on the bill that whole time. This would be a very short number of \nhours. Nonetheless, I will work with our Members, and I don't think \nanybody is intending to delay matters. We just put them off when, in \nfact, we have long lists, wondering who is going first. There are not a \nlot of amendments that people say they want to vote on. There are a lot \nof amendments that are going to be either in the managers' amendment or \nare not going to be taken care of. Senators know that. I will try to \nget two or three more lined up if we can proceed with this one now.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. In the spirit of cooperation, after listening to the \nmajority leader, I would be happy if the other side took the amendment \nand we would not need to have a vote. We are willing to do that on this \nside, but not on the other side. I hope after my explanation there will \nbe a reconsideration and we will not have to have a vote. However, if \nwe don't get accepted, we will press for a vote.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1018\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1018.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To provide grants and fellowships for energy industry \n  workforce training and to monitor energy industry workforce trends)\n\n       On page 12, line 19, strike ``$732,496,000'' and insert \n     ``$722,496,000''.\n       On page 19, line 2, strike ``$3,268,816,000, to remain \n     available until expended.'' and insert ``$3,278,816,000, to \n     remain available until expended: Provided, That $10,000,000 \n     shall be provided to fund grant and fellowship programs in \n     the appropriate offices of the Department of Energy to \n     enhance training of technically skilled personnel in \n     disciplines for which a shortfall of skilled technical \n     personnel is determined through study of workforce trends and \n     needs of energy technology industries by the Department of \n     Energy, in consultation with the Department of Labor.''.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this amendment makes appropriations for \nenergy and water development for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n2002, specifically providing that $10\n\n[[Page S7866]]\n\nmillion shall be provided to fund grant and fellowship programs in the \nappropriate offices of the Department of Energy to enhance training of \ntechnically skilled personnel in disciplines for which a shortfall of \nskilled technical personnel is determined through study of workforce \ntrends and needs of energy technological industries by the Department \nof Energy, in consultation with the Department of Labor.\n  The purpose of the amendment is to address realities associated with \nthe area of energy and to focus in on the energy crisis in this \ncountry. To a large degree, that crisis exists because of inadequate \ntraining capabilities within the energy area.\n  The amendment would monitor workforce trends across the energy \nindustry. It would provide $10 million for DOE grants and fellowships \nto colleges and universities to remedy workforce shortages. It would \ndevelop the energy workforce of the future.\n  This amendment takes $10 million from the increased funding proposed \nfor the CALFED program. I want to identify for my friend, the senior \nSenator from California, that these are funds coming from the increased \nfunding proposal. I recognize the sensitivity to the senior Senator \nfrom California of the CALFED program. I also direct your attention to \nthe fact that this program has never been authorized by the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, which is an appropriate procedure.\n  I welcome that authorization. I would welcome the opportunity to work \nwith my friend from California, perhaps, to find these funds in some \nother area. In any event, what we do in the amendment is redirect these \nfunds to address what we consider a critical need for our Nation's \nenergy security and the next generation of energy workers.\n  I recognize the CALFED program is a water program, but I also point \nout that we are taking this from the increased funding for CALFED.\n  As we talk about national energy policy--supply, demand, and \ninfrastructure--I think we also have to consider the realities \nassociated with the inadequacy of the workforce. Who is going to \ndevelop and deploy the new energy technologies we are going to need for \nthe future? Even now, we find the Nation is unable to meet current \nlabor needs and trends for the future. The forecast is ominous.\n  Enrollment in petroleum engineering has dropped 28 percent in the \nlast decade. Geoscience enrollment is down 32 percent. Enrollments in \nnuclear engineering have declined by 60 percent in the past 10 years. \nTwo-thirds of our nuclear faculty are older than 45; 76 percent of U.S. \nnuclear workers and 51 percent of geophysicists are within 10 years of \nretirement. There are few renewable energy and energy-efficiency \nprograms but large potential needs for skilled workers to meet the \ndemand.\n  Several years are required to train highly skilled workers with \nadvanced engineering or science degrees. We must act now. I have worked \nwith Senators Domenici and Bingaman, and I agreed they were right to \ninclude workforce considerations in their energy proposals. This is a \nvital but unrecognized part of energy strategy.\n  Recognizing the urgent national need we face, I propose that we \nprovide sufficient funding to finally get this program started. Mr. \nPresident, $10 million will allow the Department of Energy to begin the \nprogram, conduct the initial needs assessment, and fund a few of the \nfellowships that are necessary in the necessary priorities.\n  I would have preferred to bring this program to the floor of the \nSenate in conjunction with comprehensive energy legislation, but we are \nstill reviewing several proposals, still holding hearings, with the \nhope of action later this year.\n  I hope we can adopt this amendment now and get started and develop a \nfully authorized, fully funded program as we consider comprehensive \nenergy legislation.\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment to develop the energy workforce \nof the future. In order to fund this critically needed education \nprogram, I am proposing to take $10 million from funding from the \nCALFED bay-delta program in California. This program, just like last \nyear, has no authorization, as I have indicated.\n  Last year, the Appropriations Committee refused to fund CALFED, and I \nthink it should consider the merits of this amendment this year. I am \nnot unsympathetic, as I have indicated, to the water needs of the \nWestern States. When I was chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, a number of important water projects were authorized: the \nGarrison project in North Dakota; the Lewis and Clark Rural Water \nSystem; the Animas-LaPlata project, and several others perhaps not as \nexpensive as these.\n  What these projects had in common were, A, many, sometimes agonizing, \nyears of study and negotiation; B, numerous Senate hearings spanning \nseveral Congresses; C, most important, they were all authorized by the \ncommittee of jurisdiction, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.\n  CALFED has done none of this--no hearings in the Senate ever, \nalthough I point out we do have our first CALFED hearing scheduled for \nthis Thursday afternoon in Senator Dorgan's Water and Power \nSubcommittee.\n  When CALFED was first authorized in 1996, no hearings were held; $430 \nmillion over 3 years was put in the Omnibus Parks Act of 1996, which I \nmanaged, to begin a process to address California's complex water \nproblems. But that authorization expires at the end of fiscal year \n2002.\n  Senator Feinstein has introduced a bill, S. 979, to authorize the \nactions recommended in the Record of Decision last summer. I commend \nher for her efforts on this important project and hope the hearing \nscheduled on Thursday will be helpful as she pursues this goal.\n  However, one scheduled hearing is certainly not adequate in my mind \nto justify the $20 million requested by the administration, much less \nthe $20 million added by the subcommittee.\n  Mind you, it was $20 million by the administration, and an additional \n$20 million was added by the subcommittee. What we are proposing to do \nis to take $10 million of the additional $20 million, so it will still \nleave $30 million, which is $10 million more than the administration \nproposed.\n  In addition, one hearing is not likely to provide enough information \nto learn as much as is necessary to move on a 30-year project that is \nestimated to cost in the first 7 years alone some $8 billion. Clearly, \nthis is a project that should be authorized by the committee of \njurisdiction.\n  I wonder how many Senators in the Chamber today can tell me on what \nsome of that $8.5 billion will be spent.\n  In funding the CALFED program, the committee report contains some \nrather interesting language. First, the committee report notes that:\n\n       The appropriate authorizing committees of Congress should \n     thoroughly review and specifically reauthorize the CALFED \n     program.\n\n  I believe Senator Feinstein has started us along that path with S. \n979 and Thursday's hearing.\n  Second, the committee recommended:\n\n       No funding under the California Bay-Delta Ecosystem \n     Restoration Project.\n\n  This is where things get a little tricky. In the next paragraph of \nthe report, the committee provides an additional $20 million over the \nbudget request for the Central Valley Project:\n\n       Additional funds to support the goals of CALFED are \n     provided as follows:\n\n  Then the report goes on to list all kinds of projects with very \nlittle explanation that should be undertaken in the CVP to support the \ngoals of CALFED.\n  To understand the irony of this, I have one more quote from the \ncommittee report:\n\n       The committee has consistently expressed concern regarding \n     the duplication and overlap of CALFED activities with Central \n     Valley Project Improvement Act programs and other activities \n     funded under various other programs within the Bureau of \n     Reclamation.\n\n  It seems to me by not funding CALFED, then pulling money from CVP, \nthe committee is fostering the very confusion and overlap about which \nconcern has been consistently expressed. If we are providing funds from \nthe CVP, the CVP contractors should receive the benefit. Yet a central \nfocus on the CALFED proposal is that proposals, such as raising the \nShasta Dam or enlarging the Los Vaqueros Reservoir, should not be used \nto offset the 1.2 million acre foot reduction in CVP yield as a result \nof the CVPIA.\n  I am not proposing we completely eliminate the funding proposed under\n\n[[Page S7867]]\n\nthis bill, but I am asking that a portion of the increase be redirected \nto critically needed educational programs.\n  I also suggest that the appropriators, when they get to conference, \nensure that whatever they fund is directed toward the purposes of the \noriginal authorization.\n  The benefits of raising Shasta Dam should go to the water and power \nusers of the CVP, even if there are collateral benefits to the CALFED \nprocess.\n  If you want to pick a particular aspect of the subcommittee that \nshould not be funded, I support cutting the environmental water \naccount. Maybe that is a good idea, but that is why we are holding a \nhearing on S. 979.\n  Mr. President, that concludes my statement. I yield the floor, and I \nwill be happy to respond to any questions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I regret that I have to strongly \noppose the amendment of the distinguished Senator from Alaska. I recall \nboth in the committee and in the Senate Chamber hearing the \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska talk about supply, particularly in \nview of the electricity and natural gas portion of the energy crisis \nthat faces this Nation.\n  One of the things we in California have learned is that the \nelectricity crisis is a forerunner of what is going to happen with \nwater.\n  California has 35 million people. It is the largest high-tech State \nand the largest agricultural producing State. It has a need for high-\nquality water for high-tech, and it does not have enough water.\n  Just last week, this Senate debated the Klamath with an endangered \nspecies issue involving both the coho salmon and the suckerfish. The \nBureau of Reclamation had to cut off water for farmers, and 1,500 \nfarmers on both sides of the Oregon-California border essentially could \nnot plant.\n  This is not going to be an isolated incident. We are going to see \nthis happen up and down the Central Valley if we do not act smart, if \nwe do not work smart, if we do not move to improve the water supply, to \nwork smarter on the big pumps on the California Water project, if we \nare not able to recharge our ground water and, respectfully, if we are \nnot able to take from the wet years and store that water to use in the \ndry years.\n  The Senator is precisely going after this money so that we cannot \nbuild the storage we need. The three projects that he mentioned: \nRaising Shasta Dam--that is a dam that is already there--raising the \nLos Vaqueros Reservoir, which is for reasons of water quality. There is \na need for water quality both for the people in the area as well as \nwhat is supplied to the high-tech industry. That is Los Vaqueros. And \nthe third is a delta wetlands project to provide water for the Central \nValley water community.\n  He mentioned that there is no authorization. CALFED was authorized, \nhe is correct. The authorization has expired. Tomorrow we have a \nhearing in the committee on a bill he mentioned which I have authored \nto provide the necessary authorization. There are three bills in the \nHouse.\n  I believe we are going to authorize this project. Not to do so would \nbe a terrible mistake.\n  I must correct the Senator on one point. He mentioned $8 billion in \nthe authorization. This is not correct. Although the bill says ``such \nsums as may be available,'' the fact is the Federal share would be $3 \nbillion and the State share $5 billion.\n  The point of what I am trying to do in the authorization bill is have \nall segments of the project--the ecosystem restoration, which is \nnecessary for fish, the environmental water account, which is there to \navoid an additional takings issue, as well as the storage and the water \nquality improvements--moved together concurrently so there is a \nbalanced plan to move on the California water issue prior to the time \nit becomes a real crisis and the fifth largest economy on Earth is put \nout of business.\n\n  I plead with the Senator from Alaska not to take these dollars, \nparticularly from the storage project. Unless we can take water from \nthe dry years and save that water and use it for the wet years, \nCalifornia has no chance of solving its problem. We have 34 million \npeople, projected to be 50 million people, and we have the same basic \nwater infrastructure we had when we were 16 million people. That is why \nthis isn't going to work.\n  The chairman of the committee, the distinguished Senator from Nevada, \nhas worked very hard to be helpful. I am enormously grateful to him. He \nhas worked in a prudent way to meet the need, I think knowing we are \ngoing to be able to produce an acceptable authorization vehicle in this \nsession.\n  Once again, I am willing to work with the Senator from Alaska. I am \nwilling, as an appropriator, to try to help find other funds. His \nproject is worthy. His offset is not.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the subcommittee was very cautious to make \nsure that anything we did did not interfere with the jurisdiction of \nthe Energy Committee. The ranking member, Senator Murkowski, is in the \nChamber. Everything we have appropriated money for is related to things \nthat have been authorized. We are not appropriating money that has not \nbeen authorized, and we went to great extremes to make sure we did \nthat.\n  I am, some say, the third Senator from California. I am happy to be \nin that category. Because it is such a huge State, they need all the \nhelp they can get. We in Nevada are a neighbor of the State of \nCalifornia. We are small in relation to population, compared to their \n34 million, but we have some of the same problems they have. Water is \none of them. The bay-delta project is an extremely complex, difficult \nproblem. The State of California has recognized it is a difficult \nproblem. It has spent billions of dollars of California taxpayers' \nmoney to solve these problems.\n  I believe, this subcommittee believes, and I think the Senate will \nbelieve, we, the Federal Government, have an obligation to help. This \nmoney we are appropriating is a very small amount of money, considering \nthe tremendous burden the State of California has to meet their \ndemands. Many of these problems were created by the Federal Government. \nThe Bureau of Reclamation has been up to their hips in water. Many of \nthe problems that California has had have been created by virtue of the \nFederal Government being involved in one way or another.\n  The committee believes, of course, the appropriate authorizing \ncommittees of Congress should shortly review and authorize the \nprograms. We agree with the distinguished Senator from Alaska that \nshould be the case. They are in the process of doing that, as has been \nindicated by the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from California.\n  However, in what we have appropriated, it is important to keep the \nFederal Government involvement. I oppose the amendment being offered by \nmy friend from Alaska. I agree it is important to invest in the future \nof our energy workforce. I believe that very much. I believe his \namendment, as far as what he is trying to accomplish, is excellent. I \nthink the offset he has identified is inappropriate.\n  My friend from Alaska correctly notes the worker training program is \nsubject to future authorization in his committee as is CALFED. However, \nthis subcommittee, I repeat, has been very careful to fund only those \nCALFED programs that existed as authorizations under other programs. \nCALFED is desperately important to the bay area and is important to the \nwhole State of California.\n  I oppose any changing of the mark at this time. It is an appropriate \nlevel of funding dealing with the population growth of the largest \nState in the Union, 34 million people and growing. As the Senator from \nCalifornia has indicated, it is the fifth largest economy in the world. \nIt is the largest agricultural State in America. We hear a lot about \nthe farm States. Rarely is California included in those, but they are \nan immense producer of agricultural products. We in the West appreciate \nvery much the fruits and vegetables that come from the State of \nCalifornia. The commodities are great. Much of that comes from this \narea of the country. Agricultural needs of California are threatened if \nwe don't provide this money.\n  One of the things we have not talked about that we need to talk about \nis the\n\n[[Page S7868]]\n\necosystem itself. I admire what the State of California is trying to \ndo. The State of California in years past has created economic and \nenvironmental disasters in the State of California. The State of \nCalifornia, to its credit, is trying to correct this. We, the Federal \nGovernment, should join in trying to help them.\n\n  I will try to work with my friend from Alaska. It is my understanding \nthat the chairman of the committee also likes very much this program \ndealing with worker training. I think that is important. I would like \nto work with him to try to accommodate this new program for workers in \nconference. I will try to do that.\n  I am aware, as I indicated, that we have a situation where the \nchairman and the ranking member agree on this, as they agree on a \nnumber of issues. I honestly believe we have stayed out of the \nauthorizers' jurisdiction in this matter, and I will ask at the \nappropriate time for the Senators to support this motion to table that \nI will make at a subsequent time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Let me make a couple of observations. In arguing \nagainst the amendment, it is somewhat ironic that the two Senators \nprobably have as much exposure as any Members who come from States \nwhere there is either a risk or an exposure to electricity blackouts. \nClearly, training a new generation of energy workers suggests we need \nthe best engineers in the world to create the best energy development, \nthe best delivery system. That will help fund the solutions to the \nStates' problems, particularly California.\n  I remind my friend from Nevada, the floor manager, and the \ndistinguished senior Senator from California, we are not creating a new \nprogram. We are not creating a new program that requires authorization. \nWe are directing funding to the DAO Office of Science to carry out this \nimportant function as opposed to what we are doing relative to the \nCalifornia issue.\n  As far as the CALFED issue is concerned, I agree California needs to \naddress its problems with the help of the Congress. However, they must \ndo so in a process that is customarily laid out in procedure before \nthis body. I am happy to help the Senator from California with her \nconcern, but the Senate has never, ever, ever, ever held a hearing on \nthe proposals mentioned here. That is significant itself. Many Senators \nin this body assume there is a process where we hold a hearing, we do \nan evaluation, and we hear from witnesses on the merits of the \nproposal. There has been no explanation offered as to why we have not \nhad a hearing. I recognize there will be a hearing tomorrow. We have \nheld a hearing on workforce needs, specially nuclear workforce needs in \nthe Energy Committee.\n\n  So we have some reasonable reference point to justifiably say there \nis a significant difference here between funding this workforce effort \nand having had a hearing on it and not having had any hearings on the \nCALFED issue, as proposed in this legislation. The dollars are not \nspecifically taken from an individual project, only from a larger \noverall account. I am happy to support appropriations once a proposed \nauthorization is completed, and I would work with the Senator from \nCalifornia to address from where those funds might come. But the bottom \nline--and I encourage my colleagues and those who are monitoring this \ndebate to recognize the realities--is the administration requested $20 \nmillion. What did the Appropriations Committee do? They said no. They \nsaid no because CALFED is not authorized.\n  Instead, the Appropriations Committee put $40 million into the CVP, \nwhich is a separate California project. But the intent was to spend it \non the CALFED project. It is kind of a sleight of hand, if you will. I \ndo not mean this in a derogatory way, but when you look at the $20 \nmillion the administration requested and the Appropriations Committee \nsaid no because CALFED is not authorized, then the Appropriations \nCommittee put $20 million into CVP, so they basically doubled the \namount that was requested by the administration.\n  What we are talking about here is not taking anything beyond what the \nadministration requested, which was $20 million. They got $40 million \nin the CVP. We are talking about taking $10 million to fund the \nworkforce effort in the Department of Energy. Clearly, the CVP would \nhave $10 million more than the administration requested. Instead of $40 \nmillion, they would have $30 million. So I think that is an adequate \nexplanation of the points brought up.\n  Again, I have the deepest respect for the senior Senator from \nCalifornia and for the floor manager, the senior Senator from Nevada. \nHaving gone to school in California, having familiarity with the \nnecessity of California's productivity related to water, I suggest we \nproceed with this process through an authorization in the committees of \njurisdiction, including the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and \nI will pledge to the delegation from California my effort, and that of \nthe professional staff, to work toward the end to meet the legitimate \nneeds of California. But I think we need to adhere to the process.\n  It is my understanding there has been an effort to try to reach \nconsensus on a vote, perhaps at 6 o'clock or shortly after?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I object to 6 o'clock.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I hear the Senator from California objecting. I am not \nasking for a unanimous consent. I was making an inquiry. Again, I \nencourage recognition of the necessity of authorization on this matter.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time until \n6:15 today be equally divided and controlled between Senators Reid and \nMurkowski; that no amendments be in order prior to the vote in relation \nto the amendment; that at 6:15 the Senate vote in relation to the \namendment with no intervening action; and that the Senator from Nevada \nallocate 10 minutes that I have to the Senator from California, Mrs. \nBoxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  If no one yields time, time will be charged to both sides.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to address the amendment before us. \nIs that in order at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, because I was preparing for this debate, I \ndo not know exactly the time I have been allowed. May I be informed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am really disappointed that we have this amendment \npending which would take $10 million out of a $40 million appropriation \nthat my colleague Senator Feinstein has worked hard to get for the \nCalifornia water, I would say, near crisis.\n  We have a process in California called the CALFED process. I think a \nlot of our States could learn some good lessons from this process. Why \ndo I say that? Because we all know that questions about water, when it \nis in short supply, can be extremely contentious. We certainly know \nwater is the staff of life. People need it to live. We certainly know \nthat water and the free flow of water is important to our wildlife, to \nour environment, unless we believe we can abandon being good stewards \nof the environment and forget about the wildlife, about endangered \nspecies, and suddenly have a circumstance where we have fishermen \nworried they cannot fish. We certainly know we need the water for our \nfarmers.\n  The reason Senator Feinstein has worked hard on this appropriation is \nwe did not have an appropriation last year. We have to move this \nprocess forward. We cannot abandon this very carefully balanced \napproach which I think has worked so well. We will have a \nreauthorization; that is clear. But the bottom line is we have many \ntimes appropriated funds where there was no authorization, where we had \na history, a good history, with the project as we have had with CALFED. \nThis important process would be harmed if the Murkowski amendment were \nto pass.\n\n[[Page S7869]]\n\n  Why do I say that? I refer you to the bill where we have very \ncarefully explained it. My colleagues are again to be commended, for \nthis spells out exactly where these funds will go. Yes, we have an \nenvironmental water council, which my colleague from Alaska talked \nabout without seeming to praise it very much. But it is crucial because \nif we can take care of that particular part of the equation \nenvironmentally, it will free us up to get more water storage to be \nable to take care of the other users.\n  The money that is in this bill is not put there lightly. My colleague \nfrom California understands the needs of the country. But every single \nappropriation is spelled out very clearly and very carefully. As I read \nit, most of this will go in terms of numbers for projects to find water \nfor the farmers. And, yes, we have an environmental council that will \ntake care of that set- aside.\n  We know what it is to go through water wars in California. We know \nwhat it is to go through electricity wars in California. We know what \nit is to have people pointing fingers back and forth about who is to \nblame. We also know that the CALFED process works. It is very important \nthat we hold it together. It is very balanced.\n  As my colleague and I seek to get reauthorization, we are trying to \nbe as one as we go forward. But we certainly have one goal, and that is \nto be true to the CALFED process. We will in fact be sending a very bad \nsignal this evening if this appropriation is reduced.\n  This funding is needed. This funding is important. This funding sends \na signal to all stakeholders--be they urban users or farmers or \nenvironmentalists--that their goals are important; we will come behind \nthose goals with funding. I think it will be in fact very detrimental \nto the CALFED process if the Senate sends this kind of signal tonight.\n  This is not controversial. We talk about water. Water in itself \nalways brings up controversy. But the CALFED process to date has been \nvery successful. What Senator Feinstein has done and what the committee \nhas done is to take those projects that are not controversial, that are \npart of the CALFED process, and fund them.\n  I hope we will reject the Murkowski amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from California wishes to speak.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague for \nher comments. I very much appreciate her solidarity and unity on this \nsubject. It is extraordinarily important.\n  I also want to say there is a statement from the administration in \nsupport of this appropriation. We have the support of the Secretary of \nthe Interior, as well as the administration, that this appropriation \nmove forward. I am very hopeful that we will have unanimous support \nfrom our side of the aisle as well as support from the Republican side.\n  As my colleague has well stated, we are fighting for every dollar. \nThe energy subcommittee listened. I think it is a fact that the money \nin this appropriations bill is extraordinarily important. I believe \nthat unless we can move aggressively to build an environmentally \nsensitive water infrastructure in our State, there is no way we are \ngoing to be able to meet the challenges of the future.\n  This is a beginning.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank the chairman and my colleague.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am certainly sensitive to the \nconsiderations of my two friends from California. I would like to \ncorrect the record in one sense. We are not talking about a \nreauthorization; we are talking about an authorization that has never \ntaken place. While there are exceptions from time to time, it is the \ngeneral rule that we authorize these projects.\n  This is a complex project. Again, I remind my colleagues that the \nAppropriations Committee during this process increased over the \nadministration's proposal from $20 million to $40 million total. As a \nconsequence, to take $10 million away is still giving this project $10 \nmillion more than originally proposed by the administration.\n  Again, let the record note specifically that the administration \nrequested $20 million. The appropriators said no. Why did the \nappropriators say no? They said no because CALFED is not authorized.\n  That is the only real reservation the Senator from Alaska has. I do \nthat as the ranking member and former chairman of the committee of \njurisdiction. I have no other reason, no other motivation, because I am \nsensitive to the water needs of California. Instead, the appropriators \nput $20 million in the CVP, a separate California project. But the \nintent was for it to be spent on CALFED projects.\n  There has been a little sleight of hand here, if you will, in the \nmanner in which the appropriators addressed this. That is their \nbusiness. But it is my business as the ranking member of the Energy \nCommittee to advise my colleagues that we have not had an \nauthorization. That is the basis for my objection.\n  I think it is certainly a justification, since we are not creating a \nnew program with $10 million of the $40 million, which is more than the \nadministration requested in the sense that they offered $20 million and \noffered to move $10 million to a worthwhile project while not creating \na new program that would need authorization, but directed funding to \nthe DOE Office of Science to carry out the important function of \ntechnical training in the State.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to compliment the distinguished \nSenator from Alaska on what his amendment will do.\n  There is no question that the Department of Energy is now engaged in \na transition period as we prepare for new technologies, both in \nconservation and in the production of electricity and other aspects of \nenergy consumption in our country.\n  His amendment supplements a portion of this bill which continues to \nfund college programs in the area of nuclear physics and related \nmatters. He brings it down to creating some openings for internships to \nget involved in this kind of technology and training. I think it is a \nrather interesting approach to this changing period. He discussed it \nwith me. I urged him to proceed with reference to this idea.\n  I urged that we not support the motion to table and that we permit \nthis new idea to be approved with reference to the kinds of skills that \nare necessary to make the transition, and see whether it will work, \nalong with other programs that we are now funding out of the Department \nof Energy.\n  I yield any time I may have.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Alaska, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table amendment No. \n1018. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced---yeas 56, nays 44, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 238 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--56\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n\n[[Page S7870]]\n\n\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith (OR)\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--44\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Cochran\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the live \nquorums in relation to these two cloture motions be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nprograms in the fiscal year 2002 Energy and Water Appropriations Report \nthat prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and nuclear weapon-usable \nmaterial. These programs are vital to the national security of the \nUnited States.\n  Appropriately, the committee has expressed concern that the \n``proposed budget would seriously erode progress made at great expense \nto assure the Nation's capability to detect and mitigate global \nproliferation activities.'' By providing $106.8 million above the \nPresident's request, the committee has restored many of the \nadministration's cuts to nuclear non-proliferation programs.\n  Programs restored by the committee include the Nuclear Cities \nInitiative, which redirects Russian nuclear expertise and reduces \nRussian nuclear infrastructure. This project was given a $14.5 million \nboost. An additional $15 million was added to the Initiatives for \nProliferation Prevention program, which funds joint non-military \nresearch and development projects, pairs U.S. industries with \nindustries in the former Soviet Union and identifies and creates non-\nmilitary commercial applications. I support the committee's \nrecommendation that some of the excess funds for this program be \ndirected to projects within Russian nuclear cities, in coordination \nwith the Nuclear Cities Initiative. While encouraging, these actions by \nthe committee merely move us back to the starting line.\n  I also would like to express my support for the committee \nrecommendation of $300 million to recapitalize existing operation \nfacilities. The President proposed nothing in his budget to \nrecapitalize our nuclear infrastructure.\n  The National Nuclear Security Administration released a study last \nyear on defense programs facilities and infrastructure assessment that \nreviewed the conditions of our nuclear facilities and labs. The report \nidentified a $650 million annual shortfall over the next five years in \nour nuclear weapons complex, with unfunded priority requirements \nincreasing by $200 million per year.\n  This is unacceptable.\n  Many of our facilities are World War II-era and in dire need of \nupgrades and repair. I have visited the facilities in Oak Ridge, TN, \nand can personally attest to the amount of recapitalization and \nmodernization needed. The President's budget addressed none of these \nneeds.\n  Recently the distinguished former leader of this body, the Honorable \nHoward Baker from Tennessee, testified before the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee about the serious funding inadequacies in non-\nproliferation programs run by the Department of Energy. As Co-Chair of \nthe Baker-Cutler Task Force, Baker testified that increased funding is \ncritical to the future of these vital programs.\n  He testified that in the former Soviet Union ``over 40,000 nuclear \nweapons, over a thousand metric tons of nuclear materials, vast \nquantities of chemical and biological weapons materials, and thousands \nof missiles. This Cold War arsenal is spread across 11 time zones, but \nlacks the Cold War infrastructure that provided the control and \nfinancing necessary to assure [they] remain securely beyond the reach \nof terrorists . . . The most urgent unmet National Security threat to \nthe United States today is the danger that weapons of mass destruction \nor weapons-usable material in Russia could be stolen and sold to \nterrorists or hostile nation states and used against American troops \nabroad or our citizens at home.'' As a result, the Baker-Cutler report \ncalled for an increase in funding for such initiatives--approximately \n$30 billion over the next 8-10 years.\n  I urge the Senate to consider the efforts and work of Howard Baker \nand Lloyd Cutler and provide the resources needed to fund these \nprograms and facilities because they are vital to our national \nsecurity.\n  Our nuclear weapons complex and infrastructure will become even more \nimportant if the president seeks to reduce our stockpile as part of a \nnew strategic framework. I encourage President Bush to place \nappropriate emphasis on nonproliferation as we develop this new \nframework with Russia and other involved nations.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, in 1997, the Department of Energy and \nthe State of South Carolina reached an agreement for the Savannah River \nSite to accept and dispose of surplus weapons-grade plutonium. In \nresponse to an effort by the former Soviet Union and the United States \nto reduce weapons-grade plutonium, the Savannah River Site would accept \nplutonium from the Pantex Plant in Texas and the Rocky Flats \nEnvironmental Technology Site in Colorado. South Carolina was promised \nthat this plutonium would only be treated at SRS, not stored for a \nsignificant amount of time. The disposition agreement included two \ntypes of treatment--blending the plutonium into mixed oxide fuel for \nuse in commercial nuclear reactors, commonly known as MOX--and \nimmobilizing it in a facility know as the Plutonium Immobilization \nPlant. The reason for using two different treatments was simple and \nspelled out in the Federal Register on January 21, 1997.\n\n       Due to technology, complexity, timing, cost, and other \n     factors that would be involved in purifying certain plutonium \n     materials to make them suitable for potential use in MOX \n     fuel, approximately 30 percent of the total quantity of \n     plutonium (that has or may be declared surplus to defense \n     needs) would require extensive purification to use in MOX \n     fuel, and therefore will likely be immobilized. DOE will \n     immobilize at least 8 metric tons, MT, of currently declared \n     surplus plutonium materials that DOE has already\n\n[[Page S7871]]\n\n     determined are not suitable for use in MOX fuel.\n\n  Since 1997, DOE has continued on this dual-track path for \ndisposition. That is until this year. In the administration's fiscal \nyear 2002 DOE budget request, funds for the National Nuclear Security \nAdministration, NNSA, were cut by over $100 million. Due to these \nbudget cuts, one of the plutonium disposition programs, immobilization, \nwas delayed indefinitely. I don't blame the NNSA for the cut to this \nprogram because I know it is their job to work within the budget they \nare given. However, I do blame the Administration for providing a \nbudget that is woefully inadequate to provide for plutonium disposition \nactivities at Savannah River. When General Gordon, the NNSA Director, \ntestified in front of the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, \nhe stated plainly that Plutonium Immobilization was delayed because of \nfinancial reasons, not policy ones. DOE claims it can process all of \nthe plutonium by converting it into MOX, but, when pressed on the \nmatter they say there is no certainty in this treatment. If MOX fails \nand there is not a back-up, SRS will be left with large amounts of \nsurplus weapons-grade plutonium, but without a plan to treat it.\n  There is an analogous situation to this one track mind set that \npreviously occurred at SRS. To separate the sludge and liquid wastes \ncontained in the tank farms, DOE proposed In-Tank Precipitation, ITP. \nAfter putting more than a billion dollars into this separation process, \nproblems occurred. Excessive benzine was being produced as a by-product \nof the separation. As a result, the program was shut down until a new \nprocess could be found. The new process was selected last week--four \nyears after the old process failed. Why? Because there was not an \nalternative to this process. Four years and a billion dollars later, \nthe tanks are still overflowing with 60 percent of the Nation's high-\nlevel waste. This is exactly why I want to continue a dual-track \ndisposition program for this plutonium. It was part of the original \nagreement and I believe that any attempt to change the agreement should \nbe made in consultation with all the affected parties.\n  To date, the Secretary of Energy and the Governor of South Carolina, \nGovernor Hodges, have not spoken about the disposition activities, \nwhich is unfortunate. In fact, Governor Hodges has said he may take \nsteps to stop shipments of plutonium to SRS, which are scheduled to \nbegin in August. I hope the Secretary and the Governor can come to some \nagreement to ensure safe and timely disposition of this surplus \nplutonium.\n  I had an amendment, which would have prohibited the shipment of \nplutonium to SRS until March 1, 2002 or until a final agreement could \nbe reached on disposition activities, whichever comes first. Some say \nthat stopping these shipments would be devastating to our clean-up \nefforts at other sites. I say that walking away from our commitments of \nsafe and timely disposition of this material would be just as \ndevastating. All I want is for the Administration to commit to me, the \nCongress and to the State of South Carolina on plutonium disposition. I \ndo not want this plutonium to be shipped to SRS and then have the \nAdministration come back and say that MOX is not going to work and \nthey're going to study another way of disposing of the material. I fear \nthis is the road we are going down, especially in light of a recent \narticle in the New York Times saying the White House wants to \nrestructure or end programs aimed at disposing of tons of military \nplutonium.\n  I have spoken to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Energy and \nWater Appropriations Subcommittee and we have worked out an agreement \non my amendment. With this compromise, hopefully, DOE and the State of \nSouth Carolina will come together and reach an agreement to continue \nthese disposition programs at SRS, while ensuring they're done in a \ntimely and safe manner. If an agreement cannot be reached, you can rest \nassured this will not be the last time this issue is raised on the \nSenate floor.\n  I want to thank the distinguished chairman and ranking member for all \ntheir help on this amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/18/senate-section/article/S7871-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, JULY 19, 2001\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, in the coming days I suspect there will be \nappropriations bills and we will visit another issue we have visited \npreviously in the Senate and also in the House, and that is the price \nof prescription drugs, especially those imported into this country from \nother countries.\n  About a week ago, the Secretary of Health and Human Services decided \nthat legislation which I and several of my colleagues drafted and was \npassed last year and became law would not be administered. It is a law \ndealing with the reimportation of prescription drugs into this country.\n  The provision allows distributors and pharmacists to go to another \ncountry such as Canada, to access the same prescription drugs made in \nan FDA-approved plant and bring them to this country because it is much \nless expensive in Canada, and pass those savings along to consumers. \nThat is what our legislation did.\n  The Secretary of Health and Human Services under the previous \nadministration and now under this administration said they could not \ncertify, A, that it would be lowering costs for prescription drugs and, \nB, that it would be safe; therefore, they would not certify to that and \nwould not implement the law.\n  We are terribly disappointed by that. We think it was a mistake in \nthe past administration to have made that decision, and we think last \nweek it was a mistake for the Department of Health and Human Services \nto make that decision.\n  We will revisit this issue, and there will be another vote in the \nSenate dealing with it. We will have to do it in a different way, but \nthe principles are still the same.\n  The same pill put in the same bottle manufactured by the same \nprescription drug company by the same pharmaceutical manufacturer is \nsent to Grand Forks, ND, and to Winnipeg, Canada--the same drug made in \nthe same plant put in the same bottle made by the same company. The \ndifference? Price, and in many circumstances a very big difference.\n  One pays 10 times more for the drug tamoxifen, which is used to treat \nbreast cancer, in the United States than in Canada. I happen to have in \nmy desk--I have had several of them. These are two empty bottles. I ask \nunanimous consent to show these bottles in the Senate Chamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this drug called Zoloft is used to treat \ndepression, a very commonly used drug. The same pill made by the same \ncompany; one is marketed in Canada, one in the United States; $2.34 per \ntablet sold in the United States; $1.28 per tablet--same drug--sold in \nCanada.\n  Let me make it more immediate. Emerson, Canada; Pembina, ND--5 miles \napart. I took a group of senior\n\n[[Page S7872]]\n\ncitizens to Emerson, Canada. We left Pembina, ND, traveled across the \nborder, and went to a little one-room drugstore in Emerson, Canada. The \nprices for the prescription drugs, for a whole range of prescription \ndrugs that these senior citizens needed for heart disease, diabetes, \nand a whole series of ailments they had, in every circumstance, was \nmuch less expensive in Canada.\n\n  Why is that the case? It is not just the case in Canada; it is the \ncase in every other country in the world: Mexico, England, Italy, \nFrance, Sweden, the identical drug, produced in a plant approved by the \nFood and Drug Administration, in many cases produced in the United \nStates, is sold for a much higher price here than any other country in \nthe world.\n  Why is that the case? Because the pharmaceutical industry can do it. \nThey can impose whatever price they choose and they choose to do it in \nthis country. The result is the American consumer is charged multiples \nof what the same pill is sold for or the same drug is sold for to \nvirtually every other citizen in the world.\n  We said if this is truly a global economy, there is trade back and \nforth, it is a global economy that ought to benefit everyone, how about \nmaking this a global economy with respect to the purchase of \nprescription drugs? Why should you not be able, if you are a pharmacist \nin Grand Forks, ND, to go to Winnipeg to access a supply of \nprescription drugs at a fraction of the cost and bring it back and pass \nthe savings on to the customers? Why should you not be able to do it?\n  At the moment, a law prevents it. The United States has a law that \nsays the only entity that can bring a prescription drug into this \ncountry is the manufacturer itself. What a sweetheart deal that is.\n  So we said, provided this is a drug that is approved by the FDA, \nprovided for a chain of custody and safety of supply, our distributors \nand pharmacists ought to be able to go to another country to access the \nsame prescription drug, made in the same plant, put in the same bottle, \nand come back and pass those savings along to the American consumers.\n  So we passed a piece of legislation like that on the floor of the \nSenate with over 70 votes. It went to conference. After some laboring \nin conference, it became law. And then the Health and Human Services \nSecretary in both the last administration and this administration \nrefused to administer it because they said they cannot demonstrate \nthere will be, A, savings, and, B, they cannot assure the safety.\n  Let's take part A, savings, first. This is not rocket science. I am \nhappy to give the names of citizens from Fargo who can describe to the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services, either in the previous \nadministration or this administration, that there is savings. They have \ngone to the one-room drugstore in Emerson, Canada, and saved the money \non the prescription drugs. If you are going to pay half the price or a \nthird of the price or a tenth of the price for the identical \nprescription drug, how on Earth can a Cabinet Secretary not compute \nthat to be a savings? What nonsense is this? Of course there are \nsavings, and substantial savings.\n  Second, with respect to safety, we import a massive quantity of \nprescription drugs into this country from other countries with the \npharmaceutical manufacturers doing the importing. What is the \ndifference between that and having a licensed pharmacist or a licensed \ndistributor access from a licensed pharmacy in Canada the identical \nprescription drug made in the identical plant, approved by the FDA, to \nbring back into this country to sell to American consumers at a reduced \nprice? Why on Earth should someone have to go in the first place to a \nforeign country to find a reasonable price for a prescription drug that \nwas made in the United States? That doesn't make any sense to me. So we \npassed that legislation and now it has been sidetracked because the HHS \nSecretary has refused to implement it both last year and this year.\n\n  We will be back to revisit that and we will change the construct of \nit some. A group of Senators, including Senator Stabenow, Senator \nCollins, myself, Senator Jeffords, Senator Wellstone, and others, have \nworked very hard on this issue for a long period of time. There is no \njustification for the American consumer paying the highest prices for \nprescription drugs in this country. There is no justification for that.\n  I have held hearings across this country as chairman of the \nDemocratic Policy Committee in recent years on this subject. It doesn't \nmatter where you are--in downtown Manhattan; I have held hearings in \nDickinson, ND; hearings in Chicago; you hear the same story. The \nstories are from people 70 or 75 years of age. A woman testifies at a \nhearing, saying: I go into a grocery store and I must go to the back of \nthe store first where the pharmacy is because when I buy my \nprescription drugs and pay for them, then I will know how much money is \nleft for food, if any.\n  We hear that all the time. Or the doctor from Dickinson who did a \nmastectomy on a senior citizen and told her: Now, in order to reduce \nthe chance of recurrence of breast cancer, you have to take these \nprescription drugs I will prescribe. And she asked how much they would \ncost. He told her, and she said: There isn't any way I can take the \nprescription drugs; I have to take my chances.\n  We hear those stories in town after town. It doesn't matter what the \nState is.\n  The fact is, prescription drug prices are higher in this country for \nthe American consumer than they are anywhere else in the world. It is \nunfair. We ought to do something about it. My feeling is we ought to \npass a piece of legislation we will offer once again this year and \nexpect someone to implement that legislation as we enact it, that gives \npharmacists and distributors and ultimately the American consumers--not \njust senior citizens, the American consumers--the opportunity in a \nglobal economy to access prescription drugs that are reasonably priced. \nThey are reasonably priced in virtually every other country of the \nworld but are overpriced here, often in multiples of prices as \nelsewhere for the exact same drug that was manufactured in this \ncountry.\n  I wanted to offer a preview, again, of this issue to say we won last \nyear, passed legislation that became law, and HHS refused to implement \nit. But we are not giving up. This is the right thing to do for the \nright reasons. We say to the American people who struggle to pay the \nprices, there is a way to make the global economy work for you and \nallow, through your pharmacist or distributor, a personal amount of \nprescription drugs, to access those prescription drugs in Canada or \nelsewhere.\n  Ultimately, my goal is not to ask someone to go elsewhere to buy \ndrugs but to force the pharmaceutical industry to reprice the drugs in \nthis country so our consumers get a fair price as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/18/senate-section/article/S7872-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7872-S7873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2002\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to offer for the record the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring for S. 1172, the Legislative Branch \nAppropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2002.\n  The Senate bill provides $1.9 billion in discretionary budget \nauthority. Per tradition, that amount does not include funding for \nexclusive House items. The discretionary budget authority will result \nin new outlays in 2002 of $1.6 billion. When outlays from prior-year \nbudget authority are taken into account, discretionary outlays for the \nSenate bill total $2 billion in 2002. The Senate bill is well under its \nSection 302(b) allocation for budget authority and outlays. In \naddition, the committee once again has met its target without the use \nof any emergency designations.\n  I again commend Chairman Byrd and Senator Stevens for their \nbipartisan effort in moving this and other appropriations bills quickly \nto make up for the late start in this year's appropriations process.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the budget committee \nscoring of this bill be inserted in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S7873]]\n\n\n\n                    S. 1172.

Mr. President, I rise to express my deep concern about \nthe apparent lack of emphasis by the Department of Defense on the \ncounterdrug mission. This has been a year of continual discussion of \nincreased DOD funding for various military missions. However, all the \nindications I am hearing point to a decreased DOD interest in this \nmission, as well as decreased funding levels. I believe this would be a \npoor policy decision, and a poor indication of the Nation's priorities.\n  In May 2001 testimony, before the Senate Caucus on International \nNarcotics Control, on which I served as Chairman, the heads of the Drug \nEnforcement Administration, the U.S. Customs Service, and the U.S. \nCoast Guard all testified that DOD reductions would be detrimental to \ntheir agencies' counterdrug efforts. The Office of National Drug \nControl Policy summarized that, ``DOD's command and control system \nprovides the communications connectivity and information system \nbackbone * * * while the military services detection and monitoring \nassets provide a much need intelligence cueing capability.''\n  The Commandant of the Coast Guard testified at length about DOD \ncounterdrug support, stating ``[w]e would go downhill very quickly'' \nwithout DOD contributions. The Commandant also stated that 43 percent \nof Coast Guard seizures last year were from U.S. Navy vessels, using \nonboard Coast Guard law enforcement detachments. The Coast Guard \nconcluded that ``[s]hould there be any radical reduction of the assets \nprovided through the Department of Defense * * * it would peril the \npotential for all the other agencies to make their contributions as \nproductive * * * mainly because of the synergy that is generated by the \nenormous capability that the 800-pound gorilla brings to the table * * \n* They are very, very good at what they do. They are the best in the \nworld * * * and when they share those capabilities * * * in terms of \nintelligence fusion and command and control, we do much better than we \nwould ever otherwise have a chance to do.'' I understand that an \ninternal review of DOD's drug role contemplated severe reductions as a \nworking assumption. After years of decline in DOD's role in this area, \nI believe this sends the wrong signal and flies in the face of DOD's \nstatutory authority.\n  I have consistently supported an integrated national counterdrug \nstrategy. If we reduce the DOD role, we risk lessening the \neffectiveness of other agencies as well. We need to make these \ndecisions carefully, and with full Congressional involvement. I urge \nthe Department of Defense to keep in mind DOD's important role in, and \nnecessary contribution to, a serious national drug control strategy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/18/senate-section/article/S7873-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COST ESTIMATE ON S. 180\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, on July 12, the Committee on Foreign \nRelations reported S. 180, the Sudan Peace Act. At the time the bill \nwas reported, the cost estimate from the Congressional Budget Office \nwas not available.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the CBO estimate be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE, JULY 17, 2001\n\n                        S. 180: Sudan Peace Act\n\n [As ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on \n                             July 12, 2001]\n\n       S. 180 would condemn slavery and human rights abuses in \n     Sudan, authorize the Secretary of State to support the peace \n     process in Sudan, and require the President to devise a \n     contingency plan for delivering aid to Sudan. CBO estimates \n     that enacting S. 180 would have no significant budgetary \n     impact. The act would not affect direct spending or revenues; \n     therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures would not apply. S. 180 \n     contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as \n     defined by the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) and would \n     not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal \n     governments.\n       Each year the United States provides nearly $190 million in \n     assistance to the people of Sudan through various emergency \n     food-aid, disaster assistance, refugee assistance, and \n     development assistance programs. The provisions of S. 180 \n     would not substantially expand the Administration's authority \n     to provide such assistance. CBO estimates that spending on \n     those emergency and humanitarian programs would continue at \n     current levels.\n       The bill contains several reporting and contingency \n     planning requirements that would not affect the State \n     Department's or the U.S. Agency for international \n     Development's (USAID) workload significantly. Based on \n     information from the department and USAID, CBO estimates that \n     enacting S. 180 would increase the agency's spending by less \n     than $500,000 annually, assuming the availability of \n     appropriated funds.\n       On June 7, 2001, CBO prepared an estimate for a similar \n     bill, H.R. 2052, as ordered reported by the House Committee \n     on International Relations, on June 6, 2001. Like S. 180, \n     H.R. 2052 would not significantly affect discretionary \n     spending. That bill would require disclosure of business \n     activities in Sudan prior to an entity trading its securities \n     in any capital market in the United States. That provision \n     constitutes a private-sector mandate, as defined in UMRA, but \n     the cost of the mandate would fall below the annual threshold \n     established in UMRA ($113 million in 2001, adjusted annually \n     for inflation).\n       The CBO staff contact is Joseph C. Whitehill, who can be \n     reached at 226-2840.

Assuming the appropriation of the \n     authorized amounts, CBO estimates that implementing the bill \n     would cost $221 million over the 2002-2006 period. Because S. \n     1021 would not affect direct spending or receipts, pay-as-\n     you-go procedures would not apply.\n       The Tropical Forest Conservation Act authorizes the \n     Secretary of State to negotiate agreements with eligible \n     countries to create local funds administered by local boards \n     with the authority to make grants to preserve, maintain, and \n     restore tropical forests. The local funds receive a stream of \n     payments generated by modifying the terms of outstanding \n     development assistance or food-aid debt owed to the United \n     States. The debt modifications include authority to reduce \n     and to restructure debt, to swap the debt, or to sell the \n     debt back to an eligible country in ways that will generate \n     income for the local funds. The amounts authorized by S. 1021 \n     would be used to cover the cost, as defined by the Federal \n     Credit Reform Act, of modifying the debt.\n       S. 1021 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector \n     mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \n     (UMRA) and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or \n     tribal governments.\n\n\n                ESTIMATED COST TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\n\n       The estimated budgetary impact of S. 1021 is shown in the \n     following table.

Mr. President, earlier today, I had the opportunity to \nmeet with the wives of four Belarusian opposition leaders who have \neither disappeared, been imprisoned, or have died under mysterious \ncircumstances. Theirs is a compelling story which starkly illustrates \nthe human toll of Alexander Lukashenka's regime in which human rights, \ndemocracy and the rule of law are violated with impunity.\n  These courageous women--Ludmilla Karpenko, Irina Krasovska, Tatiana \nKlimova and Svetlana Zavadska--conveyed their concerns about their \nhusbands as well as about the continuing climate of fear in Belarus.\n  Earlier this month, I led a delegation to the OSCE Parliamentary \nAssembly Annual Session, where I met with Anatoly Lebedko, one of the \nleaders of the Belarusian democratic opposition.\n  Belarusian presidential elections are quickly coming up--on September \n9. Unfortunately, the Belarusian authorities have not yet made a \nserious commitment to abide by criteria set forth well over a year ago \nby the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, OSCE, of \nwhich Belarus is a member. These criteria include an end of the climate \nof fear, equal access to the state media for all candidates, respect \nfor freedom of assembly, as well as transparency and fairness in the \nregistration of candidates and functioning of electoral commissions.\n  The Helsinki Commission, which I chair, continues to receive \ntroubling reports concerning developments in Belarus. Indeed, the \nprospects for free and fair presidential elections this fall remain \ndim. The unbalanced composition of the regional electoral commissions \nis particularly disturbing given the apparent rejection by the \nauthorities of all candidates--over 800--proposed by Belarusian \ndemocratic parties and non-governmental organizations. The Belarusian \nauthorities need to guarantee the impartiality of the electoral \ncommissions by ensuring that democratic parties and non-governmental \norganizations, NGOs, are represented meaningfully and to correct other \nreported violations of the electoral code.\n  The State Department has urged the Belarusian authorities to mount a \ncredible investigation to account for missing former Minister of \nInternal Affairs Yury Zakharenka, 13th Supreme Soviet Deputy Chairman \nViktor Gonchar and his associate Anatoly Krasovsky, as well as Russian \nTelevision cameraman Dmitry Zavadsky. They have urged the immediate \nrelease of political prisoners and 13th Supreme Soviet members Andrei \nKlimov and Valery Shchukin. Such an investigation, as well as the \nrelease of political prisoners, will be an essential factor in reducing \nthe current climate of fear.\n  Finally, the Belarusian authorities need to work with the OSCE to \nfacilitate the work of international and domestic observers and to help \nensure that all candidates are able to organize freely, without \nharassment, and carry their campaigns to the people.\n  While it is not yet too late for the Belarusian authorities to take \nthe steps necessary to ensure an atmosphere conducive to elections that \nwill meet international democratic standards, time is of the essence. \nFree and fair presidential elections are an essential step if Belarus \nis to move ahead and end its self-imposed isolation. As President Bush \nhas remarked in connection with this week's observance of Captive \nNations Week, America must remain vigilant in our support of those \nliving under authoritarianism. The people of Belarus have that support \nas they seek to overcome the legacy of\n\n[[Page S7875]]\n\nthe past and build an independent nation based on democracy, human \nrights and the rule of law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/18/senate-section/article/S7875-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              NURSE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I want to commend Senator Rockefeller, \nChairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, VA, for his leadership \non the measure we are introducing today, the Nurse Recruitment and \nRetention Act of 2001.\n  I also want to commend Senator Rockefeller for conducting his first \nhearing as newly appointed Chairman of the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs on the looming nursing shortage. The Federal health sector, \nemploying approximately 45,000 nurses and the VA as the single largest \nemployer of nurses may be the hardest hit in the near future with an \nestimated 47 percent of its nursing workforce eligible for retirement \nin the year 2004. Current and anticipated nursing vacancies in Federal \nhealth care agencies are particularly alarming with the increased \nnursing care needs of an aging America. The Journal of the American \nMedical Association published a study last year which found the average \nage of the nursing workforce rose by 4.5 years between 1983 and 1998, \nmostly because fewer younger people are joining the profession.\n  It is imperative that the VA have the ability to recruit and retain \nnurses. Expert witnesses, like Nurses' Organization of Veterans \nAffairs, NOVA, President Sarah Meyers R.N., Ph.D. of Atlanta, GA, \ntestified at the June 14 hearing. These witnesses identified critical \nissues ranging from those impacting VA nurses' ability to continue to \nsafely care for veterans to nursing burn-out. Senator Rockefeller and I \nhave developed a comprehensive proposal to address both recruitment and \nretention of VA nurses.\n  The Nurse Recruitment and Retention Act of 2001 includes provisions \nfor the nurse scholarship program and education debt reduction. The \nbill's other needed measures to enhance retention of nurses are: \nSaturday premium pay for nurses and other identified health \nprofessionals, inclusion of unused sick leave in retirement computation \nfor nurses enrolled in the Federal Employees Retirement System, FERS, \nand full-time service credit in annuity computation for part-time \nservice prior to April 7, 1986. Also proposed are reports to Congress \non: (1) the use of mandatory overtime with recommendations for \nalternative staffing strategies and (2) the encouraged use of waivers \nof pay reduction for reemployed annuitants to fill needed nurse \npositions to enhance recruitment.\n  The Nurse Recruitment and Retention Act of 2001 is needed now in \norder for VA nurses to continue to care for this country's veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/18/senate-section/article/S7875-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

A 27-year old gay man was allegedly attacked and beaten \nwhen he was walking home from work by assailants who shouted anti-gay \nepithets. One of the attackers carved the letter ``F,'' presumably for \n``faggot,'' on the victim's shoulder.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator \nBond, in introducing the Small Business Investment Company, SBIC, \nAmendments Act of 2001. I am a strong supporter of this program, and am \nmystified and frustrated by efforts to eliminate funding for and \nrestrict the investment capacity of a program that does so much good \nfor the economy.\n  Last year, the Agency financed 4,600 venture capital deals, which \ninvested $5.6 billion in our fastest-growing small businesses. In spite \nof this impressive track record, the President's budget, and the House \nappropriators, have eliminated funding for the SBIC participating \nsecurities program and reduced the program level for the debenture \nprogram, which requires no appropriations. Why eliminate funding and \nrestrict activity for the SBIC programs when venture capital has all \nbut dried up? As I have said so many times, the programs at SBA are a \nbargain. For very little, taxpayers leverage their money to help \nthousands of small businesses every year and fuel the economy.\n  In the SBIC participating securities program last year, taxpayers \nspent $1.31 for every $100 leveraged for investment in our fastest \ngrowing companies--companies like Staples, Callaway Golf, Federal \nExpress, and Apple computers.\n  The main purpose of this Act is to adjust the fees charged to \nParticipating Security SBICs from one percent to 1.28 percent. The \nchange is necessary because the demand for the SBIC program is growing \nbeyond what is possible to fund solely through appropriations.\n  The National Association of Small Business Investment Companies, \nNASBIC, testified before both the Senate and House Committees on Small \nBusiness in favor of increasing the program level from $2 billion to \n$3.5 billion.\n  This legislation raises fees just enough to make up the difference \nbetween appropriations of $26.2 million, which is level funding, and \nthe $65.4 million that would be needed to provide a $3.5 billion \nprogram level. This approach is consistent with the Kerry/Bond \namendment to the Budget Resolution that was agreed to in the Senate by \nvoice vote in April, and retained in the final budget resolution.\n  The other changes strengthen the oversight and authority of SBA to \ntake action against bad actors and protect the integrity of the \nprogram.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/18/senate-section/article/S7875-5", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE LOSS OF KATHARINE GRAHAM\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

When Katharine Graham assumed the reigns at The \nWashington Post, two women served in the U.S. Senate, and none served \nas Governors of States. Today, in large part because of the path that \nshe and other women of her generation have blazed, there are more women \nserving as Members of Congress, as Governors, and as corporate \nexecutives than ever before.

Mr. President, in a couple of days, July 27th to \nbe exact, I will be going to Oshkosh, WI, to attend ``2001 Air \nVenture'' or the Oshkosh Fly-In for those of us who are involved in \ngeneral aviation. This will be the 23rd consecutive year that I have \ngone and it is an event that I look forward to each July.\n  As in years past, I will use the opportunity to catch up with old \nfriends, watch a couple of air shows, and look over hundreds of planes. \nIn addition, this year I will have the opportunity to meet a true \nAmerican hero, Colonel Harold Dean Weekley, retired, who will be \nhonored by the WAR BIRDS for his 30 years of service in the Army Air \nCorp and then the United States Air Force. During World War II, Colonel \nWeekley flew B17's where he had a great many close calls but in each \ninstance heroically finished his mission and on several occasions put \nhis own life on the line to protect his crew.\n  I know all my colleagues will agree with me that we owe the men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces a tremendous debt of gratitude because they \nare the ones on the front lines protecting our liberty. Colonel Weekley \nand his generation went above and beyond the call of duty when they put \ntheir lives and careers on hold to fight in a conflict a half a world \naway which many at the time did not believe should involve the United \nStates. Certainly in hindsight, American involvement in World War II \nwas not only the right thing to do but critical to our own security. It \nwas courageous individuals like Colonel Weekley that won the war. \nTherefore, I think it very fitting that the WAR BIRDS honor Colonel \nWeekley for his service and urge my colleagues to join me in thanking \nthe Colonel for the sacrifices he has made for us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/18/senate-section/article/S7876-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            HONORING CENTENNIAL OF BROWNE'S MARKET AND DELI\n\n Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, it is the 100th anniversary of a \nbusiness in Kansas City, MO that represents the entrepreneurial spirit \nthat has made America great. In 1901, two Irish immigrants, Edward and \nMary Flavin, in search of the American dream, designed and constructed \na building that would serve as a grocery store and meat market. The \ncouple wished to develop a successful business, catering to the needs \nof the residents in their neighborhood. The Flavins recognized the \nopportunity offered in the United States and took advantage of it, \nbuilding a strong business that still exists today.\n  The store continued to flourish, proving to be a profitable \ninvestment. But as the couple grew older, the Flavin Grocery store was \neventually passed on to their daughter, Margaret Flavin-Browne, and her \nhusband James Browne. They continued to operate and develop the store, \nchanging the name to J.R. Browne Grocery.\n  The grocery and building complex is now operated by Kerry Browne, \nfourth generation, and is known to Kansas Citians as Browne's Market & \nDeli. The building was designated a historic landmark in 1983, \nsymbolizing the certainty of the American dream and the opportunity \nwhich embodies it.\n  Today we celebrate the contributions of the Flavin-Browne family and \nthis building complex to the cultural, aesthetic and architectural \nheritage of Kansas City and Jackson County. The great State of Missouri \nis very proud to honor this significant landmark on the centennial of \nits founding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/18/senate-section/article/S7876-3", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LARRY HORNSBY\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to an \noutstanding representative of Alabama State, Larry G. Hornsby, CRNA, \nBSN. Mr. Hornsby will soon complete his year as national president of \nthe American Association of Nurse Anesthetists, AANA. I am very pleased \nthat one of Alabama's own was tapped as the 2000-2001 president of this \nprestigious national organization.\n  The AANA is the professional organization that represents more than \n28,000 practicing Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists, CRNAs. \nFounded in 1931, the AANA is the professional association representing \nCRNAs nationwide. As you may know, CRNAs administer more than 65 \npercent of the anesthetics given to patients each year in the United \nStates. CRNAs provide anesthesia for all types of surgical cases and \nare the sole anesthesia provider in \\2/3\\ of all rural hospitals, \naffording these medical facilities obstetrical, surgical and trauma \nstabilization capabilities. They work in every setting in which \nanesthesia is delivered including hospital surgical suites and \nobstetrical delivery rooms, ambulatory surgical centers, and the \noffices of dentists, podiatrists, and the plastic surgeons.\n  Larry received his nurse anesthesia education at the University of \nAlabama, Birmingham, where he also earned his bachelor's of science and \nnursing degrees. He is currently president of Anesthesia Professionals, \nInc., in Montgomery, AL, and Anesthesia Resources Management, Inc., in \nBirmingham, AL. Mr. Hornsby has held various leadership positions in \nthe AANA as regional director, vice president, and president-elect \nbefore becoming the national president of AANA in 2000. Also, Larry has \nserved terms as president and vice president for the Alabama \nAssociation of Nurse Anesthetists, and has chaired the Government \nRelations and the Educational District Six committees.\n  In addition to his service to the AANA, Mr. Hornsby sits on the \nAlabama Board of Nursing Advisory Council to the Nursing Practice/\nDiscipline Committee and was a representative to the State of Alabama \nCommission on Nursing. Adding to his professional accomplishments, Mr. \nHornsby has become a nationally recognized speaker on anesthesia-\nrelated topics over the years.\n  Even with his time commitments to the AANA and in his profession as a \nCRNA, Larry still manages time for his second passion, to fish for bass \nin the rivers of Alabama. As a bassmaster, Mr. Hornsby was president of \nthe Capital City Bassmasters in Montgomery, AL between 1987-1997.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing Mr. Larry G. \nHornsby, CRNA, BSN, for his notable career and outstanding \nachievements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/18/senate-section/article/S7876-4", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7876-S7877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IN MEMORY OF ALDERMAN LORRAINE L. DIXON\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to take this moment to \ncommemorate the life of Lorraine L. Dixon, Alderman from the 8th Ward \nin the City of Chicago.\n  Born on Father's Day, June 18, 1950, in the south side neighborhood \nof Bronzeville, she was the youngest of five children born to Edwin and \nEdra Godwin. Alderman Dixon grew up surrounded by friends and family \nincluding her four brothers Edward Jr., Eddie, Andrew and John. She was \nparticularly close to her brothers Eddie and John who would do anything \nto protect and please their little sister including taking the blame \nfor accidents. After attending Fuller Elementary School and South Shore \nHigh School, she graduated from Chicago State University in 1972 with a \nBachelor of\n\n[[Page S7877]]\n\nScience Degree in Secondary Education and a minor in English \nLiterature.\n  Alderman Dixon's career in the public service began soon thereafter. \nAfter graduation she became a member of the 8th Ward Young Democrats \nOrganization and became the vice president of the organization in 1977. \nIn that same year and again in 1978 she was elected Woman's Vice \nChairman of the Cook County Young Democrats.\n  From these positions she went on to work for current Cook County \nBoard President John Stroger during his 1980 congressional campaign, \nand thus began a strong alliance between these two public servants. \nPresident Stroger was a mentor to Alderman Dixon throughout her years \nof community involvement and work for her constituents. Her years of \nservice with President Stroger were representative of the intense \nloyalty she had for her colleagues in public service.\n  Alderman Dixon next held positions with the Chicago Department of \nHuman Services, the Chicago City Council Committee on Zoning and the \nCommittee on Energy. She also served as an aide to Alderman Keith \nCaldwell, who represented the 8th Ward at the time.\n  Lorraine Dixon's career as an alderman began when she was appointed \nby Mayor Richard M. Daley to complete the term of the late Alderman \nKeith Caldwell in June 1990. Her commitment to the position was \ndemonstrated by her scheduling of weekly Monday night meetings with \nconstituents of the 8th Ward. Alderman Dixon won her first aldermanic \nelection to represent the 8th Ward in 1991 and won overwhelming \nreelections in 1995 and 1999, demonstrating the support she inspired \nfrom her constituents. During her years as the standard bearer for the \n8th Ward, she served as Chairman of the Human Relations Committee and \nChairman of the Subcommittee on MBE/WBE and Affirmative Action Matters. \nIn 1993 she was elected President Pro Tempore of the Chicago City \nCouncil, becoming the first woman in the history of the Chicago City \nCouncil to be so honored. Then in August 1994 she was elected as the \nfirst woman to serve as Chairman of the Committee on the Budget and \nGovernment Operations. From this powerful committee she was able to \noversee taxpayer dollars used to support programs in the city that she \nloved. She served her ward, and the entire City of Chicago, with \npassion and grace.\n  Her dedication to the public was equaled only by her dedication to \nGod and her unwavering faith gave her courage as she battled breast \ncancer. Alderman Dixon's faith gave her the strength to overcome the \nanguish of being diagnosed with this grave disease and to continue her \nwork in the 8th Ward during the last days of her life. She worshiped at \nChrist Temple Cathedral and was active within the community of the 8th \nWard, where she is remembered by many for her willingness to come to \nthe aid of those in need. The constituents of the 8th Ward will not \nsoon forget her kindness.\n  Alderman Dixon was a member of many community boards and professional \norganizations and from these activities she was able to hear and \neffectively respond to the issues and needs of her constituents in the \n8th Ward. Her involvement touched many lives. Lorraine L. Dixon was a \ntrue leader and a true public servant. Her accomplishments in life \nleave a rich legacy to all who knew and respected her. She has left an \nextended family that includes her mother, Edra, her brothers Edward Jr. \nand Eddie, and countless nieces, nephews, cousins and close personal \nfriends. I was honored to call her a friend and I will miss her warm \nsmile, boundless energy and personal commitment to help those in \nneed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/18/senate-section/article/S7877-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF IRONWORKERS LOCAL NUMBER 25\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today marks the 100th anniversary of \nIronworkers Local Number 25--the largest ironworkers local in the \nNation. On Saturday, July 21, 2001, thousands of members of Local 25, \ntheir families and friends will gather in Detroit, MI to celebrate this \nsignificant milestone.\n  Founded on July 18, 1901, and chartered by the International \nAssociation of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental and Reinforcing \nIronworkers, Local 25 is responsible for the construction of much of \nmodern day Detroit. As we continue to celebrate the 300th anniversary \nof Detroit, many of the most notable landmarks that dot Detroit's \nskyline were constructed by members of Local 25. Cobo Hall, the \nBroadway Theater, the Renaissance Center and many of the cities' auto \nplants are just a few of the facilities constructed with the help of \nLocal 25.\n  Dubbed ``I-beam cowboys'' or ``cowboys of the sky,'' because of their \nindependent nature and the fact that they often work hundreds of feet \nabove ground on steel beams only a few inches wide, ironworkers are \nproud of the challenging and rewarding nature of their work. \nIronworkers are not to be confused with steelworkers who make steel. \nIronworkers take architectural plans and turn them into massive steel \nstructures. This work can send ironworkers all over the country--in \nfact, some members of Local 25 are working in our very backyard on the \nbiggest steel project underway in North America: the Washington, DC \nConvention Center.\n  The independent nature of ironworkers makes the success of Local 25 \neven more significant. While one should never doubt the strength of an \nindividual ironworker, the strength of ironworkers uniting together \naround a common goal is something to behold. While their collective \nwork is evident in beautiful structures across our Nation, Local 25 and \nthe International Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental and \nReinforcing Ironworkers have also worked together to guarantee fair \nwages, increased safety and needed benefits for their members.\n  Local 25's contributions to Detroit and our Nation can be seen in \nskylines, bridges and facilities across our country. At the same time, \nLocal 25 has worked to protect the rights of skilled workers enabling \nthem and their families to build better lives. I know that my Senate \ncolleagues join me in saluting Local 25 for all the enthusiasm they \nbring to their work everyday, and for all they have done to build our \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/18/senate-section/article/S7877-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7877-S7878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         REMEMBERING THREE GREAT MUSICIANS, THREE GREAT FRIENDS\n\n Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, three good and uniquely talented \nmen who spoke to the world through the universal language of music died \nrecently.\n  Chet Atkins, John Hartford, and Johnny Russell are gone. They are \ndead, but as long as their music is played they remain alive, and they \nwill be for a long, long time.\n  Chet Atkins was as responsible as any single person for turning \nNashville, Tennessee, into ``Music City, USA'' and was the originator \nof what came to be called ``The Nashville Sound.'' From his position as \nvice president in charge of country music for RCA and because of the \ngreat respect other artists had for him, he was able to influence the \ndirection the music went in and who the artists were who made it.\n  A laconic, modest man, Chet Atkins played down his own importance and \nreferred to himself simply as ``a picker.''\n  John Hartford is best known as the songwriter of ``Gentle On My \nMind,'' one of country music's most recorded songs and as the banjo \npicker in the Glenn Campbell and Smothers Brothers Shows. But he was \nmuch more than that. He was a versatile musician who recorded nearly 40 \nalbums of his own and appeared most recently on the soundtrack of ``O \nBrother, Where Art Thou?''\n  Johnny Russell was a country music singer and songwriter, but it was \none of his songs by The Beatles that was his most successful \ncompositions. It was called ``Act Naturally'' and was on the flip side \nof the Beatles' single ``Yesterday.'' His biggest hit as a singer was \n``Red Necks, White Socks and Blue Ribbon Beer.''\n  Much more could be said, and has been said, about these three \nremarkable talents who died so closely together. The New York Times \nwrote lengthy obituaries of both Atkins and Hartford.\n  I had the good fortune of knowing all three as personal friends. Chet \nonce showed me the toilet stall in a school in Harris County, Georgia, \nwhere as a young picker using it, he got the idea\n\n[[Page S7878]]\n\nfor an echo chamber. John Hartford and his talented son, Jamie, have \nstayed up late with me at the Georgia Governor's Mansion picking and \nsinging. And Johnny Russell always said my wife, Shirley, made the best \nbiscuits he had ever eaten. Coming from a 275-pound man with a \ntremendous appetite, she always considered that to be the supreme \ncompliment.\n  I will miss them. America will miss them. But their music still \nlives. Thank God, their music still lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/18/senate-section/article/S7878-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                COMCAST LEADERS OF TOMORROW SCHOLARSHIPS\n\n Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to take this \nopportunity to recognize the 144 New Jersey students who were recently \nselected to receive this year's Comcast Leaders of Tomorrow \nScholarship. The company awarded scholarships totaling $144,000 to \ncollege bound students from 96 high schools throughout New Jersey. Each \nscholar is receiving a grant in the amount of $1,000 to pursue further, \npost-secondary studies. To be considered for this scholarship, \nprospective candidates were required to demonstrate a positive \nattitude, outstanding academic achievement, exemplary leadership \nskills, and a serious commitment to community service. Therefore, it is \nwith great pride that I bring the outstanding accomplishments of these \nindividuals from the great State of New Jersey to your attention.\n  Education has always been one of my top priorities. In an era of \nglobalization and high technology, it is vital that each child has \naccess to a world-class education that emphasizes the importance of \nboth academics and social responsibility. The quality of our \neducational system will determine the future of our children, our \nnation, as well as the world.\n  At a time in history where environmental hazards and civil conflicts \nhave captured our interests, we must not abandon the ongoing battle to \nmodernize schools and reform education. It is truly gratifying to learn \nhow these individuals from New Jersey are challenging themselves to \nreach their highest potential. As these students quickly emerge as the \nfuture leaders in our society, I would ask that my colleagues join me \nin applauding this year's Comcast Leaders of Tomorrow Scholarship \nwinners for their remarkable accomplishments and their sincere desire \nto make a difference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/18/senate-section/article/S7878-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/18/senate-section/article/S7878-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/18/senate-section/article/S7878-3", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/18/senate-section/article/S7878-4", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:47 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks announced that the House has \npassed the following bill and joint resolution, in which it requests \nthe concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 807.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na tax credit for modifications to intercity buses required under the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, in the summer of 1990, President George \nBush signed the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, into law saying, \n``Let the shameful wall of exclusion finally come tumbling down.'' With \nintercity buses playing an important role in transporting millions of \npassengers throughout the country, we must ensure the means are \navailable for all Americans to access this transportation mode. That is \nwhy I am introducing, along with Senators Snowe, Hollings, and Schumer, \na bill to provide tax credits to intercity bus companies which purchase \ncoaches in compliance with the ADA. Our bill expands a current tax \ncredit to give bus owners a 50 percent tax credit of the cost of \npurchasing and installing hydraulic wheelchair lifts and other devices \nto improve accessibility.\n  As my colleagues know, I have long been a proponent of ensuring \naccessibility. In fact, while I was a member of the Georgia State \nSenate in the early 1970s, I sponsored a bill to make public facilities \naccessible to the disabled, and this bill became law. Georgia was a \nnational leader at that time, and I have been pleased to see the \nchanges throughout the country with regard to accessibility over the \npast three decades. However, there is more that can and should be done.\n  With their reliability, safety and low cost, over the road buses are \nthe preferred mode of transportation for millions of Americans, and \nwith the 2012 deadline to have all over the road buses be wheelchair \naccessible approaching, it is time for Congress to aid in meeting this \nmandate. The Transportation Research Board estimates that the annual \ncoast of upgrading and replacing the over the road bus fleet could \naverage $25-$27 million, not to mention the extra training and \nmaintenance costs. At the heart of the intercity bus industry are small \nbusinesses, on which this deadline would impose a significant toll. If \nthese small businesses can not meet this deadline, the rural \ncommunities that have no other means of transportation will suffer, or \nlarge portions of the upgrade costs will be\n\n[[Page S7881]]\n\npassed on to consumers in the form of higher fares, that is, unless \nCongress provides some assistance. Our legislation would do exactly \nthat.\n  I believe that bus service is destined to play an ever important role \nin transportation planning. In my home State of Georgia, many of the \nmetropolitan counties have been declared as out of attainment with the \nClean Air Act. As a result, Georgia is re-evaluating its transportation \npriorities, which includes moving people between intercity \ndestinations. Personally, I envision a Georgia, and a United States, \nwhere buses play an important role in transporting people to hub cities \nfor work or to transfer to another mode of transportation.\n  The cost to us if we lose bus services is incalculable. All segments \nof the community will obviously be affected and not for the better. \nHowever, by working together, legislators, the disabled, the elderly, \nand the bus industry can and must strengthen bus service for all \ncommunities and the millions of Americans who use the service of over \nthe road buses. I encourage my colleagues to join in support of this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 1194. A bill to impose certain limitations on the receipt of out-\nof-State municipal solid waste, to authorize State and local controls \nover the flow of municipal solid waste, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce a \nbill that would allow States to pass laws limiting the import of waste \nfrom other States. Addressing the interstate shipment of solid waste is \na top environmental priority for millions of Pennsylvanians and for me. \nAs you are aware, Congress came very close to enacting legislation to \naddress this issue in 1994, and the Senate passed interstate waste and \nflow control legislation in May, 1995 by an overwhelming 94-6 margin, \nonly to see it die in the House of Representatives. I look forward to \nmy new role as a member of the Senate Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works and am confident that with the strong leadership of my \ncolleagues Chairmen Chafee and Smith, we can get quick action on a \nstrong waste bill and put the necessary pressure on the other body to \nconclude this effort once and for all.\n  As you are aware, the Supreme Court has put us in the position of \nhaving to intervene in the issue of trash shipments. In recent years, \nthe Court has struck down State laws restricting the importation of \nsolid waste from other jurisdictions under the Interstate Commerce \nClause of the U.S. Constitution. The only solution is for Congress to \nenact legislation conferring such authority on the States, which would \nthen be Constitutional.\n  It is time that the largest trash exporting States bite the bullet \nand take substantial steps towards self-sufficiency for waste disposal. \nThe legislation passed by the Senate in the 103rd and 104th Congresses \nwould have provided much-needed relief to Pennsylvania, which is by far \nthe largest importer of out-of-State waste in the Nation. According to \nthe Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, 3.9 million \ntons of out-of-State municipal solid waste entered Pennsylvania in \n1993, rising to 4.3 million tons in 1994, 5.2 million in 1995, 6.3 \nmillion tons from out-of-State in 1996 and 1997, and a record 7.2 \nmillion tons in 1998, which are the most recent statistics available. \nMost of this trash came from New York and New Jersey, with New York \nresponsible for 44 percent and New Jersey responsible for 41 percent of \nthe municipal solid waste imported into Pennsylvania in 1998.\n  This is not a problem limited to one small corner of my State. \nMillions of tons of trash generated in other States find their final \nresting place in more than 50 landfills throughout Pennsylvania.\n  Now, more than ever, we need legislation which will go a long way \ntoward resolving the landfill problems facing Pennsylvania, Indiana, \nand similar waste importing States. I am particularly concerned by the \ndevelopments in New York, where the closure of the city's one remaining \nlandfill, Fresh Kills, has been announced this year. I am advised that \n13,200 tons per day of New York City trash were sent there and that \nPennsylvania is a likely destination of this trash.\n  I have met with county officials, environmental groups, and other \nPennsylvanians to discuss the solid waste issue specifically, and it \noften comes up in the public open house town meetings I conduct in all \nof Pennsylvania's 67 counties. I came away from those meetings \nimpressed by the deep concerns expressed by the residents of \ncommunities which host a landfill rapidly filling up with the refuse of \nmillions of New Yorkers and New Jerseyans whose States have failed to \nadequately manage the waste they generate.\n  Recognizing the recurrent problem of landfill capacity in \nPennsylvania, since 1989 I have pushed to resolve the interstate waste \ncrisis. I have introduced legislation with my late colleague, Senator \nJohn Heinz, and then with former Senator Dan Coats along with \ncosponsors from both sides of the aisle which would have authorized \nStates to restrict the disposal of out-of-State municipal waste in any \nlandfill or incinerator within its jurisdiction. I was pleased when \nmany of the concepts in our legislation were incorporated in the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee's reported bills in the 103rd \nand 104th Congresses, and I supported these measures during floor \nconsideration.\n\n  During the 103rd Congress, we encountered a new issue with respect to \nmunicipal solid waste, the issue of waste flow control authority. On \nMay 16, 1994, the Supreme Court held (6-3) in Carbone versus Clarkstown \nthat a flow control ordinance, which requires all solid waste to be \nprocessed at a designated waste management facility, violates the \nCommerce Clause of the United States Constitution. In striking down the \nClarkstown ordinance, the Court stated that the ordinance discriminated \nagainst interstate commerce by allowing only the favored operator to \nprocess waste that is within the town's limits. As a result of the \nCourt's decision, flow control ordinances in Pennsylvania and other \nStates are considered unconstitutional.\n  I have met with country commissioners who have made clear that this \nissue is vitally important to the local governments in Pennsylvania and \nmy office has, over the past years received numerous phone calls and \nletters from individual Pennsylvania counties and municipal solid waste \nauthorities that support waste flow control legislation. Since 1988, \nflow control has been the primary tool used by Pennsylvania counties to \nenforce solid waste plans and meet waste reduction and recycling goals \nor mandates. Many Pennsylvania jurisdictions have spent a considerable \namount of public funds on disposal facilities, including upgraded \nsanitary landfills, state-of-the-art resource recovery facilities, and \nco-composting facilities. In the absence of flow control authority, I \nam advised that many of these worthwhile projects could be jeopardized \nand that there has been a fiscal impact on some communities where there \nare debt service obligations.\n  In order to fix these problems, my legislation would provide a \npresumptive ban on all out-of-state municipal solid waste, including \nconstruction and demolition debris, unless a landfill obtains the \nagreement of the local government to allow for the importation of \nwaste. It would provide a freeze authority to allow a State to place a \nlimit on the amount of out-of-State waste received annually at each \nfacility. It would also provide a ratchet authority to allow a State to \ngradually reduce the amount of out-of-state municipal waste that may be \nreceived at facilities. These provisions will provide a concrete \nincentive for the largest exporting states to get a handle on their \nsolid waste management immediately. To address the problem of flow \ncontrol my bill would provide authority to allow local governments to \ndesignate where privately collected waste must be disposed. This would \nbe a narrow fix for only those localities that constructed facilities \nbefore the 1994 Supreme Court ruling and who relied on their ability to \nregulate the flow of garbage to pay for their municipal bonds.\n  This is an issue that affects numerous states, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this very important legislation.\n\n[[Page S7882]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Bond, Mr. Reid, \n        Mr. Schumer, Mr. Corzine, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 1195. A bill to amend the National Housing Act to clarify the \nauthority of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to \nterminate mortgagee origination approval for poorly performing \nmortgagees; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today Senator Mikulski, Senator Bond, \nand I, along with a number of our colleagues, are introducing, ``The \nCredit Watch Act of 2001,'' a bill that will authorize the Federal \nHousing Administration (FHA), to identify lenders who have excessively \nhigh early default and claim rates and consequently terminate their \norigination approval. This legislation is necessary to protect the FHA \nfund and take action against lenders who are contributing to the \ndeterioration of our neighborhoods.\n  A rash of FHA loan defaults have led to foreclosures and vacant \nproperties in cities around the country. In Baltimore, the effects of \nhigh foreclosure rates are acute. In some neighborhoods, there are many \nvacant foreclosed homes within just a few block of each other. This can \noften be the beginning of a neighborhood's decline. The high volume of \nvacant properties creates a perception that both the property and the \nneighborhood are not highly valued. In turn, these neighborhoods \ndeteriorate physically and often attract criminal activity.\n  It's like a rotten apple in a barrel. The rundown appearance of one \nhome spreads to the surrounding neighborhood. Stabilization and \nrevitalization efforts are undermined by the presence of abandoned \nhomes.\n  The Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, community \nactivists, and local law makers have come together to examine the loans \nbeing made in neighborhoods with high foreclosure rates.\n  In Baltimore and other cities, these groups that careless lenders are \noffering the FHA insured loans to families who cannot afford to pay \nthem back. This results in defaults and foreclosures. A foreclosed \nproperty can easily turn into an uninhabited home, which can either \nbegin or continue a cycle of decline.\n  In an effort to reduce the number of loans that end in foreclosure, \nthe FHA developed several new oversight methods, one of which is \n``Credit Watch.''\n  ``Credit Watch'' is an automated system that keeps track of the \nnumber of early foreclosures and claims of lenders in a particular \narea. This legislation authorizes the FHA to revoke the origination \napproval of lenders who have significantly higher rates of early \ndefaults and claims than other lenders in the same area. The FHA is \ncurrently targeting lenders with default rates of 300 percent of the \narea average.\n  Credit Watch has been an effective tool in tracking down bad lenders. \nSince HUD launched Credit Watch in May 1999, the Department has \nterminated the origination approval agreements of 77 lender branches. \nAn additional 177 lender branches were placed on Credit Watch, warning, \nstatus.\n  The legislation accounts for differing regional by ensuring that \nlenders are only compared to other making loans in the same community. \nIt also provides a manner by which terminated lenders may appeal the \ndecision of the FHA, if they believe that mitigating factors may \njustify higher default rates.\n  When lenders make loans with no regard for the consumer or the health \nof the community, the FHA must be able to take action in a timely \nmanner so that costly abuses of the FHA insurance fund can be stopped. \nQuick action not only protects the health of the Mutual Mortgage \nInsurance, MMI, fund, it protect neighborhoods from the detrimental \neffects of high vacancy rates and consumers from the pain of \nforeclosure and serious damage to their credit.\n  Lenders that offer loans to individuals who cannot afford them should \nnot be able to continue making those loans. It is a bad deal for \ntaxpayers. It is a bad deal for neighborhoods. It is a bad deal for the \nfamilies who take out the loan.\n  Credit Watch is an useful and efficient way for the FHA to prevent \nthese unfortunate foreclosures from happening. While we need to address \nthe larger issue of predatory lending in our communities. ``Credit \nWatch'' is an obvious and immediate solution to one part of this \nproblem.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 1196. A bill to amend the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Small Business \nInvestment Company Amendments Act of 2001. This bill is important for \none simple reason: once enacted it paves the way for more investment \ncapital to be available for more small businesses that are seeking to \ngrow and hire new employees.\n  In 1958, Congress created the SBIC program to assist small business \nowners in obtaining investment capital. Forty years later, small \nbusinesses continue to experience difficulty in obtaining investment \ncapital from banks and traditional investment sources. Although \ninvestment capital is readily available to large businesses from \ntraditional Wall Street investment firms, small businesses seeking \ninvestments in the range of $500,000--$3 million have to look \nelsewhere. SBICs are frequently the only sources of investment capital \nfor growing small businesses.\n  Often we are reminded that the SBIC program has helped some of our \nNations best known companies. It has provided a financial boost at \ncritical points in the early growth period for many companies that are \nfamiliar to all of us. For example, Federal Express received a needed \ninfusion of capital from two SBA-licensed SBICs at a critical juncture \nin its development stage. The SBIC program also helped other well-known \ncompanies, when they were not so well-known, such as Intel, Outback \nSteakhouse, America Online, and Callaway Golf.\n  What is not well known is the extraordinary help the SBIC program \nprovides to Main Street America small businesses. These are companies \nwe know from home towns all over the United States. Main Street \ncompanies provide both stability and growth in our local business \ncommunities. A good example of a Main Street company is Steelweld \nEquipment Company, founded in 1932, which designs and manufactures \nutility truck bodies in St. Clair, Missouri. The truck bodies are \nmounted on chassis made by Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors. \nSteelweld provides truck bodies for Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., \nTexas Utilities, Paragon Cable, GTE, and GE Capital Fleet.\n  Steelweld is a privately held, woman-owned corporation. The owner, \nElaine Hunter, went to work for Steelweld in 1966 as a billing clerk \nright out of high school. She rose through the ranks of the company and \nwas selected to serve on the board of directors. In December 1995, \nfollowing the death of Steelweld's founder and owner, Ms. Hunter \nreceived financing from a Missouri-based SBIC, Capital for Business, \nCFB, Venture Fund II, to help her complete the acquisition of \nSteelweld. CFB provided $500,000 in subordinated debt. Senior bank debt \nand seller debt were also used in the acquisition.\n  Since Ms. Hunter acquired Steelweld, its manufacturing process was \nredesigned to make the company run more efficiently. By 1997, \nSteelweld's profitability had doubled, with annual sales of $10 million \nand 115 employees. SBIC program success stories like Ms. Hunter's \nexperience at Steelweld occur regularly throughout the United States.\n\n  In 1991, the SBIC program was experiencing major losses, and the \nfuture of the program was in doubt. Consequently, in 1992 and 1996, the \nCommittee on Small Business worked closely with the Small Business \nAdministration to correct deficiencies in the law in order to ensure \nthe future of the program.\n  Today, the SBIC Program is expanding rapidly in an effort to meet the \ngrowing demands of small business owners for debt and equity investment \ncapital. And it is important to focus on the significant role that is \nplayed by the SBIC program in support of growing small businesses. When \nFortune Small Business compiled its list 100 fastest growing small \ncompanies in 2000, 6 of the top 12 businesses on the list received SBIC \nfinancing during their critical growth years.\n  The ``Small Business Investment Company Amendments Act of 2001''\n\n[[Page S7883]]\n\nwould permit the annual interest fee paid by Participating Securities \nSBICs to increase from 1.0 percent to no more than 1.28 percent. In \naddition, the bill would make three technical changes to the Small \nBusiness Investment Act of 1958, '58 Act, that are intended to make \nimprovements in the day-to-day operation of the SBIC program.\n  Projected demand for the Participating Securities SBIC program for FY \n2002 is $3.5 billion, a significant increase over the FY 2001 program \nlevel of $2.5 billion. It is imperative that Congress approve this \nrelatively small increase in the annual interest charge paid by the \nParticipating Securities SBICs before the end of the fiscal year. This \nfee increase, when combined with an appropriation of $26.2 million for \nFY 2002, the same amount Congress approved for FY 2001, will support a \nprogram level of $3.5 million.\n  The ``Small Business Investment Company Amendments Act of 2001'' \nwould also make some relatively technical changes the '58 Act that are \ndrafted to improve the operations of the SBIC program. Section 3 would \nremove the requirement that the SBA take out local advertisements when \nit seeks to determine if a conflict of interest exists involving an \nSBIC. This section has been recommended by the SBA, that has informed \nme that is has never received a response to a local advertisement and \nbelieves the requirement is unnecessary.\n  The bill would amend Title 12 and Title 18 of the United States Code \nto insure that false statements made to the SBA under the SBIC program \nwould have the same penalty as making false statements to an SBIC. This \nsection would make it clear that a false statement to SBA or to an SBIC \nfor the purpose of influencing their respective actions taken under the \n'58 Act would be a criminal violation. The courts could then assess \ncivil and criminal penalties for such violations.\n  Section 5 of the bill would amend Section 313 of the '58 Act to \npermit the SBA to remove or suspend key management officials of an SBIC \nwhen they have willfully and knowingly committed a substantial \nviolation of the '58 Act, any regulation issued by the SBA under the \nAct, a cease-and desist order that has become final, or committed or \nengaged in any act, omission or practice that constitutes a substantial \nbreach of a fiduciary duty of that person as a management official.\n  The amendment expands the definition of persons covered by Section \n313 to be ``management officials,'' which includes officers, directors, \ngeneral partners, managers, employees, agents of other participants in \nthe management or conduct of the SBIC. At the time Section 313 of the \n'58 Act was enacted in November 1966, an SBIC was organized as a \ncorporation. Since that time, SBIC has been organized as partnerships \nand Limited Liability Companies (LLCs), and this amendment would take \ninto account those organizations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that section-by-section \nsummary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n Small Business Investment Company Amendments Act of 2001--Section-by-\n                            Section Summary\n\n     Section 1. Short title\n       This Act will be called the ``Small Business Investment \n     Company Amendments Act of 2001.''\n     Section 2. Subsidy fees\n       This section amends the Small Business Investment Act of \n     1958 to permit the SBA to collect an annual interest fee from \n     SBICs in an amount not to exceed 1.28 percent of the \n     outstanding Participating Security and Debenture balance. In \n     no case will the SBA be permitted to charge an interest fee \n     that would reduce the credit subsidy rate to less than 0 \n     percent, when combined with other fees and congressional \n     appropriations. This section would take effect on October 1, \n     2001.\n     Section 3. Conflicts of interest\n       This change would remove the requirement that SBA run local \n     advertisements when it seeks to determine if a conflict of \n     interest is present. SBA has informed me that it has never \n     received a response to a local advertisement and believes the \n     requirement is unnecessary. SBA would continue to publish \n     these notices in the Federal Register. This section would not \n     prohibit the SBA from running local advertisements should it \n     believe it is necessary. It is supported by the SBA.\n     Section 4. Penalties for false statements\n       This section would amend Title 12 and Title 18 of the \n     United States Code to insure that false statements made to \n     SBA under the SBIC program would have the same penalty as \n     making false statements to an SBIC. The section would make it \n     clear that a false statement to SBA or to an SBIC for the \n     purpose of influencing their respective actions taken under \n     the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 would be a criminal \n     violation. The courts could then assess civil and criminal \n     penalties for such violations.\n     Section 5. Removal or suspension of management officials\n       This section would amend Section 313 the Small Business \n     Investment Act of 1958 to expand the list of persons who \n     could be removed or suspended by the SBA from the management \n     of an SBIC to include officers, directors, employees, agents, \n     or other participants of an SBIC. The persons subject to this \n     section are called ``Management Officials,'' a new term added \n     by this amendment. The amendment does not change the legal or \n     practical effect of the provisions of Section 313; however, \n     it has been drafted to make its provisions easier to follow.\n       Sections 3, 4, and 5 would take effect on enactment of the \n     Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/18/senate-section/article/S7883-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 136--TO AUTHORIZE TESTIMONY DOCUMENT PRODUCTION AND \nLEGAL REPRESENTATION IN STATE OF CONNECTICUT V.

Res. 122) relating to the transfer of \n     Slobodan Milosevic to the International Criminal Tribunal for \n     Yugoslavia, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution, which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations \nwith an amendment and an amendment to the preamble, as follows:\n  [Omit the parts in black brackets and insert the part printed in \nitalic.]\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I am not raising an objection to the \nSenate's approval of S. Res. 122 regarding the transfer of former \nYugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to the United Nations war crimes \ntribunal. It is clear that the primary purpose of the resolution is to \napplaud the fact that someone credibly alleged to have been a primary \ninstigator of heinous crimes be brought to justice. I applaud that \nsentiment. A number of similarly culpable persons from all the groups \nconcerned should have to answer for what has occurred during the past \nten years of war and strife in former Yugoslavia, and by all accounts \nMilosevic tops the list. His prosecution and, if he is found guilty \nafter a fair and open judicial process, his severe punishment are very \nmuch in order.\n  However, despite my decision not to object to this resolution, I \nthink it is important to point out that it contains several elements \nthat do not serve United States interests. And some of what is stated \nin it is not even accurate. Indeed, when an effort was made to pass \nthis resolution just prior to the July 4 recess, I asked that it be \nheld up until some of these could be addressed. It was then sent to \ncommittee and some of the problematic portions were in fact made worse. \nI wish to address some of these briefly.\n  First, just as a factual matter--and this is new language added in \ncommittee--it is inaccurate to state, as the Resolution does in the \nsecond ``Whereas'' clause, that ``the reformist Government of the \nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia freely exercised its sovereign right to \ncede jurisdiction to prosecute'' Milosevic. Actually, as far as anyone \nknows, the federal Yugoslav government headed by President Vojislav \nKostunica, an old-fashioned patriot, who, incidentally, was the \ntranslator of the U.S. Federalist Papers into Serbian, had nothing to \ndo with the Milosevic handover and in fact strongly opposed it, but was \ncircumvented by the Serbian republic government of Prime Minister Zoran \nDjindjic.\n  Second, one can hardly say that this was a ``free exercise of \nsovereignty.'' It is well known that the United States--mistakenly, in \nmy view, continuing the policies of the Clinton administration--had \nthreatened to boycott an international aid donors' conference unless \nMilosevic were surrendered. It should be understood that this is not \njust a matter of the U.S. withholding foreign aid. Rather, it amounts \nto continuing a policy of sanctions against an economically devastated \ncountry, and threatening to destabilize its weak democratic government, \nuntil it disregarded its own laws and complied with our demands. I \ncould call this many things, but ``free exercise of sovereignty'' is \nnot one of them. Moreover, Prime Minister Djindjic's compliance with \nthis pressure is hardly an example of ``courage,'' as the resolution \ncalls it, especially since it is well known the extent to which he has \nused the Milosevic handover to undermine his political rival, President \nKostunica.\n  Third, the same clause says the handover fosters ``the rule of law in \nYugoslavia.'' Again the opposite is true. When we have here, to give an \nAmerican analogy, would be as if an American State Governor violated \nprovisions of the U.S. constitution and policies set by the President \nin order to comply with the wishes of foreign countries. Instead of the \nrule of law, what has been fostered in Yugoslavia--and in its two \nremaining republics, Serbia and Montenegro--is the idea that laws, \nconstitutional government, and national sovereignty are meaningless, \nand that the only real authorities are the demands of foreign powers \nand the ``jurisdiction'' of global United Nations ``justice,'' \nrepresented by the tribunal to which Milosevic has been delivered. For \na country trying to emerge from decades of dictatorship, this is \nexactly the wrong message to send.\n  Fourth and finally, the same clause applauds the notion that the \nMilosevic handover has fostered ``international justice.'' That \nunfortunately is true, but I don't think it is reason for applause. As \nmany of my colleagues know, I am strongly and unalterably opposed to \nthe creation of a permanent International Criminal Court, of which the \nYugoslavia tribunal and its Rwanda counterpart are precursors. In \nsending Milosevic to the U.N. tribunal--on charges arising in his own \ncountry, specifically Kosovo, which is a province of Serbia--we are \nhelping to set a dangerous precedent for the ICC. We are saying to the \nworld that when the will of a United Nations ``court'' clashes with a \ncountry's laws and constitution, the latter go into the trash can. I \ncannot speak for my colleagues, but I would object to sending any \nAmerican citizen, no matter how evil the acts of which he was accused \nand however guilty he might be, to a United Nations court, especially \nif his alleged crimes took place in the United States. But we have \nsuccessfully demanded that Serbia and Yugoslavia do exactly that, and \nsimilar demands are being made against the Bosnian Serb republic and \nagainst Croatia. Serious crimes deserve serious punishment, but the \nquestion is not one of whether justice will be done but before what \ncourt and under whose authority.\n  At a time when U.S. troops are facing danger every day in Bosnia and \nKosovo--and may soon be sent, unwisely in my view, to Macedonia--the \npolicy consequences of setting in motion political events that may \ndestabilize non-democratic Yugoslavia and even help break up the \nfederation are counterproductive to U.S. interests and a threat to the \nsafety of our troops. For the reasons stated above, it has been a blow, \nnot a benefit, to democracy and constitutionalism. But worst of all, it \nhas lent credence to the principles supporting the ICC, which is a \ndirect threat to the sovereignty of our own constitutional republic and \nour democratic institutions. I welcome the day that Milosevic and \ncomparable persons face justice for their deeds. But he should have \nbeen allowed to face justice at home, in front of a court of his own \npeople, under his own laws and constitution, as President Kostunica \nwanted. The fact that we have ensured that this will not occur is not \nsomething for us to be proud of.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 86, S. Con. Res. 53.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 53) encouraging the \n     development of strategies to reduce hunger and poverty, and \n     to promote free market economies and democratic institutions, \n     in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate will \nunanimously pass Senate Concurrent Resolution 53: Africa Hunger to \nHarvest. I became a cosponsor of the resolution because I strongly \nbelieve that it is an important first step towards a renewed commitment \nto acting in concert with our African partners to significantly reduce \npoverty and hunger on the sub-continent in the next ten years. I saw to \nit that the resolution moved out of the Foreign Relations Committee \nexpeditiously because I wanted this legislation to pass with all due \nhaste. As you know, the G-8 members are preparing for their meeting in \nGenoa. I hope that President Bush will interpret the passage of Africa: \nHunger to Harvest as a signal of the Senate's support for development \nin Africa, and obtain commitments from other members of the G-8 to \ndevise comprehensive plans to increase the ability of African nations \nto feed their people.\n  Sub-Saharan Africa is a region with vast human and economic \npotential. There is a preponderance of natural resources, and a large \nenough population to provide the labor necessary to fuel industry. Yet \nAfrica, for the most part, has not prospered. It is the only region of \nthe world where hunger is increasing. In the past thirty years the \nnumber of hungry people in Africa has more than doubled to the point \nwhere one of every three Africans is chronically undernourished. There \nare many reasons why: war, natural disaster, corruption, and poor \ngovernance, to name a few. And while African themselves must take \nultimate responsibility for the success or failure of their countries, \nwe have the resources and opportunity to help improve the lives of \nmillions of people living there.\n  This resolution lays out a preliminary blueprint for doing so. It \ndirects the Agency for International Development to devise solid, \nconcrete five- and ten-year strategic plans to help Africans reverse \nthe current state of affairs for many living in the region, and asks \nthat the plans focus on such key areas as the establishment of \ndemocratic institutions, private sector and free market development, \naccess to education, improved health, and debt relief. The blueprint \nitself acknowledges that hunger and poverty must be attached along \nthese critical fronts to be eliminated.\n  A necessary component to achieving development is stability in the \nregion, but stability alone will not result in\n\n[[Page S7888]]\n\neconomic growth and improved living conditions. The establishment of \nthe rule of law and democratic institutions is also necessary. Africans \nmust have a say in the structure of their societies. They must be able \nto find a remedy through courts, they must have rules and regulations \nin place that provide an atmosphere of accountability. They must be \nable to put leaders in place that are dedicated and capable of imposing \nsound fiscal and economic policies. Leaders that work for the African \npeople. That is why an emphasis on building democratic institutions is \nan essential building block in any plan to help improve conditions in \nAfrican countries. Establishing institutions, accountability and rule \nof law helps establish favorable conditions for investment in the \nprivate sector.\n  Such investment is supported by increased opportunities for \neducation, especially for women and girls. Education must be an \nintegral part of this undertaking. While the illiteracy rate for women \nin the developing world stands at 32 percent, in Africa it is \napproaching 48 percent. In other words nearly half the women in Sub-\nSaharan Africa are completely illiterate, according to the World Bank. \nThis has very serious and costly implications. Women with more \neducation have fewer children, and start families later. Great \neducation increase a mother's knowledge about child healthcare, which \nincreases the chances that their offspring will grow to adulthood. \nHaving fewer children frees more resources to educate the children \nfamilies do have. The illiteracy rate for man and Africa is just as \nstartling: 31.1. percent compared to 18 percent in the rest of the \ndeveloping world. Economic growth is nearly impossible without \ninvestment in human capitol. We must work to change this state of \naffairs.\n  Health indicators are equally alarming. The infant mortality rate in \nSub-Saharan Africa is higher than in any other region of the world. For \nevery 1000 children born, 107 die in infancy. The under five mortality \nrate is 160 for every child born. This rate is significantly lower than \nit is in the rest of the developing world. Life expectancy for women \nfortunate enough to survive childhood is less than 48 years. Men who \nsurvive childhood live just shy of 46 years on average.\n  Seventy percent of those living with HIV/AIDS are in sub-Saharan \nAfrica. The UN Human Development Report states that Rwanda, Botswana, \nBurundi, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe life expectancy has dropped more \nthan seven years because of the disease. It knows no boundaries of \nincome or education or occupation. Teacher and soldiers as well as mine \nworkers and women who work in the house are equally at risk. While \nthere are a few notable exceptions, it seems as through African heads \nof state are just now beginning to realize that they cannot hold their \nheads in the sand with respect to this issue. We must help and \nencourage them to not only devise credible plans to combat the spread \nof the disease, but to speak out about it.\n  All of the above emphasizes the fact that development in the health \nsector must be addressed as part of the USAID's strategic plans on \nhumanitarian grounds and economic grounds. If we fail to do so, we risk \nlosing a huge portion of the population of African countries, both in \ninfancy due to childhood maladies and between the ages of 15 and 49, \nwhich is the bulk of the working population.\n  Finally, let me say that while we have made great strides on the \nissue of debt relief, we need to continue our efforts. Many countries \nwill continue to have unsustainable levels of debt despite the advances \nthat were made by the global ecumenical debt relief movement. Debt \nrelief has positive results. In Uganda, for example, debt relief has \nmeant that the government has increased spending on education so that \nchildren are able to attend primary school for free. New ways must be \nfound to provide resources for countries where the poorest of the poor \nresidents reside.\n  A reversal of fortune for the region is sorely needed. The rest of \nthe world is leaving Africa behind in terms of economic development. It \nwas the only region in the world to have experienced a shrinkage of \nGross Domestic Product during the past 25 years. This trend must not \ncontinue. We have a lot of work ahead of us. The United States will \nnever be able to help African nation feed their hungry populations \nwithout dedicating resources to implement plans which concentrate on \nthe areas aforementioned. My colleagues have heard me say over and over \nagain that we are not spending enough money on constructive foreign \nassistance programs such as the one set out in Senate Congressional \nResolution 53. I repeat that admonition and add this: We can direct \nUSAID to develop as many plans as we want to. At the end of the day, we \nmust be willing to finance such plans. I stand ready to do so. I \nencourage my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. REID.

One child out of seven dies before the age of \n     five, and one-half of these deaths are due to malnutrition.\n       (4) Sub-Saharan Africa is the region in the world most \n     affected by infectious disease, accounting for one-half of \n     the deaths worldwide from HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, \n     cholera, and several other diseases.\n       (5) Sub-Saharan Africa is home to 70 percent of adults, and \n     80 percent of children, living with the HIV virus, and 75 \n     percent of the people worldwide who have died of AIDS lived \n     in Africa.\n       (6) The HIV/AIDS pandemic has erased many of the \n     development gains of the past generation in sub-Saharan \n     Africa and now threatens to undermine economic and social \n     progress for the next generation, with life expectancy in \n     parts of sub-Saharan Africa having already decreased by 10-20 \n     years as a result of AIDS.\n       (7) Despite these immense challenges, the number of sub-\n     Saharan African countries that are moving toward open \n     economies and more accountable governments has increased, and \n     these countries are beginning to achieve local solutions to \n     their common problems.\n       (8) To make lasting improvements in the lives of their \n     people, sub-Saharan Africa governments need support as they \n     act to solve conflicts, make critical investments in human \n     capacity and infrastructure, combat corruption, reform their \n     economies, stimulate trade and equitable economic growth, and \n     build democracy.\n       (9) Despite sub-Saharan Africa's enormous development \n     challenges, United States companies hold approximately \n     $12,800,000,000 in investments in sub-Saharan Africa, greater \n     than United States investments in either the Middle East or \n     Eastern Europe, and total United States trade with sub-\n     Saharan Africa currently exceeds that with all of the \n     independent states of the former Soviet Union, including the \n     Russian Federation. This economic relationship could be put \n     at risk unless additional public and private resources are \n     provided to combat poverty and promote equitable economic \n     growth in sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (10) Bread for the World Institute calculates that the goal \n     of reducing world hunger by one-half by 2015 is achievable \n     through an increase of $4,000,000,000 in annual funding from \n     all donors for poverty-focused development. If the United \n     States were to shoulder one-fourth of this aid burden--\n     approximately $1,000,000,000 a year--the cost to each United \n     States citizen would be one penny per day.\n       (11) Failure to effectively address sub-Saharan Africa's \n     development needs could result in greater conflict and \n     increased poverty, heightening the prospect of humanitarian \n     intervention and potentially threatening a wide range of \n     United States interests in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the years 2002 through 2012 should be declared ``A \n     Decade of Support for Sub-Saharan Africa'';\n       (2) not later than 90 days after the date of adoption of \n     this concurrent resolution, the President should submit a \n     report to Congress setting forth a five-year strategy, and a \n     ten-\n\n[[Page S7889]]\n\n     year strategy, to achieve a reversal of current levels of \n     hunger and poverty in sub-Saharan Africa, including a \n     commitment to contribute an appropriate United States share \n     of increased bilateral and multilateral poverty-focused \n     resources for sub-Saharan Africa, with an emphasis on--\n       (A) health, including efforts to prevent, treat, and \n     control HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and other diseases \n     that contribute to malnutrition and hunger, and to promote \n     maternal health and child survival;\n       (B) education, with an emphasis on equal access to learning \n     for girls and women;\n       (C) agriculture, including strengthening subsistence \n     agriculture as well as the ability to compete in global \n     agricultural markets, and investment in infrastructure and \n     rural development;\n       (D) private sector and free market development, to bring \n     sub-Saharan Africa into the global ecomony, enable people to \n     purchase food, and make health and education investments \n     sustainable;\n       (E) democratic institutions and the rule of law, including \n     strengthening civil society and independent judiciaries;\n       (F) micro-finance development; and\n       (G) debt relief that provides incentives for sub-Saharan \n     African countries to invest in poverty-focused development, \n     and to expand democratic participation, free markets, trade, \n     and investment;\n       (3) the President should work with the heads of other donor \n     countries and sub-Saharan African countries, and with United \n     States and sub-Saharan African private and voluntary \n     organizations and other civic organizations, including faith-\n     based organizations, to implement the strategies described in \n     paragraph (2);\n       (4) Congress should undertake a multi-year commitment to \n     provide the resources to implement those strategies; and\n       (5) 120 days after the date of adoption of this concurrent \n     resolution, and every year thereafter, the Administrator of \n     the United States Agency for International Development, in \n     consultation with the heads of other appropriate Federal \n     departments and agencies, should submit to Congress a report \n     on the implementation of those strategies, including the \n     action taken under paragraph (3), describing--\n       (A) the results of the implementation of those strategies \n     as of the date of the report, including the progress made and \n     any setbacks suffered;\n       (B) impediments to, and opportunities for, future progress;\n       (C) proposed changes to those strategies, if any; and\n       (D) the role and extent of cooperation of the governments \n     of sub-Saharan countries and other donors, both public and \n     private, in combating poverty and promoting equitable \n     economic development.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/18/senate-section/article/S7889-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--H.J.

LaFontaine, Jr.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for \ntestimony and document production in a criminal case in the Superior \nCourt in Hartford, CT. A resident of Connecticut has been charged with \ninciting injury to a person, second-degree harassment, and threatening. \nThe criminal charges arise out of threatening and abusive telephone \nmessages left on an answering machine at Senator Lieberman's \nConnecticut District office, located in Hartford, CT, threatening, \namong other things, to inflict bodily injury through an attack on a \nFederal building.\n  This resolution would authorize an employee on Senator Lieberman's \nstaff who heard the threatening messages to testify and to produce \nevidence of the calls, with representation by the Senate Legal Counsel.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity just to say \na few words. I thank Senator Reid for his leadership and effort to move \nthe legislation that has been moving forward pretty well so far. I \nthink this side has certainly been cooperative. We have not had \nanything like the 100-plus amendments that we had when this side was \ntrying to move bills last year. We have been very cooperative.\n  There is a real concern that this administration, as it gets itself \ninto office facing all kinds of challenges, needs to get its people on \nboard as soon as possible. We are now entering the seventh month of \nPresident Bush's administration. Maybe 15 percent of his term has been \nused up, and we now have 150 nominees who have not been confirmed. \nMaybe there will be some objections to some and they will need some \nscrutiny, but most of them are nominations which, if called up and are \nvoted upon on the floor, are going to pass virtually unanimously.\n  These are good men and women who have left their jobs and careers. \nThey are committed to public service for a period of time. We need to \ngive them an up-or-down vote.\n  I think we need to set a higher standard than we have done before. I \ndo not object to a Senator who has a concern over a nominee to raise \nthat concern, to highlight the problem, to ask questions, even delay a \nnominee. But when we have a nominee nobody objects to--and this is true \nof the overwhelming majority of the 150 or so--we believe they ought to \nbe moving forward promptly. That is why we are at loggerheads a little \nbit here. There are some strong feelings that we need a good, firm \ncommitment we will move these nominations before we leave in August for \na month away because then we will come back with all kinds of things \nand it will be September with appropriations bills and there will be\n\n[[Page S7890]]\n\nother issues and it will be harder than ever to get up nominations. \nEven more of them will be in the system by then, having been submitted \nby the President. It is going to be a big problem if we do not move \npromptly.\n  I think this is a reasonable request. I know Senator Reid, Senator \nDaschle and others, have indicated they will make some progress, but we \nare not confident we have made a strong enough determination and \ncommitment at this point in time to ensure those nominees move forward. \nI hope maybe this cloture motion can be vitiated and we will be able to \nreach accord and move forward, but I just want to say for the record \nthat the matter is very serious. We have probably taken too long to \nmove nominations as we go forward.\n  I think the ones that have little or no objection certainly ought to \nbe moved forward.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend from Alabama is right. There is no \nquestion that the process is very cumbersome. I hope in the future that \nwe can maintain our record. We have a clear conscious. We cleared 54 \nlast week. It was really the first week that we were in power because \ncommittees were just organized. With the leadership having changed, it \nslowed things down a little bit. But there wasn't much the Republicans \ncould have done while they controlled the Senate because of the funnel \nthat just doesn't allow these nominations to get here.\n  We have worked diligently today. Our staff worked. I told one of \nSenator Lott's staff people just a minute ago that I spoke to Senator \nBiden earlier today, and we had told him that prior to the August \nrecess we would clear all of those that already had hearings. We \nreceived a call back from Senator Biden's staff, and he told us that he \nspoke to Senator Biden and Senator Biden hopes to clear as many as 20 \nfrom the Foreign Relations Committee prior to the recess.\n  We recognize it is an embarrassment to this country--as powerful as \nthe United States is--not having an Ambassador in a country. That is \nsomething that is good for the country. It is not because of Democrats \nor Republicans.\n  The Senator from Alabama is absolutely right. For the vast majority \nof these people, there is no problem at all. We just have to get them \nthrough the hearing process, which is sometimes cumbersome.\n  If there is somebody who has some objections, we can arrange \nsomething just like Graham. We are going to debate the Graham \nnomination when we finish the energy and water bill. There is time. I \nwanted to finish it tonight.\n  I wish right now that we could be doing this and Graham could look \nforward tomorrow morning to a very early vote and we could complete \nthat matter. It is a contentious issue, but it is something we need to \ndo. We can do that on others.\n  I have worked diligently. A lot of times people criticize me on my \nside because I work too closely with Senator Lott on moving some of \nthese bills. Last year, prior to the August recess, we did eight \nappropriations bills. Republicans controlled the Senate. But we moved \neight appropriations bills. That was hard, hard work. But we did it. \nThe Senator is right. A lot of times there were lots of amendments on \nthose bills. But we worked our way through them.\n  I hope the Senator, who has a fine legal mind, is very concerned \nabout what is happening. He wants his President to have all the help he \nneeds. I hope the President gets all of his subcabinet people approved \nreal soon.\n  I listened to an account on public radio just a short time ago. It is \nabsolutely correct. It said what I already know--that President Bush \nwill be lucky to have his subcabinet people approved by February. That \nis not because of partisan politics. It is because a system has \ndeveloped in this country where we have vetting by the White House, by \nthe Justice Department, by the agency in which the person is going to \nserve. It is too cumbersome and too burdensome.\n  Why do we need to have all this process for Dan Coats? Dan Coats \nserved in the Senate up until a couple of years ago. He will be \nconfirmed easily. Everybody likes him. It seems to me that the \nadministration--Democratic and Republican administrations--should just \nhave a little more courage, and say: We don't need Dan Coats to be \nvetted--that is just how I feel about it--by anyone. Let's just bring \nhim down here, and he will stand or fall on how we feel about Dan \nCoats.\n  I hope in the morning that the Senator from Alabama and his \ncolleagues who are concerned about this will look at our good-faith \nefforts. We are trying to do everything that we can. As I said, we were \nwilling to clear 9 or 10 people tonight. For reasons that the Senator \nunderstands, we decided not to do that.\n  We haven't gotten much credit for the 54 we confirmed. We want to \nmake sure that you feel good about what we are trying to do. There are \na number of people as we proceed who may have some problems. We will \nidentify those and set a special time for having some debate on the \nfloor so we can have an up-or-down vote on them. We are not going to \nhold them up just to be holding them up.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his comments. We \nhave made some progress. There were some objections last week and some \nconcerns about not moving. The Democratic leadership moved 50 or more. \nBut we still have 150, and we are coming up on the August recess. That \nis all we are saying.\n  Mr. REID. One-hundred and sixty.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If we don't get moving now, we are not going to be able \nto finish by August with many confirmed. That will get us even further \nbehind. We are going to have a flood of nominations that haven't even \ncome in yet. I am frustrated, as a former U.S. attorney, that no U.S. \nattorney nominees have even been made. I guess the President deserves \nblame for that. Maybe the FBI is working the other nominees and can't \nget the backgrounds on them, or whatever. The Senator from Nevada said \nperhaps they are terrified that they will nominate somebody who will \nhave a black mark on their record and the administration will be \nembarrassed.\n  But I think all we are asking is let's give an intensity of interest \nto it. Let's give it our best shot before we recess in August to make \nsure that the backgrounds have been done on every one of these nominees \nso they are ready to go forward. The committees have to have some \nhearings. I know they are busy. We have been having hearings in the \nJudiciary on the FBI and DEA nominees, but we haven't had but three \njudges come out of Judiciary in 7 months, and none have been confirmed. \nWe have to speed up a little bit. That is what we are asking.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/18/senate-section/article/S7890-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
