Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of the Torricelli amendment No. \n122.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, the Senate now turns its attention to \nwhat is the other half of the campaign finance problem. It is, after \nall, not simply what is raised but why money is raised and where it is \ngoing.\n  This Senate, for 5 years, has had to overcome four filibusters to get \nus to this moment in considering campaign finance reform. We have voted \non 113 occasions to reform the campaign finance laws. We have \nconsidered 300\n\n[[Page S2604]]\n\npieces of legislation, heard 3,000 speeches, and filled 6,000 pages of \nthe Congressional Record. But none of this will mean anything, this \nlegislation will accomplish no more than leading to a less informed \npublic with less political dialog, if we do not complement the \nreduction in fundraising with more availability of information by \nreducing the cost.\n  The McCain-Feingold legislation, as written, will not abate the \nexpense of running for political office. It could, if not amended, \nsimply lead to an American public, as Senator McConnell has said many \ntimes, that is less informed with less political speech. I know no one \nin the country who believes that is the kind of reform we genuinely \nseek.\n  The Alliance for Better Campaigns recently stated:\n\n       Reform must do more than limit the supply of political \n     money. It must also restrain the demand for political money.\n\n  There is a perception in the media and in the public that the entire \nproblem of campaign financing is the amount of money. That is a \nproblem, but it is not the only problem. Members of this institution \nknow that an equal burden that must be addressed is the amount of time \nSenators and Members of the House of Representatives are taken away \nfrom their legislative responsibilities, not meeting with ordinary \ncitizens, to cater to the wealthy to gain access to this money.\n  On the chart on my left, I have taken a State at random, New Jersey, \nand given an indication of what it takes in time to run what all future \nSenate campaigns in New Jersey probably will cost--a minimum of $15 \nmillion. This would require, under current campaign finance laws, \nraising $20,833 every day 7 days a week for 2 years, or 150 fundraising \nevents, each raising $100,000, or 1,500 events at $10,000 per event, \n1,500 fundraisers at $10,000.\n  We can make it more difficult to raise the money. We can eliminate \nsoft money. The question remains: Are we simply adding to the burden of \nhow much time candidates must spend doing that? If we are eliminating \ncategories of money, making it more difficult to get the $15 million, \nall we could be doing is adding to that time which candidates must \nspend finding it. That will not be an achievement. That is why today we \nare dealing with the other half of the equation--not what is raised but \nhow much is spent.\n  The 2000 elections provide an illustration. Common Cause estimates \nthat the 2000 elections cost $3 billion. This is a 50-percent increase \nover 1996, begging the question, At this rate of increase, where is the \nNation going?\n  Obviously, to anyone in the system, by far the greatest component of \nthis campaign spending is the cost of television advertising. Indeed, \none-third of the $3 billion raised and spent in the 2000 elections went \nto pay for political advertisements on television. My predecessor, \nSenator Bradley of New Jersey, probably said it best a few years ago:\n\n       Today's political campaigns function as collection agencies \n     for broadcasters. You simply transfer money from contributors \n     to television stations.\n\n  During the 2000 elections, the broadcast networks enjoyed record \nprofits. The placing of political advertisements on the networks is not \na public service. They do not do this under duress. It is a major form \nof network profits. It is estimated to be at least $770 million and, \nindeed, figures could be as high as $1 billion that was spent by \ncandidates on political advertisements--a 76-percent increase over \n1996.\n  The chart on my left illustrates the rapid increase. President \nmidterm spending, in 1982, adjusted for inflation, was $200 million; in \nthe year 2000, now reaching $800 million. It is an exponential increase \nthat is unsustainable. The Alliance for Better Campaigns recently \nissued its report, ``Gouging Democracy, How the TV Industry Profiteered \non Campaign 2000.''\n  This report illustrates how stations across the country took \nadvantage of candidates by increasing their pricing for advertising \njust when they knew that campaigns needed the time the most.\n  In Philadelphia and New York City, the two media networks which serve \nmy State of New Jersey, the cost of some political ads increased almost \n50 percent between Labor Day and election day--television stations \nrecognizing that unlike an automobile manufacturer or a soap \nmanufacturer that can advertise at any time of the year, a candidate \nhas no choice but to communicate with those voters between Labor Day \nand election day. They have a captive market and they take full and \nunconscionable advantage.\n  The letter on my left is a perfect example. This is a television \nstation which has had an ad placed by a Federal candidate. Under the \nlaw, they are required to sell this ad at the lowest unit rate. But as \nis typical of the television networks, they wrote a letter back to the \ncandidate saying:\n\n       Activity is a lot heavier than the station anticipated, and \n     your schedules are already getting bumped.\n\n  My colleagues, this is the heart of the problem. The candidate placed \nthe ad at $6,300, as required by law. But the television station let \nthe candidate know: You may have bought this ad in accord with Federal \nlaw at $6,300, but you will never see it on television because we will \nbump it. You will not get it for when you bought it. It will be shown \nin the middle of the night when no one will see it.\n  So they politely extort another $8,000 in order to guarantee the time \nslot that has been provided. An ad required to be sold at $6,000 by law \nis now in excess of $14,000. This is the heart of the problem. And it \nis typical.\n  In our surveys across the country, as in Philadelphia and New York, \nthese rates were going up by 50 percent. We have seen in others, \ntypically, 30-percent increases in these rates.\n  Now, by law, Members of the Senate undoubtedly think this was \naddressed years ago, and they would be right in having that belief. \nNothing I am now reviewing should be allowed by law. But there is a \nloophole, and the loophole, as I have illustrated, is that they will \nsell you the time. They will just never guarantee it will ever be seen \non television. That, as I think anybody could assess, is not much of an \nadvertising campaign.\n  The law is actually being complied with as an exception. The rule is \nthe violation. The chart on my left illustrates this point \nconclusively. The heavy red lines are advertisements that are placed \nabove the lowest unit rate--remembering that the law requires that \nadvertisements be sold to political candidates, as required for \ncommunication in Federal elections, at the lowest unit rate.\n\n  WCCO in Minneapolis met its public responsibility by selling 4 \npercent of all of its advertisements at the lowest unit rate. And 95 \npercent of all the ads placed were higher than lowest rates. They are \npaying commercial rates.\n  In New York city, an advertising market with which I am familiar, \nWNBC--not some unaffiliated station, but one owned by the National \nBroadcasting Company itself--15 percent of their ads were in accordance \nwith the law at the lowest unit rate; for 78 percent they were charging \ncommercial rates to Federal candidates for public office. There are \nstations that are better. The chart illustrates that virtually in every \nmarket in the country, large States and small, rural and urban, the \nresponsibilities are not being met.\n  In Los Angeles, KABC--once again, an affiliate owned by the network \nitself--34 percent of all advertisements are being sold at commercial \nrates. In Columbus, OH, it is 90 percent. At KYW, one of the most \npopular stations in Philadelphia, it is 91 percent. At WXYZ in Detroit, \nit is 88 percent sold at commercial rates.\n  My colleagues, the law as you intended it, to require lowest unit \nrate sales of advertising, has collapsed. It is not happening. \nBroadcasters are auctioning advertising time to Federal candidates in \ncompetition with the industries of America. Any candidate is facing the \nprospect of a bidding war with General Motors or Ford or IBM when they \ngo to place political advertising. The law is simply not functioning.\n  Similar patterns, as I have demonstrated, are all over the country. \nTo quote the Alliance for Better Campaigns, ``while this law remains on \nthe books, its original intent is no longer served.''\n  The other part of this equation is not simply that there is price \ngouging of candidates by taking advantage of a loophole in the lowest \nunit rate, but, almost incredibly and simultaneously, the broadcasters \nare violating another responsibility. One responsibility is the lowest \nunit rate to allow advertising,\n\n[[Page S2605]]\n\nnot to increase the cost of campaigns and increase fundraising \nresponsibilities and burdens; the other is to provide news coverage. \nThese, my colleagues, after all, are the public airwaves, licensed by \nthe Federal Government for the interest of the American people to \npromote their debates. The Federal airwaves are not to be used entirely \nfor sitcoms and cartoons, or to sell soap or automobiles. There is a \npublic responsibility.\n  I am going to show the difference between what is going on in \nadvertising and news coverage. As you can see on this chart, those ads \nsold at the unit rate are flat. The red line shows that almost all \nadvertising is going on to the non-unit rate or commercial rate of \nadvertising.\n  We will move on to the news coverage. Now, remembering how the \nadvertising was increasing at commercial costs, exponentially the chart \nwas rising to the top. Consider this, remembering the two \nresponsibilities: selling at lowest unit rate and providing news \ncoverage in the public interest.\n  In Philadelphia, during the New Jersey Senate primary--remembering \nthere was no incumbent--we were choosing a U.S. Senator for New Jersey, \nduring a Presidential election, the final 2 weeks of the campaign. In \nPhiladelphia, this is the amount of news coverage in the final 14 days \nof the election: WPVI in Philadelphia, an average of 19 seconds per \nevening; WVAU, in the public interest, on a federally licensed station, \ndedicated an average of 1 second per night to informing their viewers \non the Senate campaign in its closing days. In New York, the situation \nwas not very much different. WNBC--once again, a network-owned-and-\noperated affiliate, not some arm's length operating station, but NBC's \nown station in New York, in the final 2 weeks of the campaign--gave 23 \nseconds to covering the primary. At WCBS in New York, an average of 10 \nseconds was given to covering this.\n  As Robert McChesney wrote in Rich Media, Poor Democracy:\n\n       Broadcasters have little incentive to cover candidates, \n     because it is in their interest to force them to publicize \n     their campaigns.\n\n  Exactly. Why would anyone provide free coverage in the public \ninterest in hard news when, alternatively, candidates must pay millions \nof dollars to the stations themselves to get their message across? \nThere is a disincentive to provide news because people have to pay for \nit.\n  The Brennan Center reports that, indeed, in the 30 days preceding the \nNovember elections, the national broadcasters averaged about 1 minute \nper night--1 minute--in substantive campaign coverage.\n  Rather than a discussion of substantive issues, the broadcast \nnetworks covered the campaign 2000 primarily as a horse race. Only one \nin four network news stations aired stories that were, indeed, issue \noriented.\n  The chart on my left makes this comparison: what is happening in \nadvertising in which candidates are now paying nearly a billion \ndollars, and what is happening in news coverage as required by Federal \nlicense. These are the top four rated TV stations in Philadelphia and \nNew York.\n  Overall, a viewer in the State of New Jersey is 10 times more likely \nto see a paid political advertisement--10 times--than they are ever to \nsee a news story, excepting that most of those news stories are \nscandal, and horse races, and are not news anyway.\n  Conceding they really are news, let's operate on the fiction they \nwere putting news on the air. Nevertheless, one would be 10 times more \nlikely to see a political advertisement.\n  Here are examples in Philadelphia: WPVI, 122 advertisements ran \nbetween May 24 and June 5. The number of news stories was 11. WNBC in \nNew York, 99 advertisements, 16 news stories.\n  The fact is, news coverage has reached an all-time low. Just as the \nnetworks are evading their responsibility for the lowest unit cost \nunder the law, they are also avoiding their responsibility to provide \nhard news.\n  During last summer's political conventions for Democrats and \nRepublicans, ABC, CBS, and NBC reduced by two-thirds the hours they \ndevoted to convention coverage of 1988, the last time there was an open \nseat Presidential election.\n  Broadcasters are in many respects public trustees. They should not be \nputting the public airwaves out to bid when political candidates want \nto communicate with their constituents. They receive their licenses by \nmeeting FCC requirements under the 1934 Communications Act in the \npublic interest. The law makes clear that the airwaves are public \nproperty and that they must be used for the ``public interest, \nconvenience, and necessity.''\n  Indeed, perhaps maybe this Congress deserves some of the blame. In \n1997, the Congress gave broadcasters digital TV licenses which doubled \nthe amount of spectrum. If sold at auction, it would have brought in \n$70 billion. William Safire wrote:\n\n       A rip-off on a scale vaster than dreamed. . .by the robber \n     barons.\n\n  Bob Dole called it ``a giant corporate welfare scheme.''\n  What all this has meant is broadcasters taking advantage of this new \ntechnology without any new responsibility, and we have allowed this \nsituation to deteriorate to the point of billion-dollar campaigns \nputting enormous burdens of time and money on the political system. \nThat is, in my judgment, unsustainable.\n  In response to this gift of public assets, President Clinton \nappointed an advisory panel to update the public interest obligation of \nbroadcasters. The panel advised broadcasters to voluntarily air 5 \nminutes a night in the 30 days before the election. During the 2000 \nelections, local affiliates of NBC and CBS agreed to the 5 minutes. \nAlthough these stations should be commended, they and other stations \nmade similar decisions representing 70 percent of the 1,300 local \nstations.\n  Shockingly, ABC, which was the second biggest beneficiary of \npolitical advertisement last year, did not make any commitment at all. \nThe refusal of ABC to join other broadcast networks was the broadest \nstep toward further corporate irresponsibility.\n\n  In sum, what much of this means is that contrary to law and the \nnational interest, the broadcasters have now developed a dependency on \npolitical advertising. As the chart on my left illustrates, this is now \nthe source of revenues of television stations and networks, gaining 25 \npercent of all of their revenue from the automobile companies, the \nlargest industry in America; 15 percent from retailers across the \ncountry, and, unbelievably, 10 percent of all revenues of television \nstations is now coming from political advertising.\n  If this, however, were a chart of Iowa or New Hampshire or early \nprimary States, we would find during the Presidential elections that it \nis not third but first.\n  Even taking the network's greatest advantage of looking at this \nnationally, it is clear television stations have developed a \ndependency--indeed, an addiction--on political advertising. That is \nclearly not in the national interest.\n  What should, however, gain the attention of the American people is \nthe almost unbelievable hypocrisy of the networks on this issue. They \nhave joined the fight for campaign finance reform by criticizing the \ncurrent finance system, and we welcome their assistance. If there is to \nbe genuine reform, we are glad the voices of the networks have been \npart of the drumbeat of criticism to bring this Congress to a change. \nThey want change. They just do not want to be part of it, recognizing \nthere is a reason this money is being raised, and they are the \nprincipal reason.\n  Outside this Chamber, today the National Association of Broadcasters \nwill have its lobbyists attempting to convince Members they should not \nbear any responsibility and they should be able to evade the current \nlaw and charge commercial rates for their $1 billion in political \nadvertising. Indeed, since 1996, the National Association of \nBroadcasters has spent $19 million. While the network broadcasters are \nconvincing the American people to change the political system, their \nlobbyists are in the hall spending millions of dollars in lobbying time \nconvincing people not to lower costs, do not raise money, but keep \nspending it on us.\n  From 1996 through 1998, the National Association of Broadcasters and \nfive media outlets together spent $11 million to defeat 12 campaign \nfinance bills that would have, if implemented, reduced the cost of \nbroadcasting for candidates.\n  Time's up. You wanted campaign finance reform and you were right, the\n\n[[Page S2606]]\n\nsystem should be changed, but you miscalculated because you are going \nto be part of that reform.\n  On a bipartisan basis, this Senate is going to vote today to \nimplement a law which we intended a long time ago. These are public \nairwaves. There will not be price gouging for candidates for Federal \noffice. This time will be sold at the lowest unit rate as was always \nour intention.\n  Under the Torricelli-Corzine-Durbin-Dorgan, et al., amendment, we are \ngoing to bring the letter of the law back in line with the spirit of \nthe law.\n  Our intention is very simple: One, require broadcasters to charge \ncandidates and political parties the lowest rate offered throughout the \nyear. Therefore, the gouging that takes place because the networks know \nthat we must advertise between Labor Day and election day will \nend. They will base these prices on the lowest rate throughout the \nyear.\n\n  Second, ensure that candidate and party ads cannot be bumped, \ndisplaced, by other advertisers willing to pay more for the air time. \nSimply stated, to avoid the problem, as in the letter I indicated from \none television station, where a candidate for public office attempting \nto communicate with their constituent is told that General Motors is \nwilling to pay more for the same spot; therefore, either you pay what \nthey will pay or your advertisement will run in the dead of the night.\n  Three, require the FCC to conduct random checks during the \npreelection period to ensure compliance with the law. In 1990, Senator \nDanforth of Missouri requested a similar audit by the FCC and for the \nfirst time revealed the extent to which broadcasters were not charging \ncandidates the lowest unit rate. Although the crackdown resulted in a \ntemporary dip in rates as broadcasters followed the law more closely, \nrecognizing the FCC controlled their licenses, as soon as the study was \nfinished, the monitoring was over, rates went up again, and the law was \nviolated. This time we will monitor it, but we will monitor it \npermanently.\n  Savings that will result from this amendment are extraordinary, as is \nthe ability to change the national political culture of the fundraiser, \nreducing costs, resulting in reduced fundraising. This is a great \nopportunity. I do not know a member of this Congress who wouldn't \nrather spend their time legislating than raising funds. I don't know a \nMember of this Congress who wouldn't prefer to be at home on the \nweekends with their family or constituents, rather than traveling \naround the Nation raising funds. This isn't something that anybody \nenjoys. There is an endless spiral of fundraising that is out of \ncontrol, but it will not be stopped simply by eliminating soft money or \nmaking it more difficult to raise money of any kind. Candidates will \nfind money within the law under some system unless we address the \nquestion of costs. In the modern political age, the cost of a campaign \nis easily defined. It is television. This is a network-driven process. \nAnd it can change.\n  My final chart illustrates the difference in running political \ncampaigns in three jurisdictions. If the Torricelli-Corzine-Durbin-\nDorgan amendment is adopted, the cost of running advertising in Los \nAngeles, the second most expensive media market in the country, would \nbe a 75-percent difference by applying the lowest unit rate; in Denver, \n41 percent; in Birmingham, AL, an incredible 400-percent difference.\n  This goes to the heart of the problem. We are simply requiring what \nwas asked a long time ago. We do not do this to an industry that is \nstruggling. The broadcast industry is making record profits by using \nFederal licenses with new technology that has been given without cost. \nNow, my friends, it is time to ask them to meet their responsibilities.\n  A new campaign finance system in America will require \nresponsibilities and sacrifices by many people--certainly by every \nMember of Congress. This amendment will welcome the broadcasters into a \nnew responsibility in being part of the answer to the problem rather \nthan the core of the problem itself.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my esteemed \ncolleague, the senior Senator from New Jersey and a number of other \ncolleagues in offering this amendment to reduce the exploding costs of \npolitical advertisements on the airwaves. As Senator Torricelli has \narticulated and effectively demonstrated, this amendment would \nguarantee that candidate advertisements are not preempted by more \nfavored, high-spending advertisers and that candidates are given the \nlowest available rate for the reserved time.\n\n  Mr. President, campaigns do cost too much. God knows, I know. To \ncommunicate with voters, at least in large States like New Jersey with \nmultiple and expensive media markets, candidates must use television \ntime. And television is very expensive. My campaign was charged as much \nas $55,000 for one 30-second spot alone in the weeks directly preceding \nthe election. Others actually paid more.\n  When I began my run for the Senate, I was generally unknown to the \ncommunity at-large. I had enjoyed a successful business career, which I \nthought would make a contribution to the Senate, the Nation, and my \ncommunity. But virtually no one in New Jersey knew who I was or, more \nimportantly, where I stood on the issues. Meanwhile, my opponents \nincluded a former Governor and a former Congressman who were very well \nrecognized throughout our State. The Governor had run five statewide \ncampaigns and the latter had been in Congress 8 years and politics most \nof his adult life. Certainly their experience should not have been \ndisqualifying, but neither should a lifetime of participation in the \nprivate sector preclude the possibility for government service.\n  With that background, Mr. President, as you may know, New Jersey has \nno major in-State television market. Rather, north Jersey voters are \nserved by New York City television stations while south Jersey voters \nare served by those from Philadelphia.\n  The trend in television news coverage is to spend less and less time \non State and local races, and the problem is exaggerated in New Jersey \nwhere stations from other States devote little airtime to covering New \nJersey politics.\n  As my senior colleague pointed out, in both the Philadelphia market \nand New York market, as we ran up to the primary, there was very little \ncoverage. It averaged, if you looked across the two markets, 13 seconds \nper day during the 60 days leading up to the election. Think about \nthat: 13 seconds a day for five candidates to express their points of \nview and get in front of the public. That is some debate. I do hope we \ncan do something about it.\n  Compounding matters, there is also a trend away from covering \nsubstantive issues, as Senator Torricelli remarked, in favor of \ncovering elections in horseraces, who is up, who is down, what the \npolls say, not what the issues are. For those candidates, such as \nmyself, who want to engage voters on the issues, the only option is to \npurchase time from the high priced, out-of-State broadcasters in our \ncase. The end result is the candidates, especially challengers, those \nwho have not previously held public office, must grapple with hugely \nexpensive media costs to stand a chance.\n  Let me be clear. Media exposure does not guarantee success. A \nbankrupt message will lose, despite a well-funded media campaign. I \ndon't buy the argument you can buy an election. There are many examples \nof candidates who have spent significant amounts of money, only to \nlose. People who argue you can buy elections, in my view, underestimate \nthe ability and the judgment of the voters. Still, while adequate \nexposure on television clearly is not sufficient to generate success, \nlack of exposure for many candidates almost certainly will guarantee \nfailure, again, particularly for challengers and newcomers who might \nbring different experiences and perspectives to issues.\n  Congress recognized this media cost problem in 1971 when it required \nbroadcasters to offer candidates the lowest price offered for a similar \ntimeslot. Unfortunately, that legislation included a major loophole. \nUnder the law, while local stations must offer a candidate the lowest \navailable rate, the broadcasters are allowed to preempt those\n\n[[Page S2607]]\n\ncommercials and broadcast them at a later time--in the case in New \nJersey and Philadelphia markets, maybe at 3 a.m., as opposed to prime \ntime. To guarantee that an advertisement is shown at a particular time, \ncandidates are forced to pay premium rates. These premiums have \nincreased the price of on-air time dramatically.\n  Not long ago, the Alliance for Better Campaigns issued a report \nentitled ``Gouging Democracy.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the executive summary of this report be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       Local television stations across the country systematically \n     gouged candidates in the closing months of the 2000 campaign, \n     jacking up the prices of their ads to levels that were far \n     above the lowest candidate rates listed on the stations' own \n     rate cards. They did so despite a 30-year-old federal law \n     designed to protect candidates from such demand-driven price \n     spikes. The stations apparently did not break the law; \n     rather, they exploited loopholes in a law that has never \n     worked as intended. In 2000, this so-called ``lowest unit \n     charge'' [LUC] safeguard for candidates was overrun by the \n     selling practices of stations, the buying demands of \n     candidates, the sharp rise in issue advocacy advertising and \n     the unprecedented flood of hard and soft money into political \n     campaigns.\n       As a result, political advertisers spent five times more on \n     broadcast television ads in 2000 than they did in 1980, even \n     after adjusting for inflation. The candidates made these \n     payments to an industry that has been granted free and \n     exclusive use of tens of billions of dollars worth of \n     publicly owned spectrum space in return for a pledge to serve \n     the public interest. In 2000, the broadcasters treated the \n     national election campaign more as a chance to profiteer than \n     to inform. Their industry has become the leading cause of the \n     high cost of modern politics.\n       This study is based on a comparison of political \n     advertising sales logs and rate cards at 10 local television \n     stations; an analysis of political advertising costs at all \n     stations in the top 75 media markets in the country; and \n     interviews with Democratic and Republican media buyers, \n     television station ad sales managers and officials at the \n     Federal Communications Commission. Its key findings:\n       Candidates Paid Prices Far Above the Lowest Published Rate. \n     In the final months of Campaign 2000, federal, state and \n     local candidates paid ad rates that, on average, were 65 \n     percent above the candidates ``lowest unit charge'' rate \n     published in the stations' own rate card, according to an \n     audit of ad logs at 10 local stations across the country. The \n     10 stations are major network affiliates in large markets; in \n     total, they aired more than 16,000 candidate ads.\n       Stations Steered Candidates Toward Paying Premium Rates. \n     Television stations made their lowest candidate rate \n     unattractive to candidates by selling ads at that rate with \n     the proviso that they could be bumped to another time if \n     another advertiser came forward with an offer to pay more. \n     The LUC system is supposed to ensure that candidates are \n     treated as well as a station's most favored product \n     advertisers (e.g., the year-round advertiser who buys time in \n     bulk and receives a volume discount). But unlike most product \n     advertisers, candidates operate in a fast-changing tactical \n     environment and need assurance that their ads will run in a \n     specified time slot. During the height of the 2000 campaign, \n     station ad salesmen routinely took advantage of these special \n     needs and steered candidates toward paying high premiums for \n     ``non-preemptible'' ad time.\n       An Explosion of Issue Advocacy Ads Caused Spikes in All Ad \n     Rates. The biggest change in the marketplace of political \n     advertising in recent years has been the explosive growth of \n     party and issue group advertising; in 2000, it accounted for \n     roughly half of all political ad spending. These ads are not \n     entitled to LUC protection. In markets where there were \n     highly competitive races, stations doubled and sometimes \n     tripled issue ad rates in the campaign's final weeks. This \n     had a tail-wags-dog effect on the pricing of candidate spots. \n     The intention of the LUC system is to peg candidate rates to \n     volume discount rates for product ads. But in 2000, \n     candidates paid rates driven up by the demand spike created \n     by the flood of soft money-funded issue advocacy ads.\n       Some Candidates Were Shut Out of Air Time. The heavy demand \n     for political ad time squeezed some would-be candidate \n     advertisers off the air. In some markets, television stations \n     either ran out of inventory or refused to sell air time to \n     down-ballot state and local candidates. These candidates are \n     entitled to lower ad rates than issue groups and parties, \n     but, unlike candidates for federal office, they are not \n     guaranteed access to paid ad time.\n       Political Ad Sales Were at Least $771 Million . . . \n     Stations in the top 75 media markets took in at least $771 \n     million from Jan. 1 to Nov. 7, 2000 from the sale of more \n     than 1.2 million political ads, almost double their 1996 take \n     of $436 million.\n       . . . and May Have Hit $1 Billion. The $771 million figure \n     is a conservative estimate. It covers ad spending on the 484 \n     stations in the nation's 75 largest markets, but excludes the \n     ad dollars spent on roughly 800 stations in the nation's 135 \n     smaller markets. It also fails to account for the spike in ad \n     rates that occurred close to Election Day. Some Wall Street \n     analysts estimate the actual political ad revenue total was \n     closer to $1 billion.\n       While Profiteering on the Surge in Political Spending, \n     Stations Cut Back on Coverage. Even as it was taking in \n     record revenues from political advertisers, the broadcast \n     industry scaled back on substantive coverage of candidate \n     discourse. Throughout the 2000 campaign, the national \n     networks and local stations offered scant coverage of \n     debates, conventions and campaign speeches, prompting veteran \n     ABC newsman Sam Donaldson to remark that his network evening \n     news political coverage had ``forfeited the field'' to cable. \n     The industry also fell far short of a proposal by a White \n     House advisory panel, co-chaired by the president of CBS, \n     that stations air five minutes a night of candidate discourse \n     in the closing month of the campaign. In the month preceding \n     Nov. 7, the national networks and the typical local station \n     aired, on average, just a minute a night of such discourse. \n     This minimal coverage increased the pressure on candidates to \n     turn to paid ads as their only way of reaching the mass \n     audience that only broadcast television delivers.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. According to this report, the cost of political \nadvertising last year was $771 million, more than doubling the cost \njust 8 years ago in 1992. That is up from $375 million to almost $800 \nmillion. That is a conservative estimate. The fact is, media costs \nsimply are growing out of control.\n  This is a chart I would like to see for earnings of a company I \nformally represented.\n  To avoid having campaign ads preempted, candidates are forced to pay \nprices above the lowest unit cost. Some 78 percent of the political ads \non WNBC, a New York network affiliate--one of the prime spots for \nplacing your ads in the New York media market--were purchased at a rate \nhigher than the lowest published candidate rate for those timeslots in \nthe fall of 2000. You will see here: WNBC--78 percent.\n  So we compare it equally with Philadelphia, where you also have to \nrun in New Jersey, and 91 percent of the ads were sold at or above \nthose lowest unit costs.\n  It is critical to remember that the public owns the airwaves. They \nare licensed to broadcasters but they belong to all of us. They are a \npublic trust, gifted to the broadcasters for commercial use.\n  The Television Bureau of Advertising, based on estimates supplied by \nCMR MediaWatch, estimates that ad revenues for the broadcast television \nstations in 1999 exceeded $36 billion. Seemingly, the public spectrum \nhas proved profitable for the television broadcasters: $36 billion. \nConsequently, it is not unreasonable to ask the stations to make time \navailable so candidates can communicate with the voters.\n  An article by David Broder appearing in yesterday's Washington Post \ndrives home the underlying motivation for this amendment. I ask \nunanimous consent the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, March 20, 2001]\n\n                       Where the Money Goes . . .\n\n                          (By David S. Broder)\n\n       The Sunday television talk shows were focused on campaign \n     finance reform, but no one was rude enough to suggest that TV \n     itself is at the heart of the problem. The same subject is \n     conspicuous by its absence in the campaign finance debate now \n     underway in the Senate. For a change, the lawmakers are \n     arguing seriously how to regulate the money coming into \n     politics from business, labor and wealthy individuals. But \n     they are ignoring where that money goes.\n       Voters I've interviewed seem to think this money goes into \n     the coffers of the political parties or into the pockets of \n     the politicians. In fact, the parties and the candidates are \n     the middlemen in this process, writing checks as fast as the \n     contributions arrive.\n       Many of the checks go to broadcasters for those 30-second \n     ads that, in the final weeks of a campaign, fill the screen \n     during the breaks in local news shows and popular prime-time \n     series.\n       A report earlier this month from the Alliance for Better \n     Campaigns, a bipartisan public interest group critical of the \n     broadcasters, said that ``stations in the top 75 media \n     markets took in at least $771 million . . . from the sale of \n     more than 1.2 million political ads'' last year. If the \n     figures for stations in the 135 smaller markets were added, \n     it's estimated that the total take probably would be counted \n     at $1 billion.\n       That reality is being ignored as senators debate rival \n     measures, all of which have a common feature--reducing the \n     flow of contributions that pay the campaign television\n\n[[Page S2608]]\n\n     bills. Common sense tells you that if the TV bill remains \n     that exorbitant, politicians will continue the ``money \n     chase'' under any rules that are in place.\n       But that fact is suppressed in Senate debate for the same \n     reason it was ignored on the TV talk shows: fear of \n     antagonizing the station owners, who control what gets on the \n     air.\n       The influence that broadcasters exercise in their home \n     markets is reflected is the power their lobbyists wield in \n     Washington. That is the main reason the major proposals \n     before the Senate--one sponsored by Sens. John McCain and \n     Russ Feingold and the other crafted by Sen. Chuck Hagel--have \n     no provisions aimed at reducing the TV charges. Instead, they \n     focus on the high-dollar ``soft money'' contributions to the \n     political parties. McCain and Feingold would eliminate them; \n     Hagel would limit their size.\n       The soft-money exemption from the contribution limits that \n     apply to other gifts to candidates and parties was created in \n     order to finance such grassroots activity as voter \n     registration and Election Day turnout. But now most of the \n     soft money is converted into TV issue ads, indistinguishable \n     for all practical purposes from the candidates' \n     electioneering messages.\n       The National Association of Broadcasters denies the \n     Alliance for Better Campaigns' charge of price ``gouging'' in \n     the last campaign. But there are no discounts for issue ads; \n     they are sold at whatever price the market will bear. And the \n     heavy volume of issue ads drove up the cost for all TV spots \n     in the weeks leading up to Election Day, including those \n     placed by candidates, thus fueling the money chase.\n       Whether the McCain-Feingold bill, or the Hagel substitute, \n     or some blend of the two is passed, campaign cash will \n     continue to flow to those television stations--and they will \n     continue to charge the candidates and parties what the \n     traffic will bear.\n       For years, some reform advocates have argued that no new \n     law will be effective unless the cost of television can be \n     brought down. McCain, in fact, has drafted a bill that would \n     require the broadcasters--in return for their use of the \n     public airways--to contribute perhaps one percent of their \n     earnings to finance vouchers that the parties and candidates \n     would convert into payment for TV spots. Estimates are that \n     it would go a long way toward eliminating the need for \n     private funding of the TV side of campaigns.\n       But McCain does not plan to offer this as an amendment \n     during the current debate, fearing that the broadcasters' \n     lobby would turn enough votes to kill the underlying bill. It \n     is possible that other senators may offer amendments designed \n     to reduce the need for billion-dollar political TV budgets, \n     but their prospects are poor.\n       The reality is that any measure that becomes law without \n     such a provision is likely to be no more than a Band-Aid. As \n     long as broadcasters can continue to treat politics as a \n     profit center, not a public responsibility, the money will \n     have to come from somewhere to pay those bills. The current \n     debate focuses too much on the people who write the checks. \n     It's time to question, as well, where the money goes.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. He writes:\n\n       Common sense tells you that if the TV bill remains . . . \n     exorbitant, politicians will continue the ``money chase'' \n     under any rules that are in place.\n\n  This amendment seeks to lower the cost of television to reduce that \nmoney chase by lowering the amount of money necessary to run for \nelection.\n  Many would argue if we truly want to get rid of this money chase in \npolitics, we should guarantee free air time for public debate. I agree, \nbut for today we argue only for TV time at the lowest cost per unit. \nThat is all this amendment does. It requires broadcasters to make time \navailable on a nonpreemptable basis at the lowest cost offered to \nanyone for that time period, and it requires the FCC to conduct \nperiodic audits to ensure compliance.\n  This does nothing more than enforce the original intent of Congress \nwhen it first required broadcasters to make time available at the \nlowest unit rate. This simple but powerful reform potentially will \nbring sanity to the cost of 21st century campaigns.\n  I urge my colleagues, as Senator Torricelli has before me and others \nwill after, to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am about to yield to my colleague and \nfriend, Senator Dorgan, but I wish to commend both of our colleagues \nfrom New Jersey--Senator Torricelli for being the lead sponsor of this \namendment and Senator Corzine and others for their cosponsorship of it \nand to Senator Corzine for some excellent remarks on the purpose of \nthis amendment.\n  I will take some time later on this morning to address the substance \nof the amendment, but I commend both of my colleagues for their \nefforts. This is very well thought out. The point Senator Corzine made \nthat we sometimes forget is that these are public airwaves which we \nlicense people to use for commercial purposes. Nothing is more \nimportant than making people aware of the choices, both issues and \nsubstantive choices as well as political choices that they make in \nnational, local, or State elections. We can't say anything about local \nor State elections, but we can about national--Federal elections.\n  I think Senators Torricelli, Corzine, Dorgan, and Durbin have hit on \na very important point if this bill is to do truly what its authors \nintend it to do.\n  I yield 15 minutes to Senator Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I say to Senator Torricelli and my other \ncolleagues who have cosponsored this amendment, they have done a real \nservice, in my judgment, in this debate. This is an amendment that can \nhardly be opposed by Members of the Senate. It makes so much sense and \nis so overdue.\n  Let me begin in a more general way talking about campaign finance \nreform and then describing why this amendment is critical to the \nsuccess of this effort.\n  This Saturday there was a story in one of the major city newspapers \nin this country. I do not think I will identify the people in the \nstory, but I want to use this story to make a point. It is a story \nabout a group who has gathered to fund certain political campaigns. It \nsays they met in a conference room, 40 business executives, investors, \nwealthy folks gathered at a law firm conference room, and they had some \ncandidates come in and they would make presentations to the gathered \npotential donors. Then the donors would score them, 1 to 10, and \ndetermine who was best, who were the best candidates.\n  It was like a beauty contest without the bathing suits or good looks, \nI guess. You have the candidates come in this law office conference \nroom, make their presentation, and they get a score of 1 to 10. \nApparently after the candidates have made this presentation, this group \nof investors would decide who they were going to support. In this case, \nthe story was about a Member of Congress now who went to this \nconference room, made a presentation, scored in the 10s, I guess, and \nthen this group of 40 people said: You are our guy. What we are going \nto do is, we are going to do a couple of hundred thousand dollars worth \nof television advertising for you--independent issue ads--and then, \nsecond, we are going to bundle some money and get you a couple of \nhundred thousand dollars in checks.\n  So this little beauty contest produces $400,000 for a candidate. The \ngroup evolved from a small core of Wall Street bigwigs led by so-and-\nso. Their goal is to target large sums of money to specific kinds of \ncandidates who come in and survive this little beauty contest they \nhave.\n  Do we need campaign finance reform? Of course we do. That is just one \nevidence of the desperate need for campaign finance reform. You bet we \nneed it. I support the McCain-Feingold bill. I admit it is not perfect. \nI might have written some sections differently. It may need to be \nchanged some. But it is a piece of legislation this Congress ought to \nembrace.\n  Fifty years ago we effectively had no rules with respect to \ncampaigns. There were no limits, no reporting requirements, and there \nwas an exchange of money in this town in paper bags or envelopes; it \ncould be in cash. The amount of money was donated and unreported.\n  Was that a system that worked? Of course not. That desperately needed \nto be changed and it was in the early 1970s. We had the reforms of 1974 \nthat tried to establish certain limits and tried to establish certain \nreporting. In many ways it worked, in some areas, but in other ways it \nhas not worked. Money and politics are like water finding a hill. They \nrun downhill inevitably.\n\n  There is in this political system, rather than a competition of ideas \nis, which is what democracy ought to be about, a mad rush for money in \norder to pay the costs of television advertising, which has become the \nmother's milk of politics. What has happened to their competition of \nideas in this blizzard of television advertising? Ideas are\n\n[[Page S2609]]\n\nalmost gone, nearly obliterated. The orgy of 30-second advertisements \nin this country is a slash-and-burn and hit-and-run negative attack, \noften by nameless and faceless people, in many cases by organizations \nthat are not part of political parties. They are independent \norganizations collecting unlimited money from donors who are \nundisclosed.\n  Do we need campaign finance reform? Darned right, we do. This system \nis out of control.\n  In this morning's Washington Post there is a columnist who really \nmakes the case about, what we need in politics is more money, that we \njust need more money in this political system. I wonder, has this \nperson been on some kind of space flight somewhere? Did the shuttle \ntake him up, and have they gone for the last 10 years? Could they not \nhave failed to see in September and October--and even before in every \nelection year, especially last year--the blizzard of advertisements, \nthe 30-second ads in every venue of every kind?\n  Our political system doesn't need more money. In fact, what has \nhappened--and I think that is what has prompted this amendment--is that \npoliticians have become collectors of money in order to transfer the \nmoney to television stations that become the large beneficiaries of \nthis new system of ours.\n  My colleague, Senator Torricelli, has offered an amendment that says \nthe television stations in this country have a responsibility to do \nwhat the law says they should do--that industry has a responsibility to \nsell political time for political advertisements to candidates at the \nlowest rate on the rate card. But that has not been happening. What has \nhappened in the communications business--especially television and \nradio--is a galloping concentration and mergers. Since the 1996 \nTelecommunications Act, we have seen a rash of mergers and large \ncompanies becoming larger. In virtually very State, there are fewer \ntelevision stations owned locally, and more are owned by large national \ncombines.\n  Guess what happened. The result is they make decisions now about the \nad prices and the rate cards they are going to use for politics. They \nare maximizing their revenue from the political income in this country.\n  My colleague described what is happening in New Jersey. I think that \nis important, because he describes the substantial increase in costs of \ntelevision advertising for political purposes in New Jersey.\n  Let me describe what happened in North Dakota. The advertisement that \ncost a mere $290 in 1998 to clear an ad on four NBC stations in western \nNorth Dakota--remember that this is a sparsely populated area, and the \nrates are much different from in New Jersey and New York--but a $290 or \n$300 advertisement 2 years go sold at $753 last fall, nearly tripling \nthe advertising rates of the television stations in a small State such \nas North Dakota.\n  I am told that the two Federal races paid almost exactly double for \nabout the same time on the television stations in North Dakota in the \nyear 2000.\n  This isn't just about big markets, it is about every market, and it \nis about the television industry deciding it is going to profit as a \nresult of being able to ignore, effectively, a provision that exists in \nlaw requiring the sale of television advertising at the lowest rate on \nthe card for political advertising.\n\n  I happen to think we ought to do more in reform with respect to \nadvertising. I know some think this would be too intrusive. But, as I \nindicated, I think political campaigns ought to be a competition about \nideas. They ought to be about competing ideas of what we need to do in \nthis country to make this a better place in which to live. They have \ninstead become this machine gunfire of 30-second advertisements.\n  I would like to see at some point that we require the lowest rate on \nthe rate card to be offered to those who purchase a 1-minute ad, \nrequire the television industry to sell ads in 1-minute increments, and \nrequire the candidate to appear on the ad three-fourths of the time of \nthe 1-minute ad. That would really require people to use television \nadvertising to tell the American people what they are about. If they \nwant to criticize their opponent, good for them. But they would have to \ndo it in person on the air.\n  I think that would really change a lot of political advertising in \nthis country, and I think America would be better served to have \npositive debate about what the candidate stands for; one would stand \nfor one set of ideas, and the other would stand for another set of \nideas; and let people make a choice. But these days, that is not what \nyou have. You have a rush to try to destroy one candidate by the other, \nand in many cases we are seeing expenditures and unlimited money coming \nfrom undisclosed donors. That doesn't serve this political system at \nall.\n  My colleague says let us at least solve this problem by adding to the \nMcCain-Feingold bill. As I indicated when I started, I support the \nMcCain-Feingold legislation because I think it is a significant step in \nthe right direction. But it will be incomplete if we do not add this \namendment because this amendment will finally tell the television \nindustry: You must do what the law requires. Here is exactly what \nCongress says the law has required for some long while that you have \ngotten away from doing. If we don't do this, we will not see an \nabatement to this mad rush for money and the requirement that those who \nare involved in politics collect funds in order to transfer those funds \nto the television stations that are now charging double and triple for \nthe advertising that is required in America politics.\n  I really believe this is a critically important amendment.\n  I must say my colleague from New Jersey, Senator Torricelli, made an \noutstanding presentation. He has done his homework, as I described, \nwith one of my colleagues. He has made a very effective presentation of \nwhy this is necessary.\n  Let me make an additional point about the television industry. I \nthink the television industry does some awfully good things in our \ncountry, and all of us take advantage of it almost every day. And we \nappreciate the good things they do. But, as we know, the television \nindustry was provided a spectrum. The public airwaves were given to \nbroadcasters free on the condition they serve ``the public interest, \nconvenience, and necessity.''\n  According to a study by the Norman Lear Center at the University of \nSouthern California, during the 2000 campaign the typical local \ntelevision station in a major market aired just 45 seconds of the \ncandidate's second discourse per night during a month before November \n7. Why? They know what sells on the news. They are chasing ambulances, \nthey are not covering political campaigns.\n\n  There were stories about this in the last campaign. Too often \ntelevision stations decided they weren't going to put campaign news in \nthe news strip, let people buy it, and at the same time on the \ncommercial side of the station they were jacking up the price of their \nads and preventing candidates from accessing the lowest unit cost.\n  I think on the issue of public interest, convenience, and necessity, \nwe have a ways to go in the television industry dealing with the \ncoverage of political campaigns.\n  Major broadcast networks performed only slightly better--airing just \n64 seconds a night of a candidate's discourse per network, according to \nan Annenberg Public Policy Center report.\n  The question is, How are the American people to gather information \nabout the competition of ideas that ought to exist in the political \nrace over the newscast? Hardly. The news industry, including the \nnetworks, is not covering most of these campaigns. And local stations \nhave decided increasingly that there is a menu for their nightly news, \nand they understand exactly what it is. It is often dealing with crime, \neven while crime goes down.\n  Incidentally, there are wonderful studies about this which show \ndecreased crime rates and increased viewing of stories about violent \ncrime on the nightly news because that is what sells.\n  It is time for us to ask for something better and something different \nfrom the television industry. In this circumstance, we are simply \nasking them to do what we believe the law has required them to do but \nwhat they have been refusing to do in recent years, and that is to sell \n45 days before a primary and 60 days before a general election to \ncandidates for public office at the lowest unit charge of the station \nfor the same class and amount of time for the same period as for the \ncommercials\n\n[[Page S2610]]\n\nthat are aired on those stations. That is what the requirement is.\n  It is what they have not been doing, and it is what Senator \nTorricelli and Senator Corzine, Senator Durbin, I, and others say it is \ntime to be required to do.\n  So I am pleased today to support this amendment. I think it is a very \nimportant amendment, and I am especially pleased my colleague, Senator \nTorricelli, has taken the lead to offer it today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me inquire, how much time remains on the \nproponents' side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seventeen minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. DODD. How much time remains on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ninety minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. May I inquire of my colleague from Kentucky--if I could \ninterrupt for 1 second--we are down to about 17 minutes on the \nproponents' side. Will my colleague from Kentucky be willing at some \npoint to yield us a little time if we need it?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield some time. I \nam unaware of speakers at the moment in opposition to the Torricelli \namendment. There may be some. Actually, I know of one who wants to \nspeak. He is not on the floor at the moment. So we will be casual about \ntime, and I will make sure we can accommodate all speakers.\n  Mr. DODD. How much time does my colleague want?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Let me inquire. We have several colleagues who want \nto speak on behalf of the amendment. While I want to speak, I do not \nwant to take all the time that remains. So I am under the Senator's \nguidance.\n  Mr. DODD. Why not take the time the senator's need, and I am \nconfident my colleague from Kentucky will yield us some time if we need \nit.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my colleague from New Jersey, I am not \nexactly swamped with speakers requesting time. I will be glad to work \nwith the Senator to have adequate time.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Senator very much.\n  At this point, I want to deal with several of the questions that have \nbeen put before the Senate. In the absence of anyone coming to the \nSenate floor to confront the overwhelming logic of our amendment, I \nwant to deal with the stealth arguments being presented in Senators' \noffices. Even though no one will rise in defense of this indefensible \ncause of the networks, nevertheless, there are silent arguments being \nwaged. I will debate those even if there is not someone in person to do \nit.\n  As some of my colleagues have noted, some of the most effective \narguments were actually made yesterday in the Washington Post by David \nBroder, the columnist. Let me begin by quoting those arguments. I \nquote:\n\n       The reality is being ignored--\n\n  That is in dealing with McCain-Feingold--\n\n     as senators debate rival measures, all of which have a common \n     feature--reducing the flow of contributions that pay the \n     campaign television bills. Common sense tells you that if the \n     TV bill remains that exorbitant, politicians will continue \n     the ``money chase'' under any rules that are in place.\n\n  Exactly. Further:\n\n       The reality is that any measure that becomes law without \n     such a provision--\n\n  Parenthetically, that meaning the cost of television--\n\n     is likely to be no more than a Band-Aid. As long as \n     broadcasters can continue to treat politics as a profit \n     center, not a public responsibility, the money will have to \n     come from somewhere to pay those bills. The current debate \n     focuses too much on the people who write the checks. It's \n     time to question, as well, where the money goes.\n\n  That is the heart of the argument for this amendment.\n  Where does the money go? Mr. McCain and Mr. Feingold deal with the \ndemand for money. We are dealing with the supply of the advertisements. \nThis is an equation that inevitably must be dealt with together in the \nbill.\n  It has been noted by my colleague, Senator Corzine, of our experience \nin the New York metropolitan area, although indeed we do so simply \nbecause we are the most familiar with it. The arguments we are making \nabout New York and Philadelphia could be made in any market in the \ncountry, al though I want, parenthetically, to deal with how the \nnetworks are approaching political campaigns today, not as a \nresponsibility to enhance communication but as an economic opportunity.\n  It should be noted that of the 10 stations that made the most money \nfrom political advertising in the year 2000, three are in New York: \nNBC, ABC and CBS; two are in Philadelphia, WPVI and WCAU. They range \nfrom WNBC in New York, which placed $25 million of advertising, and in \nPhiladelphia with $11 million for WCAU. It is best described by the \nsales director at the CBS affiliate in Philadelphia as ``the best year \nwe've had in forever.''\n  Why was it the best year and why all this excitement?\n  Let me quote from an article by Paul Taylor, former Washington Post \npolitical reporter. Quoting the CBS affiliate in Buffalo, WIVB-TV, \nPatrick Paolini, general sales manager, who said:\n\n       We're salivating. No question it will be huge as far as ad \n     revenue [is concerned] . . . It's like Santa Claus came. It's \n     a beautiful thing.\n\n  He was not talking about the quality of the debate. ``Santa Claus \ncoming'' was not about substantive arguments to help the people of New \nYork. He was talking about the prospects of Hillary Rodham Clinton \nrunning for the Senate and the potential revenues, recognizing the \nexpenditures in a Clinton Senate campaign. ``We're salivating.'' ``It's \na beautiful thing.'' ``It's like Santa Claus came.''\n  It is not by chance that we come today making this argument. There \nhas been a calculation by television networks to take advantage of this \npolitical system and this fundraising to maximize their profits.\n  There are arguments going on in Senators' offices as we speak. Papers \nare being circulated, as I have suggested, in the absence of any \nSenators coming to argue against this amendment. Stealth arguments are \nbeing made to Senators' offices. Let me go through a few of these \narguments for a moment.\n  The National Association of Broadcasters is arguing, first, that we \nare going down the slippery slope of free time.\n  My colleagues, there is no amendment before the Senate requiring free \ntime. Indeed, there could be an argument for it. All of our European \nallies, in every other industrial democracy in the world, broadcasters \nare required to provide free time to help the public debate. We are not \ndoing that today. It would be warranted, but it is not being argued.\n  We are simply requiring that the law read as many Senators believe it \nalready exists--lowest unit cost. We are closing a loophole in the \ncurrent law.\n  Second, the National Association of Broadcasters is arguing in \nMembers' offices that: Candidates already receive a 30 percent discount \non regular commercial ad rates. Oh, my colleagues, if only it were so. \nAs I think we demonstrated earlier in my arguments, that is a fiction. \nCandidates are not getting 30 percent. Yes, that is the law. That is \nwhat should be happening. But as we have demonstrated--in Minneapolis, \n95 percent of advertising is now being done at commercial rates, 4 \npercent is at lowest unit rate; in Detroit, 8 percent is at lowest unit \nrate; in Philadelphia, 9 percent; in San Francisco, 14 percent; in Las \nVegas, 38 percent; in Seattle, 9 percent.\n\n  No, National Association of Broadcasters, you are not providing a 30-\npercent discount. That is the exception. The rule is, you are price \ngouging. You are charging commercial rates--contrary to current law.\n  Third, arguing that: This has a fundamental, constitutional problem. \nThere is no constitutional problem. First, we have had, for more than \n30 years, the requirement that ads must be sold at the lowest unit \nrate. We are not doing anything new. We are closing a loophole in \ncurrent law. If there is a constitutional argument now, then there has \nbeen a constitutional argument for decades; and it has never been \nraised before, although, frankly, even if it had been, it would have \nfailed.\n  The fifth amendment's taking challenge would fail in this provision. \nThere is no right to a grant of a license or property interest in the \nuse of a frequency. The networks have a public license to use the \npublic frequencies for their network business. There is no\n\n[[Page S2611]]\n\nconstitutional right to it. You apply for a license, and you can get \nthat license subject to conditions. Public responsibility is one of \nthose conditions.\n  Selling air time for the public debate at a reasonable cost is \nanother condition. That has always been a condition.\n  Under section 304 of the Communications Act of 1934, broadcasters are \nrequired to ``waive any claim to the use of any particular frequency or \nelectromagnetic spectrum as against the regulatory power of the U.S.'' \nThere they have waived the constitutional right to claim that the \nspectrum must be used for public purposes.\n  In Federal Communications Commission v. Sanders Bros. Radio Station, \na court decision, the Supreme Court of the United States interpreted \nthis provision to mean that:\n\n       No person is to have anything in the nature of a property \n     right as a result of granting a license.\n\n  There simply is no constitutional right impaired by asking these \nreduced rates.\n  Finally, the broadcasters are arguing, in correspondence to our \noffices, that broadcasters should not bear the burden of campaign \nreform. Why not? Isn't dealing with the campaign finance problems of \nthe country everybody's responsibility? We are saying that candidates \nfor public office should no longer avail themselves of soft money, \nshould abide by certain rules. Why indeed should broadcasters not bear \nsome of the responsibilities? Do they not have public licenses? Do they \nnot have responsibility to air the news fairly, cover campaigns, to \ninform the public? Should they be allowed to price gouge?\n  They make the argument: What about newspapers? Shouldn't newspapers \nbear this responsibility? I don't know a newspaper in America that \ndeals with a Federal license, nor are newspapers under the same \ncircumstance of a market that will only permit so many newspapers. The \nspectrum has limited the number of television stations; hence, the \nFEC's requirements and Federal law.\n  These National Association of Broadcasters arguments are an insult. \nThey confirm the arrogance with which the networks are approaching \nFederal campaigns, the arrogance that is leading to avoidance of \nFederal responsibilities, the selling at lowest unit rate cost, or the \nraising of these extraordinary arguments without merit.\n  That is the sum and substance of the case they are making. To the \ncredit of my colleagues, they are so meritless in their points that no \none will actually argue their point of view. Hence, I challenge them \nalone.\n  We have other colleagues who have come to the floor to make their \ncase. I yield the floor. Senator Durbin will be available to speak to \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from New Jersey, once \nagain, for raising the arguments that are being circulated around the \noffices of the Senate and pointing out the fallacy of those arguments.\n  The facts are inarguable, when you look at the rates that are being \ncharged in major markets all across the country. It goes back to the \nheart of the bill. As we are trying to keep down costs, for many of us \nit runs somewhere around 75 or 80 cents on the dollar that is spent on \nTV advertising. It varies from State to State, I am sure, but that is \nnot an unrealistic number in modern campaigns to spend that much of a \ncampaign dollar on TV advertising, considering how much the public \nrelies on television for its sources of information.\n  If we are truly trying to put the brakes on the ever-spiraling cost \nof campaigns, as my colleague from Wisconsin has eloquently described, \nthere is no natural law that I know of which says that the costs of \ncampaigns ought to continue to rise at the rate they have been rising \nover the last few years. Trying to do something about cost as well as \nthe amount of dollars that are raised is the second part of this \nequation.\n  If we are making the case that we don't need more money in politics, \nthat case is more easily made if we are able to demonstrate that we can \nreduce the cost of trying to speak to the American public about what \nour views are, what their choices are, as we encourage people to \nparticipate in the electoral process.\n  I thank our colleagues, the authors of this amendment, for offering \nthe amendment and making the case they have. I know our colleague from \nIllinois, who is a cosponsor of the amendment, wants to be heard. I see \nmy colleague from Wisconsin. Maybe he would like to take a couple \nminutes before Senator Durbin arrives. I yield a couple of minutes to \nthe Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I know the Senator from Illinois is coming. I will take \na moment or two. I appreciate the Senator from Connecticut giving me \nthe time so I can indicate my support for this amendment. I think I can \nspeak for the Senator from Arizona as well. We are going to support \nthis amendment.\n  The Senator from New Jersey has laid out the substantive arguments \nvery persuasively. I wish to say a word or two about how this amendment \nrelates to our overall McCain-Feingold bill and why it is very \nconsistent with reform. The Senator from Connecticut has already \nmentioned this, pretty much foreshadowing what I will say.\n  The most important point is that the amendment compliments the soft \nmoney ban. The bottom line of our legislation is, we have to get rid of \nthis party soft money that is growing exponentially. The reality, \nthough, as the Senator from New Jersey has pointed out, is that in a \npost-soft-money world, the amount of money available for a candidate in \nparty advertising will be significantly reduced. That is how it should \nbe. That is what we must do.\n  Reducing the cost of television time will have the very beneficial \neffect of reducing the impact of the loss of soft money on the ability \nof candidates to legitimately get their message out. The parties will \nonly have hard money to spend. For that reason, it is appropriate to \nallow them to use the lowest unit rate as well.\n  The fact is, this amendment can help make the legislation work. This \namendment will help the parties to adjust to the new world of \nfundraising for only hard money, and it will help candidates have the \nsufficient resources to respond to ads that will still be run by \noutside groups.\n  Some of the concerns about all the money that would flow to the \noutside groups are overblown. I don't think all the money will flow. It \nis false that all the corporations will give their money in that way. \nThe fact is, there still will be these ads and people will still need \nto respond. The Torricelli amendment does make it possible for people \nto have that ability to respond through the legitimate, controlled, \nregulated, and disclosed hard money system.\n  Like the soft money ban in this bill, the amendment will take our \nelection law back to its original intent. The soft money ban \nreinvigorates the century-old prohibition of corporate spending in \nconnection with Federal elections. Lowest unit rate, on the other hand, \nwas intended to give candidates a significant discount for advertising \nso they could get their message out. The practice of having preemptible \nand then, on the other hand, nonpreemptible classes of time was not \ncontemplated by the lowest unit rate statute. What this amendment does \nis bring the LUR back to what the Congress intended it to be.\n  In my mind, it is very similar to what the soft money ban does. It \ntakes us back to where we were supposed to be. We are talking in both \ncases about loopholes that have helped destroy an entire system that \nactually was pretty well thought out. But loopholes do occur, and this \namendment helps us close them.\n  The Senator from New Jersey already did a fine job on this. I \nreiterate, this is not a slippery slope. This is not the next step to \nfree time. I wish it was. There ought to be free time for candidates. \nThere ought to be reduced television costs, but LUR is not free time. \nThe original McCain-Feingold bill, when Senator McCain and I first came \ntogether to work on a bipartisan basis, was about voluntary spending \nlimits in return for reduced costs for television time. That is \nsomething we were unable to get a majority of the Senate to support. \nThat is not what this amendment does. This amendment simply makes LUR \neffective and useful in practice for candidates.\n\n  I thank the Senator and appreciate his very serious involvement in \nthis campaign finance debate and, in particular, for this amendment \nthat, as I indicated, Senator McCain and I tried\n\n[[Page S2612]]\n\nfor 5 years to finally get this bill on the floor. We always said we \nhave our ideas, but we believe that if this bill is brought to the \nfloor of the Senate, the Members of the Senate will make it a better \nbill. Every one of us is an expert on this issue. If we come out and \nhave an honest, open debate as we are having now, it will get better. \nThe Torricelli amendment is proof of that proposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield myself whatever time I may use. \nI assure my colleagues from Connecticut and from Illinois it will be \nshort.\n  I have been very pleased by the debate so far on this subject and, \nfrankly, somewhat surprised. The comity in the Senate has been \nexcellent. There has been a total absence of unsubstantiated charges of \ncorruption, which we had on the floor the last time this debate came \nup. That is a step in the right direction.\n  On that subject, in today's Washington Post, there was an interesting \narticle by George Will, a columnist. I ask unanimous consent that the \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, March 20, 2001]\n\n                          Drops in the Bucket\n\n                          (By George F. Will)\n\n       McCainism, the McCarthyism of today's ``progressives,'' \n     involves, as McCarthyism did, the reckless hurling of \n     imprecise accusations. Then, the accusation was \n     ``communism!'' Today it is ``corruption!'' Pandemic \n     corruption of ``everybody'' by ``the system'' supposedly \n     justifies campaign finance reforms. Those reforms would \n     subject the rights of political speech and association to yet \n     further government limits and supervision, by restricting the \n     political contributions and expenditures that are \n     indispensable for communication in modern society.\n       The media, exempt from regulations they advocate for rival \n     sources of influence, are mostly John McCain's megaphones. \n     But consider how empirically unproved and theoretically \n     dubious are his charges of corruption.\n       What McCain and kindred spirits call corruption, or the \n     ``appearance'' thereof, does not involve personal enrichment. \n     Rather, it means responding to, or seeming to respond to, \n     contributors, who also often are constituents. However, those \n     crying ``corruption!'' must show that legislative outcomes \n     were changed by contributions--that because of contributions, \n     legislators voted differently from the way they otherwise \n     would have done.\n       Abundant scholarship proves that this is difficult to \n     demonstrate, and that almost all legislative behavior is \n     explainable by the legislators' ideologies, party \n     affiliations or constituents' desires. So reformers hurling \n     charges of corruption often retreat to the charge that the \n     ``real'' corruption is invisible--a speech not given, a \n     priority not adopted. That charge is impossible to refute by \n     disproving a negative. Consider some corruption innuendos \n     examined by Bradley Smith, a member of the Federal Election \n     Commission, in his new book ``Unfree Speech: The Folly of \n     Campaign Finance Reform.''\n       In April 1999, Common Cause, McCain's strongest \n     collaborator, made much of the fact that from 1989 through \n     1998 the National Rifle Association had contributed $8.4 \n     million to congressional campaigns. However, that was just \n     two-tenths of one percent of total spending ($4 billion) by \n     congressional candidates during that period. How plausible is \n     it that NRA contributions--as distinct from the votes of 3 \n     million NRA members--influenced legislators?\n       Common Cause made much of the fact that in the 10 years \n     ending in November 1996, broadcasting interests gave $9 \n     million in hard dollars to federal and state candidates and \n     in soft dollars to parties. Gosh. Five election cycles. \n     Changing issues and candidates. Rival interests within the \n     industry (e.g., Time Warner vs. Turner). And broadcasters' \n     contributions were only one-tenth of one percent of the $9 \n     billion spent by parties and candidates during that period. \n     Yet, as Smith says, Common Cause implies that this minuscule \n     portion of political money caused legislative majorities to \n     vote for bills they otherwise would have opposed, or to \n     oppose bills they otherwise would have supported, each time \n     opposing the wishes of the constituents that the legislators \n     must face again.\n       As Smith says, to prove corruption one must prove that \n     legislators are acting against their principles, or against \n     their best judgment, or against their constituents' wishes. \n     Furthermore, claims of corruption seem to presuppose that \n     legislators should act on some notion of the ``public good'' \n     unrelated to the views of any particular group of voters.\n       Although reformers say there is ``too much money in \n     politics,'' if they really want to dilute the possible \n     influence of particular interests (the NRA, broadcasters, \n     whatever), they should favor increasing the size of the total \n     pool of political money, so that any interest's portion of \n     the pool will be small. And if reformers really want to see \n     the appearance of corruption, they should examine what their \n     reforms have done, have tried to do and have not tried to do.\n       Smith notes that incumbent reelection rates began to rise \n     soon after incumbents legislated the 1974 limits on \n     contributions, which hurt challengers more than well-known \n     incumbents with established financing networks. After 1974, \n     incumbents' fundraising advantages over challengers rose from \n     approximately 1.5 to 1, to more than 4 to 1.\n       Early 1997 versions of the McCain-Feingold and Shays-Meehan \n     reform bills would have set spending ceilings--surprise!--\n     just where challengers become menacing to incumbents. Shays-\n     Meehan set $600,000 for House races. Forty percent of \n     challengers who had spent more than that in the previous \n     cycle won; only 3 percent of those who spent less won. In \n     1994, 1996 and 1998, all Senate challengers lost who spent \n     less than the limits proposed in the 1995 and 1997 versions \n     of McCain-Feingold.\n       There are interesting limits to McCain's enthusiasm for \n     limits. His bill does not include something President Bush \n     proposes--a ban on lobbyists making contributions to \n     legislators while the legislature is in session. Such a limit \n     would abridge the freedom of incumbents. Campaign finance \n     reform is about abridging the freedom of everyone but \n     incumbents--and their media megaphones.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It was on the whole subject of unsubstantiated charges \nof corruption.\n  In my view, as I have said in the past, and repeat again today, when \npeople make those kinds of charges, they need to back them up. I am \nquite pleased there have been no such charges made during this debate. \nIt produces an atmosphere that makes it more likely that we can better \nlegislate.\n  This is the second amendment offered in the last 24 hours that I \nthink addresses some of the real problems in today's campaign finance \nreform debate. The first problem that we addressed yesterday was the \nproblem of the millionaire candidate. It passed 70-30. It was an \nexcellent amendment by Senator Domenici and Senator DeWine and Senator \nDurbin that actually addresses a real problem we have in today's \ncampaigns.\n  Now we have another amendment that addresses a real problem. I \ncommend the Senator from New Jersey for a thoughtful, well-researched, \nand, in my view, conclusive case, that the law that has been on the \nbooks for 30 years requiring the broadcasters to sell candidates time \nat the lowest unit rate ought to be complied with. None of us likes \nhaving to raise money. But it is my view that it is better than getting \nit out of the Treasury. I assume we will debate later whether or not \nthe taxpayers ought to pick up the tab for our campaigns. If it is \ninconvenient for us, it ought to come through our efforts, not somebody \nelse's.\n  As the Senator from New Jersey pointed out, and very persuasively, no \nmatter how many hours there are in a day, with the declining value of \nthe $1,000 contribution set in the 1970s, when a Mustang cost $2,700, \nand inflation in the television industry, far beyond the CPI--coupled \nwith an apparent unwillingness that we have all experienced in our \nStates of broadcast stations to cover campaigns in the news--we are, in \neffect, blacked out in terms of earned coverage.\n  The need for commercials is critical and essential. So what the \nSenator from New Jersey is saying is, let's apply the law, as \noriginally written, correctly. Give candidates for public office an \nopportunity to get their message across. I think it is an amendment, \nthe passage of which is necessary if we are going to address one of the \nreal problems in the current campaign finance system.\n  This is something of a historic moment. I think Senator McCain, \nSenator Feingold, and I are going to be on the same side of an \namendment. Come to think of it, it is the second time.\n  I commend the Senator from Wisconsin, also, for his consistent \nopposition to amending the first amendment for the first time in 200 \nyears. He and I have been on the same side of that issue over the \nyears. This will be the second time we have been on the same side. I \nthink it bodes well as we move forward in this debate.\n  In my judgment, we are actually improving this bill. I hope we will \nmake other improvements as we go along. I intend to support the \nTorricelli amendment. I commend the Senator from\n\n[[Page S2613]]\n\nNew Jersey for a completely well-researched, documented case that \naddresses one of the real problems we have in American politics in the \nyear 2001.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I don't know if I need specific time \nyielded. I ask for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the proponents has expired.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I had yielded the Senator 20 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If my friend will yield for a moment, I wonder if the \nSenator from Kentucky will give me 5 minutes at the conclusion of \nSenator Durbin's time. I would appreciate it.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will be happy to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Kentucky for graciously allowing \nme to speak.\n  Back in the early 1960s, Newt Minow, of Chicago, was named Chairman \nof the Federal Communications Commission by President John Kennedy. He \ncame up with a phrase to characterize television at that moment in our \nhistory, which has become legendary. Newt Minow called television in \nthe early 1960s, ``the great wasteland.'' He took a look at what was \navailable on television and suggested that the American people deserved \nbetter. It triggered a national debate for reform and creative thinking \nabout the role of television.\n  I say today, if you look at the role of television in this debate on \npolitical campaigns and public issues, television is not just a great \nwasteland, television has become a killing field because the people who \nrun the television stations, the networks and local broadcasters, have \nforgotten the bottom line: their responsibility to the American people.\n  You see, they are selling a product. It is something they create; it \nis programming--the types of things we like to watch on television, \nsuch as sports, news, and entertainment. But their business is \ndifferent than any other. The way they sell their product is on \nsomething that we as Americans all own--the airwaves. The television \nstations don't own the airwaves. We tell them: You can rent the \nairwaves; you can lease the airwaves, and we will license you to use \nthe airwaves, but we expect you to do it in a responsible way.\n  Today we are engaged in a debate--and all this week--on campaign \nfinance reform. Many people have suggested changes that are \nsignificant. I salute Senators Feingold of Wisconsin and McCain of \nArizona. I have been a cosponsor of the bill. They are talking about \nthe sources of money that go into political advertising. We all know \nthat the sources have become scandalous in size and, frankly, in their \nspecial interests. I think they are on the right track to clean up the \nmoney going into political campaigns. But the important thing to \nremember is that just dealing with the supply side, if you will, of \npolitical campaigns, the sources of campaign contributions misses the \npoint.\n  Do you want to really reform political campaigns in America? You \ncan't even have a serious conversation about that, unless you address \nthe role of television. Television used to be a tiny part of political \ncampaigns, but it has grown almost out of control.\n  Take a look at these numbers--political advertising on broadcast \ntelevision. Starting in 1970, network expenditures were $260,000. Come \ndown to the year 2000, 30 years later, and it is $15 million-plus. \nStation TV used to be about $12 million in the 1970 cycle. Now we are \nup to $650 million. The total expenditure for the year 2000 was \nestimated to be some $665 million. Well, the Alliance for Better \nCampaigns came out and said it was going to be between $771 million and \n$1 billion spent on television by political campaigns.\n\n  So what we have, in fact, are efforts by candidates of both political \nparties to raise money to give to television and radio stations in an \neffort to get your message out to the American people. When we created \nthese stations and we acknowledged that the public owned the airwaves, \nwe also said when it came to political advertising, candidates would be \ntreated differently than other advertisers--something called the lowest \nunit charge. We basically said that if there was a bargain at the TV \nstation, the bargain should be given to the political candidate. That \nis in the interest of sharing information on public issues, but also in \nkeeping the cost of political campaigns under control.\n  But, sadly, though the law required, as of 1971, that the lowest unit \ncharge be charged to candidates in their campaigns, the fact is that \ncandidates are paying more and more. Why? Because if you go to a \ntelevision station in Chicago, or in Springfield, IL, and say you want \nto buy a 30-second ad right before the newscast the night before the \nelection, they will say: Senator, great. We will be glad to sell you \nthat ad. Incidentally, if we only charge you the lowest unit rate, the \nbargain basement, sadly, if anybody comes and offers a dollar more for \nthat ad, we knock you off the air.\n  Well, there isn't a political candidate with any good sense that will \nagree to that. If you are going to be knocked off the air right before \nthe news and they put you on right before the Pledge of Allegiance and \nthe Star-Spangled Banner at the end of the night, you have lost \neverything. Your market doesn't have the benefit of all the good things \nyou have to say.\n  What candidates are doing is not paying the lowest unit charge, they \nare paying the inflated charges. The television stations have become a \nkilling field, because they have taken the law, which said we are going \nto favor candidates in public discourse of issues, and have turned it \nupside down so that candidates, frankly, end up paying dramatically \nmore than the lowest unit rate. The cost to the campaign skyrockets, \nand then candidates, incumbents and challengers alike, scramble, beg, \nand plead for people to give them money so they can give it right back \nto the television stations.\n  That is why the Torricelli amendment, of which I am a cosponsor, is \nso important. It addresses the demand side of political campaigns--not \njust the supply side, where the money comes from, but how the money is \nspent. Sadly, as we get closer to election day and the demand for their \nTV ads goes up, these stations raise their rates dramatically.\n  A gentleman by the name of Paul Taylor, who used to write for the \nWashington Post, created a group called Alliance for Better Campaigns. \nHe enlisted the support of a lot of great people, such as former \nPresident Ford; former President Carter; Walter Cronkite, the legendary \nCBS news commentator; and a former Senator from Illinois, Paul Simon.\n  This public interest group said let's take a look at television with \nregard to public information and whether it is doing its job. I was in \none of their meetings in Chicago. They brought in the managers of TV \nstations and said: We noticed you are not covering campaigns, unless \nthe candidates pay for it, on your stations. What Mr. Taylor did was to \ninvite the radio and TV stations to take a 5-minute segment during the \nlast week or two of the campaign and make it available for some public \ndebate and public discourse about the issues.\n  Sadly, after we take a look at the participation in it, very few \nstations got involved in Mr. Taylor's request.\n  Let me tell you some of the statistics they developed. The political \ncoverage of these stations shows the result of an analysis of political \nad costs in all top 75 media markets.\n  The alliance advocates scrapping the lowest unworkable lowest unit \ncharge and requiring the industry to open the airwaves. When they were \nasked to do it voluntarily, the stations did not comply.\n  These stations steer candidates toward premium rates. They pay the \nhighest amount. They are shut out of air time.\n  America is different in this regard. Many countries make this time \navailable to their candidates so they can have literally free access to \ntelevision and radio, but in America you have to pay for it. We do not \nprovide free air time. The cost, of course, is going through the roof.\n  Let me give an illustration of how bad it is using one market in \nwhich I have to buy advertising, and the market is in St. Louis. St. \nLouis is one of\n\n[[Page S2614]]\n\nthe toughest markets in which to buy advertising. There are some radio \nstations there which will only sell you four or five ads a week. They \nlimit you. You cannot buy any more.\n  Listen to what we found when we went to a major network affiliate in \nSt. Louis and compared some of the charges they made in the last \nelection cycle with what they charged just a few weeks later.\n  The cost of nonpreemptible time--in other words, you get a set time \nwhich is guaranteed--was four times higher than preemptible time. Take \nthe lowest unit charge which candidates are supposed to get, and then \nif you want to make sure you get the time you asked for, at this \nstation you are going to pay up to four times as much for that \nnonpreemptible time.\n\n  On the early morning weekday news shows, the rate that this station \ncharged after the political campaign was over went down 55 percent from \nthe political campaign time. During noon weekday news, the rate went \ndown 66 percent in the weeks after the election campaign.\n  The story goes on. Weekday evening news took 3.3 times the amount to \nbuy a nonpreemptible ad, and then as soon as the campaign was over, \nthey dropped the overall rate 38 percent. On week night news at 10 \no'clock in St. Louis, they dropped it 45 percent. On the Sunday a.m. \nnews talk shows, as soon as the campaign was over, advertising costs \nwent down 66 percent; the Sunday p.m. local news, 25 percent.\n  The television stations and the network affiliates are gaming the \nsystem. They understand that candidates are desperate for time. They \nunderstand that if they tell them it is preemptible, they will pay \nmore, and then as soon as the campaigns are over, we see these dramatic \ndecreases in the cost of this television time.\n  That is why it has become a killing field. They run up the rate cost \nfor the candidates, and they refuse to cover the campaigns. They have \nreally forgotten their civic responsibility that the airwaves belong to \nthe American people. As a consequence of that, we are seeing a \nphenomenon in American politics which we cannot ignore.\n  A lot of people are going to argue later about how much money we \nshould be able to raise. But keep in mind that if we are raising money \nto pay for electronic media--television--the cost of that media, \naccording to a media buyer I contacted, goes up 15 to 20 percent every \n2 years. So your campaign needs to raise 15 to 20 percent more funds to \ndo exactly the same thing you did on television 2 years ago. If you are \nrunning for the Senate, in a 6-year period of time you can see a 60-\npercent increase in your television cost.\n  Let me give an example in St. Louis again. A moderate television buy \nin St. Louis runs about $186 a point. A point is the way they measure \nthe audience. A 1,000-point buy for a week of spots--that is about 30 \nor 40 30-second ads a day--will cost you $186,000.\n  Under the current rules of raising money, I can ask a contributor to \ngive me up to $1,000. So in order to run advertising in one area that \nserves the State of Illinois, I have to get 186 people to give me \n$1,000. Obviously, when one considers the entire State of Illinois and \nthe campaign everyone is facing, one can see how the cost of these \ncampaigns is going through the roof.\n  A $200,000 media buy buys a few 30-second slivers of time to get \nideas and views out on the public airwaves. It takes just a moment to \npurchase it, and if a person gets up to get a sandwich in the kitchen, \nthey miss that 30-second ad. It requires asking 4,000 people to make a \n$50 campaign contribution.\n  Former Senator Bill Bradley said a few years ago:\n\n       Today's political campaigns function as collection agencies \n     for broadcasters. You simply transfer money from contributors \n     to television stations.\n\n  It is interesting to me that as we spend more and more money on \ntelevision in these campaigns, as we do our best to get our message \nout, our market--the voters of America--has responded by refusing to \nvote.\n  If you ran a company and said, ``We are not selling enough of our \nproduct, let's increase the marketing budget''; and after a quarter or \ntwo, you brought in the marketing department and said, ``How are you \ndoing?'' and they said, ``We have doubled the marketing budget''; you \nwent to the sales department and asked, ``How are you doing?'' and they \nsaid, ``Sales are down''--that is what is happening in political \ncampaigns. The marketing budget is increasing, but we are not making \nthe sales to the American people. They are not buying what we are \nselling.\n\n  Why? Because, frankly, the whole process has been tainted. It has \nbeen tainted by the expense, by the involvement of special interest \ngroups, and by the fact that so many candidates, myself included, spend \nso many waking hours trying to raise money to launch an effective \ncampaign such as in a State as large as the State of Illinois.\n  This amendment is an important step forward because here is what it \ndoes: This amendment says that we are going to eliminate class \ndistinctions for air time for candidates under the current statute. We \nare going to make time purchases nonpreemptible, we are going to allow \npolitical parties the benefit of the lowest unit charge, and we are \ngoing to require random audits in designated market areas to check \ncompliance.\n  We cannot say to the TV station how much it charges, but we can say \nthey cannot run their ad rates up right before an election, as so many \nstations have done, and then drop them precipitously as soon as the \nelection is over.\n  All of this money going to television stations from political \ncampaigns is, frankly, good for their business, but it is not good for \nAmerica. Let us remember our responsibility: to make sure the airwaves \nare used in a manner that serves all the people in this country, not \njust serving the needs to make a profit. Sadly, that is what has been \ndone too many times in the past.\n  I hope we will see an increase in voter participation, but I hope we \nwill also see an increase in interest in public issues by the networks \nand by the local stations. It is not enough for them to say that a few \ntimes, in what might not even be prime time before an election \ncampaign, they are going to make their station available so there can \nbe a debate among the candidates. It is not enough that they will give \nus the Sunday morning opportunities to talk on the shows. As good as \nthat is, that just does not make it in terms of selling products--they \nknow that--and in terms of convincing voters as to what we have at \nstake in these elections. I think it is time for these networks and \ntelevision stations to be part of campaign finance reform. The original \nversion of the McCain-Feingold bill included this reform, included \nefforts to address the television and radio costs which candidates face \nthat was taken out of the bill for reasons I don't know, but it should \nbe brought forth.\n\n  If we are going to have real campaign finance reform, then we \ndefinitely have to make sure we are getting candidates an opportunity \nto purchase time at affordable rates. Otherwise, we are going to find \nthe cost of campaigning continuing to skyrocket and the sources of \nmoney for candidates drying up as we cut off soft money, as we cut off \nother sources. I think this amendment is critically important.\n  When they asked these stations how much time they would give of their \nown time during the course of the campaign in a survey, it is \ninteresting what they found. A national study released by the \nUniversity of Southern California's Norman Lear Center, on February 5, \n2001, of 74 local stations, found that the typical local television \nstation spent less than 1 minute of air time a night on candidate \ndiscourse in the final month of the 2000 campaign--less than a minute.\n  The study found all but one local station failed to meet a voluntary \npublic industry standard that they air 5 minutes a night of candidate-\ncentered discourse in the 30 nights before the election. Stations in \nthe survey that indicated they would try to meet the standard, which \nwas just 7 percent of the Nation's 1,300 local stations, averaged 2 \nminutes and 17 seconds a night.\n  They are paying no attention whatever to elections and campaigns \nunless the candidates show up with money in hand and are prepared to \npay the outrageous charges that have been leveled against them in terms \nof these candidates.\n  National broadcast networks didn't do much better. They averaged 64 \nseconds a night per network of candidate discourse in the final month \nof the 2000 campaign.\n\n[[Page S2615]]\n\n  It is no surprise the broadcasting industry, which has profited so \nmuch from political campaign spending, also vigorously resists any \ncampaign finance reform which touches them. The media industry, since \n1996, has spent over $111 million lobbying Congress, partly to block \ncampaign finance reform bills that included any kind of discounted or \nfree candidate air time. The number of registered media-related \nlobbyists has increased from 234 in 1996 to 284 in 1999. The amount \nspent rose in 1999 to $31.4 million, up 26.4 percent from the 1996 \namount. This is big business. This is big profit. They have a lot at \nstake.\n  I hope at the end of this debate we will enact this amendment, an \namendment I have cosponsored with Senator Torricelli, Senator Corzine, \nand Senator Dorgan. If we do not address the real costs of campaigns, \nthe demand side of the ledger, we are not going to serve the need of \nreal campaign finance reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that a vote on the pending \namendment occur at the expiration of the period of time beginning with \n5 minutes of the remarks by the Senator from California, 5 minutes of \nremarks by the Senator from Nevada, and 7 minutes under the control of \nthe Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Kentucky for \nyielding.\n  I strongly support the amendment being offered today by Senators \nTorricelli, Corzine, Durbin, and Dorgan.\n  We learn best when involved in the middle of a situation. Anyone who \nruns for office from my State of California knows it is all about \ntelevision. In its wisdom, our founders said if you come from a State \nthat has 500,000 people, you get 2 Senators; you come from a State that \nhas 34 million people, like my State, you get 2 Senators. It is very \ndifficult in a large State to personally meet but a very small \npercentage of the people. So we must rely on television. That is the \nonly way.\n  What has happened, and the chart shows this, in California, the \nbroadcasters have taken tremendous advantage of this situation. To say \nthe costs are unreasonable is an understatement. They are confiscatory. \nThey are taking 80 percent or 90 percent of our budget after we pay our \noverhead. TV was so expensive in my last race I couldn't even afford to \nhave much radio. I didn't even have any left over for radio. I raised \n$20 million and huge sums went to television.\n  The facts are, when we approached the TV stations, we thought we were \nentitled to get the lowest rate because that is, in fact, the law. \nHowever, it is a little bit similar to airline seats. If you see \nairline seats advertised, they say we have a special fare from Los \nAngeles to New York; it is really cheap, $100. Call up and they say: \nSorry, those seats are sold. Therefore, you have to spend $1,000. It is \na little bit similar.\n  When we went to the broadcasters and asked to buy time and asked for \nthe lowest rate, which is required by law, they would say: Absolutely, \nwe will give you that rate. But be warned, if someone else comes along \nand wants to pay more, you cannot retain that spot.\n  Again, everyone knows if you are running for the Senate you need to \nreach people when they are up and about. Otherwise, it doesn't pay. If \nyou say, fine, bump me to another spot, you could be having your \ncommercial aired at 3 o'clock or 4 o'clock in the morning. Not that \nmany people will see it. So they have you in a very difficult \nsituation.\n  Los Angeles is the second most expensive media market. Senator \nTorricelli's chart shows basically the average 30-second spot is almost \n$35,000 in a good time slot. By the way, I once wanted to buy a couple \nof slots, and I was told it was $50,000, but let's just say about \n$35,000. Under the Torricelli amendment, it comes down 75 percent. That \nis a very big difference.\n  The fact is, this is a very good amendment. I am very much for the \nMcCain-Feingold bill. I will be opposed to amendments that I think are \nnot good amendments, are not meritorious amendments, and cannot be \ndefended and might make this veto bait. It would be hard to imagine \nthat George W. Bush could look at what the broadcasters are doing to \ncandidates, some of whom are struggling very hard to get the money they \nneed, and will take the side of the broadcasters who are laughing all \nthe way to the bank, nodding their head, saying: We really got them \nthis time.\n  I have good relationships with the communications industry in my \nState, good relations with the TV people, the radio people, but I have \nasked over and over again, how can they sleep at night knowing what the \npeople who own airwaves in this country get so people can find out what \ncandidates stand for. It is almost impossible unless you are \nindependently wealthy or just raise huge sums of money.\n  So to close this statement, I say again how strongly I support the \nunderlying bill and how much I respect Senators McCain and Feingold. I \nwill be voting against most amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for 20 more seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. In closing, which I would have done if I had the \nopportunity, I believe there are certain amendments that strengthen \nthis underlying bill. This is one of those amendments. It strengthens \nthe underlying bill. It makes it even better. It gets at a situation \nthat is out of control. I will be supporting this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, what we are talking about on this \namendment is something called the lowest unit rate. The spirit of the \nlaw that was passed was that candidates could have the lowest unit rate \ncharged to them by broadcasters so campaigns would be less expensive \nand candidates could get their message out to the masses.\n  The Senator from California just talked about how expensive it is in \nher State to advertise. I cannot even imagine, coming from a State like \nNevada with only 2 million people, what it is like in a State like \nCalifornia with 34 million people. But I can tell you, having been \nthrough 4 campaigns in the last 8 years, that advertising costs on \ntelevision have skyrocketed. The State of Nevada, during that same 8-\nyear period of time, grew by approximately 50 percent. It was the \nfastest growing State in the country. So you would expect television \ntime to go up by a significant amount--maybe by 70 percent or 80 \npercent, as it has in other parts of the country. But in Nevada, even \nthough we have only grown by 50 percent, our advertising rates have \ngone up by as much as 300 percent to 400 percent. That is at least 6 \ntimes faster than the rate the population has grown.\n  My first congressional campaign was the most expensive congressional \ncampaign ever in the State of Nevada. I spent around $700,000, and my \nopponent spent around $800,000. Now a typical congressional race in the \nState of Nevada will cost somewhere between $1.5 to $2 million. That is \na significant change of cost in just 8 years. And almost every dime of \nthat increase has come from the increase in the cost of television \nadvertising.\n  The broadcasters were just visiting me back here in Washington D.C. \nand we had a discussion about the lowest unit rate and what that means \nfor a congressional campaign. During my first campaign we bought time \nfor the most part on the lowest unit rate. But in the last couple of \ncampaigns, candidates have not been able to use the lowest unit rate \nbecause when you place an ad, that ad is probably going to be bumped by \na higher paying customer. There is so much competition for certain time \nslots on television that those commercials always get bumped, and what \nyou end up with is terrible placement and you do not get your message \nout to the people you are trying to reach.\n  My advisers in the last two campaigns have insisted we not buy the \nlowest unit rate because you cannot direct your message to the people \nto\n\n[[Page S2616]]\n\nwhom you want to direct it. So we are always forced to buy the most \nexpensive slot in order for our message to be effective. In addition, \nat the end of a campaign cycle, the broadcasters' rates skyrocket.\n  The broadcasters used to dread campaigns because that was the time of \nyear they made the least amount of money because of this lowest unit \nrate. Now it is one of their favorite times of the year because it is \nactually one of their highest profit margin times of year. This \ncertainly was not the intent of the legislation that brought about the \nlowest unit rate.\n  So I applaud the Senators who are bringing this amendment to the \nfloor. I add my support to this amendment.\n  Before I yield the floor I want to address one final issue. \nBroadcasters have the airwaves for free, and the justification for this \nis that they provide a very important public service to local \ncommunities by providing news and local politics.\n  I talked to the Nevada broadcasters about this last week. While I \nwould say in this election their coverage improved--and more of the \ncampaigns were covered during this time it was still pathetic.\n  When you consider how much time is spent on a sensational television \nstory, as compared to the time spent on a message or a story that \nactually affects the lives of the vast majority of people in our \nStates, I think you will agree that many of these local broadcasts \nacross the country spend a small percentage of their time actually \ndelivering important public service to the communities.\n  So I think it is the responsibility of the broadcasters to not only \naccept what we are trying to do with the lowest unit rate, and the \nspirit of the law of the lowest unit rate, but also we need to call on \nthe broadcasters to cover more of our politics, so that we get more \npeople involved in the political system.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 5 minutes of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask unanimous consent for another 20 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. To close on this, even though I believe the broadcasters \nhave made progress in my State, we need to keep the pressure on them \nbecause we are seeing such a low voter turnout. If we cannot get our \nmessage as candidates to the general public, we cannot get them \ninspired to come out and participate in elections.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am expecting a couple of Members who asked \nto come over and be heard.\n  Just to conclude, it is an encouraging sign we have heard nothing but \nstrong support for the amendment offered by our colleague from New \nJersey. I think the argument is quite clear. The facts have been laid \nout about as clearly as possible. There is clearly a loophole, to put \nit mildly--maybe something more serious occurs--when the lowest unit \nrate is not being recognized in major media market after major market \nall across this country, thus raising the cost of campaigns.\n  Part of the idea was, of course, to have the lowest unit rate so \npeople's voices could be heard during election season to hopefully \nenlighten and educate the public about the choices they would make. I \ndo not want to say that is necessarily what occurs in every 30-second \nor 1-minute ad that the public is subjected to, but nevertheless the \nidea is the unit cost would be the lowest rate so the cost of campaigns \nwould not get out of hand, which obviously what has occurred in the \nlast few years.\n  The charts Senator Corzine used, and Senator Torricelli, showed the \nexponential growth in the cost of campaigns. While there are a lot of \nreasons that has occurred, there is no reason any more clear than the \nrising cost of television advertising.\n  I note the arrival of my colleague and friend from New York who would \nlike to be heard on this issue as well. I commend her for her support \nof this as well and thank the authors of this amendment. This is really \nan important piece of this bill.\n  If we are going to try to keep down costs, keep down the rising costs \nof campaigns, we have to address this issue. The Senator from New \nJersey has done that with this amendment.\n  I am happy to yield 3 or 4 minutes to my colleague from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Connecticut. \nI also thank Senators Torricelli and Corzine for bringing this \nimportant issue to the forefront of this debate because clearly we are \nnot going to be able to have the kind of campaign finance reform that \nmany of us are hoping will come out of this process if we do not \naddress the most expensive aspect of modern-day campaigns.\n  As we all know, that is the advertising that we have to do in order \nto communicate with voters about where we stand on issues. It is a \nparticular challenge in large States. But it is a national one that all \nof my colleagues face.\n\n  The Torricelli amendment, which would amend the Communications Act of \n1934, would require that the lowest unit rate be provided to committees \nof political parties or candidates purchasing time. I think that is in \nthe best interest of our democracy. I certainly believe it is the kind \nof reform that goes to the real heart of what the money chase is all \nabout.\n  I think a lot of us would like to be able to turn the clock back to \nthe days that some of our colleagues can remember, but for most of us, \nwe just read about it, where you could literally go out into a town \nsquare or out in the countryside, set up a little platform, visit with \nconstituents, make a speech, keep on going, and reach most of the \npeople who were going to vote for you or make a decision on an \nimportant issue. Those days are long gone. The television broadcast \nnetworks know they are the means by which we must communicate.\n  I think this amendment is not only fair but long overdue. I commend \nthe Senator from New Jersey for bringing it to the floor. I hope the \ntelevision industry recognizes that there is an effort to not just have \na level playing field but fulfill what many of us thought was the \nbargain; that when we use the public airwaves for communications--and \nthose communications are basically controlled by the companies that \nhave been given, in my opinion, the privilege of having those \nairwaves--that there has to be some way they give back to keep the \nfirst amendment alive, to keep democracy going. I am just so pleased \nthat we are going to have a chance to vote on it.\n  I thank my good friend from Connecticut for yielding some time so \nthat I could weigh in on the importance of this issue.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, there was one other Member who wanted to be \nheard. He is not here. I am going to yield back the time, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if the Senator will withhold for just a \nmoment, we wondered if Senator Burns wanted to speak. He may be walking \nthrough the door momentarily.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator from Connecticut has any time\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Are we waiting for another speaker?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senate has been waiting for a minute. Why not ask \nunanimous consent to speak for a minute or two.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I appreciate the usual courtesy of my good friend from \nKentucky.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from New Jersey, and \nthe managers of the bill who I understand are supporting the amendment. \nI think it takes an important step towards reducing the money chase and \nleveling the playing field.\n\n[[Page S2617]]\n\n  First, the money chase will be reduced somewhat because so much of \nthe money which has been raised goes into television. The more \nreasonable these ads are and the closer they come to the lowest rate, \nwhich is supposed to be provided for anyway under existing law, the \nless demand there will be for money in order to get a minimum message \non television.\n  I think it does some real good in terms of reducing the case for huge \namounts of money for campaigns.\n  Second, it attempts to level the playing field a bit because the less \nfunded candidates will have a greater opportunity, as the television \nrates are less, to have at least a minimum message on television that \nthey are able to fund.\n  I think leveling the playing field is also something we are trying to \ndo in the legislation before us.\n  The existing law and spirit of the law provide that the lowest unit \ncharge of the station is supposed to be provided in the 60 days \npreceding the date of the general election and 45 days preceding the \nprimary.\n  This amendment just carries out what is clearly the spirit, purpose, \nand intent of the existing law, and again I commend the Senator from \nNew Jersey for bringing this forward and for those who have indicated \ntheir support for it, including, I understand, both Senators McCain and \nFeingold.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senator from Oklahoma wishes to \nspeak for a couple of minutes. We expect him to walk in the door \nmomentarily. At the end of his 2 minutes, it is our intention at that \npoint to go to a vote.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, may I ask unanimous consent to \nsupplement my earlier remarks?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I didn't realize it until after I spoke, but my good \nfriend, Senator Torricelli from New Jersey, gave me one of the articles \nhe read into the Record that I have yet a new title; that is, ``Modern \nDay Santa Claus.''\n  I was given an article that was written by Paul Taylor about \nbroadcasters and their desire to have political advertising.\n  I was delighted to learn that I am a beautiful thing like Santa Claus \nbecause the campaign I ran brought, I guess, great beauty and good \ncheer to the broadcasters of my State.\n  I would like to add to my previous comments in support of this \namendment that I think this is a good start to ensure that the spirit \nof the current law is enacted and implemented. But I think we should go \nfurther. And later in the debate I hope we will have a chance to talk \nabout even going further, to perhaps legislate the 5 minutes that has \nbeen suggested by a number of people as being free air time, and even \nto have a debate on an issue I support, which is free broadcast time \nacross the board and some way to fulfill the political obligations of \ncommunications that I think our society so desperately needs without \nhaving the charges attached to it that we currently are experiencing.\n  I know in 1997 when the FCC doubled the amount of the spectrum it \nlicensed to television broadcasters, I joined with many others in \nrecommending that 5-minute, voluntary, candidate-centered discourse \nduring the 30 days leading up to the campaign. We know that is not \nhappening.\n  I think we need to do more to provide free air time for political \ncandidates. I hope we will not only pass this amendment but go on to \nconsider other ways we can make air time more readily available. If it \nwere in my power, as Santa Claus, to give that gift to the American \npeople, I would certainly do it. But I am going to try to make that \ncase in addition to supporting this very worthy amendment.\n  I thank the Senator from Kentucky for yielding me time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the distinguished \nassistant majority leader have 5 minutes prior to the vote.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. If the Senator would yield, could I have 1 minute, \nthen, before the vote, just to close on my amendment?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Sure. Then the vote will occur 6 minutes from now, and \nwill be followed by an amendment by the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. \nWellstone.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Thank you very much. I thank my colleagues for their \ncooperation. I understand my colleagues are ready to vote and that they \nhave held the vote off so I could make a few comments. I appreciate \nthat.\n  I am going to speak against this amendment. I heard everybody say \nthey are for it, so I am sure this amendment will be adopted. But my \nguess is, this amendment should be classified as ``the million-dollar \ngift to Senators'' and maybe for Senate candidates.\n  This is a big gift. This is a gift. In reading the language it says:\n\n       . . . to such office shall not exceed the lowest charge of \n     the station (at any time during the 365-day period preceding \n     the date of the use) for the same amount of time for the same \n     period.\n\n  What that means is, we get to buy ads at the lowest rate that the \nstation charged anybody anytime during the past year.\n  These are political ads. Some stations may have lower rates because \nthey want to do something to help a charity. Maybe they want to be kind \nto a university and raise money, and there is a fundraising drive, such \nas the University of Kentucky. So they want to have a fundraising \ndrive, and the station says, this is a low time of the year, so, yes, \nwe will give you good rates. And maybe this is in April or maybe it is \nin January when time is pretty cheap because the demand is not very \nlarge.\n  What we are saying is, we want to have that rate for politicians in \nOctober and early November, when maybe the demand is very great. The \nrates might be four times as much, three times as much. You have the \nnew shows on TV.\n\n  I look at this, and maybe it sounds kind of nice. Somebody says this \nis really enforcing what the existing language is. I say hogwash. This \namendment is worth millions, and everybody should know it. This \namendment is worth millions to candidates.\n  I question the wisdom of doing it, saying we should have lower rates \nthan anybody else in the country. And, oh, incidentally, Mr. \nBroadcaster, we politicians want to check your rates for that entire \nyear, and we get the lowest of anybody. Of anybody, anytime, we get the \nlowest. We are special. I question the wisdom of it. I am going to \nsupport some amendments to help this bill. I do not doubt that this \namendment is going to be adopted, but I certainly question the wisdom \nof it.\n  Some people said: Let's just have free time. This is a gift. This may \nnot be free time, but this is a gift that may be greater than free \ntime.\n  Some people say: Maybe we should have free time for candidates of so \nmany minutes or so many hours, and so on. This is an amendment worth a \nlot more than that. So our colleagues should know that. Because rates \nvary significantly throughout the year, and we are saying you get the \nlowest rates.\n  I guess if a person is going to buy a rate in August, that is one \nthing; so we check the last 365 days, and then if you are going to buy \nan ad in October, we have to check the last 365 days to see if there is \na lower rate.\n  I think this amendment is very well intended. But, in my opinion, \nthis amendment should not be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, what is the time circumstance?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute remaining for the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield the Senator from Alaska whatever time I have \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I rise to agree with the Senator from Oklahoma. This \namendment in my State is going to be catastrophic. We have many small \nstations that survive on mass marketing throughout the year at low \nrates. This will mean they will have to provide those of us who are \ncandidates with the same rates. It makes no sense to me at all. I think \nit is an invasion of the\n\n[[Page S2618]]\n\nrights of the people who operate these small independent stations.\n  I agree with what the Senator from Oklahoma said. It is a benefit to \ncandidates. If people are meaning to kill this bill, this is one way to \ndo it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to support the \namendment offered by Senators Torricelli, Corzine, and Durbin. I \nbelieve that allowing candidates the opportunity to let their message \nbe known to the public, through television ads, without having to raise \nan obscene amount of money to finance those advertisements is a needed \nstep toward truly reforming our campaign finance system. During the \n2000 election broadcasters' advertising prices soared precisely when \nairtime was most valuable to candidates. Due to this dramatic increase \nin prices the broadcasters earned record profits from political \nadvertising.\n  David Broder of the Washington Post articulated the need for TV \nadvertising price relief. He writes, ``Common sense tells you that if \nthe TV bill remains . . . exorbitant, politicians will continue the \n`money chase' under any rules that are in place.'' The rules to which \nMr. Border refers are the rules drafted in the campaign finance reform \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n1 minute.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, the Senate is now moving beyond a \nsimple soft money ban to genuine campaign finance reform, ensuring that \nas we reduce the amount of money in the political system, we are not \nreducing the amount of political debate in the Nation.\n  There is nothing new or startling about this amendment. Under current \nlaw, the broadcast industry must provide the lowest unit rate for \npolitical broadcasting. The problem is, they have been evading their \nresponsibility. Stations now will have to participate in a shared \nsacrifice. Candidates will not raise certain forms of money that are \nundermining political confidence, and the broadcast industry must meet \nits public responsibility to provide low-cost broadcasting.\n  I believe this is a critical component to comprehensive campaign \nfinance reform. It allows many of us to be part of McCain-Feingold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I believe it is a proper addition.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second.\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor just 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, \npeople keep coming and getting more time. That is fine. But I think we \nneed to reserve another matching minute because now the opponents are \ncoming to the floor laying out their arguments. People are coming to \nthe floor. So if Senator Burns is speaking against this amendment, I \nask unanimous consent that I have 30 seconds to respond to his \ncomments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I object. I am on the same side as the \nSenator from California on this issue. It seems to me the Senator from \nMontana is not unreasonable to ask for a minute to explain his \nposition, after which the regular order would occur.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for a minute for \nSenator Burns and a minute for Senator Boxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my friend, the assistant leader.\n  I have been tied up in a committee all morning trying to get over \nhere. We have had some pressing energy business. But I wish to make one \npoint.\n  How many other industries are we asking to lower their rates on the \nservices they perform for the sake of political activity? Are we asking \nthe automobile companies? The gasoline companies? The newspapers? The \ndirect mailers? The writers? Are we asking them to lower their rates on \ntheir inventory for the sake of political activity? I think not.\n  And the broadcasters, once their time is gone, it is gone forever; \nand they cannot recover it. I don't think we have a right to ask them \nto do that, especially incumbents, as we are here, who have access to \nthe news every night.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from California is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we are not asking anyone to lower their \nrates. That is a misstatement of the amendment. The Torricelli \namendment simply says current law should be followed. Current law says \nthe lowest rate should apply. May I remind my friends, the airwaves are \nowned by the American people. People get a license. The airwaves should \nbe open to the American people.\n  In California, they give us 10 percent at the lowest rate, and 90 \npercent of it is at the highest rate. You cannot get your message out.\n  This amendment is a clarification of existing law. It strengthens \nMcCain-Feingold. If you vote against this, it is just a signal to the \nbroadcasters to keep on ripping us off and all the money will go to TV.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Torricelli amendment No. 122. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 70, nays 30, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 41 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--70\n\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bunning\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Shelby\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Thompson\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--30\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Craig\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Sessions\n     Smith (NH)\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n  The amendment (No. 122) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to reconsider the vote by which the amendment was \nagreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n\n[[Page S2619]]\n\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 123\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I call up amendment numbered 123.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], for himself and \n     Ms. Cantwell, proposes an amendment numbered 123.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To allow a State to enact voluntary public financing \nlegislation regarding the election of Federal candidates in such State)\n\n       On page 37, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 305. STATE PROVIDED VOLUNTARY PUBLIC FINANCING.\n\n       Section 403 of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 \n     U.S.C. 453) is amended by adding at the end the following: \n     ``The preceding sentence shall not be interpreted to prohibit \n     a State from enacting a voluntary public financing system \n     which applies to a candidate for election to Federal office, \n     other than the office of President or Vice-President, from \n     such State who agrees to limit acceptance of contributions, \n     use of personal funds, and the making of expenditures in \n     connection with the election in exchange for full or partial \n     public financing from a State fund with respect to the \n     election, except that such system shall not allow any person \n     to take any action in violation of the provisions of this \n     Act.''.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my understanding is Senator Clinton \nwill be coming to the floor in a moment.\n  Mr. DODD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator from New \nYork be recognized for 5 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask my colleague if we may extend that to 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from New York is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Wellstone pertaining \nto the introduction of S. 584 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, before we go to the Senator from Idaho, \nI ask unanimous consent that in addition to Senator Cantwell as \noriginal cosponsor of my amendment, also Senator Corzine and Senator \nBiden be included as original cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Crapo are located in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will reserve for myself just a little \nbit of time now because there will be other Senators who will want to \nspeak on this subject. This is an amendment to the McCain-Feingold \nbill, a very important piece of legislation in and of itself, which I \nthink is a very important step forward for all of us. I hope this \namendment will have bipartisan support. I think it just adds to the \nMcCain-Feingold bill.\n  This amendment simply allows States, any of our States, to set up \nvoluntary systems of full or partial public financing for Federal \ncongressional candidates that involve voluntary spending limits on both \npersonal and outside contributions, as long as these systems are not in \nconflict with the Federal Election Campaign Act. So this simply allows \nStates, if they want, to set up a voluntary system of partial public \nfinancing.\n  This is entirely a voluntary system, and we leave it up to our State.\n  Historically, the States have been a ``laboratory of reform''--the \nterm was coined by Supreme Court Justice William Brandeis--where \ninnovative policies have been created.\n  This States rights amendment allows these laboratories to do their \nwork in a safe way--I want Senators to listen to this--because the \nelectoral regulation that Congress has written into Federal law remains \nthe floor. That is the law.\n  In other words, while States will be given wide latitude to set up \nvoluntary systems of public financing, they will not be able to enact \nlaws that will allow candidates, whether covered by public financing or \nnot, to engage in conduct that will otherwise be in violation of \nFederal election laws.\n  While the Federal law is the floor, I think it is a low floor, \nindeed, although McCain-Feingold makes it better. Many believe our \nsystem is awash in special interest money. I agree with them. It is not \na matter of individual corruption. I almost wish it was. It goes way \nbeyond I don't wish it was, but I think it is a more serious problem.\n  I don't think we are talking about the wrongdoing of individual \nofficeholders. But we are talking about a huge imbalance of power where \nsome people, by virtue of their economic resources, have way too much \nwealth access and too many people are left out.\n  Please remember that 80 percent of the money spent in the year 2000 \nwas hard money. Please remember as these campaigns--we just had an \namendment that was an effort to deal with part of the problem--become \nmore capital intensive, more television expensive, as communication \ntechnology becomes the main weapon in every electoral conflict, the big \nmoney matters even more.\n  This amendment says: Look, if our States want to--we leave it up to \nthem--set up a voluntary system of partial or public financing to apply \nto our races, they should be able to do so.\n  This debate in the Senate about big money and politics and the ways \nin which too often our elections have become auctions and the ways in \nwhich all too often Senators have to be concerned about cash \nconstituencies as well as real constituencies couldn't have come at a \nmore perfect time.\n  Let me give a few examples. Several weeks ago we had an effort that \ntook 10 hours to overturn 10 years of work. The National Academy of \nSciences said repetitive stress injury is the most serious injury in \nthe workplace. It endorsed taking action, did the research, did the \nstudy, endorsed a standard that was promulgated by OSHA, but big \nbusiness said jump. So we jumped, and we turned our back on reasonable \nstandards. We turned our back on science, and we turned our back on a \nlot of workers and their pain. We made them expendable.\n  Then we had the bankruptcy bill. I gave enough speeches about the \nbankruptcy bill to deafen all the gods. I will not repeat any of it, \njust to say ultimately what we got with this bill was a wish list for \nthe credit card industry which is not held accountable at all for their \nreckless and sometimes predatory lending practices but very harsh for a \nwhole lot of people who find themselves having to declare bankruptcy--\nnot because they are trying to game any system but because of a major \nmedical bill, because they have lost their job, or because there has \nbeen a divorce in the family.\n  Then we have the news today that the arsenic standard that EPA had \npromulgated to make sure we had safe drinking water has been overturned \nby the Administrator of EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  Then we have a tax cut--I am not going to spend a lot of time on \nthis. It will be in the budget debate in about 2 weeks. If I am proven \nwrong, I will be glad to be proven wrong. I believe my colleagues will \nfind that ultimately a rigorous sort of measurement, if you will, of \nwhat the surplus really is--and then alongside of that what the tax cut \nreally amounts to--will mean two or three things.\n  It will mean there won't be a dime for any of the investments to \nwhich we say we are committed. There are going to be some harsh \ndiscretionary domestic spending cuts. What that means is anything from \nenergy assistance, to housing, to programs that try crimes against \nwomen who have been battered--you name it. In addition, you have tax \ncuts that represent a Robin-\n\n[[Page S2620]]\n\nHood-in-reverse philosophy so that over 40 percent of the benefits go \nto the top 1 percent.\n  What I said before I will say again. The President talks about \nleaving no child behind. One-third of all the children in America live \nin families who will not receive one dime from this tax cut, and 50 \npercent of African Americans live in families who will not receive one \ndime, and 57 percent of Hispanic children live in families who will not \nreceive one dime, but over 40 percent goes to the top 1 percent of the \npopulation.\n  So forget any commitment to making sure that every child in America \nhas a good education. The vast majority of people believe in that goal. \nForget any commitment to making sure that elderly people--I argue there \nare a lot of families as well who are hurt by this--can afford the \nprescription drugs they need for their health. And forget any \ncommitment to expanding health care coverage for the 43 or 44 million \npeople who have no coverage at all. For that matter, forget any \ncommitment to beginning to get serious about home health care so that a \nlot of elderly people aren't institutionalized, aren't forced into \nnursing homes but can still live in home in as near normal \ncircumstances as possible with dignity, or people with disabilities.\n  From where is the money going to come?\n  How about the veterans? I will tell you about the veterans budget. \nThere is a $1 billion increase, but $900 million of it is medical \ninflation.\n  Then we have all of these commitments which we say we are going to \nmake for the millennium program--elderly, home-based care, in addition \nto mental health services; in addition a bill I have with Evan Bayh to \nfinally deal with the distress about the fact that 30 percent of the \nadults in the homeless population are veterans--many of them Vietnam \nveterans--and we need to reach out and help them. I tell you, I don't \nthink any of this is by accident because for the sake of the top 1 \npercent of the population making sure they get the tax cuts--by the \nway, these are the same people who are the heavy hitters. They are the \nbig givers who give the contributions, whether it is soft money or hard \nmoney.\n  We are at the same time not going to live up to our commitment of \nleaving no child behind. We are not, if this administration has its \nway, going to do much about prescription drug costs, or expanding \nhealth care coverage, or making sure there is a good education for \nevery child. Obviously, we have an all-out assault on basic workplace \nprotections and environmental protections.\n  I think a lot of people in Minnesota and a lot of people in the \ncountry have reached the conclusion that the Congressional agenda is \nnot their agenda; that the Congressional agenda is the agenda of the \npowerful; that the Congressional agenda is the agenda of the heavy \nhitters; and that the Congressional agenda is the agenda of the \ninvestors in both political parties.\n  For so many people, when it comes to their concerns for themselves, \ntheir families, and their communities, their concerns are of little \nconcern in the corridors of power in this Congress.\n  Who could fault them for this belief? Many people believe there is a \nconnection between big special interest money and the outcomes in \nAmerican politics.\n  People believe what is on the table and what is off the table is \nbased upon who has the money and power. People believe who gets to run \nand who does not get to run and who wins and who loses is quite often \ndetermined by the mix of money in politics. People believe that some \npeople march on Washington every day, and they have the lobbyists, and \nthey have the lobbying coalitions, but that when it comes to their \nconcerns, they are not well represented. People believe that if you \npay, you play, and if you don't pay, you don't play.\n  So people have lost faith in this system. I do not know what I think \nis worse: That so many citizens have this disillusionment and \ndisengagement toward Government and public affairs. I hate that. I \nstate that as the son of a Jewish immigrant born in the Ukraine who \nfled persecution in Russia. I love this country. I hate it when people \nfeel that way about public affairs. Sometimes I think it is even worse \nwhen I talk to people who are so excited about public affairs, and they \ntell me they will never run for office. They say they do not want to \nspend all their time raising the money. They cannot bear the thought of \nit.\n  Frankly, I think it gets to the point where we have this horrible \nself-selection process where a lot of the very best people never will \nrun for office, for a Senate seat or a House seat. I think that is a \ntragedy for the country.\n  I know the sponsors of the new McCain-Feingold bill hope this bill \nwill have the votes to pass. I hope it does. But this bill is scaled \ndown. It is a step toward comprehensive reform, but I do think this is \nan ideal time to let States take the lead. While we should not allow \nStates to undermine Federal election law, the law should not be an \nartificial ceiling that prevents States from setting up systems of \npublic financing that allow them to address this money chase, to \naddress voter apathy, to address corruption, actual and perceived.\n  Mr. President, by way of background to this amendment, my own State \nof Minnesota attempted to set up a public financing system for Federal \ncandidates 9 years ago, when the State legislature passed a law \noffering partial public financing to candidates for Congress from \nMinnesota.\n  Unfortunately, the Federal Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit \nstruck down Minnesota's law in 1993 in Weber v. Heaney. The court ruled \nthat because the Federal Election Campaign Act, FECA, did not \nspecifically allow States to create this kind of voluntary public \nfinancing program, then FECA prohibited it. I think what the court was \nsaying was: If you want to do it, fine, but we want to see the \nauthority.\n  The amendment I am offering would correct that by adding one simple \nsentence to FECA which specifically allows States to set up voluntary \npublic financing programs for the election of their own Members of the \nSenate and House, as long as no such program violates any provision of \nthe current FECA law. That is all this amendment does.\n  In other words, if a State--Minnesota, Montana, Connecticut; I will \ntalk about States that have already done this --wants to create a \npublic financing fund and give its congressional candidates the \noption--a voluntary option; it is not required--of financing their \ncampaigns partially or wholly with public money rather than private \ncontributions, that State will be able to do so--again, provided there \nis no violation of any of the current FECA provisions.\n  I want to stress to colleagues, because I do not want there to be any \nmisinformation about this amendment, that these programs must be \nstrictly voluntary, just as the public financing for Presidential \nelections is voluntary. Candidates who would rather finance their \ncampaigns with private dollars, adhering to the existing campaign \nfinance rules, would be free to do so. However, the courts have made it \nclear, in some cases, by upholding the very public financing systems \nfor election of State officeholders, which are models for this \nlegislation, that a State may offer public financing or other \nenticements to make contribution limits and spending limits attractive.\n\n  This amendment, giving States the option of creating their own \nvoluntary alternatives to the current system, is perfectly \nconstitutional.\n  Some States have already moved in this direction. Twelve States \nalready offer partial public financing to candidates for State offices. \nIn fact, one of the most advanced of these programs is in my colleague, \nSenator McConnell's own State of Kentucky. In Kentucky, there is a \nsystem of partial public financing for gubernatorial candidates.\n  In my own State of Minnesota, there is a voluntary public financing \nsystem for statewide candidates as well as candidates for the \nlegislature. Candidates agree--it is voluntary--to spending limits, and \nin return they receive public funds.\n  The State of Minnesota provides a tax credit for contributions to \nState candidates of up to $50.\n  In addition, four States have gone even further and have recently \npassed full or nearly full public financing systems for their \nelections--it is inspiring--in Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, and in \nSenator McCain's own\n\n[[Page S2621]]\n\nState of Arizona. They have passed legislation similar to the Clean \nMoney, Clean Elections Act.\n  Senator Kerry and I have introduced this as national legislation. \nEventually, I would like to get there. Basically, that is what they are \nsaying in these States to the citizens. And the citizens said: Yes, \nlet's do it.\n  I want to talk about these inspiring examples. They have said: \nListen, if each citizen will contribute a small amount into a clean \nmoney, clean election fund--maybe $5--and then candidates draw from \nthat fund--candidates who have passed a threshold to show that they are \nviable candidates--then these candidates do not have to be involved in \nthe money chase. They do not have to be dependent on these private \ndollars. You, the people of Maine, you, the people of Vermont, you, the \npeople of Arizona, you, the people of Massachusetts, you own the \nelections. You own your own State government. You own the political \nprocess.\n  In Maine it is just incredible. There was broad participation in the \nClean Elections program during this last election, with 116 out of 352 \ngeneral election candidates--both Republicans and Democrats--\nparticipating.\n  What these clean money, clean election States have done is \ndramatically reduced the influence of special interest money by \nproviding a level playing field, by offering candidates a limited and \nequal amount of public funds.\n  I am saying to colleagues today, at the very minimum, we ought to \nallow our States to move forward with these voluntary systems if they \nwant to do so. That is the only proposition you vote on. Will you or \nwill you not at least be willing to allow your States to provide for a \nsystem of voluntary full or partial public financing for our races, \nunderstanding full well that everything else about Federal election law \nstays as is.\n  I want to offer some comments about Maine, giving some indication of \nwhat happened in Maine, because I think it inspires a lot of hope. \nThese comments tell us something about what they have done and why it \nis so important to allow States to do so.\n\n  Here are some of the comments of people who ran.\n  Shlomit Auciello, a Democrat challenger:\n\n       Without Clean Elections, I couldn't even think about \n     running for office. I just couldn't afford it.\n\n  Chester Chapman, a Republican challenger:\n\n       The main reason I did it was that this is what people want.\n\n  Glenn Cummings, a Democrat challenger:\n\n       I spent a lot of kitchen table time explaining the system \n     to people. Once they knew what it was they really liked it. \n     They liked that it means no soft money and no PAC money will \n     be used. I want to work for the people of Maine and I don't \n     want to be beholden to anyone else.\n\n  Gabrielle Carbonear:\n\n       It will definitely change some things. For one thing I will \n     have about half the amount of money I raised last time but \n     much more time to talk with people which is a good thing.\n\n  Just one more:\n\n       We have an obligation to put into practice the system that \n     was approved by voters in 1996. Maine is in the lead in this \n     area. It will only work if it is used, and it is important \n     for incumbents to embrace it. Also, the Clean Election Act is \n     making it easier to recruit candidates to run for office.\n\n  That was said by Rick Bennet, Republican incumbent, assistant senate \nminority leader, and candidate for reelection.\n  I simply say to my colleagues, I am all for McCain-Feingold, as long \nas it does not get too weakened. I think the amendment we just \nadopted--the Torricelli amendment--was a step in the right direction. \nBut, honest to goodness, 80 percent of the money is hard money. You \nstill have this huge problem of the system being so wired for \nincumbents. It is so hard for challengers to raise the money and for \nthere to be a level playing field. I can remember what happened when I \nran in 1990; I can remember in 1996. I am now in a reelection.\n\n  At a very minimum, there ought to be a vote on public financing in \nthe Senate, but this amendment doesn't say we vote on public financing \ndirectly. We don't vote on this at the Federal level, and we don't \nreally vote on it saying that Montana or Minnesota has to do it. Given \nthe experience of some of the States, such as Maine, Vermont, \nMassachusetts, Arizona, and other States that have moved forward, let \nus at least allow States, on a voluntary basis, to have a system of \npartial public financing that they could apply to Federal races.\n  If they want us to have the opportunity to volunteer to be involved \nin clean money and clean elections as opposed to all this big \ninterested money that will continue to dominate the process, even with \nMcCain-Feingold passing--there is still so much of that money; we are \nstill so awash in that money--at the very minimum we ought to allow \nStates to light a candle and lead the way.\n  I know there are other Senators who are going to be coming to the \nfloor. I can speak a much longer time about this and will, but if my \ncolleague from Connecticut is going to speak, I will yield the floor \nfor now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Minnesota. I commend \nhim for this amendment.\n  This is a very creative amendment because it doesn't go to the heart \nof what many of us have felt for a long time, and that is that as we \nhave done with Presidential elections--I don't know if my colleague \nfrom Minnesota spent time on this point--we have had public financing \nof Presidential races. Ronald Reagan, George Bush, this President Bush, \nand President Clinton have all used public moneys in Presidential \nelections going back to the late 1970s. I believe President Reagan was \nthe first--maybe President Carter was the one--to use public moneys and \npublic financing of a Presidential election.\n  All would agree that as a result of that, the costs of Presidential \nelections, while they are expensive, have been reduced by having a \npublic financing scheme where, as a result of accepting public dollars, \ncandidates agree to certain caps, certain limitations on how much money \nwill be spent by a Presidential candidate.\n  This country is not without precedent in dealing with public \nfinancing. My colleague has talked about some of the States that have \ndone things. We have done it at the national level and with some \nsuccess. This amendment doesn't call for Federal public financing, as I \nunderstand it. It merely says to the States, if they would like to \nestablish a public financing mechanism for candidates running for the \nHouse of Representatives or the Senate, the two Federal offices for \nwhich there are elections in each State, then the States would be \nallowed to construct such a mechanism that then-candidates who would \nagree to accept public moneys in those States would also accept certain \nlimitations, principally financial ones, as one way of trying to get a \nbetter handle on this ever spiraling cost of campaigns.\n\n  I don't have the charts with me that some of our other colleagues \nhave used which point to the exponential increase in the cost of \nrunning for Federal office. There is not a person in this Chamber who \nholds a seat who can't bear witness to that fact. We wouldn't be here \nif we hadn't gone through the excruciating gauntlet of having to raise \nthe money and spend the dollars in order to be on television and run \nall the various elements of a successful campaign. We are all familiar, \nevery one of us, with how vastly these campaigns have increased in \ncost.\n  I have often cited the statistic that when I first ran for Congress, \nsome 24 years ago, Ella Grasso was running for Governor of the State of \nConnecticut, the first woman to be elected in her own right as a \nGovernor in the United States. Ella Grasso spent about $500,000, an \nunprecedented amount of money, in the State of Connecticut to win a \nstatewide race. I think she even bought New York television time, which \nalways adds considerably to the cost of a campaign in Connecticut. And \n$500,000 was an outrageous sum of money 24 years ago.\n  My colleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, and I--I can't \nrecall the exact amount, but I will pretty much be in the ballpark to \ntell the Senate that a contested race in Connecticut is now somewhere \nbetween $4 and $6 million. I promise you, if you went back 24 years, \nprior to 1974, you would have found an increase in the cost of \ncampaigns but nothing like we\n\n[[Page S2622]]\n\nhave seen in the last 25 years, with no indication this trend line is \ngoing anywhere but up in the coming years.\n  The issue before us is whether or not we can come up with some \nmechanism which reduces the money chase, brings down the cost of these \ncampaigns, which is what the Torricelli amendment tries to do by \ninsisting the lowest unit rate be charged for campaign costs for \nadvertising, and now what our colleague from Minnesota has proposed--\nthat is, the creative idea of saying to the 50 States that if you \ndecide you would like to have this kind of a mechanism for your \ncandidates for Federal office, we should not necessarily stand in the \nway.\n  If this were a mandate, then I think it would run into immediate \nconstitutional problems. There may be some with this anyway. I know \nStates in the past have tried to pass legislation which would put \nlimitations on us, such as term limits. In every one of those cases, \nthe courts have overruled State statutes which would limit the ability \nof people to serve here. We ourselves could put limitations in the \nConstitution on our service, but States don't have the right, according \nto the Supreme Court or the Federal courts, to do that.\n  I do not think this amendment falls into that category. This is not \nsome limitation on a Member's right to run or to serve. It merely \noffers the option of a different mechanism for financing the campaign. \nWhile I am not a constitutional scholar, I am sure there will be those \nwho make the case that this may suffer from a constitutional flaw. I am \nsure there will be others who will argue that this does not.\n  In my view, because this does go in a direction that contributes \nsignificantly to the underlying bill Senator McCain and Senator \nFeingold have submitted to us, it is worthy of support.\n  I commend my colleague from Minnesota for offering this creative \nidea. We are constantly hearing from our colleagues how we need to give \nour States more flexibility. It is a call we hear quite frequently in \none piece of legislation after another. My colleague from Minnesota and \nI serve on the Education Committee of the Senate. We have just spent a \nnumber of days--marking up, as we call it--writing up the education \nbill for elementary and secondary education.\n\n  One of the important debates was how much flexibility we would give \nour local communities and our States in using Federal dollars. It is a \nworthy debate because most of us embrace the idea that local \ncommunities ought to have a great deal of latitude in deciding how the \neducation system ought to work in those communities.\n  I will be interested to know if those who are most vociferous in \narguing for greater flexibility at the State level in the education of \nour children would not similarly be inclined to support this amendment \nwhich would offer greater flexibility to our States that may decide \nthat the cost of campaigns in their States has gotten out of control; \nthat they would like to do something about it; that they would like to \noffer Federal candidates an option that would reduce those costs.\n  I am attracted to this amendment. I think it has value. I urge my \ncolleagues to read it carefully, to raise questions to my colleague \nfrom Minnesota, if they have them, and then vote for this amendment. I \nthink it deserves our support. I know others will come to the floor to \naddress this matter. I don't know if my colleague care to take a few \nmore minutes or not. I am prepared to stay with him and engage in some \ndebate. If not, we could suggest the absence of a quorum and urge \nMembers to come to the floor to discuss the amendment.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, I thank my colleague from \nConnecticut. There are three or four Senators who want to speak, and I \nhave more to say. Frankly, I don't want to use up all of our time \nwithout hearing from the opposition. I will take a few more minutes. If \nnobody is here, I will suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that the \ntime be charged to the opponents of this amendment. I would like to \nhear from them rather than burning off all my time.\n  Mr. DODD. Well, I suggest that the time be charged to both sides \nequally. That is normally how we proceed. Why not go ahead, and I am \nsure others will come to the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. All right. Mr. President, there are 65 organizations \nthat support this amendment. I ask unanimous consent that this list be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n Sixty State and National Organizations Supporting ``States' Rights'' \n                               Amendment\n\n     ACORN--Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now\n     Alliance for Democracy\n     American Friends Service Committee of Northeast Ohio\n     Arizona Clean Elections Institute\n     California Clean Money Campaign\n     Campaigns for People, Texas\n     Citizen Action of New York\n     Citizen Action of Illinois\n     Colorado Progressive Coalition\n     Connecticut Citizen Action Group\n     Democracy South\n     Equality State Policy Center, Wyoming\n     Fannie Lou Hamer Project\n     Florida Consumer Action Network\n     Florida League of Conservation Voters\n     Georgia Rural-Urban Summit\n     Global Exchange\n     Gray Panthers\n     Hawaii Elections Project\n     Indiana Alliance for Democracy\n     Iowa Citizen Action Network\n     League of United Latin American Citizens\n     Louisiana Democracy Project\n     Lutheran Office for Governmental Affairs--\n     Evangelical Lutheran Church in America\n     Maine Citizen Leadership Fund\n     Maryland Campaign for Clean Elections\n     Massachusetts Voters for Clean Elections\n     Michigan Campaign Finance Network\n     Midwest States Center\n     Minnesota Alliance for Progressive Action\n     Missouri Voters for Clean Elections\n     Money in Politics Research Action Project, Oregon\n     National Voting Rights Institute\n     NETWORK: A Catholic Society Justice Lobby\n     New Hampshire Citizen Alliance for Action\n     New Jersey Citizen Action\n     New Mexico Alliance for Community Empowerment\n     New Mexico Progressive Alliance\n     North Carolina Alliance for Democracy\n     Northeast Action\n     Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada\n     Progressive Maryland\n     Public Campaign\n     Rainforest Action Network\n     Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism\n     Rural Organizing Project, Oregon\n     San Fernando Valley Alliance for Democracy\n     Sierra Club\n     South Carolina Progressive Network\n     United Methodist Church--\n     General Board of Church and Society\n     United for a Fair Economy\n     United Vision for Idaho\n     USAction\n     USPirg\n     Utah Progressive Action Network\n     Vermont Pirg\n     West Virginia Citizen Action\n     West Virginia Peoples' Election Reform Coalition\n     Western States Center\n     Wisconsin Citizen Action\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, these different organizations range \nfrom the national AFL-CIO to AFSCME and SEIU. Also, at the State level, \nthere are a lot of different State organizations, including the \nCalifornia Clean Money Campaign, Arizona Clean Elections Institute, the \nMaine Citizen Leadership Fund, Maryland Campaign For Clean Elections, \nMassachusetts Voters Information Clean Elections, Public Campaign, \nMissouri Voters For Clean Elections, the Catholic Social Justice Lobby, \nNew Hampshire Citizen Alliance For Action, Florida Consumer Action \nNetwork, and it goes on.\n  Then there is one organization I mention, which is the Fannie Lou \nHamer Project. I mention that project because I think in a lot of \nways--and I hope I say this the right way because I have such deep love \nand respect for the memory of Fannie Lou Hamer. For colleagues who \ndon't know about her, Fannie Lou Hamer was the daughter of a \nsharecropper in Mississippi. There were 14 children in her family, and \nshe grew up poor. She was one of the great leaders of the civil rights \nmovement.\n  The reason I mention the Fannie Lou Hamer Project is that Fannie Lou \nHamer uttered the immortal words, ``I am so sick and tired of being \nsick and tired.'' She was talking about economic justice issues. I \nthink the reason the Fannie Lou Hamer Project is one of the \norganizations that is most behind this amendment is that a whole lot of \npeople in the country--and I think this whole issue of campaign finance \nreform--when you say it that way, it doesn't have passion. It is about \ncivil rights. I hear colleagues talking about freedom of speech and \nthat more money is freedom of speech--the more\n\n[[Page S2623]]\n\nmoney, the more speech, and then some people who have all of this money \nuse a megaphone to drown everybody else out.\n  I am all for freedom of speech. I think the Supreme Court is right, \nalthough I didn't agree with the decision in Buckley v. Valeo. If there \nwas a problem of corruption, that is the time for reform, they said. If \nyou think the standard of a representative democracy is that each \nperson should count as one, and no more, we have violated that \nstandard.\n  I will put this in a civil rights context for a moment. A lot of \npeople believe they don't have the freedom to be at the table, the \nfreedom to participate in the political process, or the freedom to run \nfor office; and they don't have the freedom to be people who can affect \nwho runs for office because they don't have the big dollars.\n  Honest to goodness, I believe that ultimately this debate is all \nabout--I wish I had brought the brilliant speech that Bill Moyers gave \ncalled ``The Soul of Democracy.'' This is about the soul of democracy. \nIf my father Leon was alive today--the Jewish immigrant I mentioned \nearlier--he would say this is all about this wonderful, bold, beautiful \nexperiment we have had in self-rule in the United States of America. We \ndon't want to lose that. We don't want to have a minidemocracy or a \npsuedodemocracy, when only certain people can run for office, when some \npeople matter a whole lot more than other people, in terms of who can \naffect our tenure and who can't. This becomes a justice issue.\n  I say to my colleagues--and I will be very frank about it--the reason \nfor this is absolutely constitutional. Not in one court case--and I \nmentioned the Minnesota court of appeals case--has any judge raised a \nconstitutional question. We make it crystal clear that we are simply \nsaying that--it is almost like consumer law, where we make it clear, \nhey, there is a Federal standard that no State can go below it. But if \nthe State of Florida or Minnesota want to do better, they can do so.\n\n  Colleagues, we can do a lot better when it comes to financing \ncampaigns. Justice Brandeis was right; the States are laboratories of \nreform, and I challenge Senators to come to the floor and vote for the \nproposition that if your State wants to apply a full or partial public \nfinancing on a voluntary basis to congressional races so that the \npeople of Florida, or Connecticut, or Arizona, or Wisconsin, or \nMinnesota, or you name it, can feel like, by God, we have put together \na model program for the Nation--we are leading the way--then let them \ndo so.\n  I am for McCain-Feingold unless it gets too weakened. We had this \ndebate yesterday where Senators came to the floor and said we were \npresenting the millionaires amendment. Their answer to the problem of \npeople who have their own wealth and can finance their own campaigns \nwas to dramatically raise the spending limits. So now somebody can go \nfrom $1,000 to $6,000 a year. I recited the figure yesterday that one-\nquarter of 1 percent of the population contributes $200 or more, and \none-ninth of 1 percent of the population contributes $1,000 or more. \nNow we are raising it to $6,000.\n  Well, if you are worried about the great advantage the wealthy \ncandidates have, then what you want to do is move toward a system of \nclean money, clean elections. I wish we could pass it at the Federal \nlevel. That is what makes it a more level playing field. But if we \ncan't pass it at the Federal level, at the very minimum--and if we \ncan't pass it at the Federal level because some of the folks who have \nsuch power can basically block that, so we have to move along with \nMcCain-Feingold as a first step, fine; but would it not make McCain-\nFeingold stronger to allow States to move forward if they want to do \nso?\n  I met with some of the legislators and some of the candidates, both \nDemocrats and Republicans, from the State of Minnesota, and it was one \nof the most inspiring meetings I have had. Oh, God, how I yearned that \nthis could be our elections. They were telling me: Paul, I was an \nincumbent and I had the money and I could have beat a challenger, but \nit wasn't the right thing to do any longer. So I agreed to participate \nin a clean money, clean election campaign. I felt so much better about \nit. I did the right thing. That was a Republican.\n  Then you had challengers saying: If we didn't have this clean money, \nclean election system, there would be no way, as a challenger, I could \nhave raised the money. This created, more or less, a level playing \nfield.\n  Everybody was saying: We had to spend less time at these big-dollar \nfundraisers and less time with cash constituencies and a lot more time \nwith real constituencies. We could be at the coffee shops, we could be \nnot chasing the big dollars but focusing on the big issues.\n  Well, Senators, vote for this amendment and at least let your State \nlead the way. If they want to pass it in the legislature, or by \ninitiative, or referendum, however it is done, a law that would apply a \nvoluntary partial, or some form of public financing, to the Senate and \nHouse races from States, let them do so. Let them become the laboratory \nof reform. See how the people like it. You know something. You will be \nstriking a blow not only for clean money, clean elections, but you will \nalso, as my colleague from Connecticut pointed out, be consistent about \nbeing a decentralist and letting States lead the way if they have a \nmodel program.\n  The third thing you are going to do, and I do not know if I should \nmake this argument because it may be a reason people vote against it, \nbut the third is you are going to be nurturing and promoting a lot of \ngrassroots politics at the State level because once people realize at \nthe State level they might be able to achieve this--since it looks like \nwe are not there yet, though we are going to take a good step forward, \nI hope, with McCain-Feingold--there is going to be a wave of grassroots \ninvolvement where people in the States are going to try to win this. \nAnd that is great.\n  I am looking to win this vote. I am looking for a vote for every \nreformer. Every Senator who says he or she is a reformer should vote \nfor this amendment. I am looking for a vote from Democrats. I am \nlooking for a vote from those Senators who voted against the so-called \nmillionaire amendment because they did not think it was much of a \nreform to get to the point where you have a contest with someone who \nhas a lot of resources versus someone who is dependent on the top 1 \npercent for their economic resources. I am looking for their vote for \nthis. I am looking for support from Democrats and Republicans.\n  Some of my Republican colleagues come from States that have passed \nclean money, clean election legislation, a voluntary system at the \nState level. They are doing it, and they are doing it well. Can we not \nvote for the proposition that we ought to at least let the people in \nour States decide? That is all this amendment says.\n  If there are colleagues who want to speak, that is fine. I have been \ntold other Senators are on their way. I will suggest the absence of a \nquorum, and I ask unanimous consent that the time be charged equally to \nboth sides. But I ask those opponents to come to the floor--we do not \nwant to use up all of our time, unless the opponents want to throw in \nthe towel right now and vote for this amendment. That would be OK, too.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum, with the time \nto be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reid). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished Senator from Florida be recognized to speak for 5 minutes \nas in morning business and that the time not be charged to the present \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Florida.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Nelson of Florida are located in today's Record \nunder ``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on the subject of the Wellstone \namendment, if my understanding is correct, I believe the Senator from \nMinnesota allows each State legislature to determine whether or not \nthere could be a\n\n[[Page S2624]]\n\nsystem of taxpayer funding and spending limits imposed on Federal \nelections from that State.\n  There are a lot of issues we don't know much about in terms of public \nopinion. But we do have a pretty good sense of how people feel about \nhaving their tax dollars used to elect public officials. In a research \nproject in September of 1999, the question was asked: Should public \nfunding be provided for all candidates running for Congress? It was \nvery simply put. The public responded yes, 25 percent; no, 56 percent; \nnot sure, 18 percent.\n  The use of the term ``public funding'' produces a better result for \nthe proponents of taxpayer funding of elections because ``public'' is \npresumed to be sort of a benign thing producing a positive response. I \nam unaware of what the answer would have been had the words ``taxpayer \nfunding'' of elections been inserted, but we do know when Americans \nknow it is their tax money that is being used, it produces a response \nsometimes ranking right up there with anger.\n  We have an opportunity every April 15 to have the biggest poll on \nthis subject ever taken in America. It is the check off on our tax \nreturns which doesn't add anything to our tax bill. It simply diverts \n$3 of taxes we already owe to the Presidential election campaign funds. \nIt doesn't add to our tax bill. Last year, only about 12 percent of \nAmericans checked off indicating they wanted to divert $3 of their tax \nbill away from children's nutrition or defense of the Nation or any \nother worthwhile cause the Government funds into a fund to pay for \nbuttons and balloons at the national conventions which get some of the \ntax money, and the Presidential campaigns, which get some of that tax \nmoney.\n  Interestingly enough, this has continued to drop over the years. It \nwas originally $1 when it was set up back in the mid-1970s. The high \nwater mark of taxpayer participation was 29 percent in 1980. It has \ngone consistently down since then. Ten years ago, in order to make up \nfor the lack of interest, when the other party was in charge of both \nHouses and the White House, the $1 check was upped to $3 so that fewer \nand fewer people could designate more and more money to make up for the \nlack of public interest in having their dollars pay for political \ncampaigns.\n  In short, with all due respect to the Senator from Minnesota, who has \nbeen very straightforward about the fact he would like to have taxpayer \nfunding of all elections in America, this is not an idea widely \napplauded by the American people. In fact, they hate it. Almost any way \nyou ask the question, there is a negative response.\n  I hope this amendment will be defeated. It certainly takes us in \nexactly the wrong direction if the idea is to produce a campaign \nfinance reform bill out of the Senate which might subsequently at some \npoint be signed by the President of the United States. I think it is \nfurther noteworthy that the Presidential system is collapsing anyway. \nPresident Bush was able to raise more money because of his broad \nsupport across America and chose not to accept the public's subsidy and \nthe speech restrictions on his campaigns that go along with that on a \nState-by-State basis.\n  Another candidate, Steve Forbes, obviously because of his own \npersonal wealth, chose not to take public funding. I think that is a \ntrend. I think you are going to see more and more candidates for \nPresident on both sides of the aisle deciding they do not want to use \ntaxpayer funds for their elections because a number of bad things \nhappen to you once you do that.\n\n  We know that once you opt into the system, you are stuck then with \nall the auditors and all the restrictions. We know one out of four of \nthe dollars spent in Presidential elections has been spent on lawyers \nand accountants trying to help the candidates comply with all the rules \nthat come along with it and of course also telling them how they can \nget around those rules.\n  So it is a pretty thoroughly discredited system that I think most \nMembers of the Senate are not going to want carried over to \ncongressional races as well. It is bad enough the Presidential \nelections are stuck with it. And of course they are ignoring it.\n  Issue advocacy was huge in the Presidential election. One of the \nreasons both sides have gone to using issue ads is the scarcity of hard \ndollars, even when supplemented with tax dollars in the Presidential \nrace, a genuine scarcity in terms of the enormous audience you have to \nreach in America.\n  This is a system that simply does not allow the candidates for \nPresident to get out their own message. To give State legislatures the \nopportunity to impose that on us without our will, without acting at \nthe Federal level, seems to me a particularly bad idea. I hope this \namendment will not only be defeated but be soundly defeated.\n  I yield the floor and retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, there are two colleagues on the floor, \nand I will just take 1 quick minute to respond. How much time do we \nhave left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Just under 24 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Just under 24 minutes. I say to all Senators--or \nstaffs, because quite often staffs follow this debate as well--it all \ndepends upon how you frame the question. Actually, when you talk to \npeople and say, do you want to try to get some of the private money out \nand big dollars out and you want to have clean money, clean elections \nwhere they are your elections and your government, people are all for \nit. It depends on how you frame the question.\n  But all the arguments my colleague from Kentucky made do not apply to \nthis amendment. Mr. President, 24 States including the State of \nKentucky have a system of public financing or partial public financing. \nThey must like it. But the point is, we give people in our States the \nright to decide. That is all this amendment says.\n  I made the argument for clean money, clean elections. But that is \nbeside the point. What we are saying is let the States be the \nlaboratories of reform and let the people decide--what they did in \nMaine, or what they have done in Massachusetts, or what they have done \nin Arizona, or what they have done in Vermont, or, for that matter, \nwhat they have done in a lot of other States with partial public \nfinancing. Let them decide whether, on a voluntary basis, they want to \napply that to congressional races. That is the point. We do not get to \nmake that decision for them. You are just voting on the proposition of \nwhether or not you want to let the people in your States make the \ndecision.\n  Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield just for a unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, after consultation with the assistant \nDemocratic leader, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on the \nWellstone amendment occur at 2:15.\n  Mr. KERRY. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I would like \nto ascertain how much time remains and how much time might be \navailable.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If I may finish, I say to my friend from \nMassachusetts, the thought we had was 20 minutes of the time between \nnow and then would be for your side and 10 for our side.\n  Mr. REID. I think that is about all the time we have anyway, isn't \nit, on Senator Wellstone's time.\n  Mr. KERRY. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remain 21 minutes 52 seconds.\n  Mr. KERRY. Could I ask for 12 minutes?\n  Mr. REID. Senator Cantwell, I think, indicated she would like 8 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would like to reserve. There are others coming. \nUnfortunately, when we went into a quorum call, the time was equally \ndivided because we didn't have people down here. I would like to \nreserve the last 3 minutes for myself.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Minnesota, we have 21 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Let's do 10 and 8.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will be glad to accommodate your side. Senator \nWellstone wants to speak again, Senator Cantwell, Senator Kerry--are \nthere others?\n  Mr. REID. Senator Corzine wanted 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. You tell me how to do that.\n\n[[Page S2625]]\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, after the \nSenator from Washington, I be permitted to speak for 10 minutes and we \nhave the vote at the conclusion of that amount of time, and allowing \nfor the time for the use of the Senator from Kentucky as the manager on \nhis side.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. What I would like to do is set a time for the vote in \nconsultation with the Senators on the floor, and we will divide the \ntime after that.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, could I suggest perhaps we allow the \nSenator from Washington to begin speaking and arrange the time?\n  Mr. REID. How much time does the Senator need?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, 12 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Corzine 5 minutes; Wellstone, 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Cantwell?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, 10 minutes. Vote at 2:30.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a vote occur on \nthe Wellstone amendment--on or in relation to the Wellstone amendment \nat 2:30.\n  Mr. REID. And the time be allocated----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The time be allocated in the following manner: 12 \nminutes for Senator Kerry, 5 minutes for Senator Corzine, 5 minutes for \nSenator Wellstone at the end, 5 minutes for Senator Cantwell--10 \nminutes for Senator Cantwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. And 2 minutes before the vote for the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the McCain-\nFeingold campaign finance reform legislation and the Wellstone \namendment. I ran for the U.S. Senate because I believe it is time for \nus to reform our political system and bring it into the 21st century. \nAt a time where citizens are more empowered than ever with information, \nwhere access to technology and communications tools makes it possible \nfor citizens to track and understand on a daily basis our legislative \nprogress, and where citizens understand exactly the tug and pull of the \nlegislative process, that is, who is getting tugged and who is getting \npulled. It is time to respond with a political system that is more \ninclusive in the decision process. That meets the best long term needs \nof our citizens, instead of a political system of financing campaigns \nthat rewards short-term expedient decisionmaking.\n  But before I go on about the Wellstone amendment that I rise to \nsupport, I want to thank the authors of the bill, Senators John McCain \nand Russ Feingold, for the commitment, determination, courage and \nperseverance that they have demonstrated on this issue. Campaign \nfinance reform has few friends. It has many enemies. It suffers from a \npublic that simply believes that we can not reform ourselves or this \nsystem. John McCain and Russ Feingold, at great personal expense, have \nchampioned this cause for many years and I am proud to join them in the \nheat of this battle.\n  I rise today in support of the Wellstone amendment that I am \ncosponsoring along with Senators Corzine and Kerry because I believe it \nwill truly start us down the road of progress. Progress in allowing \nclean money and clean money efforts to finance campaigns. There is \nalmost a grassroots effort popping up in many States such as Maine, \nVermont, Arizona, and Massachusetts, and hopefully with this amendment, \nin many more States across our country.\n\n  The clean money effort allows us to put our political system where it \nbelongs--back in the hands of the public, making it more accountable \nfor the people we represent. This is the political reform that our \ncountry so badly needs.\n  The money we raise from special interests plays a role in politics. \nIt plays a role in setting the terms of the debate. It plays a role in \nwhat issues get placed at the top of the legislative agenda. And, most \nimportantly, it keeps the focus in the wrong place.\n  Elizabeth Drew, wrote a book called ``Whatever It Takes,'' that \nchronicled some of the way business and the Congress operate. \nParaphrasing her remarks, some of the interest groups oppose \nlegislation because it is the camel's nose under the tent. It is \nsomething they can stop, and so they do.\n  We need a political decision making process in Congress in an \ninformation age where people are brought together, and not just met \nwith because we agree with them. Our failure to act to reduce the \namount of money in politics is feeding the skepticism and cynicism \nabout politics and government among our citizens, and particularly our \nyouth.\n  At a time when we are not far from Internet voting, we ought to have \na system of financing campaigns that encourages our citizens to be more \ninvolved. Our citizens believe the current campaign finance system \nprevents us from acting in their interest.\n  We have been through a technology revolution in this country, and we \nhave to have a governing system, and a campaign system that will keep \npace with it.\n  I was reminded in this last cycle--going around the State of \nWashington, I met a constituent who wanted to tell me about a piece of \nlegislation. They turned around to their desktop and printed off the \nbill that was being considered, circled the sections of the bill they \nwere most interested in, and said: Now tell me why we can't get this \npassed by the U.S. Senate.\n  I didn't have to answer this person. They knew very well why it was \nnot getting addressed in the Senate. And that is why we need to change \nour system.\n  I welcome Senator Wellstone's amendment and his recognition that \nStates can be leaders in this area. I hope my colleagues embrace the \nspirit of this amendment and recognize it for what it is--a great \nopportunity to watch, to see, and to learn from those experiments that \nare happening at the State level.\n  As Senator Wellstone said, States are great laboratories. By letting \nStates that are interested in doing so set up public funding systems \nfor their Federal candidates, we will be providing ourselves with \nvaluable research on how we can level the playing field and get the \nmoney out of politics.\n  Think about that: The time that Members spend raising money instead \nspent listening to the voters in their States.\n  We have already learned from the clean money election systems in \nMaine that candidates taking part in that voluntary system have had the \nfollowing things say:\n  It was easier to recruit candidates to run for office.\n  It is what the people want.\n  I will only have about half the money I raised last time but much \nmore time to talk to the people.\n  We have learned that voluntary limits can work. In his Senate race in \n1996, Senator John Kerry and his opponent, then-Governor Bill Weld, \nagreed to a voluntary spending limit, and the result was a campaign \nwaged largely on the issues. Senator Kerry proved there are incentives \nfor both sides to improve the political discourse.\n\n  In Arizona, 16 candidates were elected under the clean money system, \nincluding an upset victory over the former speaker of the State senate. \nAnd the challenger spent only one-quarter of the money that his \nopponent took.\n  In Maine, 49 percent of the State senate candidates won their seats \nwhile participating in the clean money program.\n  Overall, States implementing public financing have seen more \ncandidates run, more contested primaries, more women running for \noffice, and, most importantly, it is proving that good candidates can \nrun winning campaigns and participate in a system that limits spending.\n  The only way we have to truly level the playing field, both between \ncandidates and parties of opposing ideologies, and more importantly, \nbetween new candidates and incumbents, is to commit the resources to \nthe process of getting people elected.\n  Not until we create a campaign system with a shorter and more \nintensive campaign period--something I think the public would truly \napplaud--funded with finite and equal resources available to all \ncandidates, will we be able to really listen carefully to what the \npeople want.\n\n[[Page S2626]]\n\n  Not until then will we be able to free candidates from the time, and \nthe energy drain that is needed for dialing for dollars. Not until then \nwill we be able to improve the quality of political discourse, to play \ndown the dominance of polls, to render tax-driven negative ads \nineffective, and to remove the appearance that political decisionmaking \nis not based on principle but on the dependence on funds.\n  We can't in an information age and a technology age be smart enough \nto figure out how to make prescription drugs and new therapies improve \nthe quality of life and health care and yet not even have the debate to \nmake prescription drugs more affordable.\n  Why is that? Because it, too, has gotten clogged in this debate and \ncampaign finance reform. Senator Wellstone's amendment removes the \nroadblock to exploring new options for getting people elected in a new \ninformation age. I support the right of States to experiment with new \nideas to help level the playing field and to improve our election \nprocess and our campaign system.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank Senator Cantwell but remind her \nthat actually we worked together on this amendment. It is really our \namendment--the Wellstone-Cantwell-Kerry amendment.\n  I thank the Senator for her help on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, let me begin my comments by making it as clear as I \ncan that I am a strong supporter of the McCain-Feingold legislation. I \nhave had the pleasure of working with both of them through the years on \ncampaign finance reform. I want McCain-Feingold to pass the Senate and \nultimately be signed into law.\n  But let me also make it equally as clear to my colleagues and all \nAmericans who are focused on and care about this issue that what we \nmight achieve, if we pass McCain-Feingold, is only a small step towards \nwhat we ought to be trying to do in this Congress. The fact is that \neven if we pass McCain-Feingold, all that we would have achieved is a \nreduction--it is not all, but it is significant and it is important--in \nthe soft money flow to our campaigns through either corporate \ncontributions or private contributions.\n  Nothing in McCain-Feingold is going to restrain the arms race of \nfundraising in the United States. Nothing in McCain-Feingold is going \nto restrain ultimately the dependency of people in Congress to have to \ngo out and ask people for significant amounts of money in total--\nbecause of amounts of money that you can give Federally--hard money up \nto the $25,000, which may well be lifted in the course of this debate--\npeople who have $20,000, $25,000, or $15,000 to make in a contribution \nwill have far more capacity to be able to affect Federal campaigns than \nthe average American citizen.\n  I do not know if my colleagues are aware of this, but almost all of \nthe soft money that was contributed in the last election cycle for both \nparties came from about 800 people. Obviously, those 800 people have \nthe capacity to be able to put up larger Federal contributions or match \nFederal dollar contributions.\n  What the Congress ought to be doing and what we ought to be focused \non is how to put the greatest distance between each of us in the \nfundraising and create the greatest proximity between each of us and \nthe people who vote for us or who are asked to vote for us.\n  The Senator from Kentucky said earlier in this debate that this \namendment by Senator Wellstone, myself, and Senator Cantwell is a bad \nidea because it would tell the States how to run a Federal election, or \nit would take our campaigns--I think was the language--and prevent the \nStates from somehow living by the rules that the Federal Government has \nset up or espouses. Nothing, again, could be further from the truth.\n\n  First of all, it is not our campaign. It is the voters' campaign. \nThis election belongs to the voters of each of our States. How \npresumptuous of us to stand here and say we should deny the voters of \nour States the right to elect us the way they might like to elect us.\n  Moreover, this amendment is purely voluntary. No Member of Congress \nis compelled to go with the system even if a State requires it. So it \nis really only a half preemption. It is a way of saying to those 24 \nStates--almost half the States in the Union; among them the State of \nthe Senator from Kentucky. They have already adopted some form of \npublic financing. Every one of those States has decided they do not \nwant special interests governing the elections. They want to reduce the \nelection process to the simplest connection between candidate and \nvoter.\n  I am pleased to say that ever since I ran in 1984--the first time for \nthe Senate--I have been able, thus far, to run without taking the \nlarger conglomerate funds, the PAC money funds. I think I am the only \nMember of the Senate who has been elected three times without taking \nPAC money. I am proud of that. That is not because PACs are inherently \nevil or a bad part of the process. I think it is fine under the \nConstitution for people to come together and give money jointly through \na PAC. The problem is, when it is conglomerated the way it is, in the \namounts that it is, it leaves our fellow citizens with the perception \nthat the system is up for grabs; that the money is what controls the \nelections of our country.\n  Senator John McCain, in the course of his Presidential campaign, \nelicited from his countrymen and women a great sympathy for that \nnotion. Part of what propelled that campaign was people's conviction \nthey do not get to control what happens in the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives, but the large money has more control over what happens \nhere than their conglomerate votes they express on election day.\n  What the Wellstone-Kerry-Cantwell amendment seeks to do is simply \ngive a choice to States. If you are a conservative and you believe in \nStates rights, here is the ultimate States rights amendment because \nwhat we are saying is that a State has the right to offer to its \ncandidates a different way of getting elected. And if the candidate for \nFederal office wants to take advantage of that, they may. It does not \nrequire you, there is no mandate, any person in the Senate who wants to \ngo out and rely on their amounts of money they can raise can do so. But \nit gives to the State the right to put that as an offering to those who \nrun.\n  Why is it that we should stand here and take ownership of the \ncampaign away from the people who elect us, and deny them the right to \nsay they would like to see the races for the House and the Senate run \nby the same standard that we run our race for Governor and for our \nlocal legislature?\n  As I said earlier, nothing in McCain-Feingold will ultimately resolve \nthe terrible problem of Senators having to raise extraordinary sums of \nmoney. The reason for that is we are still going to have to go out and \nraise tens of millions of dollars, except it will be without soft \nmoney; it will be so-called hard money.\n  Let me say to my colleagues, they will still--each of them--be \ncompletely subject to the same kinds of questions that exist today \nabout the linkage of money and politics. The only way we will \nultimately divorce ourselves from that perception which leads most \nAmericans to believe that this whole thing is somehow out of their \nreach and out of their control, and that it is gamed and they cannot \nreally make a difference--the only way you will affect that, \nultimately, is to adopt some form of public financing.\n\n  I know the votes are not here today. I know too many of my colleagues \nare comfortable with the status quo. I know we cannot win that vote in \nthe Senate today. But that does not mean we should not put it in the \ndebate. And it does not mean we should not require a vote because the \nreal test of whether or not people want our democracy to work is \nwhether or not we are going to do the most we can, in a most reasonable \nway, to separate ourselves from the fundraising that is so suspect and \nthat taints the entire system.\n  I respectfully suggest to my colleagues that a voluntary system--once \nagain, purely voluntary; no challenge to the first amendment at all; no \nmandate whatsoever; no constitutional issue --simply a voluntary system \nthat would allow a candidate to go for matching money, in the same way \nthat we do in the Presidential race, and have done for years--and, I \nmight add, contrary to what the Senator from\n\n[[Page S2627]]\n\nKentucky said, with great success--even President George W. Bush in the \ngeneral election took the public funding. He ran for President of the \nUnited States with public money. Bob Dole ran for President of the \nUnited States with public money. President George Bush first ran with \npublic money. President Ronald Reagan ran with public money. Why is it \nthat if it is good enough to elect a President of the United States, it \nshould not at least be voluntarily available to those who run for the \nSenate?\n  The reason is too many of my colleagues know that might put the \nopposition on an equal footing with them. Too many of my colleagues are \ncomfortable with the system where they can use the incumbency to raise \nthe large amounts of money and not allow for a fair playing field that \nenhances the democracy of this country.\n  That is why the Senate has more than 50-percent membership of \nmillionaires--because most people in this country cannot afford to run \nfor the Senate. That is how our democracy in this country is, in fact, \ndistorted. We do not have a true representation in the so-called upper \nbody of America because too many people cannot even begin to think \nabout running for office in this country.\n  Last time I ran in the State of Massachusetts, the Governor of the \nState, a Republican, joined with me in putting a limit on what we would \nspend. We voluntarily agreed to no independent expenditures. We \nvoluntarily agreed to no soft money. We voluntarily agreed on a total \nlimit of how much we would spend in our campaign on the ground and in \nthe media.\n  The result of that was, we had nine 1-hour televised debates. And in \nthe course of those nine 1-hour televised debates--in the course of all \nthe free media--the people in the State were able to hear a debate \nabout Social Security, a debate about Medicare, a debate about health \ncare, a debate about the economy; and they ultimately made a decision.\n  I say to my colleagues, I warrant that 95 percent or 100 percent of \nthe dollars we spent on paid advertising--which were equal amounts--was \na complete wash, a mishmash that ultimately did not affect the outcome.\n  We are hocking the Congress of the United States to our fundraising \nefforts in order to be able to run paid advertisements that result, \ngenerally speaking, in a clouding of the issues, not a shedding of \nlight to people about what these issues are really about.\n  The only way to stop having Americans ask about the influence of \nmoney is to adopt the greatest division between us and the influence of \nthe money. And that will come through some form of public financing.\n  I will be speaking more about this in the next few days. I will be \noffering an amendment to this bill that tries to go further than what \nwe currently have on the table. I know the reason Senators McCain and \nFeingold have settled where they are is because this is the best chance \nwe have for the votes we have today. But that does not mean the Senate \nshould not be called on to debate and vote on an issue that ultimately \nwill be the only way out of this morass that we find ourselves in.\n  I think my time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair and hope my colleagues will support this \nvoluntary opportunity that the Senator from Minnesota offers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, do we have, all together, 10 minutes \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a total of 20 minutes preceding the \nvote. The Senator from Minnesota has 5 minutes remaining, and the \nSenator from New Jersey has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from Massachusetts, if he would \nlike, I will yield an additional 5 minutes to him. I will reserve the \nfinal 5 minutes. We are in complete agreement. He is making a very \nstrong statement for clean money, clean elections.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, if the Senator will yield, the Senator \nfrom New Jersey is on his way. He has 5 minutes. The Senator from \nMinnesota has 5 minutes. The rest is under the control of the Senator \nfrom Kentucky. That was the understanding we had.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am sorry, I was under the impression that the \nSenator from New Jersey would not be able to make it at all.\n  Mr. REID. He is on his way.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will take my time now. This is a joint effort. There \nare a number of different Senators who are part of this: Senator \nCantwell worked very hard on this, Senator Kerry; Senator Biden is an \noriginal cosponsor; Senator Corzine is an original cosponsor; Senator \nClinton is an original cosponsor. There are other Senators as well.\n  My colleague from Kentucky has made the argument before--in fact, I \nremember debating him on MacNeil, Lehrer that public financing, a clean \nmoney, clean election bill, which Senator Kerry and I have written, \nwould amount to ``food stamps for politicians.'' The problem with that \nargument is that it presupposes that the election belongs to the \npoliticians. The election belongs to the people we represent.\n  I argue that McCain-Feingold is a step in the right direction, but if \nwe want to have a system that gets out a lot of the big money, brings \npeople back in, is not so wired for incumbents, and assures that we \nhave a functioning representative democracy where we do live up to the \ngoal of each person counting as one, and no more than one, frankly, \nclean money, clean elections is the direction in which to go, as has \nalready been accomplished by a number of States. Maine, Vermont, \nMassachusetts, and Arizona have led the way, but there are about 24 \nStates in the country that have some system of public or partial \nfinancing.\n  We are not voting today for clean money, clean elections. We are just \nvoting on the following proposition: Will we vote to allow our States, \nthe people in our States and their elected representatives, the right \nto decide whether or not a system of voluntary partial or full public \nfinancing should be applied to U.S. House and Senate races. Why don't \nwe allow the people in our States the chance to make that decision?\n  This is a Brandeis amendment. States are the laboratories of reform. \nFor Senators who say they want States to decide on the most fundamental \ncore issue of all, which has to do with representation, let them \ndecide. If they don't want to adopt such a system, they won't, but let \nthem decide.\n  Secondly, by doing that, we will nurture and provoke a wave of \ngrassroots citizen involvement because people will realize that at \ntheir State level not only can they adopt clean money, clean elections \nthat affect State races, but they can do it so that it will affect our \nraces.\n  This is simply an amendment that says: Let the States, our States, \nmake the decision whether they want to adopt such a voluntary system of \npartial or full public financing or clean money, clean elections.\n  Senator Corzine and Senator Biden are on the floor. I yield the final \n6 or 7 minutes equally divided between the two of them. I yield 3 \nminutes to the Senator from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has used his 5 \nminutes.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Minnesota, \nSenator Wellstone, for bringing this amendment to the Senate, and I am \npleased to join him in this effort to finally break the ice on getting \nrid of special interest money in our campaigns--once and for all.\n  He and I have been at this for a long time, a very long time. And \nwhile I support the McCain-Feingold bill, we have to remember that it \nonly addresses a portion of the problems we have.\n  Indeed, the effort to secure real reform of the way we finance \npolitical campaigns has been a central concern of my entire Senate \ncareer, almost three decades. In fact, the first Committee testimony I \never gave as a U.S. Senator, back in 1973, was to speak in favor of \npublic financing and spending limits for campaigns.\n  And if you think campaign finance reform is a tough issue today, let \nme tell you, as some of my colleagues well remember, it was truly \nunpopular then.\n  As I continued to push for public funding of campaigns in 1974, my \ngoal\n\n[[Page S2628]]\n\nwas to get rid of special interest money--money that pollutes the \nsystem and drowns out the voices of ordinary persons. Special interest \nmoney has a tendency to influence anyone running for public office, or \nat a minimum, casts that impression that elected officials are beholden \nto someone other than the American people.\n  Public financing also helps to level the financial playing field for \nchallengers taking on well established incumbents who had virtually all \nof the fund-raising muscle.\n  But again, I encountered a lot of opposition, from colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle. A story I know I have told before: One senior \nSenator pulled me aside in the cloakroom, and told me that he had \nworked hard and earned his seniority, and he was not going to open the \ndoor for some challenger to be able to raise as much money as he could. \nHe basically asked me--I expect when he would tell the story, he didn't \nask me, he told me--to stop what I was doing.\n  In that same year, 1974, I wrote an article for the Northwestern \nUniversity Law Review, outlining the three principal reasons that I was \npursuing campaign finance reform. First, a political process that \nrelied totally on private contributions allowed for, at the very least, \nthe potential of wealthy individuals and special interest groups \nexercising a disproportionate influence over the system.\n  Second, such a process meant that wealthy candidates had an almost \ninsurmountable advantage. And third, incumbents had an equally daunting \nadvantage; the system virtually locked them into office.\n  We did make some progress in 1974, largely because of documented \nabuses in the 1972 presidential campaign, with the passage of \nAmendments to the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, known as the \nFECA. The 1974 amendments, which I supported, established the Federal \nElection Commission to help ensure proper enforcement of campaign laws, \nand also set the now familiar federal campaign contribution limits of \n$1,000 for individuals and $5,000 for political action committees.\n  The amendments further established campaign spending limits and \nexpanded public financing for presidential campaigns.\n  Not unexpectedly, the constitutionality of the 1974 amendments was \nchallenged almost immediately, and the Supreme Court decided the issue \nin its 1976 landmark ruling, Buckley v. Valeo.\n  The Court upheld the law's contribution limits, but overturned the \nlimits on expenditures as a too severe restriction of political speech. \nThe Court did leave open, however, the possibility of spending limits \nfor publicly financed campaigns--which, so far, despite my best \nefforts, has been limited to presidential campaigns--because the \ncandidates could disregard the limits if they rejected the public \nfunds.\n  There were additional issues in the case, not directly related to \ncampaign financing, including a separation of powers question regarding \nhow Commissioners to the FEC were appointed.\n  In response to the Court's decision, Congress enacted additional \namendments to the FECA in 1976, which again, I supported. One amendment \nrepealed the spending limits except for publicly financed campaigns; \nanother addressed the FEC appointment procedures; and another \nrestricted and regulated PAC fund-raising. I also supported a third \nround of refining FECA amendments, which passed in 1979.\n  In addition to those successes in the 1970s, there were also \nfrustrations. In 1977, I introduced legislation to prohibit the \npersonal use of excess campaign funds by defeated candidates, by \nretired or resigned Federal office holders, or by the survivors of a \ndeceased office holder. The bill was debated on the floor, but \nultimately failed.\n  The greater frustrations of the late 1970s and early 1980s were, \nfirst, that partisan stalemate kept us from making additional progress, \nand second, that despite our efforts with the FECA amendments, \nindividual campaigns and political parties were bypassing the laws by \ntaking advantage of loopholes in the regulatory language and system.\n  We finally broke the stalemate on reform legislation in the Senate, \nand on narrowing one of the biggest loopholes, by delineating more \nspecific guidelines for the use of political action committees, or \nPACs, when we passed the Boren-Goldwater amendment in 1986, legislation \nI was proud to cosponsor. This would have reduced PAC contributions and \nput a total limit on the amount of PAC money a candidate could accept.\n  But the celebration was short-lived, and progress on campaign finance \nreform stalled again, despite our continuing efforts to give it a \nlegislative jump start.\n  With my colleagues, Senator Kerry from Massachusetts and then-Senator \nBradley from New Jersey, I offered public campaign financing bills in \nthe 101st, the 102nd and the 103rd Congresses.\n  Others among our colleagues were equally persistent during this era, \nperhaps most notably, Senators Boren and Mitchell, Senator Danforth and \nSenator Hollings, who has proposed a constitutional amendment to allow \nCongress to pass legislation setting mandatory limits on contributions \nand expenditures for federal campaigns. I have supported that proposal \nin the past, as well as other reforms suggested by the distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina and other colleagues.\n  We did manage to pass several significant pieces of legislation \nthrough the Senate, only to have the process stalled again in the \nconference process. And as I know many of my colleagues will remember, \nwe even managed to get a pretty good bill out of conference and through \nboth Houses, in 1992--a bill that included voluntary spending limits in \ncongressional campaigns, in exchange for certain public funding \nbenefits, as well as restrictions on PAC receipts and soft money.\n  But the legislation was vetoed by President George H.W. Bush, and our \nSenate override vote failed by 57-42.\n  When we resubmitted the legislation the following year, with Senator \nBoren again as the lead sponsor and with President Clinton's support \nand, indeed, some additional provisions proposed by the White House, \nthe Congressional Campaign Spending Limit and Election Reform Act again \ngot pretty far.\n  Just as I had done 20 years before, I testified before the Senate \nRules Committee, arguing for public financing as the only road to true \ncampaign finance reform. The bill, with one major compromise amendment, \npassed the Senate 60-38, but a compromise with the House proved more \ndifficult, and our debate ended with a filibuster against appointing \nconferees.\n  The 104th Congress saw a famous handshake between President Clinton \nand the Speaker of the House, Mr. Gingrich, signaling their ``agreement \nin principle'' to pursue campaign finance reform. And the two major \nsweeping reform bills, which continue to dominate our debates today, \nwere born McCain-Feingold in the Senate, and Smith-Meehan-Shays, now \nknown as Shays-Meehan, in the House.\n  Then in 1997, I again partnered with Senator Kerry, as well as \nSenators Wellstone, Glenn and Leahy, to introduce the Clean Money, \nClean Elections Act.\n  That proposal would have wiped private money out of the campaign \nsystem almost entirely, by greatly reducing the limit on individual \ncontributions and imposing an additional limit for each state. \nCandidates would have received public funds and free media time, \ncalculated by State size.\n  Unfortunately, as with so many other proposals directed toward public \nfinancing for congressional campaigns, we got no further than a \nreferral to committee.\n  In recounting this history, I do not mean to sound downtrodden or \ndiscouraged.\n  We have made progress through congressional action--with the FECA \namendments and since 1979, the elimination of honoraria and the \n``grandfather clause'' on the personal use of excess campaign funds, \nthe National Voter Registration Act and the increase in the tax return \ncheckoff for the Presidential Election Campaign Fund from $1 to $3.\n  The 106th Congress saw no fewer than 85 campaign finance reform bills \nintroduced, 24 of them in the Senate, including the McCain-Feingold \nbill that we are debating today, as well as the Hagel-Kerrey bill on \nwhich hearings were held last spring.\n  While none of the sweeping reform proposals made it through the last \nCongress, we did take a small but important step, enacting a proposal \ninitially offered by Senator Lieberman\n\n[[Page S2629]]\n\nand later incorporated into an amendment he sponsored with Senators \nMcCain and Feingold.\n  The legislation, which in virtually identical form to McCain-\nFeingold-Lieberman was signed into law by President Clinton last July, \naddressed the problem of so-called ``stealth PACs,'' operating under \nsection 527 of the tax code.\n  Such organizations claimed tax exempt status, but at the same time \nalso claimed exemption from regulation under the FECA. That meant these \nstealth PACs could try to influence political campaigns with \nundisclosed and unregulated contributions, all tax free. The new law \ncloses that loophole, requiring 527 organizations to adhere to \nappropriate regulatory and disclosure requirements. Again, an important \nstep.\n  And I hope it is a step that gives us momentum to make further \nprogress in the 107th Congress. My own legislative initiatives, \nthroughout my career, have focused on public financing of federal \ncampaigns, and I continue to believe that it is truest course to \nreform.\n  But I have been in the past, and will be in our deliberations now, \nwilling and eager to support other brands of reform that offer \nresponsible regulation and close what can, at times, seem like an \nendless chain of newly exploited loopholes in existing law.\n  Our goal, whatever proposal is at issue, must be to uphold the public \ntrust and to secure public confidence in the integrity of our election \nprocess. We are not entitled to that confidence; we have to earn it.\n  That is no small task, especially having just emerged from an \nelection that was not only contentious but expensive--the total amount \nraised just by the two national parties was close to $1.2 billion, a \n$300 million increase from the 1996 election cycle.\n  And half of that $1.2 billion was so-called ``soft money,'' raised \nand spent beyond the reach of federal regulation, although certainly \nwith the intent of influencing some Federal elections. As the amounts \nand creative uses of soft money have grown, we must give the issue the \nserious consideration it merits, as, I might add, McCain-Feingold does, \nwith its outright ban on soft money raising and spending in Federal \nraces.\n  In the past, as I've attempted to summarize today, we have made some \nprogress, but time and time again, we have stopped short of how far we \nneed to go on campaign finance reform.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Wellstone today gives us at least a \nchance, for Senate races in some States, to discard the influences of \nspecial interests.\n  Public financing allows candidates to compete on an equal footing \nwhere the merits of their ideas outweigh the size of their pocketbook. \nIt frees members from the corroding dependence on personal or family \nfortune or the gifts of special interest backers. It ends the need for \nperpetual fundraising by elected officials.\n  But above all else, it helps restore the American people's faith in \nour democracy.\n  The truth is that campaigns are financed by people, and when they are \nfinanced by all the people--not just a small percentage--they will \ncreate much better government and will do the one thing that most needs \nto be done at this time, and that is to begin to restore public \nconfidence in the system. Either all of America decides who runs for \noffice, or only a few people. It's as simple as that.\n  And if we cannot pass this at the Federal level, let's at least give \nthe States the chance to do it, as Senator Wellstone is proposing. The \nfact is, the States have been leading the way when it comes to public \nfinancing.\n  My home State is now considering such a proposal. If candidates can \nagree to spending limits, and choose public financing over special \ninterest money, we should not stand in the way of allowing a state to \npursue an avenue of reform that we are reluctant to take here in \nWashington.\n  Public financing is the true, comprehensive way to reform. While I \nwould prefer to enact public financing at the federal level, I \nnevertheless support my colleague's effort to restore faith in our \nelectoral process by giving States the go ahead.\n  Madam President, I don't understand what my friend from Kentucky gets \nso worried about. I know he disagrees with guys like me and the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts about public financing of elections, which I think \nis the only way we ever clean this up.\n  This is a simple yet important amendment. All we are saying is, if \nyour State decides it wants to put in a financing system and if both \ncandidates running for office or three candidates running for that \noffice agree to abide by it, then what is the big deal? I find it so \nfascinating that by and large my Republican friends talk about States \nrights so much. They are such great champions of States rights. They \nwould love the Environmental Protection Agency to be subservient to the \nStates. They think the 11th amendment means something the Supreme \nCourt, unfortunately, has decided it means. The States are the \nrepository of wisdom to my friends on the other side of the aisle, by \nand large.\n  We are not going to even allow the States, if they choose, to set up \na financing system for elections if all the candidates voluntarily \nagree. If they don't voluntarily agree, they can't do it \nconstitutionally, in my view. Here we are with even this modest \nattempt.\n  What we are afraid of on this floor is the public one day waking up \nand saying: Hey, the emperor has no clothes; this has been a big sham. \nGosh, look at this, I didn't realize this.\n  All they know now is generically they don't like the way we do \nbusiness. All they know now is generically there is too much money \ninvolved in politics. In their home States, if they like the idea of \ntoo much money continuing to be involved in politics, so be it; they \ncan decide that. But if they decide that there is a way to get the big \nmoney out and a way to make sure every single voter in the State has \nthe same say as any wealthy person, then they might do this.\n  This is so modest, it is almost embarrassing to have to argue for its \npassage. It is the single most insightful way to understand why what we \nare doing doesn't mean much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, I rise today in strong support of the \nWellstone-Cantwell States' Rights amendment. I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of this amendment which will allow States to attempt \ninnovative approaches to campaign finance reform on their own \ninitiative.\n  The McCain-Feingold reform bill goes a long way towards reforming the \ncampaign system. This amendment allows States to go even further. It \nwould allow States to use money from their own treasuries, to ensure \nthat campaigns are funded with clean money. Money that is free from the \ntaint of special interest.\n  As you well know, States have historically acted as engines of \nreform. Some States, including New Jersey, have adopted strong public \nfinancing systems allowing candidates a level playing field when \nseeking statewide office. However, when it comes to campaigns for \nFederal office, these States hands are tied. According to the Federal \nElection Campaign Act, Federal candidates are not allowed to take part \nin those financing systems.\n  This amendment is remarkably simple. It allows States to extend to \nFederal candidates public funding solutions already available to \ncandidates seeking State office.\n  The fundamental reason McCain-Feingold is important is that it holds \nthe promise to reduce the amount of dirty money in the campaign \nprocess, to reduce any appearance of impropriety on the part of \nrepresentatives elected to do the people's work. Some States have \nalready realized that public financing is the necessary next step in \nthe equation, that public money is clean money. However, states find \nthemselves restrained in enacting a solution.\n  This amendment will not cost the U.S. Government a penny. It does not \nmandate public financing in any way. In fact, the United States already \nprovides public support for candidates seeking the presidency. And this \namendment does not propose to extend the same financing to all Federal \ncandidates. Rather it allows States the freedom to offer public \nfinancing and a more level playing field for candidates seeking Federal \noffice. Do we allow States the freedom to determine the\n\n[[Page S2630]]\n\nformat of their own campaign finance systems? Or do we allow reform to \nend with McCain-Feingold, to end with the Congress?\n  New Jersey has an excellent public financing system for gubernatorial \ncandidates. Allowing the State to extend this system to include Federal \ncandidates holds a great deal of promise. In New Jersey, candidates \nseeking public financing agree to a funding cap that keeps pace with \ninflation. Then, for every dollar raised by the candidate, the State \nmatches him with two. When all is said and done, the candidate has to \ndo one-third of the fundraising. Imagine all the additional time you \ncould spend engaging with voters about the issues that affect their \nlives as opposed to overburdened with fundraising responsibilities. \nPoliticians can spend less time on the fundraising circuit and more \ntime on the campaign trail. The Democratic candidate for governor, \nMayor James McGreevey, stopped fundraising for the June primary in \nJanuary.\n  This amendment will allow States like New Jersey to pick up where \nMcCain-Feingold leaves off. It allows State governments to create a \ntruly level playing field in the States and serve as examples to the \nNation of realistic and forward-looking approaches to campaign finance \nreform. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, about the only thing more unpopular \nthan taxpayer funding of elections would be a congressional pay raise. \nThe American people hate, detest, and despise the notion that their tax \ndollars would be used to fund political campaigns. We have the biggest \nsurvey in the history of America on this very subject taken every April \n15 when Americans have an opportunity on their income tax returns to \ncheck off $3 of taxes they already owe to divert into the Presidential \nelection campaign fund.\n  This is not an add-on to their tax burden. This is $3 in taxes they \nalready owe. They have an option to divert that away from children's \nnutrition programs, or the national defense, or whatever might be \nconsidered worthwhile, into a fund that has been maintained since 1976, \nto pay for the campaigns for President of the United States and to buy \nbuttons and balloons for the national conventions.\n  So we have this massive survey every April 15 in which Americans get \nto vote on this very issue. The high water mark of American \nparticipation in the Presidential checkoff was 28.7 percent. That was \nin 1980--about 20 years ago. At that time, the high water mark, 28.7 \npercent, of Americans were willing to divert $1 of the taxes they \nalready owed into this fund. It has been consistently tracking down \nover the years to a point where about 10 years ago the Congress changed \nthe dollar checkoff to $3, so fewer and fewer people could divert \ngreater and greater amounts of money to try to make up for the \nshortfall that was occurring because of lack of participation, lack of \ninterest, and opposition to the Presidential publicly funded elections.\n  In the 2000 campaign just completed, the 2000 Presidential primary, \ncandidates were only able to receive a percentage of the matching funds \nthey were due that year, even with three of the Republican candidates--\nGovernor Bush, Steve Forbes, and Senator Hatch--not accepting taxpayer \nfunds. So they have had a problem, even with the $3 checkoff, dealing \nwith keeping this fund adequately up to snuff.\n  Now the other thing worthy of notice is, even if a State were to set \nup taxpayer funding of the election system, they could not \nconstitutionally deny this money to fringe and crackpot candidates. It \nis worth noting that over the history of the taxpayer-funded system for \nPresidential elections that began a quarter century ago, taxpayers \nponied up more than $1 billion overall, and $40 million of it has gone \nto candidates such as Lyndon LaRouche and Lenora Fulani. Larouche got \ntaxpayer money while he was still in jail.\n  It is important for my colleagues to understand that even if a State, \nwith concurrence of the candidates for Congress, decided to set up a \ntaxpayer-funded scheme for the election for the Senate in that \nparticular State, there would be no way, constitutionally, to restrict \nthose funds to just the candidates of the Republican Party and the \nDemocratic Party. So you would have an opportunity all across America \nto replicate the system we have had in the Presidential system, where \nfringe and crackpot candidates get money from the Treasury to pay for \ntheir campaigns for office.\n  I think this is really an issue that greatly separates many Senators \nphilosophically, as to whether or not reaching into the Treasury--\nwhether the Federal or State treasury--and providing subsidies for \npolitical candidates is a good idea. We used to call it food stamps for \npoliticians. In the early nineties, it was called vouchers. Candidates \nwere going to get taxpayer-paid vouchers for campaigns--food stamps for \npoliticians, for goodness' sake. Can you imagine how the American \npeople would feel about such an absurd idea?\n\n  So I certainly hope the Senate will not go on record as giving to the \nStates the option to squander tax dollars in such an absurd way. I have \nsome optimism about the bill we are currently debating, the McCain-\nFeingold bill, and I am authorized by Senator McCain to indicate that \nhe intends to oppose this amendment. He doesn't think it would add to \nthe underlying bill and go in the direction he would like.\n  So this is one of those rare occasions upon which Senator McCain and \nI will agree on an amendment, and we hope the overwhelming majority of \nthe Senate will agree that authorizing the use of tax dollars for \npolitical campaigns is a uniquely bad idea--and already tried. We have \nhad a 25-year experiment that has wasted over a billion dollars of \ntaxpayer dollars and funded fringe candidates, including those in jail, \nand to replicate that in any of our States, it seems to me, is a very \nbad idea.\n  I hope Members of the Senate will oppose this amendment which will be \nvoted upon shortly.\n  Are there any other Members who wish to speak?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, do we have any time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed all of his time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. All right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to say a few words on the \ntask at hand, namely reforming our campaign finance laws and doing it \nwithin the contours of the First Amendment of our Constitution. I fully \nappreciate that the issue of campaign finance is of growing concern to \nthe American electorate and has already played an important role in the \nrecent election. And I commend my colleagues, Senators McCain and \nFeingold for their bold leadership in an effort to address the public \nperception that our political system may be corrupt. At this time, I \nwill simply explain the limitations we all face in this endeavor. \nLimitations imposed by the cherished First Amendment of our \nconstitution. During the course of the coming days, I will more \nspecifically address the underlying legislation, and where in my \nanalysis of the law it falls short of meeting minimal constitutional \nrequirements. There are some bright lines drawn by the Supreme Court on \nthis issue and I will get to that.\n  The Founders of our country certainly understood the link between \nfree elections and liberty. Representative government--with the consent \nof the people registered in periodic elections--was--to these prescient \nleaders of the new nation--the primary protection of natural or \nfundamental rights. As Thomas Jefferson put it in the Declaration of \nIndependence, to secure rights ``Governments are instituted among Men'' \nand must derive ``their just Powers from the Consent of the Governed.''\n  That freedom of speech and press was considered by Madison to be \nvital in assuring that the electorate receives accurate information \nabout political candidates was demonstrated by his vehement arguments \nagainst the Alien and Sedition Acts in 1800. The Sedition Act, of \ncourse, in effect, made it a crime to criticize government or \ngovernment officials. Its passage was a black mark on our history.\n  Although the exact meaning or parameters of the First Amendment are \nnot clear, a thorough reading of Supreme Court jurisprudence provides \nconstructive guides for us in Congress.\n  Political speech is necessarily intertwined with electoral speech, \nparticularly the right of the people in election cycles to criticize or \nsupport their government. Indeed, the form of government established by \nthe Constitution is uniquely intertwined with freedom of speech. The \nvery structure of the Constitution itself establishes a representative \ndemocracy, which many observers, including myself, find to be a form of \ngovernment that would be meaningless without freedom to discuss \ngovernment and its policies.\n  To get to the heart of the matter being discussed today, I want to \nturn to the seminal Supreme Court case of Buckley v. Valeo.\n  In short, Buckley and its progeny stand for the following \npropositions: (1) money is speech; that is, electoral contributions and \nexpenditures are entitled to First Amendment protection; (2) \ncontributions are entitled to less protection than expenditures because \nthey create the appearance of corruption or quid pro quos; (3) express \nadvocacy is entitled to less deference than issue advocacy; (4) \ncorporate donations and corporate express advocacy expenditures may be \nrestricted; (5) political party independent expenditures may not be \nrestricted at least if not connected to a campaign; and (6) \nrestrictions on soft money are probably unconstitutional because soft \nmoney does not create the same problem of corruption from quid pro quos \nthat contributions bring. I will explain these further.\n  To understand why certain recent campaign finance reform measures, \nsuch as the well-intentioned McCain-Feingold bill, infringe on free \nspeech\n\n[[Page S2632]]\n\nand free elections, it is necessary to survey the Supreme Court's \ndecisions on campaign finance reform and the problems it brings to free \nspeech. The granddaddy of these cases is Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 \n(1976). Buckley established the free speech paradigm in which to weigh \nthe competing campaign reform proposals.\n  As my colleagues know well, two decades ago, in the wake of the \nWatergate scandal, Congress passed the Federal Election Campaign Act, \nor FECA. The Act imposed a comprehensive scheme of limitations on the \namount of money that can be given and spent in political campaigns. \nFECA capped contributions made to candidates and their campaigns, as \nwell as expenditures made to effect public issues, including those that \narise in a campaign. The Act also required public disclosure of money \nraised and spent in federal elections.\n  The Supreme Court in Buckley upheld against a First Amendment \nchallenge the limitation on contributions but not the limitations on \nexpenditures. The Court reasoned that contributions implicated only \nlimited free speech interests because contributions merely facilitated \nthe speech of others, i.e., candidates. Crucial to the Court's analysis \nwas its belief that limiting contributions was a legitimate \ngovernmental interest in preventing ``corruption'' or the ``appearance \nof corruption'' because such limitations would help prevent any single \ndonor from gaining a disproportionate influence with the elected \nofficial--the so-called ``quid pro quo'' effect. A similar interest \njustified mandatory public disclosure of political contributions above \nminimal amounts.\n\n  But Buckley reasoned that expenditures of money by the candidate or \nothers outside the campaign did not implicate the same governmental \ninterests because expenditures relate directly to free speech and are \nless likely to exert a quid pro quo. Therefore, to the Court, \nlimitations on expenditures could not be justified on any anti-\ncorruption rationale. Nor could they be justified by a theory--popular \nin radical circles--that limitations on expenditures, particularly on \nthe wealthy or powerful, equalize relative speaking power and ensure \nthat the voices of the masses will be heard.\n  The Court viewed such governmental attempts at balance as an \nabomination to free speech and held that this justification for \nrestraints on expenditures was ``wholly foreign to the First \nAmendment.'' It seems to me that such ``balance'' is, in reality, a \nform of suppression of certain viewpoints, a position that flies in the \nface of Justice Holmes' notion that the First Amendment prohibits \nsuppression of ideas because truth can only be determined in the \n``marketplace'' of competing ideas.\n  Significantly, the Supreme Court in Buckley held that any campaign \nfinance limitations apply only to ``communications that in express \nterms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate \nfor federal office.'' As we have heard before, a footnote to the \nopinion elaborated on what has later been termed ``express advocacy.'' \nTo the Court, communications that fall under FECA's purview must \ncontain ``magic words'' like ``vote for'' or ``elect'' or ``support'' \nor ``Smith for Congress'' or ``vote against'' or ``defeat'' or \n``reject.'' Communications without these electoral advocacy terms have \nsubsequently almost always been classified by courts as ``issue \nadvocacy'' entitled to full First Amendment strict scrutiny protection.\n  One important underpinning of the Buckley Court's view of the \nrelationship between the freedom of speech and elections is that money \nequates with speech. The Court in a fit of pragmatism recognized that \neffective speech requires money in the market place to compete.\n  But beyond looking at the purpose of campaign finance laws, it is \nclear that restrictions on political spending have the result of \nlimiting the amount and effectiveness of speech. Let me borrow \nProfessor Sullivan's example of a law restricting the retail price of a \nbook to no more than twenty dollars. To Justice Steven such a law is \nabout money and not about a particular book. But does not such a law \nlimit the amount and effectiveness of speech because it creates a \ndisincentive to write and publish such books. The Supreme Court has, as \nProfessor Sullivan pointed out, repeatedly held that financial \ndisincentives to specific content-based speech, just as much as direct \nprohibitions on such speech, trigger strict First Amendment review.\n  And I must emphasize that restrictions on campaign contributions and \nexpenditures cannot be justified as content neutral regulation. The \nBuckley Court rejected the example given by defenders of the \nregulations at hand that spending and contribution limits are similar \nto limiting the decibel level on a sound truck and do not stop the \ntruck from broadcasting. The Court rejected that analogy because, to \nthe Court, decibel limits aim at protecting the eardrums of the closest \nlistener, not at preventing the sound truck from reaching a larger \naudience. To the Court, unlike decibel limits, limits on campaign \nexpenditures and contributions do restrict the communicative \neffectiveness of speech. The Court was right.\n  Buckley's other key underpinning is its ``strict scrutiny\" \njustification of the restrictions on direct contributions to campaigns \nas needed to combat ``corruption'' and the ``appearance of \ncorruption''--in other words ``quid pro quo'' exchanges. This has been \ncriticized by the congressional reformers not as over-inclusive, but \nironically as under-inclusive. I believe the underlying bill goes much \nfurther than Buckley.\n  If Buckley v. Valeo established the skeleton of First Amendment \nprotection of the electoral process from onerous regulation, Buckley's \nprogeny filled in the flesh. Let me mention a few of the main cases.\n  In First National Bank v. Bellotti, decided in 1978, the Supreme \nCourt reaffirmed its view in Buckley that expenditures for issues are \ndirectly related to expression of political ideas and are, thus, on a \nhigher plane of constitutional values requiring the strictest of \nscrutiny. Bellotti found a Massachusetts law that prohibited \n``corporations from making contributions or expenditures for the \npurpose of . . . influencing or affecting the vote on any question \nsubmitted to the voters'' unconstitutional because it infringed both \n(1) the First Amendment right of the corporations to engage in issue \nadvocacy and, (2) the First Amendment right of citizens to ``public \naccess to discussion, debate, and the dissemination of information and \nideas.''\n  Bellotti did not involve restrictions on corporate donations to \ncandidates. The Court distinguished between portions of the law \n``prohibiting or limiting corporate contributions to political \ncandidates or committees, or other means of influencing candidate \nelections''--which were not challenged-- and provisions ``prohibiting \ncontributions and expenditures for the purpose of influencing . . . \nquestions submitted to voters,'' i.e., issue advocacy. The Court \nexplained that the concern that justified the former ``was the problem \nof corruption of elected representatives through creation of political \ndebts'' and that the latter ``presents no comparable problem'' because \nit involved contributions and expenditures that would be used for issue \nadvocacy rather than communication that expressly advocate the election \nor defeat of a candidate.\n  In Citizens Against Rent Control/Coalition for Fair Housing v. \nBerkeley, the Court once again gave full panoply of protection to \nexpenditures linked to communication of ideas. In this case the Court \ninvalidated a city ordinance that limited to $250 contributions to \ncommittees formed solely to support or oppose ballot measures submitted \nto popular vote. The Court held that it is an impairment of freedom of \nexpression to place limits on contributions which in turn directly \nlimit expenditures used to communicate political ideas, without a \nshowing of the ``corruption'' element laid out in Buckley.\n  In Federal Election Commission v. National Conservative Political \nAction Committee, the Court once again relied on Buckley's distinction \nbetween expenditures and contributions, with the former receiving full \nfirst amendment protection. The Court invalidated a section of the \nPresidential Election Campaign Fund Act which made it a criminal \noffense for an independent political committee or PAC to spend more \nthan $1000 to further the election of a Presidential candidate who \nelects to receive public funding. The Court\n\n[[Page S2633]]\n\nheld that the PAC's independent expenditures were constitutionally \nprotected because they ``produce speech at the core of the first \namendment.''\n  One year later, in Federal Election Commission v. Massachusetts \nCitizens for Life, Inc., decided in 1986, the Supreme Court clarified \nthe distinction between issue and express advocacy, holding that an \nexpenditure must constitute express advocacy in order to be subject to \nFECA's prohibition against the use of corporate treasury funds to make \nan expenditure ``in connection with'' any Federal election. In this \ncase, the Court held that a publication urging voters to vote for \n``pro-life'' candidates, that the publication identified, fell into the \ncategory of express advocacy. But the Court refused to apply FECA's \nprohibition in this case to MCFL--Massachusetts Citizens for Life, \nInc.--because the organization was not a business organization. The \nCourt noted that ``[g]roups such as MCFL . . . do not pose . . . danger \nof corruption. MCFL was formed to disseminate political ideas, not to \namass capital.''\n  Just 5 years ago, the Supreme Court, in Colorado Republican Federal \nCampaign Committee v. FEC addressed the issue of whether party ``hard \nmoney'' used to purchase an advertising campaign attacking the other \nparty's likely candidate, but uncoordinated with its own party's \nnominee's campaign, fell within FECA's restrictions on party \nexpenditures. A fractured Court agreed that applying FECA's restriction \nto the expenditures in question violated the first amendment.\n  A plurality of the Court--Justices Breyer, O'Connor, and Souter--\nbased their holding on the theory that the expenditure at hand had to \nbe treated as an independent expenditure entitled to first amendment \nprotection, not as a ``coordinated'' expenditure or express advocacy, \nwhich may be restricted. It is significant to note that Justice Thomas, \njoined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Scalia, concurred in the \njudgment, but would abolish Buckley's distinction between protected \nexpenditures and unprotected contributions, believing that both \nimplicated core expression central to the first amendment.\n  As a plurality of the Court noted, because any soft money used to \nfund a Federal campaign must comport with the contribution limits \nalready in place, soft money does not result in the actuality or the \nappearance of quid pro quo ``corruption'' warranting intrusions on core \nfree speech protected by the first amendment. In any event, it is my \nview that such soft money activities such as voter registration drives, \nvoter identification, and get-out-the-vote drives, as well as \ncommunication with voters that do not fall within express advocacy, are \nprotected by the first amendment's freedom of association--the right to \nfreely associate with a party, union, or association--as well as by \nfree speech.\n  Finally, there is the very recent case of Nixon, just last year. I \nremember that when this case was decided, proponents of so-called \ncampaign finance reform gloated that this case supported their \npositions. In my view, all the case did was extend Buckley's \nrestrictions on contributions to State campaign finance laws. The Court \nrejected a challenge to Missouri's contribution restriction as too \nlimited because it did not take into account inflation. The Court held \nthat Buckley demonstrated the dangers of corruption stemming from \ncontributions and that there was sufficient evidence in the record to \nsupport the conclusion that Missouri's campaign contribution limit \naddressed the appearance of corruption. The case did not address the \nissues of independent expenditures, issue advocacy, or soft money \nexpenditures.\n  As I noted at the outset, Buckley and its progeny stand for the \nfollowing propositions: No. 1, money is speech; that is, electoral \ncontributions and expenditures are entitled to first amendment \nprotection; No. 2, contributions are entitled to less protection than \nexpenditures because they create the appearance of corruption or quid \npro quos; No. 3, express advocacy is entitled to less deference than \nissue advocacy; No. 4, corporate donations and corporate express \nadvocacy expenditures may be restricted; No. 5, political party \nindependent expenditures may not be restricted at least if not \nconnected to a campaign; and, No. 6, restrictions on soft money are \nprobably unconstitutional because soft money does not create the same \nproblem of corruption from quid pro quos that contributions bring.\n\n  I am concerned that the practical result of the limitation on \ncontributions is that candidates must seek contributions from a larger \nset of donors. This means that candidates are spending a greater amount \nof time raising money than would otherwise be the case. This is \naggravated by the need for a lot of money in general to compete in \nAmerican elections, given our large electoral districts, statewide \nelections, and weak political parties, which require candidates to fund \ndirect communications to the electorate. The rising costs of elections \nare further aggravated by the rising importance of expensive televison \nadvertising and the use of political consultants, with their reliance \non polling and focus groups. Elections have become a money chase.\n  Ironically, this is the major complaint of the reformers. Their \ninitial FECA reforms have caused the problems they are now complaining \nabout. First, PAC money, and now soft money, are the result of \nlimitations on contributions. Let's not kid ourselves. Like pressurized \ngas, money will always find a crevice of escape. In other words, money \nwill always find a loophole. All that the FECA and courts have \naccomplished is to encourage the substitution of contributions to \ncandidates for contributions and expenditures made to and by \norganizations such as political parties or advocacy groups. These \norganizations are less accountable to the voter. The net result is the \ngrowth of yet another huge government bureaucracy to police an \ninherently unworkable scheme.\n  Furthermore, if one believes, as I do, the efficacy of Justice \nHolmes' free speech model of a ``marketplace of competing ideas,'' it \nis impermissible to drown out or even ban corporate speech or the \nspeech of the wealthy, as some advocate. If the remedy for ``bad'' \nspeech is not censorship, but ``more'' speech, then the remedy for \ncorporate speech is likewise not censorship, but more noncorporate \nspeech.\n  It should be obvious that in the electoral sphere the wealthy and \npowerful have no monopoly over speech. This is not analogous to Turner \nBroadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, where the Court in part upheld the \ncongressional requirement that cable operators carry a certain \npercentage of local broadcasting of local programs on their lines \nbecause cables' monopoly power choked the broadcast competitors. Unlike \nthe open access rule in that case, limitations on contributions offer \nno guarantee that the market power of speech will be redistributed from \nthe wealthy to the poor. Such spending limits will not stop wealthy \ncandidates like Ross Perot from spending personal wealth or the rich \nfrom influencing mass media through direct ownership or through the \npurchase of advertisements. Surely, no one would advocate that we \nattach an income test to the first amendment.\n  The wealthy will always have substitutes for electoral speech. \nMoreover, the success of the labor unions and voluntary associations as \ncompetitors in the market place of ideas demonstrate that limitations \non contributions from the wealthy and on corporate speech are \nunnecessary.\n  In my view, a far better, though, admittedly not perfect, solution--\none that I believe is both workable and is consistent with the dictates \nof the first amendment--is a campaign system that requires complete \ndisclosure of funds contributed to candidates or used to finance \nexpress advocacy by independent associations, political parties, \ncorporations, unions, or individual in connection with an election.\n  A system of complete disclosure would bring the disinfectant of \nsunshine to the system. The Democrats will audit the Republicans and \nthe Republicans will scrutinize the Democrats. And outside public \ninterest groups and the media will police both. The winner will be the \npublic. They will be able to make their own assessments. As I have said \nbefore, one man's greedy special interest is another man's organization \nfighting for truth and justice.\n  To the extent that our campaign finance laws require updating, we \nneed to find a constitutionally sound manner of doing so. We need to \nproceed\n\n[[Page S2634]]\n\nwith care and caution when acting on legislation that would have the \nimpact of regulating freedom or of placing government at the center of \ndetermining what is acceptable election speech and what is not. And, we \nneed to pass legislation that, above all, keeps the power of American \nelections where it rightfully belongs--in the hands of the voters \nthemselves.\n  Let me again commend my friends, Senators McCain and Feingold, for \ntheir leadership on this issue. Without their efforts and tenacity and \npushing this issue, we probably would not be discussing this important \nmatter. They deserve a lot of credit. Even though I disagree and have \ndone so very publicly, I still have a lot of respect for my two \ncolleagues.\n  It is important to publicly air these issues, especially given the \nunfortunate perception of the problems in Washington.\n  We can achieve needed reform here. Such reform lies in expanded \ndisclosures. With free and open disclosure of contributions, the public \nwill be fully able to decide for itself what is legitimate. I look \nforward to helping my colleagues in achieving reforms that will be \nconstitutional and effective.\n  Today, I rise to introduce an amendment as a substitute to section \n304 of the McCain/Feingold campaign finance reform bill of 2001.\n  Thomas Jefferson, in 1779, wrote that ``to compel a man to furnish \ncontributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he \ndisbelieves and abhors, is sinful and tyrannical.'' That was true then, \nand it remains true today.\n  As I will discuss later, section 304 of the McCain-Feingold bill that \npurports to be a ``Beck'' fix is wholly inadequate. Thus, I rise today \nto protect the rights of working men and women in this country to be \nable to decide for themselves which political causes they wish to \nsupport.\n  Some will choose to make this a complicated issue by arguing the \nintricacies of the Supreme Court Case, Communications Workers of \nAmerica v. Beck, but it is really quite straight forward--it's about \nfairness. In certain states, as a condition of employment, there are \nrequirements to join or pay dues to a labor organization. Let me make \nclear at the outset that I am a strong supporter of collective \nbargaining when employees voluntarily choose to be represented by a \nlabor organization.\n  But I seriously doubt that even one of my colleagues would suggest \nthat the Government should force any American to speak in favor of \ncauses in which he or she does not believe. Yet, we as Members of the \nU.S. Senate, currently stand by and allow our friends and constituents \nto be forced into speech because of their compulsory financial \nrelationship with a union.\n  I would like to know which of my colleagues would support any \nprovision of law that would mandate an individual's financial \ninvolvement in a practice that was fundamentally at variance with their \nown beliefs. I dare say that there would not be many Members from \neither side of the aisle who would advocate the arbitrary usurpation of \nfundamental freedoms like that of speech. But this is exactly what \nhappens to our union members and dues paying non-members.\n  Individuals who belong to or are represented by labor unions \nfinancially commit themselves to causes and candidates that may be \ncompletely against their own. We force individuals to subvert their \nrights of political expression to those of the unions.\n  My amendment is quite simple and straightforward. It has two parts: \nPart one requires a labor organization to obtain ``separate, prior, \nwritten, voluntary authorization'' before assessing ``any dues \ninitiation fee, or other payment if any part of such dues, fee, or \nother payment will be used for political activities''. Part two \nrequires that a labor organization disclose to its membership how it \nhas allocated and spent the portion of a members or nonmembers dues and \nfees that went to political activity.\n  Nothing can be more fair than to inform working men and women which \ncauses they are supporting. It is just that simple.\n  Let me also point out to my colleagues that this amendment also \ncovers individuals who are shareholders in a corporation. It requires \nthat a corporation gain prior consent from its shareholders before \nspending resources from the corporation's general treasury on political \nactivity. It also requires that a corporation disclose to its \nshareholders which political activity it contributes to. This amendment \nplaces corporations and labor organizations on equal ground and levels \nthe playing field.\n  I feel that it is important to note that there is a fundamental \ndifference between the compulsory way that a labor organization \nassesses its dues and fees from members and nonmembers and the \ncompletely voluntary manner a shareholder opts into purchasing stock. \nBut in past debates, my colleagues from the other side of the aisle \nhave cried foul and claimed that treating labor and corporations \ndifferently wasn't fair. Well we now have an amendment that takes care \nof that particular concern.\n\n  It is simply imperative and pretty basic that union should obtain \nconsent to use the funds they receive prior to any use other than for \ncollective bargaining, contract administration, or grievance \nadjustment. After all, if consent is to mean anything, then it must be \nreceived before the money is spent. After the fact is simply too late \nand means no consent was given for the ``activity.'' Let me state it \nagain because I think this fact is vital to creating a fair and \nmeaningful fix to this problem--effective consent must be given before \nthe funds are used.\n  My amendment is a commonsense solution to an important problem \npertinent to the lives of many Americans. The solution--consent before \nspending.\n  I said that real consent is prior consent. Let me give you an \nexample. The Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act \nof 1999--better known as the Digital Signature Act--legalized digital \nelectronic contracts. The act allows an individual to enter into a \nbinding contract without ever having to leave the comfort of his home \nthrough the use of a so-called digital signature.\n  When the Digital Signature Act was first introduced, many of my \nDemocratic colleagues had serious reservations about it. They argued \nthat the bill lacked basic, but extremely important, consumer \nprotection provisions. They argued that the bill must include effective \nconsumer consent provisions. Critics of the bill worried that an \nunsuspecting consumer might receive an unsolicited e-mail with the \ninclusion of an electronic signature therefore making the contract \nlegally enforceable. To prevent this sort of unwanted solicitation of \nbusiness, many of my Democratic colleagues advocated that a consumer \nmust first consent to receive the contract electronically.\n  My amendment seeks to extend similar rights to workers that the \nDigital Signature Act granted consumers. We should allow workers the \nsame fundamental rights that my Democratic colleagues demanded be \ngranted to individuals who enter in a contact over the Internet.\n  We must allow America's working men and women these very fundamental \nrights. American workers should have the right to have meaningful and \ninformed consent over the expenditure of their dues, fees, or payment \nmade to their union. Without these rights we are in essence creating \ndifferent classes of society--those who are free to determine which \npolitical groups they will support and those who are not.\n  I hope that my colleagues will agree with me that the standards for \nmeaningful and informed consent we extended to consumers under the \nDigital Signature Act must also be provided to workers and \nshareholders. We must allow workers to consent to the use of their \nunion dues on any expenditures other than collective bargaining, \ncontract administration, or grievance. This consent must be provided in \na manner that verifies the workers or shareholder's capacity to access \nclear and conspicuous information of their rights, receive regular \ndisclosures of these expenditures, and maintain the right to revoke \ntheir consent at any time.\n\n  Let me pause to ask a couple of questions. If your friend wants to \nborrow your car, shouldn't he ask beforehand? If he doesn't, then it's \na crime. Wouldn't it be odd to have a system in place that requires you \nto lend the car and then file a form for its return? Why\n\n[[Page S2635]]\n\nshould the unions be allowed to take from the people who pay dues \nwithout getting their consent first? By adopting this amendment, we can \nhelp all Americans. It is fairer and more equitable to obtain consent \nbefore the dues are spent. That is the right way of doing things.\n  Unions have the right, like any other organization, to spend the dues \nand fees it collects for purposes such as campaigns, issue ads, and a \nhost of additional political and other activities. I support their \nright. What is disconcerting about the current situation is that many \nemployees who are effectively forced to pay dues and fees may disagree \nwith the positions taken and not wish to support them.\n  Now some have suggested that section 304 takes care of the so called \nBeck problems and codifies Beck.\n  Unfortunately, the proposed section 304 of the McCain-Feingold bill \ndoes not require prior consent. Nor does it codify the Beck decision, \nas it purports to do. Section 304 is far narrower than the holding in \nBeck. The Supreme Court clearly held in Beck that any expenditures \noutside of collective bargaining, contract administration, or grievance \nadjustment must be returned to the non-union employee upon request of \nthe objecting employee. However, section 304 only prohibits unions from \nusing non-union employee dues for ``political activities unrelated to \ncollective bargaining''--an ambiguous phrase that is not defined in \nthat section.\n  Because section 304 is so narrowly drafted, it would allow unions to \nuse non-union dues for soft money non-collective bargaining \nexpenditures, such as get-out-the-vote campaigns and other political \nactivities, by simply avoiding the label ``political.'' By masquerading \nthe activity as one for ``educational purposes,'' a union could use \ndues for blatantly political activities such as informing union members \non what pro-union stand political candidates take.\n  Again, I recognize the unions' right to engage in any political \nactivity that they find appropriate. The more political speech the \nbetter as far as I'm concerned. But, we need to protect the fundamental \nright of the workers to know that activities and what type of issues \ntheir money is being used for, and the ability for them to decide if \nthey wish to support the activity.\n  Mr. President, the American worker faces a hidden tax at just the \nmoment the worker cannot afford it. And the American worker has less \nsay in where his money goes to than just about any group. In fact, an \nargument can be made that section 304 of the McCain-Feingold bill \nactually does the exact opposite of what its intentions are.\n  Under current law, dues paying non members may object to the use of \nportion of their dues that is spent for purposes other than or non-\nessential to collective bargaining. If the McCain-Feingold bill were to \npass, those same dues-paying-non-members would only be permitted \nto object to use of the portion of their dues spent only for \n``political purposes unrelated to collective bargaining.'' This \ndifference might sound subtle but is anything but.\n\n  Mr. President, my amendment is a modest measure of fundamental \nfairness. It embodies a very simple concept--fairness. American's men \nand women work hard every day. They have earned the right to know how \ntheir money is being spent for certain political purposes, causes, and \nactivities. The disclosure and second part of this amendment does \nnothing more than require a report by labor organizations to be filed \nwith the Federal Election Commission and given to workers represented \nby unions, showing how much of their union dues and fees are being \nspent on the political process.\n  I have to say that this amendment does not impose overly burdensome \nor onerous requirements on the unions. This is basic information, and \nit should be freely provided. I cannot believe that the union \nleadership have a legitimate interest in keeping secret what political \ncauses and activities employee dues and fees are being spent to \nsupport. If employees learn how their money is being spent in the \npolitical process, unions will enjoy an even greater confidence level \nin their decision making.\n  With the addition of this amendment to the McCain-Feingold bill we \nwill ensure that every American is treated equally under the law and \nextended the rights and freedoms that are fundamental under the \nConstitution. I urge my colleagues to thoughtfully consider this \namendment and vote for its passage.\n  I reserve the remainder of any time I may have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD. I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from North \nCarolina, Mr. Edwards.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong support \nfor the McCain-Feingold bill, to add my encouragement and praise for \nall the hard work done by Senators McCain and Feingold, and to say how \nimportant this issue is to our democracy, to our Government, and to the \nAmerican people.\n  I would not presume to suggest to my colleagues who serve with me in \nthe Senate that I have any more knowledge about the way the political \nfinancing system in this country works than they do. They are all \nexperts at it. What I say is that this debate is not about us. Instead, \nit is about the people we were sent here to represent.\n  I have heard, both in the media and in the course of the debate, lots \nof discussion about some strategic advantage that may flow to one \nparty, or one Senator or another, as a result of this bill. What I say \nabout that argument is that thirty years from now, the American people \nwill not judge what we do in these 2 weeks based upon some transitory, \nstrategic advantage that one party or another may gain as a result of \nthe McCain-Feingold bill. Instead, they are going to judge us based on \nwhat we did for our Government, for our democracy, and what we did to \nallow voters, ordinary Americans, to once again believe they have some \nownership in this democracy. That ultimately is what it is all about.\n  I say to colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, that whatever in \nthe long term is good for our democracy is good for either the \nDemocratic or the Republican Party. I think that is the test we should \nuse in making judgments about what ought to be done.\n  During the course of my time in the Senate, I have held many townhall \nmeetings around North Carolina, and over and over I hear the same \nrefrain--folks believe that they no longer have a voice in their own \ndemocracy and, as a result, they don't feel any ownership in this \nGovernment. So Washington is some faraway place, and they don't think \nthey do anything to help them. They think it is just some bureaucratic \ninstitution that has nothing to do with their day-to-day lives. More \nimportant, they feel impotent to do anything about it.\n  The folks I grew up with in smalltown North Carolina, oddly enough, \nthink if somebody writes a $300,000 or $500,000 check to a political \nparty, or for a particular election, when they go to the polls and \nvote, their voices will not be equally heard. I think that is just good \ncommon sense, and there is a reason people think that way. This is an \nissue we need to do something about. A lot of it is perception but \nperception matters. It really matters when people believe this isn't \ntheir Government. It is their democracy; it belongs to them, not to \nsome special interest group, and not to the people who are up here \nrepresenting them. In fact, it belongs to the American people.\n  A couple of examples, Mr. President: We are in the process right now \nof trying to pass an HMO reform bill. Senator McCain, Senator Kennedy, \nand I, and Congressmen Norwood, Dingell, and Ganske on the House side \nhave introduced the same bill. Our legislation, which provides basic \npatient protection rights to every single American who is covered by \ninsurance or HMOs, is supported by every health insurance group that \nhas been fighting for patient protection for the last 5 years. The only \npeople we have been able to identify on the other side are the big HMOs \nand insurance companies.\n  Unfortunately, the big HMOs and insurance companies are very well \nrepresented in Washington, and their voice is heard loudly and clearly. \nIt is really important for the voice of the American people to be heard \non issues such as basic patient rights. Then I read in the newspaper \ntoday that at\n\n[[Page S2636]]\n\nleast it appears there is going to be some pulling back of the \nregulation of arsenic in drinking water. These are the kinds of things \nthat, when folks around the country see them, cause them concern, and \nthey particularly cause concern--even though they may not see a direct \nrelationship--they particularly cause them to be worried when they know \nthe way political campaigns are financed in this country, and they know \nthat lots of huge, unregulated soft money contributions are being made \nto political campaigns in every election cycle.\n  So the question is, What do we do to return power in this democracy \nto where it started and made our country so great and where it belongs \ntoday?\n  We are trying to do two basic things in this bill. One is to ban soft \nmoney--we talked about it at length--these unregulated, totally \nuncontrolled contributions made by special interests, corporations, \nmany different groups, and individuals.\n  The simple answer is, it ought to be banned, and it ought to be \nbanned today. We will talk at length later about constitutional issues, \nbut it is black and white to anyone who has read Buckley v. Valeo and \nspecifically applies the analysis of that case to a soft money ban. \nThere is absolutely no question that a ban on soft money is \nconstitutional under Buckley v. Valeo. We will talk about that at \nlength at a later time.\n  The second issue is these bogus sham issue ads. In addition to the \nfact folks see all this money flowing into the system, they feel \ncynical, they feel they do not own their Government anymore, and that \nthey have no voice in democracy.\n  In addition to that, they turn on their televisions in the last 2 \nmonths before an election and see mostly hateful, negative, personal \nattack ads posing as issue ads. Any normal American with any common \nsense knows these are pure campaign ads. Those are the ads we are \ntrying to stop.\n  Senator Snowe actually said it very well when she said these ads are \na masquerade. In fact, they are more than a masquerade, they are a \nsham, they are a fraud on the American people, and they are nothing but \na means to avoid the legitimate election laws of this country.\n  We are trying to put an end to these so-called issue ads that are \nnothing but campaign ads. It is another issue that needs to be \naddressed. All this--these issue ads that are nothing but sham ads, \nreally campaign ads, unregulated flow of soft money into campaigns--all \nthis is about a very simple thing. It is not about us. It is not about \nthe people in Washington. It is not about the people in this Congress. \nIt is about the people we were sent to represent. We need to be able to \nsay 20, 30 years from now when we are not around anymore--at least some \nof us will not be around anymore--we need to be able to say to our \nchildren and our families that we did the right thing; we did what was \nbest for the country, and we did what was best for the democracy.\n  We will talk about this issue later, but it is also clear that Snowe-\nJeffords, under the constitutional test established in Buckley v. \nValeo, is constitutional. There are only two requirements that have to \nbe met: One, that there be compelling State interest under Buckley. The \nCourt has already held that what we are doing in these sham issue ads \nand with soft money is a compelling State interest because of the need \nto avoid corruption or, more importantly, in this case, the appearance \nof corruption.\n  Second, the legislation has to be narrowly tailored. That has been \ninterpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court to mean it is not too broad, not \nsubstantially overbroad. Snowe-Jeffords does exactly that. It is very \nnarrowly tailored. Two months before the general election, it requires \nthe likeness of the candidate or the name of the candidate to be used \nand only applies to broadcast ads.\n  The empirical evidence shows very clearly that something around 1 \npercent of the ads are not covered by that, actually issue ads that \nfall within that category. Ninety-nine percent of the ads in the last \nelection cycle, in fact, were campaign ads.\n  What that empirical evidence supports is the notion that not only \ndoes it appear that Snowe-Jeffords is narrowly tailored, in fact, the \noverwhelming evidence is that it is narrowly tailored, which is exactly \nwhat the Buckley U.S. Supreme Court decision required. We will talk \nabout this later as we discuss these various provisions.\n\n  The bottom line is, both the soft money ban and Snowe-Jeffords are \nconstitutional and meet the constitutional requirements of Buckley v. \nValeo.\n  In conclusion, I thank the Senators who have worked so hard on this \nissue for so long. I say to my colleagues, I hope that instead of \nfocusing on some strategic advantage that a particular campaign may \nhave, or a particular political party may have, that instead we will \nfocus on what is best for democracy and what is best for the American \npeople.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, how much time remains on the opponents' \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opponents have 80 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield 3 minutes to my good friend from Arizona, the \nauthor of the underlying bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Hatch for a valiant \nattempt at trying to balance this problem about so-called paycheck \nprotection and corporations. Unfortunately, he is not having any more \nsuccess than we did when we attempted to try to strike that balance as \nwell.\n  The bill, very briefly, strikes our codification of the Beck \nprovision. It has no regulatory mechanism, and it has no methodology \nfor who would enforce it and how.\n  It says in his amendment that ``expressly advocate support for \nopposition to a candidate.'' What does that mean?\n  It talks about as far as corporations are concerned, ``use funds from \nits general treasury for the purpose of political activity.'' What is \nthe general treasury? The stock market value? The cash on hand? The \nmoney that is being disbursed?\n  This, unfortunately, is an amendment which clearly cannot adequately \ndefine what a stockholder's involvement is. Again, suppose a \nstockholder said his or her stock money could not be used and then, of \ncourse, the stock is split or the stock is sold or there is a reduction \nin the amount of the budget. Who gets what money? Who regulates it?\n  Very frankly, I am in sympathy with the Senator from Utah because we \ntried to address this issue. It is just well nigh impossible and \ncertainly is not addressed in any kind of parity or specificity in this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I will be moving to table this amendment at the \nappropriate time. I would like to work with the Senator from Utah to \nsee how we can obtain some kind of parity, although I point out, as I \nsaid before, the paycheck protection in this permission or \nnonpermission really is not what this campaign finance reform is all \nabout because if you ban the soft money; you ban the corporate check; \nyou ban the union check; you ban the union leader from giving a \nmillion-dollar check; you ban the corporate leader from giving the \ncheck. When you ban soft money, then all they can do is give a $1,000 \ncheck for themselves or $1,000 from their friends.\n\n  Later on, I am sure there will be some specific questions about the \nlanguage in this bill. It is nonspecific, it is unenforceable, and it \nis in such an amorphous state, very frankly, it is meaningless. I \nbelieve my time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague. I intend to speak about this \namendment at some future point in the debate. In the meantime, I \nrecognize my friend and colleague from Massachusetts. How much time \ndoes he need? Fifteen minutes?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I can start with 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield 15 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to ask my friend and colleague \nfrom Utah some questions, if he will be good enough to answer some \nquestions.\n  Since 99.7 percent of American for-profit corporations are privately \nheld, how does this amendment apply to them?\n\n[[Page S2637]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. It applies to every corporation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It cannot because you refer to those that have \nstockholders, page 2. Since 99 percent of the corporations do not have \nthem, then they are not covered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I do not know a corporation that does not have \nstockholders, whether they be private or public.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am telling you they do not, so effectively your \namendment does not apply to the 99.7 percent under your definition.\n  We always get these amendments maybe a half an hour beforehand.\n  In our review, the Senator's amendment excludes 99.7 percent of all \ncorporations.\n  Another question I have----\n  Mr. HATCH. Can I answer the Senator, since he asked the question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. These are of the businesses----\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield so I can answer his question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. OK.\n  Mr. HATCH. My amendment covers every corporation. There are a lot of \nprivate corporations, but they are still corporations.\n  Let's face it. The major thrust of my amendment is towards public \ncorporations which has been complained of from time to time by Senators \non both sides of the aisle. I am trying to cover both unions and \ncorporations so we have an equal protection program.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator may be attempting, but that is not what the \nlanguage says.\n  On page 2, it says under ``Prohibition.--Except with the separate, \nprior, written, voluntary authorization of a stockholder, in case of a \ncorporation''--and once we have 99 percent of the businesses, according \nto Dun & Bradstreet, not covered by the stockholders, they are even, by \nmere definition, excluded.\n  Last week more than 6.7 billion shares were traded in the New York \nStock Exchange. How were those covered? Would the Senator's amendment \napply to just the stockholders included last week?\n  Mr. HATCH. My amendment would cover the stockholders who existed on \nthe day the request for the expenditures was made.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. In your amendment, you talk about cycle; you don't talk \nabout day. A cycle is generally referred, under the Federal Election \nCommission, to be the whole 2-year-period. We are talking about these \ntransitions in terms of stockholders just from 1 day. I am wondering \nhow the permission for stockholders would be met in those \ncircumstances.\n  Mr. HATCH. We are talking about violations of the Federal Election \nCampaign Act. The FEC would have the job of determining the regulations \napplicable under the circumstances. The amendment is quite clear what \nwe are trying to get after; that is, trying to give stockholders and \nunion members a right to have some say in the way unions spend, in the \ncase of unions, and corporations, in the way corporations spend on \nbehalf of shareholders.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It is the position of Senators McCain and Feingold that \nis done under the codification of the Beck decision in the first place.\n  You talk about the parity between corporations and unions. Yet on \npage 3 you say ``for any corporation described in this section to use \nfunds from its general treasury.'' So you are talking about the use of \nfunds by corporations.\n  But on the other hand, if it is a labor organization, you are talking \nabout collecting or assessing such employees' dues or initiation fees \nor other payments. On the one hand, you require one criteria for \ncorporations for expenditures, and on the other hand, for the unions, \nyou have an entirely different definition.\n  Can you explain why you favor corporations in your language to the \ndisadvantage of unions? Why do we have such a disparity in this when \nyou tried to represent to the Senate that you are trying to be \nevenhanded?\n  Mr. HATCH. What are we talking about?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would you look at this language and tell me if I am \nwrong? I think it is very important. You are representing this is \nevenhanded. This is not evenhanded. We want to understand why it isn't \nevenhanded or the Senator should admit it isn't, if you are trying \neffectively to gut the representatives of working families.\n  Mr. HATCH. I don't think the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \nis wrong in what he is saying. I don't think you are wrong in your \ninterpretation of the language, but the bill treats the union members \nand their dues in the separate context of shareholders and their value \nin a corporation.\n  The regulations will have to be set by the Federal Election \nCommission pursuant to this amendment. It is equal in treatment because \nwhat we are trying to do is give the shareholders in the case of \ncorporations a right to have some say in how the assets of a \ncorporation are used, in proportion to their shares in a corporation. \nNaturally, these situations are not analogous, and for the union \nmember, how the dues of the union member are spent by the unions.\n\n  The Senator's characterization of the McCain-Feingold language is \ninaccurate, and I think I more than indicated that in my opening \nremarks with regard to the Beck case. Actually, the McCain-Feingold \nlanguage narrows the Beck case.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I could reclaim my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, what we are seeing very clearly is not \nwhat is being stated by the Senator from Utah but what is included in \nthe language. That is what we are voting on. In the language of the \namendment, it is very clear on page 2 that in the case of a \ncorporation, to each of its shareholders, it is less than 2 percent of \nall businesses that have shareholders.\n  For the shareholders, we see how the velocity of the transitions of \nshareholders--we find there is a different criteria that is used for \nunions, different from corporations.\n  On the first page, it talks about any corporation or labor \norganization. Taking the case of a labor organization, it must submit a \nwritten report for such cycle--that is 2 years; in the case of a labor \norganization, to each employee. Now, that is to each employee. There \nare 13 million members of the trade union movement. Those who are \nmembers, of course, bargain. Several million more are covered, \ngenerally, by political activity.\n  Listen to what they have to have for every individual. They will have \nto receive a report from the organization. On page 4, what will be \nincluded: ``Internal and external communications relating to''--it will \nbe interesting to hear the definition of what is related--``specific \ncandidates, political causes,''--this is a new word.\n  What in the world is a ``political cause''? Generally, a political \ncause is in the eye of the beholder. What do they mean by political \ncause?\n  They have to send to every employee--that is what this says--the \ninternal and external communications relating to specific candidates.\n  Who are specific candidates? What do we think are the specific \ncandidates? According to the Federal Election Commission, every Member \nof Congress is defined as a candidate, 435 House Members, 100 Senators.\n  Any communication that is internal or external relating to--whatever \nthat means--political candidates, political causes and committees of \npolitical parties.\n  If you don't, you have the criminal penalties included under the \nFederal Elections Commission where people can go to jail for failing to \nfile these reports which are so voluminous.\n  This amendment is poorly drafted. It doesn't even do what the \nproponents of this amendment are attempting to do. It is one sided. It \nis targeted. The aim of this proposal is very clear. It doesn't apply \nto any of the other independent groups. It doesn't apply to the \nNational Rifle Association. They don't have to conform with it. The \nSierra Club doesn't have to; Right to Life doesn't have to. It is just \nto corporations. But only less than 2 percent of the corporations have \nto apply, and every union.\n  In terms of every activity or potential activity and every \nexpenditure for every member, not only at the national level, the State \nlevel and local level have to get the reports. Every member has to get \nthe report. It is absolutely nonworkable.\n  Finally, what are these activities? On page 5, the term ``political \nactivity''\n\n[[Page S2638]]\n\nmeans voter registration activity. Many of us have tried to encourage \nvoter registration. In fact, labor unions are involved in that. Not \nmany companies or corporations are. I wish they would be. Some of them \nhave been, but they won't be any longer if this passes. They won't be \ncontributing to any local group, to the League of Women Voters or other \ngroups involved in voter registration activity because if they do, they \ntrigger all of these other kinds of participation.\n  The proponents of this understand who does the voter registration. \nWho does it? It is labor unions. And they are included. Voter \nidentification or get-out-the-vote activity, who does that? Maybe the \nSenator from Utah can list the number of corporations that are \ninvolved. We know who does it. We might as well state it is directed \nagainst union activity. They are the ones. I don't mean companies or \ncorporations. Even the ones that have shareholders--again, it is \ntargeted to who?--corporations? No, it is targeted to the labor union \nand then public communication that refers to a clearly identified \ncandidate for Federal office and that expressly advocates support for \nor opposition to a candidate.\n  Maybe there are some corporations, but primarily those are for \nunions, again.\n  This is very clear, what is being stated here. Under the existing \nFeingold-McCain bill, there is restatement of what the constitutional \nholdings are at this time. It is effectively a restatement. There are \nsome who would like to change or alter those. But this is a very poor \nattempt at trying to gain parity. We could take additional time to go \nthrough the various provisions. I hope the Members will take that time.\n  We just received this at the time the Senator rose to speak. It is \npoorly drafted, poorly constructed, and it does not do the job the \nproponents want it to do.\n  Finally, I do think workers and those who represent workers and \nunions should have a right to have their voices heard, to speak out on \nthese issues. The fact remains, we still have not had an opportunity to \nvote on a minimum wage. I know there are many in this Chamber who hope \nwe never will have that opportunity; but we will, and we will have it \ndone pretty soon.\n  Then there is the Patients' Bill of Rights that workers support, and \nwe are having difficulty, given the fact that today the President of \nthe United States issued a message that if any of the proposals \ncurrently before the Congress pass, he would veto each one of them.\n  We have seen what has happened in recent times with arsenic standards \nbeing pulled back at the request of industry. We find out that the \nCO2 standards are being pulled back at the request of \nindustry. We have other examples that are current on this score. We are \nfinding out the influence of the HMOs on the administration is \noverpowering. It is not the voices of the workers or the families that \nare tripping up this country, it is the special interests, the large, \npowerful groups that are expending untold millions. By a ratio of \nvirtually 10 to 1 and 12 to 1, corporations are involved in outspending \nthe unions of this country. Nonetheless, we are faced at this time with \nan attempt to try to emasculate that opportunity for their voices to be \nheard. They are the voices for education. They are the voices for \nhealth care. They are the voices for child care.\n  Those are the voices that I think we need to hear a lot more of, not \nless.\n  To reiterate, I rise in opposition to this amendment, misleadingly \ncalled the Paycheck Protection Act. It is nothing of the sort. Instead, \nit is a blatant attempt to silence the voices of working families on \nthe most important issues our Nation faces today. It is an effort to \nmuzzle effective debate on critical legislation affecting the workers \nof this country. It is not reform. It is revenge for the \nextraordinarily successful efforts made by the unions to get out the \nvote in the last election. The amendment is wrong and unfair. It is \nundemocratic. It is most likely unconstitutional. I urge my colleagues \nto vote against it.\n  Make no mistake about it. A vote for this amendment is a vote against \nAmerica's workers.\n  Supporters of this amendment claim that they are concerned about \nunion members' rights to choose whether and how to participate in the \npolitical process. We know better. It is crystal clear that the real \nagenda of those who support the pending amendment is not to protect \ndissenting workers but to scuttle union participation in the political \nprocess.\n  My friends across the aisle know that unions and their members are \namong the most effective voices on issues of concern to workers, \nincluding raising the minimum wage; ensuring the availability of health \ninsurance; protecting the balance between work and families; preserving \nSocial Security, Medicare and Medicaid; improving education; and \nensuring safety and health on the job. And unions help their members to \nbecome active in the political process. As a result of union activity, \nover two million union members registered to vote in just the last 4 \nyears. In the last election, there were 4.8 million more union \nhousehold voters than in 1992. In fact, 26 percent of the voters in the \nlast election came from union households. This should surely be a \nwelcome development in a country that prides itself on fostering and \npromoting a healthy democracy.\n  But my friends across the aisle do not welcome this development. They \nwant to do everything they can to keep workers from voting and from \nparticipating in the political process. That is because they fear that \nworkers and those who represent workers' interests will defeat their \nanti-labor agenda. Silencing the voices of working families will make \nit easier for Republicans and their big-business friends to achieve \ntheir anti-worker goals. Supporters of this amendment want to cut \nworkers' overtime pay and deny millions of workers an increase in the \nminimum wage. They would end the 40-hour work week and permit sham, \ncompany-dominated unions. They voted for this body's shameful repeal of \nthe Department of Labor's ergonomics rule, leaving workers unprotected \nagainst the number one threat to health and safety in the workplace. \nThey oppose the Family and Medical Leave Act. They support privatizing \nSocial Security. They favor private school vouchers that take funds \naway from our efforts to improve the public schools. They are not \ntrying to help working Americans. To the contrary, they want to gag \nworkers so that they can implement an aggressive agenda that workers \nstrongly oppose.\n  This is not paycheck protection. This is paycheck deception. And if \nwe adopt it, we will achieve our opponents' goals of disenfranchising \nworking families. This amendment would silence working families by \nbarring a union from collecting any dues or fees that are not related \nto collective bargaining unless the union obtained a written permission \nslip from each employee each year. It would require unions to create an \nunnecessary, burdensome and expensive bureaucratic process. Unions \nwould have to create recordkeeping and filing systems for responses, \nsolicit approval from each covered employee every year, and constantly \nrecalculate the amounts they could spend on political activity--\nactivity that frequently requires immediate action. The AFL-CIO has \nestimated that implementing a paycheck deception provision would cost \nunions and their members approximately $90 million in the first year \nand $27 million each year thereafter. That is money taken away from \nworkers' hard-earned benefits and their pension plans.\n  This will, of course, hamper unions' ability to participate fully in \npolitical and legislative battles. That is the primary purpose of this \nbill. Handicapping unions in this way will also further skew the \ndrastic existing imbalances in our political system. A report issued \nlast fall by the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics showed \nthat special business interests spent more than $1.2 billion in \npolitical contributions in the last election cycle. These payments \nswamped the contributions of working families through their unions, \nwhich amounted to a total of only $90.3 million. That means big \nbusiness outspent labor unions by a ratio of 14 to 1.\n  The same report found that business outspent unions in ``soft money'' \ncontributions by an even larger margin--17 to 1. The situation has \ngotten worse over time, moreover. In the 1998 election cycle, according \nto a previous report by the center, businesses outspent unions on \npolitics by only 11 to 1. In 1996, the gap was 10 to 1. In 1992, it was \n9 to 1.\n\n[[Page S2639]]\n\n  These ever-widening disparities are not good news for our democracy. \nBut this paycheck deception amendment would only tip the electoral and \nlegislative playing field ever more decisively in favor of big \ncorporations and the wealthy.\n  In only the last 2 weeks, the power of these special interests has \nbecome ever more apparent. Just 2 weeks ago, the Congress voted--with \nless than 10 hours of debate in the Senate and a mere hour of \ndiscussion in the House--to revoke worker protections against ergonomic \ninjuries on which the Department of Labor had worked for 10 years. No \nemployer is now required to do anything to prevent these painful and \ndebilitating worker injuries.\n  Following up on their ergonomics victory, business and special \ninterests scored another coup when this body passed the bankruptcy bill \nlast week. This is a bill that caters to the credit card industry, at \nthe expense of working Americans who will now face more business-\ncreated hurdles to getting back on their feet financially after \nsetbacks.\n  This amendment is also a ``poison pill'' for campaign finance reform. \nIt is being championed by those who believe that the inequities in the \nsystem are just fine--who would like to have no changes to address the \ncorrupting influence that money has on our national elections. They \nknow that no supporter of campaign finance reform--including my good \nfriend Senator McCain--can vote for a bill that contains these \noutrageous provisions. They propose this amendment with the full \nknowledge that it could bring down these reforms and further the power \nof corporate and wealthy special interests. We should not allow \nourselves to be made parties to this ploy.\n  For these reasons, paycheck deception bills have been rejected every \ntime they have been raised. In 1998, a large, bipartisan majority of \nthe House of Representatives voted down a national paycheck deception \nscheme by a vote of 246 to 166. Twice now--in 1997 and 1998--bipartisan \nmajorities in the Senate have blocked paycheck deception bills. Thirty-\nfive States have refused to enact paycheck deception bills since that \ntime. And California voters in 1998 and Oregon voters just last year \nsoundly defeated ballot initiatives that would have imposed paycheck \ndeception.\n  The cynicism behind this amendment is made more obvious because the \namendment is completely unnecessary. For almost 13 years, the law has \noffered ample protections for any workers who disagree with a union's \npolitical activities. Under the landmark Beck decision, no worker, \nanywhere in the country, may be forced to support union political \nactivities. In addition, in 21 States, workers cannot be required to \nsupport any union activities--even collective bargaining.\n  Since the Beck decision, every union, as the law requires, has \ncreated a procedure to ensure that dues-paying workers can opt out of a \nunion's political expenditures. These procedures universally involve \nnotice to workers of the opt-out rights provided under Beck; \nestablishment of a means for workers to notify the union of their \ndecision to exercise these rights; an accounting by the union of its \nspending so that it can calculate the appropriate fee reduction; and \nthe right of access to an impartial decisionmaker if the worker who \nopts out disagrees with the union's accounting or calculations.\n  Moreover, the President has recently issued an Executive Order that \ngoes to great lengths to ensure that all workers know their rights \nunder Beck. This Executive Order, issued on February 17, requires every \nGovernment contractor to post a clear notice that alerts employees of \ntheir right to withhold their payments to unions for any purposes other \nthan costs related to collective bargaining. Individuals may file \ncomplaints with the Secretary of Labor if they believe that a \ncontractor has failed to meet this requirement. And the Secretary may \ninvestigate any contractor suspected of a violation, and may order a \nrange of sanctions for noncompliance, including debarment of the \ncontractor. I opposed this Executive Order because it does not inform \nworkers of any of their other rights under our Nation's labor laws. But \nin this context, it removes any doubt whatsoever that workers will be \ninformed of their Beck rights and provided remedies if they are not.\n  Remedies for violation of Beck rights are also available under the \nNational Labor Relations Act. Under that act, non-union members who \nbelieve that they are being required to support a union's political \nactivities, or who believe that the union's procedures do not afford an \nadequate opportunity for the individual to object, may file a complaint \nwith the National Labor Relations Board or go directly to Federal \ncourt. In such cases, the board or the courts decide whether the \nparticular union has developed procedures that are adequate to meet \nBeck requirements.\n  To erase any further doubts, the McCain-Feingold bill explicitly \ncodifies the Beck requirements as a matter of law. Section 304 of \nMcCain-Feingold requires all unions to establish objection procedures \nfor real paycheck protection.\n  The bill requires unions to provide personal, annual notice to all \naffected employees informing them of their rights.\n  It requires that union procedures lay out the steps for employees to \nmake objections to paying dues that would go toward political activity.\n  It requires unions to reduce the fees paid by any employee who has \nmade an objection so that the employee will not be charged for any \nactivities unrelated to collective bargaining.\n  It requires unions to provide explanations of their calculations.\n  Forty years ago, in a case called Machinists v. Street, the Supreme \nCourt recognized that the majority of union voters have ``an interest \nin stating [their] views without being silenced by the dissenters,'' \nand that it was necessary to establish a rule that ``protect[s] both \ninterests to the maximum extent possible, without undue impingement of \none on the other.'' Beck was the Supreme Court's formulation of this \nrule, and it represents a sound and reasonable way to achieve this \ngoal. And McCain-Feingold respects this rule laid out so well by the \nCourt.\n  The proposed amendment would upset this careful balance between \nmajority and dissenting interests. Where the Court has stated that \n``dissent is not to be presumed--it must be affirmatively made known to \nthe union by the dissenting employee,'' the bill creates precisely the \nopposite regime: dissent will be presumed absent explicit consent. \nUnder this ill-advised amendment--and unlike in every other democratic \ninstitution in our country, including the Congress itself--a minority \nwould be able to thwart the will of the majority by fiat. Not by \ndebate. Not by discussion. Not by a reasoned exchange of competing \nideas. Just by silence.\n  I believe this paycheck deception amendment is also unconstitutional. \nThe amendment would interfere with union members' freedom to associate \nin their unions according to membership rules of their own choice. \nUnder current law, unions may make payment of normal dues the \nprecondition for membership and participation in the union. Unions \nmay--and do--provide that only those individuals who have paid their \nfull dues may vote on issues before the union or run for union elective \noffice. It is entirely appropriate for those workers who do not wish to \nsupport the union's political activities to resign from membership. \nThey cannot be required to fund political activities, and their dues \nwill be reduced accordingly. These workers will receive the full \nbenefits of union representation on issues related to the union's \nbargaining obligations. But they will not be members of the union who \ncan participate in making fundamental decisions about union business--\nincluding the election of officers, the use of organizational \nresources, or the union's political positions.\n  But this amendment states that those who do not pay full dues still \nhave a full voice in the affairs of the union. They would have the same \nrights and benefits as those who pay full dues. That is not only \nunconstitutional, it is just plain wrong.\n  Some of my colleagues claim that the egregious unfairness in this \namendment can be cured if corporations are bound by ``shareholder \nprotection'' requirements. But comparing unions and corporations and \nworkers and shareholders is like comparing apples and oranges. They \nsimply are not the same.\n\n[[Page S2640]]\n\n  First, no corporation requires payments for political purposes as a \ncondition of employment. Shareholders are not employees. It is \nlaughable to think that bills that regulate payments that are \n``conditions of employment'' create parity between unions and \ncorporations.\n  Second, 99.7 percent of American for-profit corporations are \nprivately held and have no shareholders to protect.\n  Third, shares in public corporations are typically held by \ninstitutions such as mutual or pension funds not by individuals. Any \nbill that purported to create parity between unions and corporations \nwould have to reach individuals, and would have to apply to the \npolitical and legislative spending of intermediate entities, not simply \nto expenditures by the companies at the end of the ownership chain. \nNone of my colleagues is rushing to do that.\n  Finally, were corporations to be required to meet the standards that \nwould be imposed on unions, they would have to account for political \nand legislative spending and budgets; disclose such spending and \nbudgets to shareholders; constantly track new shareholders and \nrecalculate ownership shares based on daily activities in the stock \nmarket; constantly solicit consent from this ever-changing group; and \npay extra dividends or other financial benefits to shareholders who did \nnot authorize political expenditures.\n  The pending amendment does not do this. No bill purporting to create \nparity has ever done this. No bill would ever do so. Such a bill would \nlikely bring commerce to its knees, as corporations spent their time \ncreating immense administrative bureaucracies to implement these \nrequirements.\n  We would never hamstring corporations in this way and we should not \ndo it to labor unions, either. We should not impose these unreasonable, \nunfair, and likely unconstitutional burdens on our country's unions, \nwhich represent the most effective voice for our working families.\n  Since its founding, our nation has respected and nurtured the \nfundamental principle that democracy thrives best when there is robust \ndebate over issues of public concern. This amendment would subvert that \nbedrock proposition. I urge my colleagues to reject this attack on our \nworking families, our unions, and our country's core values.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I can't stay here and let the Senator from Massachusetts \nget away with this. Here we go again. I acknowledge he represents a \nState that is highly unionized. I don't know if he ever worked for a \nunion or belonged to a union, but I have. I spent 10 years in the \nbuilding construction trade unions. I have a lot of respect for the \nunion movement. I would fight for the right of collective bargaining.\n  But, unlike my colleague from Massachusetts, I do not believe I have \nto champion everything that one cause wants over everybody else. I \nshould not say everybody else, but over anybody who is not one of the \nmost liberal special interest groups in our country.\n  I do not need a lecture from the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts on how to write legislation. Nor do I need a lecture from \nthe distinguished Senator from Massachusetts on what the Beck decision \nmeans.\n  The Senator and many on the other side of the aisle will spend every \nounce of their beings to make sure that union members have no say with \nregard to how their moneys are spent in political activities.\n  By the way, with all due respect to my friend from Massachusetts--and \neverybody knows he is my friend; that is why I think my words may have \na little more impact than some others' --the idea to include \ncorporations and treat them in a manner comparable to labor \norganizations, as I recall, came from the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts himself. That was in the early 1990s when I offered \namendments requiring disclosure of the money spent by labor \norganizations, money of hard-working American men and women.\n  As I recall, one of the principal arguments of my friend from \nMassachusetts was that corporations were not treated similarly--those \nbig, massive, powerful corporations compared to these little, tiny, \n``difficult to maintain freedom for the union members'' unions.\n  We all know what is going on here. There are people on that side who \nwill fight to the death because, although 40 percent of all union \nmembers are Republicans, virtually 100 percent of all union political \nmoney is used to elect Democrats. I can recall many years when some of \nthe most liberal Republicans who always supported labor, and when a \nDemocrat who supported labor ran against them, that Democrat got labor \nsupport. If I have to cite anybody, I will cite Jacob Javits of New \nYork.\n  I know what is going on here. They will fight to the death to make \nsure that those 40 percent of Republicans who work in the unions, who \nbelieve in Republican principles, will never have any say on how the \ntotality of the money is spent in the political arena.\n  Oddly enough, I respect my friend from Massachusetts because he has \nbeen the No. 1 champion of these unpowerful trade union organizations.\n  Mr. DODD. Oddly enough.\n  Mr. HATCH. These poor little picked-on people who basically have no \nsay in their lives, unless they have the protection of the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts, among others.\n  But to come here today and tell me I have to write every detail of \nregulation into a statute that I know the FEC can do is almost an \ninsult. It comes close.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Almost.\n  Mr. HATCH. He is fighting for his special interests, and I don't \nblame him. He gets 100 percent support from union activity and union \nmoney. It has kept him in office for years.\n  I have to say it is not just the liberal side of the union movement. \nMy goodness, it is almost every liberal special interest group in this \ncountry. We all know when the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \nspeaks, he speaks for every liberal special interest group in this \ncountry, and you had better pay attention if you are on the Democratic \nside of the aisle, because if you don't, you are going to have a \nprimary in the next election.\n  I respect that kind of power. And I love my colleague as very few in \nthis body do.\n  (Laughter.)\n  Mr. McCAIN. I don't.\n  Mr. HATCH. Senator McCain said he doesn't. He is naturally being \nhumorous, as he always is.\n  Let me just say this. I acknowledge that it is difficult to devise a \nmanner in which this should be done, but I think we should work \ntogether and do what the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts said \nin the early 1990s ought to be done. We ought to get those big special \ninterests in the corporate world to have to conform to certain \ndisclosures.\n  This is an important matter for hard-working Americans. If my \ncolleague thinks stockholders should be treated similarly, that is what \nI am trying to do in good faith. I think I am doing it pretty well.\n  Just so we get rid of this argument that every detail has to be \nwritten into legislation--heck, everybody around here knows that isn't \nthe case ever. I myself think sometimes we ought to be a little more \nspecific and not just let the bureaucracy run wild, but that is not the \nway things work in this Federal Government. Just think about it.\n  I think the argument of the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \nis very insufficient in the details with regard to what legislation is \nall about. Let me give an illustration. The Federal Communications Act \nsimply tells regulators to regulate the airwaves in the public trust.\n  I am sure the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts would love to \nhave three or four thousand pages defining what that means--or maybe \n150,000 pages defining what that means. But it works. It works as long \nas we have honest people in the bureaucracy.\n  Think of this one. There is a level of detail in all legislation that \nis left to administrators and regulators.\n  The McCain-Feingold bill that is so magnificent, triumphed by the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts, requires State parties to use \nhard money to pay the salary of a State party worker if they spend more \nthan 25 percent of their time on Federal election activities.\n  That is pretty broad to me. Nowhere does McCain-Feingold state how \nState parties are to track these people's time--nowhere. We will leave \nthat to the regulators.\n  I could go down each paragraph in the McCain-Feingold bill and shred \nit\n\n[[Page S2641]]\n\nalive, if the argument of the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \nhas any merit, which, of course, it does not. But that doesn't stop \nbombastic argument, nor should it. I love them myself. I love to see \nthe distinguished Senator from Massachusetts get up there, and \neverybody is almost positive he is going to blow a fuse before he is \nthrough. But the fact is, he has a right to do that. I admire him for \ndoing it. I admire the way he supports his special interests. I do not \nknow of anybody who does it better. We don't have anybody on our side \nwho can do that as well.\n  (Applause in the Galleries.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). There will be order in the \ngallery.\n  Mr. HATCH. That brought tears to my eyes.\n  Mr. President, McCain-Feingold does not say if the contract workers \nare employees of the State party, or regular, full-time employees. \nThose details are left to regulators.\n  The amendment amends the FECA act so that the FEC would administer \nthis and all existing FEC enforcement laws and regulations, as well as \npenalties that would apply.\n  I know what is going on. It is wonderful to argue for what helps your \nside. McCain-Feingold, to their credit, is trying to get a more honest \nsystem that is equal both ways. But if you read the provision on the \nBeck decision, it basically obliterates it. It basically narrows it so \nmuch that it has no meaning.\n  I have to say there are those on the other side of the floor who will \nnever allow the Beck Supreme Court decision, the ultimate law of the \nland, to be enforced, or to be applied, because it would even things \nup, and it would allow 40 percent of the union membership in this \ncountry to have some say on how their dues are being spent in the \npolitical activity.\n  That is all I am trying to do. I think it is a reasonable thing. I \nthink it is the right thing. I think it is the intelligent thing. If we \ndon't do this, then are we really trying to have a bill that is going \nto correct some of the ills of our society?\n  I have no illusion. I suspect that many, if not all, on the other \nside will vote against this amendment because it does basically even \nthings up. It does what the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \nsaid we ought to do back in the early 1990s, but today is indicating, \nif we do it, that it has to be done in such specificity that it would \nbe the most specified language in the history of legislative \nachievement.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 134, As Modified\n\n  Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HATCH. It is a technical correction.\n  Mr. DODD. I would like to see the amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, my modification is at the desk. I ask \nunanimous consent that my amendment be so modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object--I am not going to object--\nMembers should have the right to modify their amendments.\n  For the purposes of clarification, I wonder if my colleague from Utah \nmight take a minute to explain the modification.\n  Mr. HATCH. It basically corrects language in the amendment. It \nbasically allows proportionate share with regard to the unions, and \nalso with regard to corporations. I think it applies both ways. But I \nwanted to make sure.\n  Mr. DODD. I am sure the President understood that.\n  I have no objection.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 134), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 35, strike line 8 and all that follows \n     through page 37, line 14, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 304.

Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this amendment, there are 37 minutes. The \nopponents have 62 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank Senator Dodd and others for \nallowing Senator Hatch to modify his\n\n[[Page S2642]]\n\namendment. We got into quite a tussle the other night over that issue. \nI am pleased to see the comity that the Senate normally enjoys. It has \nbeen exercised on this occasion. I thank everyone for allowing Senator \nHatch to modify his amendment.\n\n  Let me say that this amendment has been described as a poison pill by \nthe New York Times and the Washington Post and Common Cause. I think it \nis important for Members to understand what a ``poison pill'' is by \ntheir definition. A poison pill is anything that might affect labor \nunions. Disclosure and consent are universally applauded in the \ncampaign finance debate. Disclosure and consent are the two principles \nupon which there is wide agreement on a bipartisan basis throughout \nthis Chamber--unless it applies to labor unions.\n  What Senator Hatch is trying to do is to apply those principles--\ndisclosure and consent--to organized labor in this country. Admittedly, \nthe so-called paycheck protection amendment in the past has only \napplied to unions. Many of our Members have complained about that.\n  The senior Senator from Arizona, as recently as January 22, \ncomplained about the fact that it did not apply to shareholders. The \njunior Senator from Wisconsin, on the same day, was complaining about \nthe paycheck protection proposal because it only applied, as he put it, \nto one player, the labor unions. Senator Kerry of Massachusetts, in the \nlast year or so, was complaining about paycheck protection because it \nonly applied to labor unions. Senator Lieberman, in February of 1998--\njust a couple years ago--I suspect it is still his view that paycheck \nprotection is a problem because it does not apply to corporations. That \nis one of the principal arguments against so-called paycheck \nprotection.\n  The Senator from Utah has now applied it to corporations. He has \napplied it. There is parity between unions and corporations. The goal \nis to ensure that all political money is voluntary.\n  In a corporation without shareholders, if the owner uses his money on \npolitics, obviously, it is voluntary because it is his money. With \nshareholders, we need this legislation so executives do not decide for \nthe shareholders.\n  In unions, the consent provision ensures political money from dues \nare voluntarily used for political purposes. And, of course, there are \nno privately held unions.\n  Paycheck protection is clearly constitutional. In Michigan State AFL-\nCIO v. Miller, the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a State \nstatute requiring unions to get affirmative consent each year from \nunion members. In fact, the court held that the affirmative consent \nrequirement, similar to Senator Hatch's requirement, was not even \nsubject to the highest degree of strict scrutiny. Rather, the court \nfound the affirmative consent requirement so noncontroversial that it \nwas subject only to intermediate scrutiny. And it survived intermediate \nscrutiny and survived review under this standard.\n  The court upheld the affirmative consent requirement explaining that:\n\n       By verifying on an annual basis that individuals intend to \n     continue dedicating a portion of their earnings to a \n     political cause, [the consent requirement] both reminds those \n     persons that they are giving money for political causes and \n     counteracts the inertia that would tend to cause people to \n     continue giving funds indefinitely even after their support \n     for the message may have waned. The annual consent \n     requirement ensures that political contributions are in \n     accordance with the wishes of the contributors.\n\n  So there is a binding Federal court precedent upholding affirmative \nconsent requirements on unions. This case makes clear that such \nprovisions are not even subject to strict scrutiny.\n\n  It is entirely possible that unions are the biggest spenders in our \nelections. But we do not know because they do not disclose the majority \nof their political activities. The numbers people use to say \ncorporations outspend unions are suspect because they only include what \nunions disclose. But we can estimate what unions spend because there is \nno meaningful disclosure anywhere of what unions spend on political \nactivities--such as phone banks, direct mail, voter identification, \nget-out-the-vote activity, candidate recruitment, political consulting, \nand other activities--in support of the Democratic Party. We must, \nadmittedly, simply estimate what they spend.\n  By contrast, we have a very good idea what corporate America spends \nbecause almost all of its activity is limited to operating PACs and \nmaking soft money donations to parties, which, unlike big labor's \nground game, are fully disclosed activities.\n  In estimating what unions spend, we should note that in Beck cases--\nand remember, the Beck case was about a nonunion member--it is not \nunusual for nonunion members, seeking a refund of the pro rata share of \ntheir fees that the union uses for activities unrelated to collective \nbargaining, to get back in excess of 70 percent. In the Beck case \nitself, Mr. Beck got back 79 percent.\n  So let's be very conservative and say that the unions spend 10 \npercent of the money they take in each year to help Democrats.\n  Now, let's look at how much unions take in from dues from members, \nagency fees from nonmembers, and other sources, such as their affinity \ncredit card program. According to figures from the Department of Labor \nfor 1999, the Auto Workers Union took in $308,653,016. The Steelworkers \nUnion took in $569,198,286. The Machinists Union took in $167,201,344. \nThe Carpenters Union took in $624,205,132. The Laborers International \nUnion took in $133,921,734. The Food and Commercial Workers Union took \nin $316,458,642. The Airline Pilots Union took in $277,508,365. The \nTeamsters brought in $303,498,920.\n  I could go on. I have not yet included some of the largest unions, \nsuch as the Communications Workers, the Service Employees Union, the \nHotel Workers Union, the National Education Association, and the \nElectrical Workers, all of which are among the largest unions in \nAmerica.\n  But if we just add up what the eight unions I mentioned raked in \nduring 1999, it amounts to $2,700,645,439. If we double this figure, to \nreflect what these eight unions took in during the 1999-2000 election \ncycle, it amounts to $5,401,290,878.\n  If these eight unions spent just 10 percent of this amount to help \nthe Democrats in the last election, these eight alone spent $540 \nmillion. So it is safe to say that unions easily spend at least $\\1/2\\ \nbillion for Democrats in each election cycle.\n  Independent academic research from Professor Leo Troy of Rutgers \narrives at similar numbers, as do estimates from former high-ranking \nunion officials, such as Duke Zeller, formerly a Teamsters official, \nwho has acknowledged that big labor spent about $400 million for the \nDemocrats and Bill Clinton in 1996.\n  Contrast this with $244 million total for all corporate and business \nassociation hard and soft money contributions to the Republican and \nDemocratic Parties, including their congressional committees.\n  These figures regularly cited about business outspending labor 10 or \n15 to 1 are based on questionable figures generated by the ``reform \nindustry'' to reenforce its own mythology about how corrupt Congressmen \nare, in the pocket of big business. These estimates are not based on \nsound, unbiased FEC figures.\n  Moreover, the reformers' estimates only look at how much publicly \ndisclosed hard and soft money businesses and labor give to parties and \ntheir candidates. They totally ignore the hundreds of millions big \nlabor pour into its massive, undisclosed ground game operated on behalf \nof the Democratic Party.\n  The dirty little secret that big labor and its allies do not want \nanyone to know is that corporate America just makes contributions and \nmay run up some issue ads once in a while to which we can assign a \nprice tag, thanks to ad buy information. Big labor, on the other hand, \nmakes some contributions, runs some issue ads, but that is just the tip \nof the iceberg. The vast majority of its political activity and money \nis dedicated to the ground game. These direct expenditures which \ncompletely dwarf what business spends on politics, even if they are \nonly 5 to 10 percent of what big labor rakes in each year, aren't \ndisclosed anywhere. Nowhere is this disclosed. And big labor's allies \nwill do everything they can to make sure these massive expenditures \nthat form the brunt of big labor's political\n\n[[Page S2643]]\n\noperation remain hidden away from the sunlight of disclosure.\n\n  The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts has noted that no \ncorporation does get-out-the-vote operations. Unions offer the \nappearance of a legitimate democratic process but none of the reality, \nand disregard the interests of working men and women instead of \nrepresenting them.\n  In 1959, Congress enacted the Labor-Management Reporting and \nDisclosure Act to protect the rights and interests of union members \nagainst abuses by unions and their officials. The act gave union \nmembers various substantive rights that were considered so crucial to \nensuring that unions were democratically governed and responsive to the \nwill of their membership that they were labeled the Bill of Rights of \nMembers of Labor Organizations. The LMRDA made rank-and-file union \nmembers the sole guardians of protections set forth in the Bill of \nRights for Members of Labor Organizations by prohibiting the Secretary \nof Labor from investigating violations of those rights.\n  Of course, Congress realized that the protections provided in the \nBill of Rights for Members of Labor Organizations were meaningless if \nunion members did not know of their existence. Therefore, in section \n105 of the act, Congress mandated that ``every labor organization shall \ninform its members concerning the provisions of this chapter.'' \nUnfortunately, as demonstrated by the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of \nAppeals recent decision in Thomas v. The Grand Lodge of the \nInternational Association of Machinists, a decision handed down in just \nJanuary of this year, the officials at labor unions have frustrated the \nwill of Congress and sought to prevent their members from learning of \ntheir rights by refusing to notify members of the act's protections \nwhen they join.\n  In Thomas, the union asserted that their one-time publication of the \nprovisions of the act to their membership way back in 1959--the fact \nthat they published it one time in 1959 --satisfied their obligation to \nnotify their members. The court of appeals rejected this somewhat \ningenious argument because it ran counter to the clear text of section \n105 and because ``Congress clearly intended that each individual union \nmember, soon after obtaining membership, be informed about the \nprovisions of the act,'' including the Bill of Rights of Members of \nLabor Organizations.\n  This is the reality of union democracy and the contempt union leaders \nhave for the rights and interests of working men and women. Unions \nstill continue to fight disclosing to workers the basic rights Congress \nset forth back in 1959.\n  The reason the underlying amendment doesn't include ideological \ngroups is that when you give to the Sierra Club, you know the causes \nthey advocate. When people join unions or are forced to pay fees to \nunions, they probably don't know that unions use their dues for such \nthings as an effort in 1996 to legalize marijuana in California. The \nTeamsters contributed $195,000 in union dues to support that particular \neffort. I wonder how many hard-working families of union members want \ntheir hard-earned dollars to be used for the legalization of marijuana. \nI cite that as an example of the way in which union dues can be used \nwithout the consent of members and on causes certainly the members are \nnot likely to agree with.\n\n  Senator Hatch, through this important amendment, is trying to get at \nsome of these problems. I commend him for his outstanding leadership on \nthis issue over the years. We certainly hope this amendment will be \napproved.\n  I retain the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the distinguished \nsenior Senator from the State of Michigan, Mr. Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized for up \nto 15 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend from Connecticut.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is written as though it would apply to \nboth corporations and unions. The words on the piece of paper we have \njust been handed say ``any corporation or any labor union.'' When \nsomebody first looked at it, they would say: Aha, this applies to both.\n  In the real world, it doesn't. In the real world, the only entities \nto which it applies are unions and not corporations. The activities \nwhich are covered here are really for, first, voter registration \nactivity. I don't know of too many corporations that engage in that. I \nwould love to know from the sponsors of this amendment what percentage \nof corporations engage in voter registration activity. That is the \nfirst thing it covers, something which unions do and corporations \ndon't. But we are told there is parity in this amendment.\n  The second thing we are told it covers is voter identification or \nget-out-the-vote activity. I don't know of too many corporations that \nengage in voter identification or get-out-the-vote activity. I would be \nreally interested to hear from the sponsors of this amendment as to \nwhat percentage do because I don't know of many. In fact, I don't know \nof any offhand. So while it purports to be equal in its application, \nwhile it purports to have parity to both unions and corporations, it is \npurely paper parity, it is not real world parity. It is the appearance \nof parity without the reality of parity--paper parity.\n  The third item is public communication that refers to a clearly \nidentified candidate. I am not sure what that means, because if it were \na public communication that expressly advocated support for or \nopposition to, it would then be an expenditure which would have to be \npaid for in hard dollars. I am not sure even what the relevance of that \nis in this particular place. The same thing with disbursements for \ntelevision or radio broadcast time.\n\n  The heart of this amendment is to go after union activity and to \nplace requirements on unions that are so onerous that they will not be \nable to meet them. To require affirmative approval of certain \nactivities in a voluntary organization and association which has voted \nto engage in certain activities in which free people engage is set \naside here. Instead, under this amendment, we have a free association \nof people, because no one can be required to be a member of a union, \nnot in this country. Nobody can be required to be a member of a union.\n  So you have an association of free men and women who have decided \nthat they want to engage in certain political activity, but we are told \nin this amendment that they have to go through certain hoops and they \nhave to jump across certain hurdles before they are allowed to do so.\n  We are told that there is parity here. Stockholders are also covered \nby this, we are told. Yet we haven't heard, despite the many \nsuggestions and questions asked about this, of any corporations that \nengage in this activity that would be required to obtain stockholder \napproval before using corporate funds to do so.\n  If this were a serious amendment aimed at parity, if this were truly \na real-world parity amendment, it would not be written in the way it is \nrelative to corporations. Saying that you would have to get the \napproval of stockholders, for instance, without saying which class of \nstockholders--common stock, preferred stock--what day are we getting \nthe approval of stockholders on, was it yesterday before a billion \nshares of stock were sold on the New York Stock Exchange, is it today, \nwhen another billion shares of stock are going to be sold on the New \nYork Stock Exchange, This is not a moving target which would be \npresented to a corporation. It would be a moving bullet which would \nhave to be somehow or other captured so these requirements could be \nmet. But they are not real requirements because corporations don't \nengage in the activity purportedly being covered by this amendment.\n\n  The purpose of this amendment is to try to restrict legitimate \npolitical activity of an association of men and women in a labor union. \nThe disguise is pretty thin. The disguise is, look, we have heard a lot \nabout covering corporations, so we are doing it. But this isn't the \nactivity that the corporations engage in which is set forth in this \namendment. This is the activity in which labor unions engage--voter \nregistration activity, voter identification, or get-out-the-vote \nactivity. So the disguise is pretty thin. The parity is paper parity \nonly.\n  This amendment, it seems to me, should be seen for what it is--a way \nto\n\n[[Page S2644]]\n\nattempt to reduce the political activity of labor unions. There was a \ncase called Machinists v. Street in the Supreme Court back in 1961. The \nSupreme Court expressed concern with encroachment on the legitimate \nactivities and necessary functions of unions. They made it very clear \nin that case that it is up to the members of the union to decide in \nwhat activities they would engage, and that dissent is not presumed, in \nthe words of the Supreme Court.\n  This amendment reverses that right of association where members of an \nassociation are presumed to support, by the election of their officers \nand adoption of their bylaws, the program of that association. It \nreverses the Supreme Court's assumption and presumes dissent, requiring \naffirmative approval of members of a free association.\n  This is what the Supreme Court said:\n\n       Any remedies, however, would properly be granted only to \n     employees who have made known to the union officials that \n     they do not desire their funds to be used for political \n     causes to which they object. The safeguards in the law were \n     added for the protection of dissenters' interests, but \n     dissent is not to be presumed.\n\n  This amendment, by requiring that unions go through very complicated, \ncumbersome procedures in order to obtain affirmative approval of \nmembers of that free association, is intended to put a damper on union \npolitical activity, and it is very clear what this purpose is.\n  Finally, let me just say this: This is not an amendment, it seems to \nme, which belongs in this bill or is really appropriate in this bill. \nThis is an amendment that is aimed at labor unions, separate and apart \nfrom any bill that we have before us relative to money going into \ncampaigns. This is not an amendment that is aimed at the appearance of \ncorruption, which we have been told, under Buckley, can be addressed by \ntrying to put some limits on contributions to campaigns. That is what \nthe Buckley case says we can do.\n  In order to avoid the appearance of corruption, the appearance of \nimpropriety, we can put contribution limits on contributions, we can \nrestrict contributions because of what can be implied, and is too often \nimplied, by large contributions going into these campaigns. We have not \nbeen shown the corruption that this amendment intends to remedy.\n  What this amendment intends to do is to restrict the rights of \nassociation of members of a union--people who voluntarily decide they \nare going to either be in a union, remain in a union, or join a union; \npeople who are not required to stay in a union by law; people who are \nnot required to join a union by law because no law can require that in \nthis country. Yet it is the restriction of that association, the right \nof men and women in a free country to associate freely and to decide on \na regime of political activity that is being restricted by this \namendment--with no showing of an appearance of corruption, restriction \non the rights of association. That is what this amendment reflects.\n\n  That cannot just be disguised or covered up by saying, oh, look, it \napplies to corporations, too, when in fact the corporations do not \nengage in the activity being discussed here. And, in fact, if this \nseriously were aimed at corporations, it would be so totally unworkable \nthat it would fall of its own weight. No corporation I know of could \npossibly comply with these rules, even if it wanted to engage in get-\nout-the-vote activity or voter registration. There would be no \npractical way it could comply with this.\n  The effort to modify this amendment was a reflection of the total \ninability of a corporation to function under this kind of a rule. But \nit doesn't cure the problem because, again, we are not told: When is \nthis decision made? What day are the stockholders going to be counted? \nDo they have to be asked on a certain day as to whether or not they \napprove a get-out-the-vote campaign or a voter registration campaign? \nThe next day you may have hundreds of thousands, perhaps in a large \ncorporation, of different stockholders. What classes of stock are \ncovered? There is nothing about that--and for good reason. That is not \nthe purpose of the amendment.\n  The purpose of this amendment, I am afraid, is a purpose in which we \nas a body should not participate. The purpose of this amendment is to \nrestrict the political activities of a free association. We should not \ndo that, whether we like the association or don't like the association. \nWe should not do that whether the association is supportive generally \nof our party or opposes generally our party. The principle here, the \nprinciple involved, is the right of association under the first \namendment. It cannot be restricted by law. It should not be restricted \nby this body. We should not attempt to place these kinds of \nrestrictions on the associative rights of American citizens.\n  Finally, under a NAACP case in 1963, I will close with this quote. \nThe first amendment is what is being discussed in that case, and this \nis what the Supreme Court held:\n\n       Because first amendment freedoms need breathing space to \n     survive, government may regulate in the area only with narrow \n     specificity.\n\n  I know we are going to have a debate over whether or not the bill \nbefore us meets the first amendment test. Those of us who very much \nsupport McCain-Feingold feel passionately that it does, that it is \nnarrowly crafted to allow for regulation, to address the appearance of \nimpropriety and corruption. But there is no way that the amendment \nbefore us, which has an effect only on the free association of labor \nunions, can possibly meet this test with no showing of an appearance of \ncorruption, no showing of an appearance of impropriety, and severe \npractical limits on the rights of association in trade unions. And I \nbelieve this language should not only be defeated by this body, but, \nhopefully, will be rejected on a bipartisan basis because it would cut \ninto the rights that I believe all of us should want very much to \nprotect.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senator from Michigan is correct, \nof course, that no worker can be forced to join a union. They can, \nhowever, be forced to pay fees to unions, equal to union dues, as a \ncondition of maintaining their employment. That is precisely the point \nof Senator Hatch's amendment.\n  As for the concern of the Senator from Michigan about the fact that \nno corporation does ground wars as unions do, that is, of course, \nprecisely the point. That is exactly why McCain-Feingold is biased in \nfavor of Democrats.\n  Unions, as the Senator from Michigan has pointed out, do the ground \nwar for the Democrats. I wish we had an ally like that on our side. I \nadmire the unions greatly. They do the ground war for the Democrats.\n  For Republicans, it is the party that takes the primary role in the \nground war. As we have discussed here, and as the Senator from Michigan \nhas conceded, corporations don't do that sort of thing. They never have \nand, in my view, they never will.\n  McCain-Feingold eliminates one-third of the resources that Republican \nParty organizations have to counter the union ground game from which \nDemocrats benefit 100 percent.\n  According to Forbes magazine, the NEA's local uniserve directors act \nas the largest army of paid political organizers and lobbyists in the \nUnited States. According to NEA's own strategic plan and budget, these \npolitical operatives had a budget of $76 million for the 2000 cycle--\n$76 million for the 2000 cycle alone. None of that is touched by \nMcCain-Feingold.\n  With regard to the unions, what do unions do to help Democrats? \nAgain, I say I wish we had such an ally. This is what the unions do for \nthe Democrats:\n  One, get out the vote;\n  Two, voter identification;\n  Three, voter registration;\n  Four, mass mailings;\n  Five, phone banks;\n  Six, TV advertisements;\n  Seven, radio advertisements;\n  Eight, magazine advertisements;\n  Nine, newspaper advertisements;\n  Ten, outdoor advertising and leafletting;\n  Eleven, polling;\n  And twelve, volunteer recruitment and training.\n  Boy, I wish we had an ally such as that. That would be wonderful. The \nonly entity we have that engages in any of those activities on behalf \nof Republicans is our party organizations.\n\n[[Page S2645]]\n\nTheir funds would be reduced by at least a third or, in the case of the \nRepublican National Committee, 40 percent by McCain-Feingold.\n  McCain-Feingold purports to regulate some union activity, and I \ngather from reading the paper it has made the unions at least a little \nbit nervous. It purports to prohibit TV and radio ads that refer to a \ncandidate within 60 days of a general election or 30 days of a primary.\n  However, with regard to national parties, everything the national \nparty does must be paid for in 100-percent federally regulated hard \ndollars, even if it does not mention a single candidate.\n  If, in fact, that 1 restriction on union activity remains in the bill \nat the end, that leaves 11 other activities unions engage in untouched \nby McCain-Feingold while at the same time the bill reduces the funds \navailable for the national parties by a third, to 40 percent.\n  In addition to that, McCain-Feingold, in effect, federalizes State \nand local parties in even-numbered years. In order for the Republican \nNational Committee--it would apply to Democrats as well, but it is not \nas important to them because they have the unions as I just described--\nin the case of the local parties and the national party, they would \nhave to operate at 100-percent Federal dollars, even if they were \ntrying to influence a mayor's race in Wichita, KS.\n  This bill does little or nothing to the unions. What little it \npurports to do, I gather, has made the unions nervous, and it will be \ninteresting to see if, before the end of this debate, not only are the \namendments such as the one we are debating not approved, I am curious \nto see whether there will be additional amendments offered that will, \nin fact, take out what few uncomfortable portions of the existing bill \nthere are for organized labor. In other words, I am predicting that not \nonly will Senator Hatch's amendments--this one and the one he will \noffer after this one--probably be defeated, but that those elements of \nMcCain-Feingold that currently create some angst among unions, there \nwill be an effort to strip those out before we get to final passage.\n\n  In the name of fairness, what we are talking about, with Senator \nHatch's amendment, is to make sure that union dollars are voluntarily \ngiven by members and that union activities are disclosed. Consent and \ndisclosure are two principles, it seems to me, that have been at the \nheart of the campaign finance debate for many years.\n  I think we are probably through on this side. I do not know how many \nmore speakers you have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I know of three or four anyway. There may be \na few others.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has 15 minutes 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I reserve the remainder of my time, and I will see how \nit goes.\n  Mr. DODD. How much time remains on the opponents' side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-seven minutes 22 seconds.\n  Mr. DODD. Maybe we will consume all of it, and if the Senator from \nKentucky----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I have reserved mine.\n  Mr. DODD. How much time does my good friend from Minnesota need?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Ten minutes, and I may not take a full 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will tell you why I may not take the \nfull 10 minutes. I had an opportunity to hear Senator Levin, and he \nsaid much of what I wanted to say except he said it better than I can.\n  I do want to be really clear that this ``paycheck protection'' \namendment that all of us have been expecting has taken an even more \negregious and cynical form than I had contemplated in all my \nnightmares.\n  This is not about sham issue ads. It is important to go after soft \nmoney that goes into such ads by any kind of organization. This is not \nabout parity between corporations and unions, for all of the reasons \nSenator Levin outlined. This is, however, going after political \nactivity defined as ``voter registration activity, voter \nidentification, or get out the vote, public communication that refers \nto a clearly identified candidate for Federal office.''\n  I can understand why, given what we have been doing on the floor of \nthe Senate over the last couple of weeks, such as, for example, in 10 \nhours overturning 10 years of work to have a rule to provide some \nprotection for people against repetitive stress injury--I can \nunderstand why my colleagues would not want unions, or any kind of \norganization that represents workers, communicating with those workers.\n  This is a gag rule amendment. That is what this is about. Basically, \nthis is the issue: This amendment is all about going after a \ndemocratic, with a small ``d''--may I please make that distinction--a \ndemocratic institution, with a small ``d,'' and denying that \nassociational democratic institution the right to represent and serve \nits members.\n  What my colleagues are worried about, what this amendment is a \nreflection of, is the concern of some of my colleagues that this \nparticular democratic organization, with a small ``d''--a union, or it \ncan be any organization--will be able to serve its members.\n  Frankly, we in the Senate ought to be for all democratic, with a \nsmall ``d,'' associational organizations, and we should be all about \nsupporting their rights to serve their members, not trying to gag them, \ntrying to block communication. My colleagues are so worried that these \nassociations and these organizations of people who do not give the \nmillions of dollars will be able to, God forbid, be involved in voter \nregistration activity, get-out-the-vote efforts, internal \ncommunication, and grassroots politics.\n  This is the ultimate anti grassroots politics, anti association, anti \ngroup and organization, anti rank-and-file member, anti people \ncommunicating with one another, anti people without the big bucks \nthrough their association being able to have some power and some say \nand some clout in American politics.\n  This amendment should be roundly defeated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to the \nso-called paycheck protection amendment. This proposal, in my view, is \nlittle more than a thinly veiled attack on organized labor, and an \nattempt to undermine genuine campaign finance reform.\n  The effect of this amendment would be to bury unions in a morass of \nbureaucratic red tape, and severely impede their ability to represent \ntheir membership. It would push unions further to the periphery of the \npolitical process, and hurt the working men and women they represent. \nIt also may well be unconstitutional.\n  Every day, associations and other organizations representing \neverything from chocolate manufacturers to retired people come to \nCapitol Hill to advocate for their members. These organizations use a \nvariety of mechanisms to decide how they spend their money. Some give \nbroad authority to their D.C. representatives. Others centralize \nauthority with their president. Others operate through special boards \nor committees.\n  It is not Congress's business to dictate to these organizations how \nthey make their internal spending decisions. That is their business. \nAnd that is how it should be.\n  But this amendment says that it is our business as politicians to \ntell unions how to make their internal spending decisions. The obvious \nintent is to harm unions' ability to function effectively in the \npolitical process. This doesn't just discriminate unfairly against \nunions. It undercuts their constitutional rights of free association \nand of free speech.\n  As a result of the 1988 Beck case, all workers can already opt out of \npaying union dues. They can choose not to be in the union and to pay a \nfee that only covers costs associated with contract management and \ncollective bargaining. No worker is forced to join the union. \nTherefore, no worker is forced to cover costs associated with political \nactivities. And, I would add, the underlying legislation includes a \nprovision that makes this very clear.\n\n[[Page S2646]]\n\n  In reality, this amendment is a deliberate attempt to undermine one \nof the key purposes of unions, advocating for their members not only \nwith management, but with elected officials. The amendment goes well \nbeyond what the Supreme Court required in the Beck decision. It would \nrequire union members to affirmatively agree to set aside a portion of \ntheir dues for political activities. And then it would require period \nreports spelling out details of those activities.\n  These requirements would impose significant costs on unions and limit \ntheir ability to participate in the political process.\n  It is important to remember that unions are democratic institutions. \nDecisions are made by majority vote or by duly elected representatives. \nMoreover, as I said earlier, nobody is forced to join a union. If you \ndecide to join, as with other voluntary organizations, you accept the \ndemocratic decision-making process.\n  It is absurd to join the NRA and ask that no funds be used for \npolitical activities. You cannot pay a reduced fee to simply receive \nAmerican Rifleman magazine. And you cannot join the Sierra Club just \nfor the tote bag. Similarly, political activities are a fundamental \nfeature of a union's operations.\n  Unions were formed in the first place to reduce the historic \nimbalance between workers and management, between most Americans and \npowerful, entrenched interests. By coming together, working families \nhave an influential voice, and nowhere is the voice of labor unions \nmore important than in the political arena. This amendment would, in \neffect, silence that voice, and in the process silence millions of \nworking families.\n  If we believe in the constitution right to free association, we \ncannot support this amendment. If we believe in the rights of working \nfamilies to be heard, we cannot support this amendment. And if we \nbelieve in fundamental and equitable campaign finance reform, we cannot \nsupport this amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, we have many Members desiring to be heard. I \nwant to make sure I accommodate everyone who wants to be heard.\n  I yield to my colleague from Massachusetts for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized for up to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n  The impact of this amendment and the fundamental unfairness of it are \nso obvious and so patently clear. What this tries to achieve doesn't \nnecessitate a raising of voices or even an angry response, although I \nthink there are plenty of Members who feel offended by what it seeks to \ndo.\n  The purpose of this McCain-Feingold legislation is to try to create a \nfair playing field. ``Fair'' is not a word we hear a lot applied to the \nstandards which our colleagues on the other side seem to seek in this. \nBut ``fair'' means you try to achieve parity to the best degree \npossible between both sides' potential supporters, those who give to \nus.\n  What is extraordinary to me is what is being sought here is \neffectively the silencing of the capacity of organized labor to be able \nto participate with a fig leaf, a pretense about corporate \nresponsibility and shareholder obligations. There is nothing in the \nterminology of the legislation in the way it has been set forth that \nactually creates any equality at all between shareholders and union \nmembers who, I might add, are a completely different concept \naltogether. After all, I think it is understood there are certain laws \nthat apply to unions--to union participation, the Beck law, to the \nrights of union members, to union democracy, election of leaders, the \nway in which they participate--which are completely different from the \nrole of shareholders and the way shareholders participate.\n  More importantly, look at the basic numbers. Corporations outspent \nunions in political activities in the last election 15-1. Even if you \naccept the argument of some Republicans that unions tend to \npredominantly be supportive of Democrats, which might incidentally \nillicit some thinking on their part about why it is that happens, but \nwith ergonomics in the past week and other attacks, I think we can \nunderstand that differential, but even if you were to split the \ncorporate contributions--because some corporations do, indeed, also \ngive to Democrats--and you took only 8-1 or 7-1, you are looking at a \nlevel of expenditure that so far outstrips the participation of unions \nthat the real objection of some of our colleagues is not the money; it \nis the fact that people, voters, actually go out and get engaged in the \nsystem in a way that shareholders don't.\n  What they are trying to do is legislatively strip away the capacity \nof those people to be able to participate to the full extent of our \ndemocratic process.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States made it clear in Communication \nWorkers of America v. Beck--in the Beck decision--when it said that \nunions can't, over the objection of a dues-paying nonmember employee, \nspend funds collected from those activities unrelated to collective \nbargaining. They cannot use that money in politics already.\n  That decision has been properly codified in this legislation by \nSenators McCain and Feingold. Here we are codifying Beck and \nrestricting the capacity of the nonmember employee, dues-paying \nemployee. What the legislation seeks to do in reading several sections \nof it, sections (B), (C), and (D) of section 1, is show it is \nspecifically targeted to internal and external communications relating \nto specific candidates. That is the kind of communication that takes \nplace in the union. It doesn't take place among shareholders.\n\n  Internal disbursements, to operate and solicit contributions--\nlikewise, not a shareholder participation.\n  Voter registration drive, et cetera.\n  What it specifically seeks to do is restrain those activities which \nour colleagues don't like because they are participating in the \nprocess, and it doesn't achieve parity with the corporate sector--and, \nI might add, places a burden on the corporate process, which is \nabsolutely not workable.\n  I don't see how it is possible for corporations to make the kinds of \ndivisions that are called upon in this legislation. It would require a \nconstant tracking of new shareholders, a constant recalculation of \ntheir ownership stakes. Shares are traded daily on the stock market. \nCorporations would have to collect and process spending authorization \nfrom those daily changing shareholders. And, finally, the corporations \nwould have to pay additional dividends or other financial benefits to \nshareholders who refuse to authorize corporate and political \nlegislative spending.\n  It is completely unworkable on the corporate side, but it is not \nmeant to be workable. It is clearly meant to be a restraint on the \ncapacity of a voluntary association under the Constitution to be able \nto participate in the electoral process in a way not denied to any \nnumber of other groups in our country.\n  I think our colleagues ought to join together because this is an \namendment calculated to try to undo the McCain-Feingold concept, and \nparticularly calculated to establish a playing field that is not level.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield 5 minutes to my colleague from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the President of the United States, \nPresident Bush, issued a statement with regard to campaign finance \nreform indicating he is committed to working with the Congress to \nensure that fair and balanced campaign finance reform legislation is \nenacted. He specifically referred to a desire to have a balance between \nunions and corporations in the United States.\n  Apparently Senator Hatch's amendment is an attempt to do that. But as \nhas been effectively pointed out by Senator Levin, it doesn't \naccomplish that. It isn't balanced. It isn't parity. The distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts pointed out when it comes to the balance \nbetween unions and business in the country, this amendment doesn't even \napply to 99.7 percent of the businesses in the country.\n  It is an interesting technique to talk about balance between unions \nand corporations but not include many other kinds of organizations as \nwell.\n  What is even more troubling is the point made by the Senators from \nMichigan and Massachusetts. The definition of ``political activity'' is \nby no means balanced between what corporations do and unions do. This \nneeds to be reiterated. There are four kinds of\n\n[[Page S2647]]\n\nactivity listed. Two of the activities are activities in which at least \nat this point only unions participate, and a third is defined in a \ncircular way which means that it probably doesn't apply to the kind of \ndisbursements for television or radio that corporations do. The fourth \nactivity refers only to express advocacy, which unions and corporations \ncan only do through their PACs.\n  The Senator from Michigan has it right. He said it is purely paper \nparity between corporations and unions. What he said is not only \nalliterative, it is dead right. This amendment is purely paper parity.\n  Even the President of the United States' principles and desire that \nwe create a balance between unions and corporations are not achieved by \nthe Hatch amendment.\n  I compliment the Senator from Utah for attempting to do this. On its \nface, the amendment is not as one-sided as some that have been offered \nin the past. For example, one previous amendment on this subject said \nthat any union or corporation that charges its members dues is covered \nby the provision. But, of course, no corporation in America charges \ndues.\n  Nonetheless, let's be serious. Is there anybody in this body who \nreally believes that this provision will actually work? This amendment \nsupposedly would require every corporation in America to get the \npermission of its shareholders before it spends money for political \nactivities. That is ludicrous. Corporations have millions of \nshareholders. Their identity changes every day. The Senator from \nMassachusetts made this very clear--how could you possibly do this? \nBillions of shares of stock change hands each week--billions. \nApparently, it would be necessary to get the permission of every \nshareholder.\n  What about people who own shares in corporations through mutual \nfunds? How are their rights protected? Actually the amendment says that \n``without the separate, prior, written voluntary authorization of a \nstockholder, it shall be unlawful for any corporation described in this \nsection to use funds from its general treasury for the purpose of \npolitical activity.'' So perhaps this provision only requires \ncorporations to get the permission of one stockholder.\n  But if that is what it means, if it does not apply to billions of \nstockholders, which would be unworkable, and only requires the consent \nof one stockholder, it would be a sham like the earlier proposals.\n  I take the Senator from Utah at his word, that he is trying to be \nevenhanded, trying to cover unions and corporations equally. But if his \nproposal actually works, the Senator from Utah has singlehandedly \nrewritten the law of corporations in this amendment. Corporate \nshareholders generally have little ability to influence corporate \npolicy and practices. The officers and directors of a corporation do \nthat, and they are responsible and have a legal duty to their \nshareholders to do it. If this amendment actually works--and I am very \nskeptical that it does--then before this vote, corporate America should \nbe descending on this body en masse within an hour or so.\n  Lots of representatives of corporate America oppose this bill now, \nbut if this bill passes, every corporation in America will oppose it. \nThis provision would be a disaster for corporations if it works in that \nway.\n  Aside from the problems with this amendment that the other speakers \nhave very well pointed out, our Beck provision addresses the issue of \nthe use of union dues for political purposes. The real problem with \nthis amendment is that this is a poison pill to this bill. It fits the \ndefinition of a poison pill to a tee.\n  If this amendment passes, reform is dead. I am confident that we will \ndefeat it despite the herculean efforts of the Senator from Utah to \ncover corporations and unions equally because a sugar-coated poison \npill is still a poison pill. When the sugar wears off, and it will wear \noff pretty quickly on this amendment, as we have seen, the poison \nunderneath will kill this bill.\n  It is essential for the sake of this campaign finance reform effort \nthat this amendment be tabled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the arguments about the mechanics of \nthe Hatch amendment are a sham. The Securities and Exchange Commission \nhas managed to figure out ways to determine who is a shareholder and \nwhen, so that shareholders can be sent annual statements and proxies. \nRegulators are quite capable of handling these issues.\n  There has been mentioned on the floor, ``the appearance of \ncorruption.'' Let me ask a question. Why does it create the appearance \nof corruption for a union or citizen group to run an ad criticizing our \nvoting records around election time, such that it justifies regulation \nunder the Snowe-Jeffords language that is in the underlying McCain-\nFeingold bill, but it does not create the appearance of corruption of \nthe process for that same soft money from advocacy groups and unions to \nbe used for phone banks, leaflets, mailings, and other things designed \nto criticize candidates and influence elections?\n  This is absurd. Remember when you hear the words ``poison pill,'' you \nknow it is an amendment that may have some impact on organized labor.\n  It has been suggested by the sponsors and others that the Beck \ndecision, which of course applied to nonunion members working in union \nshops, was codified in the underlying McCain-Feingold bill.\n  I have a statement from the lawyer who represented Mr. Beck in that \ncase, dated January 30 of this year. He said:\n\n       I have reviewed section 304. As one of the attorneys for \n     the nonmembers in Beck, and objecting nonmembers in several \n     cases following Beck, I can assure you that section 304 of \n     McCain-Feingold-Cochran does not codify Beck. It would gut \n     Beck.\n       The federal courts and the National Labor Relations Board \n     (``NLRB'') now both have jurisdiction over claims of misuse \n     of compulsory dues for political and other nonbargaining \n     purposes. The jurisdiction is concurrent, because such claims \n     are claims for breach of the ``judicially created duty of \n     fair representation'' owed to workers by their exclusive \n     bargaining agents . . .\n\n  The Lawyer goes on:\n\n       However, section 304 of McCain-Feingold-Cochran would amend \n     section 8 of the NLRA expressly to make it an unfair labor \n     practice for a union to ``not to establish and implement [an] \n     objection procedure'' by which nonmembers compelled to pay \n     dues as a condition of employment can obtain a reduction in \n     their dues for ``expenditures supporting political activities \n     unrelated to collective bargaining.''\n       If this amendment to the NLRA becomes law, then the courts \n     are likely to hold that Congress intended to oust the courts \n     of jurisdiction to enforce the prohibition on such \n     spending.\\5\\ That would leave individual workers with no \n     effective means of enforcing their Beck rights, as history \n     demonstrates . . .\n\n  Further in the statement the lawyer points out:\n\n       Many Beck cases do not even make it to the Board, because \n     the NLRB's General counsel does not prosecute them \n     vigorously. According to the National Right to Work Legal \n     Defense Foundation's Staff Attorneys, who have represented \n     most employees who have filed Beck charges with the Board, \n     the General Counsel has settled many Beck charges with no \n     real relief for the charging employees. The Board's Regional \n     Directors have refused to issue complaints on and dismissed \n     many other charges at the direction of the General Counsel. \n     No appeal from a dismissal of a charge is possible, because \n     the General Counsel has ``unreviewable discretion to refuse \n     to institute unfair labor practice proceedings.'' . . .\n\n  The Lawyer continues:\n\n       Thus, by vesting Beck-enforcement authority in the NLRB, \n     the McCain-Feingold-Cochran amendment to the NLRA would leave \n     no real remedy available to objecting employees who wish to \n     bring Beck claims that a union's spending of compulsory dues \n     or fees, or its objection procedure, breaches the duty of \n     fair representation.\n       Section 304 of McCain-Feingold-Cochran, if it becomes law, \n     would legislatively overrule almost 40 years of decisions of \n     the United States Supreme Court concerning what union \n     activities objecting nonmembers may be compelled to subsidize \n     . . .\n\n  Far from codifying Beck, this underlying bill basically neutralizes \nBeck.\n\n       Section 304 of McCain-Feingold-Cochran purports to limit \n     the use of compulsory union dues and fees. In fact, it is \n     craftily drafted to overrule the Supreme court's \n     interpretation of the federal labor laws and sanction the \n     use, now prohibited, of compulsory dues and fees for a broad \n     range of political, ideological and other non-bargaining \n     purposes.\n       Section 304 effectively would overrule the Court's \n     decisions in Ellis and Beck for employees forced under the \n     NLRA to pay union dues and fees to keep their jobs, because \n     section 304 does not prohibit the use of compulsory dues for \n     all activities unnecessary to the performance of a union's \n     duties as the exclusive bargaining agent for the objecting\n\n[[Page S2648]]\n\n     employees' bargaining unit. Rather, section 304 prohibits the \n     use of compulsory union dues only for ``political activities \n     unrelated to collective bargaining.'' Section 304, if \n     enacted, thus would permit the use of compulsory funds for \n     union organizing, litigation not concerning the nonmembers' \n     bargaining unit, and the portions of union publications that \n     discuss those subjects, uses now prohibited under Ellis and \n     Beck.\n       Even worse, section 304 would repudiate the 1961 decision \n     in Street that no political and ideological activities may be \n     subsidized with compulsory dues and fees. Section 304 would \n     not prohibit the use of compulsory funds for all political \n     activities, but only ``political activities unrelated to \n     collective bargaining,'' which it defines as only \n     ``expenditures in connection with a Federal, State, or local \n     election or in connection with efforts to influence \n     legislation unrelated to collective bargaining.'' (Emphasis \n     added.) This definition would not prohibit the use of \n     compulsory dues and fees for political party activities not \n     in connection with an election, lobbying on judicial and \n     executive branch appointments, campaigning for and against \n     ballot propositions, and publications and public relations \n     activities on political and ideological issues not directed \n     to specific legislation. Moreover, because most legislation \n     on which unions lobby could be said to be ``related to \n     collective bargaining,'' the McCain-Feingold amendment would \n     effectively prohibit the use of compulsory dues and fees only \n     for and against candidates for public office . . .\n\n  Mr. President, you get the drift. Beck is effectively repealed by the \nunderlying McCain-Feingold legislation.\n  I do not know how many more speakers we have.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes. The other side has 29 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from New York.\n  How much time remains for the opponents?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opponents have 29 minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment of my friend Senator \nHatch on so-called ``paycheck protection.''\n  All of us know the purpose of this amendment. It is, quite simply, to \nkill McCain-Feingold, pure and simple.\n  The proponents of this amendment won't vote in favor of McCain-\nFeingold. They just want to diminish the number of Democrats voting for \nMcCain-Feingold and thereby have it fail.\n  In reality, the actual reason for this amendment is simply to end \ncampaign finance reform as we know it today.\n  If the proponents of this amendment wanted to move the issue forward, \nthey wouldn't do it as part of campaign finance because this amendment \nhas absolutely nothing to do with campaign finance.\n  This amendment is about the way unions and corporations govern \nthemselves, a subject we should debate separately.\n  I ask those who are proponents of this amendment if their goal is not \nto kill the underlying bill, they should then withdraw the amendment \nand move it forward in the appropriate committees as part of corporate \ngovernance and governance of labor unions.\n  Let us be clear about the actual substance. It is, as many have \nalready said on other occasions, ``paycheck deception'' to claim that \nunion members get railroaded into paying for speech with which they \ndisagree.\n  In reality, all of us know people are not forced to join unions. \nUnions are voluntary associations that members are free to quit the \nsecond they disagree with the union's political activities.\n  That is the essential freedom. If the freedom went any further, we \nwould have no voluntary organizations in America, and we probably \nwouldn't have a democracy.\n  To say that people are coerced by an organization that they can quit \nat any moment because they do not get the majority vote, there would be \nstrong objection to any legislative body, including this one, as there \nwould be to unions.\n  Even those who quit, of course, would be represented by the union by \npaying agency fees.\n  For that reason, the first amendment argument advanced by the \nproponents of this amendment is, quite frankly, a red herring.\n  There are people in this country and in this body who just do not \nlike unions. So they argue with the structure of the union, and the \nvery same structure of an organization that they like, they don't argue \nwith at all.\n  The first amendment rights of members are not transgressed when \nunions engage in political activity because they chose to associate \nthemselves with the speech. It's that simple.\n  Moreover, unions are democratic organizations.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle would have you believe \nthat union bosses are making unilateral decisions in smoke-filled rooms \nthat flout the will of their members and stifle their first amendment \nrights.\n  That very argument has been made by Communists and fascists about \nthis body and about our democracy. They vote. They set their own dues. \nNot everybody gets his or her way because a majority vote prevails.\n  It makes no sense to castigate unions for engaging in the same \nmajority rule upon which our country is founded. I argue that the \nreason we hear this argument is not because of any greater devotion to \ndemocracy but because of dislike and even hatred of unions. How dare \nthese union organizations force employers to pay more than the employer \nwants to pay. But, my colleagues, that argument went out if not in the \n1890s, in the 1930s.\n  We all know union members elect their own leaders, and they set their \nown dues. Not every member of the union is satisfied with the election. \nIn almost every vote we take here not every Member is satisfied with \nthe outcome of the vote.\n  If the union wants to change leaders and lower their dues to \nforeclose political expression, they are, of course, free to do so.\n  That they have not done that on the whole is an indication that \nmembers' free speech rights are not being violated in the wholesale way \nalleged by our friends on the other side.\n  Now, the sponsor of this amendment has commendably made the attempt--\nunlike some past versions of this--to include at least publicly held \ncorporations.\n  For one thing, I do not hear the venom directed at publicly held \ncorporations that make decisions and spend their money on ads when \ncertain shareholders disagree with those decisions. Shareholders can go \nto the corporate meeting, voice their objections, and they probably \nhave even less chance as an individual union member of changing things.\n  We do not hear that kind of vehemence and even venom. But the \nargument for union democracy is probably greater than that of corporate \ndemocracy.\n  Shares in corporations are alienable and change hands in virtually \ninstantaneous transactions millions of times each day.\n  To pretend that shareholders who buy and sell their shares so readily \nare analogous to members for the purpose of consenting to political \nspeech is just not a serious argument.\n  That is why it just isn't workable to try to include corporations, \nand why, my colleagues, this is just an anti-union measure from start \nto finish that should be debated in the Health, Education and Labor \nCommittee and put to its proper death.\n  Incidentally, also, other associations similar to labor unions, such \nas the Chamber of Commerce, aren't covered by this amendment.\n  In sum, I urge Members to vote against this amendment and see it for \nwhat it is--a poison pill that has nothing to do with union members' \nrights but everything to do with defeating campaign finance reform.\n  I thank my colleague and yield back the time I may have remaining.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I know my colleague from Oklahoma wishes to \nbe heard. I want to take a couple of minutes. I will be glad to give \nhim whatever time he needs. I would like to reserve 4 minutes at the \nend of the debate.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A little over 21 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. I will take about 5 minutes. My colleague from Oklahoma \nwants 5 or so minutes, if he would like, and others may show up. I \nwould like\n\n[[Page S2649]]\n\nto reserve the last 4 minutes to share some of that time with my \ncolleague from Kentucky, if he needs it, or anyone else who may come \nover.\n  Senator Schumer from New York made a very compelling and sound \nargument against this amendment.\n  First of all, I know it is something Members do with great frequency. \nIf you read this amendment, it is terribly complicated. It almost seems \nto be a flawed amendment. I get the thrust of what I think the Senator \nfrom Utah wants to do, but I am not sure, even if it were adopted, it \nachieves the results that he desires with the language he has crafted. \nIt is rather complicated. In fact, the modification that the Senator \nfrom Utah made may even complicate it further, as I read it.\n\n  Just on a first blush, if you look at this, the amendment itself \nprobably should be recrafted in a way. So it ought to be rejected \nmerely on technical grounds.\n  Even for those who may support what he wants to do, I do not believe \nthis amendment does what the author claims. For those of us who \ndisagree with the intent of the amendment, there are deeper reasons why \nthis amendment ought to be rejected. First, there is no parity. That is \nwhat my colleague from New York was suggesting. Whether people like \nunions or not, they are democratic institutions. There are laws which \ngovern how union officials are elected. They may not always perfect \nelections. There have been some highly flawed elections. Recently, we \nwent through one nationally where there was great controversy of one \nparticular international union. Members of that union protested loudly \nover how that election was conducted.\n  But, fundamentally, they are democratic institutions where the \nmembers get to decide a number of things. They decide whether or not to \nform a union. They decide who their officials will be by secret ballot. \nThey have rights to access of information about union finances and \noperations. Under the law, they are required to have that access. Union \nrules are applied on an equal basis. Now, there are problems that occur \nin the breach, but the law requires it.\n  If you change the word from ``union'' to ``corporation,'' the workers \nin a corporation do not have the right to organize themselves per se. \nThey do not elect their officials, the management team. Access to \ninformation of finances is not legally required to be made available to \nall the employees. The rules apply differently than from unions. \nCorporations are hierarchical structures. They could not function \notherwise. I am not suggesting it ought to be, but to suggest that \nunions and corporations are sort of parallel organizations is to fly in \nthe face of factually what exists.\n  So there is a significant difference between how a union is \norganized, how it functions, and how a corporation functions. Despite, \nagain, what my colleagues have said, there are 21 States in this \ncountry where people who are nonunion members still get the benefits of \nwhat unions are collectively able to bargain for. Nonunion members get \na free ride on the coattails of collective bargaining agreements in 21 \nStates in this country.\n  Further, there are laws in place to ensure that nonmembers in the 29 \nfree-bargaining States can confine their payments to what is directly \nrelated to collective bargaining, contract administration. That is in \n29 States in this country.\n  There have been a bunch of different States that have tried to do \nwhat the Senator from Utah wants to do. Every one of these States \nrejected it. Only one has it--ironically, the State of Utah--and that \nState has not made a determination yet as to whether or not this \npaycheck deception, as I call it, is going to become the law of the \nland.\n  Our colleagues in the State legislative bodies have rejected this. \nThe courts have rejected this as being unconstitutional as well.\n  Unions are the only member organizations that have to give their \nmembers the option of receiving all the economic benefits of membership \nwhether they are actually members. So whether one likes unions or does \nnot like them, there is a fundamental difference. To suggest somehow we \nare going to achieve parity, that is not the case.\n\n  On the issue of shareholders, despite the fact there has been a \ntremendous and healthy explosion of involvement by average citizens \npurchasing stocks in America in the last 10 years--While I do not have \nthe exact percentage today of Americans who own stock, own a piece of \nequity in American business, I would estimate it to be approximately \naround 70 percent. It is a wonderful, new statistic in terms of \npeople's participation economically in their own independence. But a \nsubstantial part of stock that has been purchased is purchased through \nmutual funds. There are individual buyers, but a lot of it is done \nthrough large investors or larger conglomerates, if you will.\n  However, when you start breaking this out and start to decide how a \nshareholder would vote on whether or not corporate funds ought to be \nused for political activities--I do not think I have to say much more--\nyou are entering a morass of problems on how you divide the percentages \nof corporate equity based on a corporation's political involvement. You \nare literally putting a sign around almost every corporation's neck \nsaying: Indict me. Because I do not know how you do it without getting \nyourself into trouble.\n  It seems to me, this bill is a step in the wrong direction. In a bill \nwhere we are trying to reduce the amount of money, the proliferation of \nsoft-money dollars, in politics, to try, all of a sudden, to engage in \na debate that is unworkable, and as the amendment is currently crafted, \nit is unworkable--and even if it were well crafted--I think this is \nfundamentally a step in the wrong direction and does not further the \noverall goals of this bill.\n  My colleague from New York said it well. If corporate America thought \nthis amendment was going to be adopted, it would be banging down the \nSenate doors. The idea that they should be treated exactly like unions \nis not something that corporate America would welcome.\n  Here make no mistake, again there appears to be a lot of animosity \nhere, a lot of venom, a lot of anger over the fact that organized labor \nfights on behalf of their people. They fight for a Patients' Bill of \nRights. They fight for prescription drug benefits. They fight for a \nminimum wage increase. They fight to improve the quality of education. \nMake no mistake, there are people who disagree with them. And they wish \nthe unions would just be quiet and go away and stop speaking out on \nthese issues and stop getting themselves involved in the political life \nof America. I appreciate their desire to have that occur, but that is \nnot right. It is not how America functions. It is not what we ought to \ncodify as new law.\n  Whatever else one thinks about McCain-Feingold--and despite the fact \nI agree with my colleague from Wisconsin, if this amendment were \nadopted, it would virtually act as a ``poison pill'' and kill this \nbill. To the extent people are interested in campaign finance reform, \nthe adoption of this amendment would, for all practical purposes, \ndestroy the fine effort that has been waged by the Senator from Arizona \nand the Senator from Wisconsin to achieve campaign finance reform.\n  If this amendment were adopted, aside from that issue, it would be a \nmajor setback, in my view, for millions and millions of working people \nin this country who want their voices heard, want the issues they care \nabout to be on the table when politics is being discussed and \ncandidacies are being decided.\n  For those reasons, and others brought up today, I respectfully say to \nmy friend from Utah that this amendment would be more properly \nwithdrawn for the reasons I said at the very outset of the discussion. \nNotwithstanding all of the above, the amendment ought to be defeated. \nAnd I urge my colleagues to do so when the vote occurs.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, it is with some regret I rise in \nopposition to this amendment. I tell my friend and colleague from \nConnecticut, I happen to agree with him on the portions of his debate \nalluding to the corporate side of this, trying to say that stockholders \nwould give approval--for the information of the Parliamentarian, I\n\n[[Page S2650]]\n\nam on the time of the Senator from Connecticut. I see the \nParliamentarian is having a hard time deciphering that. I am not often \non the side of my friend from Connecticut, but at this time I will use \nhis 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I hope the world notes and records this \nmoment. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. For the record, the Senator from Connecticut \nwants to be notified when there are 4 minutes remaining?\n  Mr. DODD. I think my colleague said he needs 5 minutes. I will give \nhim 10 minutes. If he uses less, let me know.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 12 minutes left.\n  Mr. DODD. Better make it 8.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will do that.\n  Mr. President, I mention to my friend from Connecticut, I happen to \nagree with him. The corporate side of this would not work. I read the \nlanguage. It is the second time today I have read the language. The \nother time I read the language was in relation to the amendment dealing \nwith broadcasting.\n  All of a sudden we are giving gifts to politicians to the tune of--if \nyou are from a large State, such as New York, New Jersey, or \nCalifornia, the previous amendment gave a gift to politicians in the \nmillions of dollars. And that was in the language. The language in this \namendment, regretfully--I have the greatest respect for my colleague \nfrom Utah, but I do not think the corporate side is workable.\n  I heard people say: We want to have voluntary campaign contributions \nthat should apply to the unions and businesses. But no one is compelled \nto be a stockholder.\n  My friend from Connecticut mentioned, you may happen to own a mutual \nfund. This is absolutely impossible to enforce. But I also say there is \na big difference between stockholders and employees. And the reason why \nwe called the original one paycheck protection is because unions are \nactually taking money away from individuals on a monthly basis many \ntimes to the tune of $20 or $30 a month, and in 29 States, in many \ncases, taking away that money without their approval. Oh, they may not \njoin the union, but they still have to pay agency dues, agency fees.\n  A lot of that money is used for political purposes. That part of the \namendment I happen to agree with wholeheartedly. That is the amendment \nI wish we were voting on, not this one that confuses corporate, where \nyou have to get shareholders' approval, who voluntarily purchase stock, \nbecause that is not workable.\n  It is workable to say, before you take money out of a worker's \npaycheck to the tune of $25 a month, if that individual does not want \ntheir money to be used--maybe $5, $10, $15 a month--for political \npurposes, they should have a veto. They should be able to say: No, \ndon't take my money.\n  No one should be compelled to contribute to a campaign in the year \n2001 in the United States. Yet we have millions of Americans who are \ngiven no choice. Some people have said this is a killer amendment, that \nit is a poison pill to kill the bill. I disagree wholeheartedly. I was \na principal sponsor of that original paycheck protection amendment. I \nstill am. I believe very strongly no one should be compelled to \ncontribute to a campaign against their will, period. We want to \nencourage participation. We don't want to mandate it. We don't want to \ntake money away from an individual, use it in a way they don't like, \nand then say: If you want to, you might file for a refund.\n  That is the Beck decision. I think we should strike the Beck \nprovision. I agree entirely with the Senator from Kentucky. The Beck \nprovision in the underlying bill is a fraud. It should not be in there. \nIt doesn't protect workers; it doesn't codify Beck. It dilutes it, if \nit does not totally eviscerate it. It needs to be deleted. We will \nwrestle with that amendment later. I don't want to confuse the two.\n  Paycheck protection is important. It is important for those millions \nof workers in 29 States that are compelled to join a union. If they \nobject to the union and resign their membership in the union, they \nstill have to pay agency fees. Agency fees can be in excess of $20 a \nmonth. Much of that money, maybe half, maybe more, is used for \npolitical purposes against their will. Those hard earned dollars may be \nused for political purposes maybe they don't agree with, money that \ngoes to candidates campaigning against a tax cut, maybe campaigning to \ntake away their right to own firearms, maybe very liberal positions \nwith which they don't agree.\n  You might ask: Where did Paycheck Protection come from? I began this \nfight because an American Airlines union member came up to me and said \nthat his money was being used for political purposes that he was \nagainst it, totally, and he couldn't do anything about it. I told him I \nwould try to help him. I told him I will try to pass legislation to \nhave voluntary campaign contributions for everybody in America. That \nshouldn't be too much to ask for. That is the genesis of paycheck \nprotection.\n  I hope maybe we will have a chance to vote on that. I hope we will \nfind out, are people really for voluntary campaign contributions. \nUnfortunately, the amendment we have before us does much more than make \na campaign contributions voluntary. So maybe at a later point in the \ndebate--we still have a week and a half left--maybe we can vote on \nvoluntary campaign contributions. That is this Senator's purpose.\n  For someone to say this is a poison pill because organized labor \ndoesn't want it is nonsense, do we should just give a special interest \na blank check--do we let them veto anything that we present on the \nfloor of the Senate? I don't think so. Organized labor forcibly \nconfiscates hundreds of millions of dollars for political purposes. \nOrganized labor put in at least $300 to $500 million in the last \ncampaign cycle. That is a lot of money. Let them participate, but it \njust should all be done with voluntary campaign contributions.\n\n  Likewise, if businesses are raising money for political action \ncommittees, that should all be done on a voluntary basis. Nobody should \nbe compelled to contribute to a campaign in the year 2001.\n  I hope we will have a chance to vote on paycheck protection, \nvoluntary campaign contributions for all Americans. I do believe that \nthe language that deals with the corporate side of this is not workable \nand does not have anything to do with voluntary campaign contributions. \nI say that with great regret because I have the greatest respect for my \ncolleague from Utah.\n  I also want to address one other issue very quickly. That is the \nissue with Beck. My friend from Kentucky mentioned that the Beck \nlanguage in the underlying bill needs to be taken out. I agree \nwholeheartedly. I hope we will have bipartisan support. People who said \nthey wanted to codify the Beck decision, this does not codify it, it \nchanges it, changes it dramatically. To me, that is not right. I don't \nthink it is right for us to say verbally it codifies Beck when it takes \nworker protections and actually guts the Beck decision. I hope that at \na later point, not to confuse it with this amendment, but at a later \npoint my colleagues will join those of us who would like to see that \nlanguage removed from the underlying bill.\n  I thank my friend and colleague from Connecticut for the time and \nalso my friend and colleague from Kentucky who I think has handled this \nbill quite well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 7 minutes 23 seconds remaining for \nthe proponents, and 6 and a half minutes for the opponents.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Before the Senator from Oklahoma leaves the floor, I \nwant him to know he has our great admiration. He is the one who thought \nof paycheck protection. He outlined the history of it a few moments \nago. I understand we will not have his vote on this offering because, \nas he knows, we were trying to meet the objections of some of those on \nthe other side who have said for years: You ought to apply it to \ncorporations as well as unions. We did that. It looks as though we are \nnot going to get any of their votes anyway.\n  I do credit the Senator from Oklahoma. This is his piece of work \noriginally. I hope at some point in the debate he will offer the \namendment without the corporate provision. I certainly would vote for \nit. I think many Members would. It deals with a very real problem in \nthe American political system.\n\n[[Page S2651]]\n\n  I think we are essentially through with the debate, I say to my \nfriend from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield, we are prepared to yield back \nwhatever time we have remaining. If that would be the case, then I \nthink a motion to table would be made, and we could move on.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield back the time on this side.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield back our time as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to table amendment No. 134, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.

I ask unanimous consent, following the debate tonight \non the pending Hatch amendment, the Senate then resume consideration of \nthe amendment beginning at 9 o'clock in the morning, and there be 30 \nminutes of debate remaining, equally divided, in the usual form. \nFinally, I ask consent that following the use or yielding back of time, \nthe Senate proceed to a vote on or in relation to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 136\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 136.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object--I don't intend to \nobject--does the Senator have copies of the amendment?\n  Mr. HATCH. I understand your side has copies.\n  Mr. DODD. I say to my colleague, there is a copy we can get.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have a copy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the dispensing of the \nreading of the amendment?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To add a provision to require disclosure to shareholders and \n        members regarding use of funds for political activities)\n\n       On page 37, between lines 14 and 15, and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 305. DISCLOSURE OF DISBURSEMENTS OF UNION DUES, FEES, \n                   AND ASSESSMENTS OR CORPORATE FUNDS FOR \n                   POLITICAL ACTIVITIES.\n\n       Title III of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 \n     U.S.C. 431 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 304 \n     the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 304A. DISCLOSURE OF DISBURSEMENTS OF UNION DUES, FEES, \n                   AND ASSESSMENTS OR CORPORATE FUNDS FOR \n                   POLITICAL ACTIVITIES.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--Any corporation or labor organization \n     (including a separate segregated fund established and \n     maintained by such entity) that makes a disbursement for \n     political activity or a contribution or expenditure during an \n     election cycle shall submit a written report for such cycle--\n       ``(1) in the case of a corporation, to each of its \n     shareholders; and\n       ``(2) in the case of a labor organization, to each employee \n     within the labor organization's bargaining unit or units;\n\n     disclosing the portion of the labor organization's income \n     from dues, fees, and assessments or the corporation's funds \n     that was expended directly or indirectly for political \n     activities, contributions, and expenditures during such \n     election cycle.\n       ``(b) Contents.--\n       ``(1) In general.--The report submitted under subsection \n     (a) shall disclose information regarding the dues, fees, and \n     assessments spent at each level of the labor organization and \n     by each international, national, State, and local component \n     or council, and each affiliate of the labor organization and \n     information on funds of a corporation spent by each \n     subsidiary of such corporation showing the amount of dues, \n     fees, and assessments or corporate funds disbursed in the \n     following categories:\n       ``(A) Direct activities, such as cash contributions to \n     candidates and committees of political parties.\n       ``(B) Internal and external communications relating to \n     specific candidates, political causes, and committees of \n     political parties.\n       ``(C) Internal disbursements by the labor organization or \n     corporation to maintain, operate, and solicit contributions \n     for a separate segregated fund.\n       ``(D) Voter registration drives, State and precinct \n     organizing on behalf of candidates and committees of \n     political parties, and get-out-the-vote campaigns.\n       ``(2) Identify candidate or cause.--For each of the \n     categories of information described in a subparagraph of \n     paragraph (1), the report shall identify the candidate for \n     public office on whose behalf disbursements were made or the \n     political cause or purpose for which the disbursements were \n     made.\n       ``(3) Contributions and expenditures.--The report under \n     subsection (a) shall also list all contributions or \n     expenditures made by separated segregated funds established \n     and maintained by each labor organization or corporation.\n       ``(c) Time to Make Reports.--A report required under \n     subsection (a) shall be submitted not later than January 30 \n     of the year beginning after the end of the election cycle \n     that is the subject of the report.\n       ``(d) Definitions.--In this section:\n       ``(1) Election cycle.--The term `election cycle' means, \n     with respect to an election, the period beginning on the day \n     after the date of the previous general election for Federal \n     office and ending on the date of the next general election \n     for Federal office.\n       ``(2) Political activity.--The term `political activity' \n     means--\n       ``(A) voter registration activity;\n       ``(B) voter identification or get-out-the-vote activity;\n       ``(C) a public communication that refers to a clearly \n     identified candidate for Federal office and that expressly \n     advocates support for or opposition to a candidate for \n     Federal office; and\n       ``(D) disbursements for television or radio broadcast time, \n     print advertising, or polling for political activities.''\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this amendment is simple, and \nstraightforward. It does not attempt to codify the Beck case that we \ndebate year-after-year on the Senate floor. There is nothing complex or \nlegalistic about it. Frankly, like the section 527 bill we passed last \nyear, we simply require disclosure.\n  This is a modest measure of fundamental fairness. It is a simple \nright-to-know amendment. The right of American workers and shareholders \nwho pay dues and fees to unions and corporations that represent them, \nto know how their money is being spent for certain political purposes, \ncauses, and activities. It does nothing more than require a report by \nlabor organizations and corporations to be given to the shareholders \nand workers represented by unions. This shows how much of their money \nis being spent in the political process.\n  As we all know, part of the debate here has been the use of these \ntypes of money that never have to, because of the loophole in the \nFederal election laws, be seen on the reports or be reported by those \nwho received benefits from union expenditures.\n  I have to say this amendment does not impose overly burdensome or \nonerous requirements on corporations or unions. This is basic \ninformation, and it should be freely provided.\n  I cannot believe that either union or corporate leadership has a \nlegitimate interest in keeping secret what political causes and \nactivities employee\n\n[[Page S2652]]\n\ndues, fees, or earnings are being spent to support. If employees or \nshareholders learn how their money is being spent in the political \nprocess, unions and corporations will enjoy an even greater confidence \nlevel in their decisionmaking.\n  On the other hand, if employees and shareholders might not like what \nthey see, is that any reason they should not see it? Is it too onerous? \nNo. After the numerous paperwork burdens that this Congress has freely \nimposed on small businesses and all taxpaying citizens, how can any of \nus object to ensuring that workers, teachers, janitors, electricians, \nand others are informed about how their dues are being spent on the \nmost fundamental of all American activities, the political process?\n  I doubt anyone would suggest that unions, even at the local level, do \nnot keep these records anyway. How else can an organization that \nrepresents employees be effective and accountable, if it does not even \nknow how the dues and fees collected from the employees it represents \nare being expended?\n  Should we have the same requirements also be applied to corporations \nthat give this type of information to their shareholders? There is not \nthe same problem there, but why not, if that is what my colleagues \nthink is fair? My amendment therefore covers not only labor unions but \nalso corporations for this simple disclosure requirement.\n\n  This amendment represents only one simple, straightforward question: \nShould an employee be left in the dark on how his or her union dues and \nfees are being spent in the political process? This amendment is the \nmost modest of beginning steps we can take to bring common sense or \nreform to our campaign laws.\n  Finally, let me add one more important point. Everyone knows that the \ncorporate world represents shareholders and not individual dues-paying \nmembers. Everybody knows the corporate world does not do the collateral \ncampaign work that the unions do with dues-paid money. It is hardly the \nsame situation. That most likely is the reason why some of my \ncolleagues did not vote for the preceding amendment.\n  But the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts has in the past \nraised a fair point. If we include the unions, why should we not \ninclude the corporations? These are not reporting requirements that are \nonerous or burdensome.\n  This amendment is about basic fairness, and I hope all my colleagues \nwill support it. Basically, it allows individuals that are shareholders \nor members of a labor organization the right to know how their money is \nspent in the American electoral process.\n  I think this is a fair amendment, it is a decent amendment, it is \nfair to both sides. It just requires simple disclosure. Why not?\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, does my colleague from Arizona wish to be \nheard on this?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would like 3 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Hatch for an effort to do \nwhat all of us agree is a fundamental of any campaign finance reform, \nand that is full and complete disclosure. I regret having to point out \nmy opposition to this amendment because it is my understanding this \nfull disclosure of political activity of both business and labor is \ndefined in the basic bill under section (2) Political Activity, which \nsays:\n\n       The term ``political activity'' means--(A) voter \n     registration activity; (B) voter identification or get-out-\n     the-vote activity; (C) a public communication that refers to \n     a fairly identified candidate for Federal office and that \n     expressly advocates support for or opposition to a candidate \n     for Federal office; and [finally] (D) disbursement for \n     television or radio broadcast time, print advertising or \n     polling for political activities.\n\n  The way I read this is most of these activities are conducted by \nlabor unions and only one by corporations. So we have an imbalance here \non requirements for disclosure.\n  There are many other things that are done by businesses and \ncorporations that need to be disclosed as well, in my view. Very few \ncorporate activities are involved in voter registration activities. Of \ncourse, unions are. The same thing holds for voter identification or \nget-out-the-vote activity. Express advocacy is clearly not something \nthat is done a lot by businesses, nor is polling.\n  I assure Senator Hatch of the following: We are working with Senator \nSnowe and with Senator Cochran and Senator Collins, and we are trying \nto come up with a fair disclosure amendment that will give greater \ndisclosure than is presently in the bill but in a more fair and \nbalanced way.\n  I will have to oppose this amendment on the grounds of its imbalance. \nThe one thing we promised everybody when we proposed this legislation \nwas we would resist any attempt to pass an amendment that would \nunbalance what we had put forward as a level playing field. This would \nimbalance that. I believe we can have all of those items fully \ndisclosed, and more, so observers will say this full disclosure, this \nlight, will shine on business and unions alike in an equal manner.\n  Having said that, I regret to have to oppose the amendment. I will \nmake a motion to table at the appropriate time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator from Connecticut yield \nme 3 minutes?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield my colleague 5 minutes.\n  I thank my colleague from Arizona for his comments. We are going to \nmeet in the morning for a half-hour debate before the final vote on \nthis Hatch II amendment. I thank my colleague.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, with all respect to my friend and \ncolleague from Utah, this really is no improvement over the earlier \namendment. In many respects, it just continues the differentiation by \nwhich different groups are being treated, not just the corporations and \nunions but other groups as well.\n  Again, I know my friend talked about the drafting. He doesn't need \nany lectures from me. But I am confused because the amendment is very \nunclear. It says, for example, that ``political activities'' must be \nreported. If you look on page 5 it has ``political activity'' defined. \nIf you go to the term ``political activity,'' it means, if you go to \nline 19, ``political activity.''\n  So you have political activity being defined as political activity. \nIt is really quite difficult to understand.\n  We all know at the present time that unions are subject to \nsubstantial reporting and disclosure requirements. I have in my hand \nthe disclosure requirements. They are extensive. Unions have to \ndisclose PAC funds, all payments for express advocacy, and detailed \nfinancial information. This goes far beyond what corporations today are \nrequired to report.\n  It is publicly available. For any of those who have a viewpoint that \nis the same as that of the Senator from Utah, they can just go down to \nthe Labor Department where all these reports are on file. They are \navailable to the public.\n  The case has not been made about the inadequacy of the information \nthat is reported. We have language requiring additional disclosure in \nthis amendment, but there has been no case that the current information \nis inadequate to reveal what political activities are being supported.\n  I think that doesn't make a great deal of sense.\n  This bill is not only vague, it is burdensome. As we mentioned \nearlier, and as Senator Hatch said during our prior colloquy, \ncorporations would have to send reports to anyone who was a shareholder \nat the time of the expenditures.\n  We have had the chance to do the numbers. Last week alone there were \nmore than 6 billion stockholder transactions just on the New York Stock \nExchange.\n  Does this mean that if any of the corporations that would be included \nin this bill made an expenditure last week that all holders of those \nshares would have to be notified? The amendment says they would have to \nbe notified of all expenditures within a 2-year election cycle. That is \nunwieldy. It is unworkable. It is enormously bureaucratic. It makes no \nsense at all.\n  We had a good exchange in the last debate. Many of us are troubled \nabout what either my good friend, Senator Hatch, or others who support \nthis amendment have against working families and the working families' \nagenda.\n\n[[Page S2653]]\n\n Working families want an increase in the minimum wage, a Patients' \nBill of Rights, and additional funding in education. They want to make \nsure we have a sound and secure national security. They want Medicare \nand Medicaid to be enhanced. They want to improve worker training. They \nwant to invest in continuing education and workforce training programs. \nI daresay that kind of a program would be worthwhile at the present \ntime. This is what their agenda is all about.\n  We are probably in some form of economic crisis. And what we have \nfrom the administration is a tax bill which isn't an economic program; \nit is a tax bill that was basically devised over a year ago when we had \nentirely different economic conditions.\n  I think the kinds of investment that working families have advocated \nin terms of ensuring that we are going to invest in training programs, \ninvest in education, invest in small business, enhance research and \ntraining, and not see further cuts in the National Science Foundation, \nor other cuts in the advanced technology program, makes a good deal of \nsense.\n  We hope this amendment is not accepted. In the earlier debate and \ndiscussion, we went through these and other provisions in careful \ndetail. The amendment does seem to be one-sided, unfairly targeted, and \ncompletely unnecessary.\n  I think the sponsors, Senator Feingold, and Senator McCain, as well \nas Senator Dodd and others, have eloquently pointed out the kind of \nbalance and protections for the American voters that have been included \nin the McCain-Feingold legislation. That was carefully considered. It \nseems to me that we ought to stay with those proposals. I hope this \namendment will not be accepted.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for \nhis comments. I think he hit it right on the head with this.\n  I made comments earlier on the previous amendment offered by my good \nfriend from Utah. He made the point. I understood the intent of what \nthe Senator was trying to achieve. As Senator Nickles of Oklahoma, with \nwhom I don't normally agree on these matters, properly pointed out, you \ncannot carry out the intent of the amendment. Despite the desire to do \nso, the language of the amendment, if followed to the letter of the \nproposal, or even the spirit, creates a tremendously bureaucratic \nnightmare for both corporations and for labor organization.\n  I do not agree that anyone would have an interest to discourage \nactivity at all. We want to know what is going on. Under current \nFederal law, labor unions are required to make various records be \navailable and open. The records cannot be shielded or hidden. That is \nin violation of existing Federal law.\n  To suddenly add even more bureaucratic requirements for every \ndisbursement, receipt and expenditure in every level, including \naffiliates, and every minor tangible office, is not in the spirit of \ntrue disclosure. This is in the spirit of discouragement from anyone \nparticipating in the process. Everyone knows we have a hard time \ngetting more people to participate in the process as it is.\n  In last year's Presidential and congressional Federal elections, we \nhad about 50 million who participated out of 101 million eligible \nvoters in this country. It seems to me we ought to be doing better and \nwe can do better. We lecture the world all the time about how important \nit is to vote. We like to think of ourselves as an example for nations \nthat are seeking to establish democratic institutions.\n  It seems to me it is in our collective interest to promote that idea, \nand to do so by example with an environment of full disclosure, of \nfairness, and of equity.\n  But with all due respect to my friend from Utah, the adoption of this \namendment is nothing more than to create unnecessary burdens on \ninstitutions that, frankly, we wish were more active in the political \nlife of America. If they were, then in some sense through voter \neducation efforts we might have greater voter participation.\n  This amendment, in my view, only adds additional unnecessary burdens \nto a process that already discourages too many people from \nparticipating in the public life of our Nation. For those reasons, I \nurge our colleagues when the vote occurs tomorrow to reject this \namendment.\n  I think the provisions included in the bill drafted by the Senators \nfrom Arizona and Wisconsin very aptly deal with this very question of \ntrue disclosure and information. They have done so in the spirit of \nseeking to make people aware of what institutions are doing that \ninvolve themselves in the political life of our country.\n  But to add this amendment to the McCain-Feingold bill would have the \nopposite effect. It would not effectuate what we are trying to achieve. \nOur goals are to reduce the proliferation of the money in the political \nlife of our country and to make it less costly for people to seek \nFederal office.\n  We ought to simultaneously try to reduce the amount of hurdles, \nburdens, and gauntlets that institutions such as corporations and labor \nunions have to presently meet. To add to them, to make their \ninvolvement even more difficult, I don't think is in anyone's interest, \nDemocrats or Republicans, and certainly not in the interest of the \nAmerican people.\n\n  For those reasons, I frankly urge that the amendment be withdrawn. \nBut, if it is not going to be withdrawn, I urge my colleagues with the \nsame expression that we saw with the previous Hatch amendment to vote \nwith the same sense of collective voice on this particular proposal. \nFor those reasons, I urge the rejection of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have listened to these comments about the \nimbalance. McCain-Feingold is balance. It brings balance. Let me give \nyou an illustration.\n  McCain-Feingold regulates what unions care about least. Think about \nit. It regulates get out the vote. It regulates two things: It \nregulates television advertisement within 60 days. It regulates radio \nads for a candidate--not a party--within 60 days of a general election, \nor 30 days of a primary. It does do that. That is technically \nunconstitutional on its face. But it does do that. Television \nadvertisements and radio advertisements are all McCain-Feingold does \nwith regard to what the unions are interested in. These are the two \nthings they care about least.\n  What they really care about and what we ought to be concerned about, \nif we want fairness, and if we don't want one side to have an advantage \nover the other, McCain-Feingold ought to cover all get out the vote \nactivities. That is probably one of the most important things in the \npolitical process today, if not the most important thing.\n  Voter identification, McCain-Feingold does not do anything about \nthat. Voter registration, nothing. Mass mailings, nothing. Phone banks, \nnothing; magazine advertisements, newspaper advertisements, outdoor \nadvertising and leafleting, polling, volunteer recruitment and \ntraining, union-salaried, full-time political operatives. And look, I \ndo not have any problem with that in the sense that unions have a right \nto do whatever they want to do in advancing their issues in the \npolitical process. And I would fight for their right to do that, as I \nhave in the past. But the only people whose rights are infringed upon \nby the McCain-Feingold bill happen to be the Republican Party because \nthe unions do all of this for the Democratic Party.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. If I could finish making my point, and then I will be \nhappy to yield.\n  The unions are the principal get-out-the-vote force in the Democratic \nParty. Keep in mind, 40 percent of union members are Republicans, yet \nalmost 100 percent of the money that unions raise helps get out the \nvote for Democrats. That does not seem like a fair process, but that is \nthe way it is. But that money could only be hard money to the political \nparties, meaning they are severely hampered in getting out the vote.\n  No. 2, voter identification. The unions do that beautifully for \nDemocrats. I do not know of one Republican that a union has worked for \nto help identify Republican voters. I am sure there is one or two, but \nthe fact is the vast majority--almost 100 percent--of their money goes \nto help Democrats. That is their right. Why aren't the Democrats scared \nabout what the McCain-Feingold bill will do to the\n\n[[Page S2654]]\n\nDemocratic Party? Because the Democratic Party does not have to worry \nabout all of this because the unions do it for them? Most of the \nemployees of the unions are dues-paid political operatives. They are \nvery good, the best in the business. I respect them.\n  Volunteer registration: The Republican Party has been limited to hard \ndollars--$1,000 a person--in order to get out voter registration. The \nunions do it for the Democrats. And, by the way, there is not one word \nin McCain-Feingold to regulate that, or to require the same requisite \non the unions that they require on the Republican Party.\n  The Democratic Party can get by because the unions will do it for \nthem. Even though they have the same rules as the Republican Party, the \nRepublican Party does not have a group like the union movement doing \nget out the vote, voter identification, voter registration, mass \nmailings, phone banks, magazine advertisements, newspaper \nadvertisements, outdoor advertising and leafleting, polling, volunteer \nrecruitment and training, and a whole raft of other things, including--\n--\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield on that point? That is not our \nfault. That is your fault. Why don't you get somebody to organize the \nvoter registration and GOTV?\n  Mr. HATCH. Wait. The last point I was making was, and union-salaried, \nfull-time political operatives.\n  You can say that is our fault. Let's assume that is so. The fact is, \nwe do not have anybody doing that. It is totally unregulated. That is \nthe guts of the political process. If we are going to regulate, let's \nregulate everybody, not just the parties. And the parties themselves \nought to be given greater leeway than this bill gives them.\n  The only thing that McCain-Feingold regulates is the thing that the \nunions care about the least; that is, TV advertisements and radio \nadvertisements.\n  Look, I give a lot of credit to the Democrats. I give a lot of credit \nto the unions. There is no question that is why they won the last \nelection in the Senate and had more people elected than Republicans. \nBecause they were getting out the vote like never before. They did \nvoter identification like never before. They did voter registration. \nThey did mass mailings. And they did phone banks. They did TV \nadvertisements, radio advertisements, magazine advertisements, \nnewspaper advertisements, outdoor advertising and leafleting, polling, \nvolunteer recruitment and training, and had union-salaried, full-time \npolitical operatives all over this country. That is their right.\n\n  Why do we take all those rights away from the Republican Party? You \ncan't just answer by saying that is the Republicans' fault because they \nare not paying the same homage to the unions that the Democrats do, and \nI have to say we are not, in the sense of doing everything that they \nwant done, because not everything they want done is right.\n  All my amendment does is require disclosure to the union members and \ncorporate shareholders. I am not even asking for priority in this area. \nI am not asking for any equality with regard to all the things the \nunions do for Democrats that make them not care about the parties not \nbeing able to raise soft money. The unions do it all for them, and that \nis all soft money.\n  Now, I had some strong words with my colleague from Massachusetts \nearlier in this debate, and they were meant in good taste and in good \nhumor as well. But I feel strongly on this issue.\n  This amendment will give ordinary workers the opportunity to have a \nmeaningful voice in how their political contributions are used. I held \na union card. I understand this.\n  Organized labor is not a monolithic entity, but too often the \nleadership of these unions act in a monolithic fashion when it comes to \nelections.\n  This amendment tries to level the playing field for both unions and \ncorporations. All it requires is disclosure.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield on that point?\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure.\n  Mr. DODD. I want to point out, if I may, when you talk about the \ngreat advantage that labor has, because it does organize, it does work \non voter registration, it does work on get out the vote----\n  Mr. HATCH. It does all these things----\n  Mr. DODD. If I may finish. This is not a liability and it should be \napplauded. The fact that corporations do not do that sort of a thing \ndoes not mean that other organizations should be condemned because they \ndo encourage people to participate.\n  To make one other point regarding parity, as of October 2000, \naccording to the Center for Responsive Politics and the Federal \nElection Commission, the ratio of ``total'' contributions from \ncorporations versus unions was 15 to 1. As of October 2000, \ncorporations had contributed more than $841 million dollars, while \nunions contributed just over $36 million. As of October 2000, the ratio \nof ``hard money'' contributions from corporations versus unions was 14 \nto 1. In 1998 and 1996, the ratio was 16 to 1. Between 1992 and 1998, \ncorporate contributions increased nearly $220 million, while union \ncontributions grew by $12.6 million. No parity in these statistics.\n  These ratios and statistics are according to the Federal Election \nCommission. You talk about disparity--16 to 1--every year, I say to my \nfriend from Utah. Corporations have massive amounts of money, hard and \nsoft money, they are pouring into these Federal elections.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. If I may take back the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Of course you may. It is your time, Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. Nowhere did they count these dues-paid political \noperatives. I read a report a number of years back--I think it was the \nCongressional Research Service, if my recollection serves me \ncorrectly--where they estimated that the unions spend about a half \nbillion dollars--that is with a ``B''--a half billion dollars every 2 \nyears in local, State, and Federal politics. This money is spent on \ndues-paid political operative activities that never show up in these \nfigures.\n  Let me tell you, I am not against their right to do that. I think \nthey should have a right to do that. I respect them. I will fight for \ntheir right to do that. The fact that it is all one-sided, even though \n40 percent of union members are Republicans, I can live with that. But \nwhat I cannot live with is shutting down the party, the only way we can \ncompete, where the unions do all these things for Democrats but nothing \nfor Republicans.\n  The fact is, the Democrats will continue to count on the unions to \nget out their vote. But why do we have McCain-Feingold shutting down \nthe rights of Republicans to compete to get out the vote, to have voter \nidentification, voter registration, mass mailings, phone banks, TV \nadvertisements, radio advertisements, magazine advertisements, \nnewspaper advertisements, outdoor advertising and leafleting, polling, \nvolunteer recruitment and training, and full-time political operatives?\n  The fact is, this is all done for Democrats. Their party does not \nhave to do it. They can live with the hard money limitation that this \nbill would impose upon them. But the Republican Party would have no \nsoft money. All this is soft money on the unions' part--all working for \nDemocrats, all one sided. And the Republican Party does not have the \nsame opportunities. Talk about imbalance.\n  Again, let's go back to what my amendment does. My amendment does not \nsay: Stop that. You members of the unions are not allowed to do that. \nIt does not say that at all. It does not say you can't get out the vote \nfor Democrats, and does not say you can't do voter identification for \nDemocrats. It does not say you can't do voter registration for \nDemocrats. It does not say you can't do mass mailings or phone banks or \nTV advertisements or radio advertisements--although for those two, with \nthe 60-day requirement, McCain-Feingold does do something; but it is \nunconstitutional on its face--it does not say you can't do magazine \nadvertisements and newspaper advertisements and outdoor advertising and \nleafleting and polling, and volunteer recruitment and training. It does \nnot say you can't have union-salaried, full-time political operatives--\nthe best in the business, all over the country in every State in the \nUnion that counts, in every large city that counts. They can do all of \nthat.\n  I am not arguing against that. All my amendment says is that they \nneed to disclose to their members something that in this computer age \nthey can do without--\n\n[[Page S2655]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. If I could just finish my comments, something that they \ncan do in this computer age without an awful lot of difficulty, and \nsomething I believe the corporate world can do without an awful lot of \ndifficulty is provide disclosure. Tell me what is wrong with \ndisclosure. To me, that is the only thing that will make our process \nmore fair, more honest, more decent. Disclosure helps everyone equally \nto know how their money is spent. I believe that everyone should be \nentitled to know what political speech they are supporting. Disclosure \nis what honesty and fairness in politics is all about. Why would anyone \nfight against disclosure?\n  Fairness is all I am asking for. I am not asking to stop any of this. \nIt has been admitted basically that unions do the work for the \nDemocratic Party.\n  Mr. DODD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. They basically help the Democratic Party, and they will \ncontinue to have the right to.\n  Mr. DODD. Should we have with all these independent 501(c)(4)s, the \nNational Right to Life groups, the Christian Coalition, the National \nRifle Association, should there be full disclosure of every member, \nincluding all their disbursements, contributions, and expenditures? \nDoes my colleague support that?\n  Mr. HATCH. You can't compare those to the unions.\n  Mr. DODD. Would you agree?\n  Mr. HATCH. I would like to answer. The National Rifle Association is \nmade up primarily of blue-collar Democrats. In all honesty, that is why \nthere hasn't been a lot of mouthing about gunslinging because Al Gore \nfound in the last election that he had offended an awful lot of \nDemocrats. I think that is why he lost West Virginia.\n  Mr. DODD. Should we have full disclosure?\n  Mr. HATCH. Not of members, but only of expenditures.\n  Mr. DODD. Why not of members?\n  Mr. HATCH. Because then you get into the NAACP, and we have already \nhad the Supreme Court say that is unconstitutional.\n  Mr. DODD. Should we know who are making the contributions to these \norganizations that are out every day with such activities as get out \nthe vote, voter registration, voter information, and mailings? You talk \nabout full disclosure, why not full disclosure on these organizations?\n  Mr. HATCH. The Supreme Court has ruled in cases that you cannot \nrequire disclosure of membership lists. I don't personally have much \nproblem with disclosure of moneys that have been put into the process, \nbut not the names.\n  Mr. DODD. Are we going to keep that secret?\n  Mr. HATCH. The main case was the NAACP where one of the Southern \nStates tried to get them to disclose their membership list and the \nCourt said they didn't have to do. They are a legitimate organization. \nI am not asking the unions to disclose their membership lists either, \nnor am I asking corporations to disclose their shareholder lists, \nalthough anybody who looks at a corporate filing can figure that out.\n  If disclosure requirements applied equally to the Sierra Club, to \nNARAL, and to other groups, disclosure might not be a bad thing for all \nof them. I would not be pushing for disclosure of members in nonprofit \nfoundations because the Supreme Court has already ruled on that. But \nnow we are talking about real players in the political process, not \nperipheral organizations. The fact is, many members of the NRA are \nDemocrats. They are just offended by some of the phony demagoging that \nhas been done about guns through the years. They are tough on crime. \nThat is another debate.\n\n  With regard to the right-to-life community, I have to admit that they \nsupport both sides, but they support people who are pro-life, just as \nthe pro-choice groups support the people who are pro-choice on both \nsides.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Will the Senator yield on this point?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. My good friend from Connecticut raised an issue that \ntroubles me about this proposed amendment that the distinguished \nSenator from Utah has put forth.\n  In addition to the issues that Senator Kennedy and Senator Dodd have \nraised about the vagueness and definitional concerns raised in the \namendment, this particular issue is the real heart of the parity \nproblem that many of us have with this amendment.\n  It reminds me of the old Anatole France saying: The law is fair; \nneither the rich nor the poor can sleep under the bridge. What we have \nis an amendment that in its practice not only would fall \ndisproportionately on unions as compared to corporations but which, \nunder the rationale put forward by it, completely leaves out other \nmembership groups, as the Senator from Connecticut so rightly points \nout.\n  The burdensome reporting requirements that are imposed under this \namendment on unions in particular are really much more difficult to \ncomply with than if they would be in a corporation. As I understand the \namendment, corporations would be required to report only on \nexpenditures from their own general treasuries and from the general \ntreasuries of their subsidiaries. However, unions would be required to \nreport on the expenditures from all of their affiliates, which would \nmean that a local union would be required to report on expenditures by \na national union, and vice versa, even though neither of them had \neither access or control to the financial records of the other.\n  This point we heard about from Senator Dodd is particularly \nimportant. If the point we are trying to get at with this amendment is \nto understand who is doing what with what funds to engage in political \nactivity during election cycles, then clearly a lot of the other \nmembership groups that raise and spend tremendous amounts of money--two \nwere mentioned, the NRA, the Sierra Club, you can add the Chambers of \nCommerce, National Right to Work Foundation, other groups across the \npolitical spectrum----\n  Mr. HATCH. Does the Senator have a question because I think I have \nthe right to the floor.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. My question would be: In response to the discussion \nbetween the Senators on this issue, how can we impose undue burdens on \nonly unions as compared to corporations and completely leave out of the \nSenator's concerns all of these membership groups that raise tremendous \namounts of money, are on the front lines of our political campaigns, \nhave a direct influence on how voters vote, and yet are in no way \ncovered by the Senator's amendment?\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me answer the question. The fact is, we are equal with \nregard to both corporations and unions. We don't include any \nideological groups because when you give to the Sierra Club, you know \nthe causes they advocate. You have a right to give. You are not forced \nor compelled to contribute to these organizations. But when people join \nunions or are forced to join unions because of the laws that we have, \nthey are forced to pay fees to unions. Most of the union members \nprobably don't know what the union dues are used for, especially with \nregard to politics or things such as an effort in 1996 to legalize \nmarijuana in California, for instance. The Teamsters contributed \n$195,000 to that effort in union dues to support that effort. How many \nworking families want their hard-earned money to be used for marijuana \nlegalization? I think that they have a right to know this kind of \ninformation.\n\n  Disclosing expenditures is constitutionally different from disclosing \ncontributors to ideological groups which the Supreme Court has said we \nshould not do. Disclosing expenditures does not implicate free \nassociation. It is important to differentiate between expenditures and \ncontributors. The difference is, union members are forced to pay dues.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield, we disagree so fundamentally on \nthat.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me restate that.\n  Mr. DODD. That is not true.\n  Mr. HATCH. It is true in nonright-to-work States. People are forced \nto join the union and forced to pay dues. They don't have to stay in \nthe union, I agree. They can quit if they give up their jobs.\n  Mr. DODD. Nor are they required to contribute union dues. Under those \n29 States, that is not the case with respect to the contribution of \nunion dues.\n  Mr. HATCH. In right-to-work States, that is not the case.\n\n[[Page S2656]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. They get the benefits of the collective bargaining \nagreements even though they are not members per se. They all get the \nsame benefits.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is another argument for another day. The fact is, I \ndon't think anybody in their right mind is going to say that people are \nnot compelled to pay union dues in nonright-to-work States, if they \nwant the job and they want to work in a union business. It is that \nsimple. Nobody doubts that. I don't have any problem with that. That is \nthe way the law is. But to say they can spend 100 percent of the money \nfor only one party and not disclose it seems to me to be a bad process, \nespecially when Democrats have suggested: Well, if you don't make the \ncorporations disclose, why should you make the unions? I am saying \nlet's make both of them disclose. Let's be fair so there is no \nimbalance.\n  The imbalance is in the fact that the only two things the unions \ndon't care about are TV advertisements and radio advertisements. They \ncan do all these other things: Get out the vote, voter identification, \nvoter registration, mass mailings, phone banks, TV advertisement, radio \nadvertisements, magazine advertisements, newspaper advertisements, \noutdoor advertising, leafleting, polling, volunteer recruitment and \ntraining, and most of their employees are union salaried, full-time \npolitical operatives, all working for one party, and at the same time \nthis McCain-Feingold bill limits the Republican Party, which has no \noutside organization doing this. It limits hard dollars to no more than \n$1,000 per contributor. Talk about imbalance. In other words, the two \ngroups that you would hope would be fully in the political process--the \ntwo political parties--are the ones that are left out, while we ignore \nall this other stuff.\n\n  Talk about imbalance. The McCain-Feingold bill is imbalanced. What is \neven worse, in my eyes, is that the one thing they impose on unions and \nothers is TV advertisements and radio advertisements within 30 to 60 \ndays of the primary and general elections. Think about that. That says \nthey don't have the right to speak during that time which, under \nBuckley v. Valeo, shows that directly violative of the first amendment. \nHere we have the media and everybody else arguing for this.\n  My amendment does one thing. It doesn't stop the unions from doing \nthis. It doesn't say you are bad people, you should not do this. It \nsays you need to disclose what you are doing so that all members of the \nunion know what political ideologies they are supporting with their \ndues. That includes 40 percent of them who are basically Republicans \nand whose moneys are all going to elect Democrats, people who are \nbasically contrary to their philosophical and political viewpoints.\n  All I ask is that there be disclosure. But to even it up, since the \nDemocrats have raised this time and again, I would require disclosure \nin the corporate world, too--disclose what the money is used for \nregarding politics.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Colonel \nWilson A. ``Bud'' Shatzer, who after thirty-one years of dedicated \nservice to the nation and the military, will retire from the United \nStates Army on April 1, 2001.\n  Colonel Shatzer's career began following his graduation from Eastern \nWashington University in 1970 when he was commissioned a Second \nLieutenant in the Armor Branch. Over the past three decades, his \nassignments have included a variety of both command and staff \npositions, and throughout his military career, Colonel Shatzer \nconsistently distinguished himself in all his assignments. Furthermore, \nwhether a newly commissioned Second Lieutenant or a seasoned Colonel, \nthis officer always demonstrated one of the most important qualities an \nofficer should possess, a deep-seated concern for his soldiers \nregardless of their rank. As a leader and teacher Colonel Shatzer \nproved himself to be a willing mentor of young officers and enlisted \nmen, and in the process, he helped to shape the successful careers of \nsoldiers throughout the Army.\n  Many of us came to know Colonel Shatzer during his five-year tour as \nExecutive Officer, Army Legislative Liaison. His professionalism, \nmature judgment, and sound advice earned him the respect and confidence \nof members of the Army Secretariat and the Army Staff. While dealing \nwith Members of Congress and Congressional staff, the Department of \nDefense, and the Joint Staff, Colonel Shatzer's abilities as an \nofficer, analyst and advisor were of benefit to the Army and to those \nwith whom he worked in the Legislative Branch.\n  For the past thirty-one years, Colonel Shatzer has selflessly served \nthe Army and our Nation professionally, capably and admirably. Through \nhis personal style of leadership, he has had a positive impact on the \nlives of not only the soldiers who have served under him, but of the \nfamilies of these soldiers, as well as the civilian employees of the \nArmy who have worked with and under this officer. I am sure that all of \nthose in the Senate who have worked with Colonel Shatzer join me today \nin wishing both he and his wife, Annie, health, happiness, and success \nin the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/21/senate-section/article/S2656-3", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2656-S2657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        BUDGET COMMITTEE MARKUP\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, it is a great privilege for me \nto be a new Member of the Senate, and it is a great privilege for me to \nbe assigned to the Budget Committee. It is with a heavy heart that I \nhave just learned that it is the intention of the chairman, the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico, for whom I have the highest \nregard, not to have a markup in the Budget Committee and rather bring a \nchairman's mark under the lawful procedures of the Budget Act straight \nto the floor.\n  I am compelled to rise to express my objection, for that is what a \nlegislative body is all about in the warp and woof and crosscurrents of \nideas for Members to hammer out legislation, particularly on something \nas important as adopting a budget.\n  We first started adopting budgets pursuant to the Budget Act passed \nin the 1970s because Congress had difficulty containing its voracious \nappetite to continue to spend. Thus, the Budget Act was adopted in \nwhich Congress would adopt a blueprint, an overall skeletal structure, \nfor expenditures and for revenues that would be the model after which \nall of the various committees, both appropriations and authorizing \ncommittees, would then come in and flesh out the skeletal structure of \nthe budget adopted.\n  How important this budgetary debate is this year for the questions in \nfront of the Congress. Such things as: How large is the tax cut going \nto be, particularly measured against, juxtaposed against, how large the \nsurplus is that we are expecting over the next 10 years. That, of \ncourse, is a very iffy projection. We have seen, if history serves us \nwell, that, in fact, we don't know beyond a year, 2 years at the most, \nwith any kind of degree of accuracy, if we can forecast what the \nsurpluses or the deficits are going to be in future years.\n  So the budget debate brings the central question of how large should \nthe tax cut be counterbalanced against how much of the revenues and the \nsurplus do we think will be there over the course of the next decade. \nThat, then, leads us, once we know that, to be able to decide how much \nwe will appropriate for other needed expenditures for the good of the \nUnited States.\n\n[[Page S2657]]\n\n  Most everyone in this Chamber agrees there ought to be a \nmodernization of Medicare with a prescription drug benefit. Most \neveryone in this Chamber agrees there should be additional investment \nin education, and there is a bipartisan bill that is beginning to work \nits way through the legislative process on increased investment in \neducation and accountability. Most everyone in this Chamber agrees we \nhave to pay our young men and women in the Armed Forces of this country \nmore of a comparable wage in competition with the private sector in \norder to have the kind of skill and talent we need in today's all-\nvolunteer Armed Forces.\n  Most people in this body would agree we have to have certain \nexpenditures with regard to health care, planning for the end game, \nencouraging additional long-term insurance, equalizing the tax \nsubsidies for health insurance now from a large employer to a small \nemployer, or to an individual employer, or to an individual.\n  There are a number of items on which there is consensus that is built \non this side of the Capitol where we should go with regard to \nexpenditures in the future while controlling our fiscal appetite.\n  That brings me back to the budget resolution, for it is the very \nessence of adopting a budget resolution that we should have as our \nwatchwords ``fiscal discipline.'' That is why we need to have a full \nand fair discussion of all the issues in adopting a budget resolution. \nThat is why we ought to mark it up and have that discussion first in \nthe committee.\n  I wrap up by saying of all the debates that will take place this \nyear, the debate on how we will allocate the resources with regard to \nthe budget of the United States is one of the most important. It ought \nto have a full and fair and thorough discussion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/21/senate-section/article/S2657-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE BIRTH OF WILLIAM BLUE HOLLIER\n\n  Mr. CRAPO.

He is the first child of \nWill and Alyssa Hollier. Will serves as my Administrative Assistant and \nhas been an invaluable part of my staff for over 8 years. I'm happy to \nreport that mother, father, and baby are doing well, although Will and \nAlyssa are probably getting used to fewer hours of sleep.\n  Young William is the grandson of Charles and Judy Hollier of \nLafayette, LA; Judy Myers of New Orleans; and Bob and Cheri Knorr of \nSawyer, ND. His great-grandparents, Henry and Mary Myers of Opelousas, \nLA; Art Odegard of Minot, ND; and Walt Knorr of Devil's Lake, ND, also \njoin me in welcoming this baby.\n  It is always a joyous event to bring a new family member into the \nworld. William has been much-anticipated and has held a place in the \nhearts of his parents and family for many months now as they have \nawaited his arrival. As the father of five myself, I know that Will and \nAlyssa are in for a most remarkable, frustrating, rewarding, and \nexciting experience of their lives. William Blue will make certain of \nthat. Our best wishes go out to the Hollier family on this most \nauspicious occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/21/senate-section/article/S2657-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CHILDREN AND HEALTHCARE WEEK\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS.

This \ncan be frightening for both the child and his or her family, and \nunderscores the need to continue providing quality, caring pediatric \nhealth services. This week in Greenville, SC, The Children's Hospital \nof The Greenville Hospital System is celebrating Children and \nHealthcare Week with a number of valuable activities for health care \nprofessionals, parents and community partners. Among the events are \ncontinuing education classes for medical residents and support staff as \nwell as an awards ceremony to honor local individuals who have \ndedicated their lives to pediatric care.\n  Children and Healthcare Week highlights educational programming to \nincrease public, parental and professional knowledge of the \nimprovements that can be made in pediatric health care. In particular, \nit stresses new ways to meet the emotional and developmental needs of \nchildren in health care settings. Lack of quality health care should \nnever be an impediment to the long-term success of our nation's \nchildren and I commend Greenville's dedication to Children and \nHealthcare Week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/21/senate-section/article/S2657-3", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               45th ANNIVERSARY OF TUNISIA'S INDEPENDENCE\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my serious \nconcern about the recent presidential elections in Uganda. Uganda is a \ncountry of great promise; in the past year I and many of my colleagues \nhave come to this floor to praise the Ugandan Government and the \nUgandan people for their energetic and effective fight against the AIDS \npandemic. In recent years, the economy has enjoyed moderate economic \ngrowth. Most strikingly, even given the persistence of brutality like \nthat embodied by the Lord's Resistance Army, there can be no mistaking \nthat Uganda has come a long way from the dark days when Idi Amin and \nMilton Obote terrorized their citizens. This progress toward stability \nand an improvement in the quality of life enjoyed by Ugandans has been \ncause for celebration, and legitimately so.\n  But the latest trends from Uganda are alarming. In particular, the \ndays leading up to the March 12 presidential elections revealed a \ndisturbing willingness on the part of the ruling party to retain power \nthrough intimidation. According to observers, the opposition was \nthreatened with violence and arrests from state security forces \nthroughout the campaign. Reports indicate that, in some cases, \nopposition supporters also resorted to violent tactics. While most \nobservers agree that outcome of the vote would probably not have been \ndifferent had the election not been marred in this manner, there can be \nno question that Uganda has been proven to be less democratic and less \nstable by these recent events, and the security of individual Ugandans \nwishing to exercise basic civil and political rights is not assured.\n  It is unquestionably true that many positive developments have \nunfolded in Uganda over the years that President Museveni has been in \noffice. But Uganda's success is not about Mr. Museveni. Institutions, \nnot individuals, are the backbone of lasting political stability and \ndevelopment. And the movement system currently in effect in Uganda, \nalways dubious, increasingly looks like a single-party system by \nanother name. Its defenders will point to last year's referendum on \nthis so-called ``no-party'' system and claim that it is the will of the \npeople. But the deck was clearly stacked against multipartyism in last \nyear's referendum on the movement system--state-sponsored political \neducation courses were used to mobilize support for the Movement, and \nthe opposition boycotted the vote.\n  Today, in the wake of the presidential election and after long months \nof Uganda's involvement in the Democratic Republic of the Congo--an \nadventure that, while perhaps profitable for the few, is clearly \nunpopular with the Ugandan people--today, those of us who genuinely \nwish to see Uganda consolidate the successes of the past and make even \nmore progress in the years ahead are profoundly troubled.\n  Some in Central Africa believe that the U.S. turns a blind eye to the \nshortcomings of the government in Kampala. I certainly hope that is not \nthe\n\n[[Page S2658]]\n\ncase, because that is not in the interests of the U.S. or the Ugandan \npeople. I have recently had cause to reflect on the damage done by \nyears of U.S. support for undemocratic and sometimes violently \nrepressive regimes elsewhere on the continent. We do no one any favors \nwhen we fail to tell it like it is, when we look away from blatantly \nundemocratic acts because we so desperately want to encourage countries \nthat hold great promise. It is precisely because Uganda has made such \nprecious gains that I am troubled, for these gains will surely be \nwasted if the staying power of the current regime becomes the utmost \npriority of the government.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/21/senate-section/article/S2658-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SILVER RIBBON CAMPAIGN\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor a \ncampaign to raise disability awareness that originated in my State of \nWyoming. I am very proud of the mission behind this effort that, in 3 \nshort years, has gained steam nationally and internationally.\n  Known as the Silver Ribbon Campaign, this effort to honor disability \nawareness month, March, was begun by the Natrona County School District \n#1 Student Support Services and the Parent Resource Center. The \ncampaign has generated significant activity among local officials and \nis responsible for a variety of training, educational and interactive \nactivities related to raising disability awareness in the broader \ncommunity. In addition to engaging local officials and the general \npublic, the campaign has worked successfully with the business \ncommunity and numerous media outlets to ensure a diverse yet unified \nfront in heightening awareness about the reality of living with a \ndisability.\n  I am particularly proud of the campaign's special effort to include \nactivities targeted towards raising awareness among children. Not only \nwill the public library host a reading hour on disability awareness, \nwith awareness bookmarks available for the public, but public school \nbuses and other public transportation will display the campaign's \ntrademark silver ribbon during the month of March.\n  The campaign has issued the silver ribbon as a pin, and since its \ninception in 1998, more than 250,00 pins, along with thousands of \nballoons and displays, have been used to raise awareness around the \nState of Wyoming. As I mentioned before, similar activities are being \nduplicated nationwide.\n  I am honored but not surprised to once again have the opportunity to \nhighlight a community-based effort invented in Wyoming that other \ncommunities are modeling. I hope hearing me today will encourage my \ncolleagues to introduce their own State to the Silver Ribbon Campaign \nand further raise disability awareness in this country. This is a \ncritical effort that every community should embrace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/21/senate-section/article/S2658-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            EVERYBODY WINS!\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Everybody Wins! is an innovative literacy \nimprovement program that pairs adults with children for one hour a week \nto share lunch, a good book and friendship. The U.S. Senate launched \nEverybody Wins! at the Brent Elementary School in 1995. Today, this \nprogram serves 4,500 children in the Washington area.\n  Last night, I had the honor of attending a reception to celebrate the \nEverybody Wins! program. I was joined by my colleague Senator Jim \nJeffords who I commend for his leadership in making the Everybody Wins! \nprogram such a success in the U.S. Senate, and Art Tannenbaum, the \nvisionary behind this wonderful program.\n  I was especially honored to join First Lady Laura Bush at last \nevening's event. Mrs. Bush's passion for reading and strong commitment \nto early literacy touched the lives of thousand of families in Texas, \nand it is clear from last night that she brings that same commitment to \nchildren all across the country.\n  I was deeply moved by her remarks last night and her real passion for \nchildren and their needs, and I believe my colleagues would appreciate \nher thoughtful statement as well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print Mrs. Bush's remarks \nfrom last evening into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n First Lady Laura Bush's Remarks, Everybody Wins! Event, March 20, 2001\n\n       Thank you very much, Dr. Billington.\n       First I want to thank Lisa Vise.\n       Lisa, you are a remarkable girl. You remind us that one \n     person's work can make a difference in a lot of other \n     people's lives.\n       Senator Jeffords, Senator Kennedy, Mr. Chabraja, Mr. Cole, \n     Mr. Woodward, distinguished guests, I'm pleased to be with \n     you tonight.\n       Everybody Wins is the largest children's literacy and \n     mentoring organization in the District because you understand \n     the value of spending quality time reading to children.\n       I am fortunate because someone spent time reading to me as \n     a child--my mother. Thanks to her I developed a lifelong \n     passion for reading, and I grew up to become a teacher. As \n     much as I loved being read to as a child, I love reading to \n     children even more.\n       The Everybody Wins volunteers will agree reading together \n     has tremendous results. Children who are read to by an adult \n     learn two things: First, that reading is worthwhile, and \n     second, that they are worthwhile.\n       Reading is the foundation of all learning. Children must \n     have good reading skills to succeed in every subject in \n     school. Those who do not read well by the end of the third \n     grade often have a difficult time catching up. Sadly, \n     thousands of children can't read well in America.\n       According to a 1998 study, 68 percent of fourth-graders in \n     our nation's lowest-income schools were unable to read at \n     even a very basic level.\n       We may grow numb to statistics, but we cannot grow numb to \n     our children. That so many children can't read is a clear \n     indication of a fundamental failure of adult responsibility \n     for children's lives and futures.\n       I know we can turn those numbers around. With caring \n     Americans like you, we will turn those numbers around.\n       George's defining commitment to children is a quality \n     education. His budget includes $5 billion over the next five \n     years for reading initiatives. Through his Reading First \n     program, he wants to give states and schools the funding and \n     tools to implement sound reading programs in Kindergarten \n     through second grade.\n       While government does its part, it's up to us as parents \n     and citizens to help children read and succeed in life. \n     Children need more than a program; they need a voice. They \n     need strong role models to put loving arms around them and \n     read to them. You recognize that need. I'm proud you are \n     lending your voice and a hand to Everybody Wins.\n       Please continue supporting this worthy endeavor. Because of \n     you, Everybody does win.\n       Thanks to the Senators for demonstrating your commitment to \n     children and sharing your common love of reading. Reading is \n     common ground for all of us. Thank you all so much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/21/senate-section/article/S2658-3", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2658-S2659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       COMMEMORATING THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PERSIAN GULF WAR\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I wish to add my voice to the many \nwho have come before the Senate to honor the brave men and women who \nserved our nation so honorably in the Persian Gulf War. March 3, 2001 \nmarked the tenth anniversary of the end of the Persian Gulf War. I pay \nspecial tribute to the families of those who gave their lives in this \neffort.\n  I would like to draw my colleagues attention to an important event \nthat will be taking place this Sunday, March 25th, 2001, in Manchester, \nNH. A group of dedicated Americans is gathering to observe the 10th \nanniversary of the Persian Gulf war, to honor those who served, and to \nevaluate the fulfillment of our promise to care for those who suffered \nas a result of their service. A driving force behind this event is the \nNew England Persian Gulf Veterans Inc., NEPGV, and its dynamic \nfounders, David and Patricia Irish. Since the NEPGV's inception in \n1996, David and Trish have worked tirelessly to promote the issues and \nchallenges of Gulf War Veterans in New England and beyond. I want to \npublicly thank them for their efforts and let them know that I will be \nwith them in spirit on the 25th of March.\n  This is an appropriate time to remember the outstanding job our \nservice men and women did in liberating Kuwait from occupation. \nTogether with our allies, this action stated that in the post Cold War \nworld, the unprovoked conquest of one's neighbors would not be \ntolerated. The unprecedented coalition of twenty six nations rolled \nback a tyrannical dictator and a military ill prepared for the \ndetermination of the United States and its allies, nor the might and \nprofessionalism of the soldiers involved. In the face of the poor \nperformance of old Soviet equipment, the Gulf War firmly established \nthe military superiority of the United States and confirmed our\n\n[[Page S2659]]\n\nstatus as the world's lone superpower. Our willingness to work together \nwith our friends in the Arab world set a new tone in the region and \nushered in a new era of respect for international cooperation.\n  The Gulf War coalition also laid a foundation for a remarkable United \nNations operation that for the first time, aggressively sought to \nidentify and destroy any potential capability for development of \nweapons of mass destruction or manufacture of chemical or biological \nagents. While UNSCOM had a very difficult time carrying out its mission \nand was eventually forced to leave Iraq, the world community learned a \ngreat deal from the experience, and set any potential future \nproliferations on notice that these types of actions will not be \ntolerated.\n  While peace process in the Middle East is at a low ebb right now, it \nis also appropriate that we remember how the Gulf War was a critical \ncatalyst for the Oslo Peace Agreement between Israel and the \nPalestinians, the cornerstone for the wave of peace that swept the \nregion during the 1990s. While subsequent agreements have been \nshattered by the recent violence, all sides still stand by Oslo, as do \nthe moderate Arab nations who continue to insist that the risks they \nhave taken for peace are worth it. Had it not been for US leadership \nand the success of the Gulf War, this would not be the case.\n  As a senior member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, I take \nvery seriously my obligation to address the needs of all our Veterans. \nAlthough it has been 10 years since this decisive victory in the \nPersian Gulf, servicemen and women continue to step forward with \nsymptoms of illnesses and disease likely attributable to serving in \nSouthwest Asia during the war. This was brought home to me by the death \nof a friend of my son Leonard, John Clark, Jr. A Gulf War veteran, John \nwas stricken with colon cancer at age 31, two short years after his \nreturn home from the Gulf. John's case is similar to other service \nmembers coming back from the Gulf War. John passed away in 1996. For \nJohn and his family, as for many veterans, the war continues well after \nthey have taken off their uniforms and returned to life as civilians. I \nwill continue to work to insure that Gulf War veterans obtain access to \nVA health benefits and that meaningful research continues to determine \ntreatment for these troubling medical problems. Our Gulf War veterans, \nhaving served in Active, Reserve and National Guard units, must know \nthat we here in Washington will continue to fight for them as they \nfought for us.\n  Once again, I remember, commemorate and congratulate the members of \nour Armed Forces who served with distinction during the Gulf War. I \nsincerely thank them for their service to our country on this, the \ntenth anniversary of this victory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/21/senate-section/article/S2659-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Candidates for the awards were evaluated in five categories \nwhich include: duty achievement; self improvement; off-duty \naccomplishments; other leadership accomplishments, and positive \nrepresentation of the U.S. Air Force.\n  Three weeks prior, Captain Christensen had been selected Company \nGrade Officer of the Year for the 89th Security Forces Squadron at \nAndrews Air Force Base, MD, and then for the 89th Support Group, and \nfinally for the 89th Airlift Wing at Andrews. He won the squadron and \ngroup competition for the second consecutive year. At the group level, \nhe represented Security Forces and competed with selectees from Mission \nSupport, Services and Civil Engineering squadrons. At the Wing level, \nChristensen competed with five other group winners from among 454 \ncompany grade officers in all groups. In addition to Security Forces, \nwhich Glen represented, group winners came from Logistics, Medical, \nOperations, and Communications groups and from the Wing Commander's \nstaff.\n  While second in command of the third largest Security Forces unit in \nthe Air Force, Captain Christensen organized and directed security at \nAndrews AFB for the NATO 50th Anniversary Summit, two Joint Services \nOpen House Air Shows, and the recent Presidential Inauguration, in \naddition to everyday base law enforcement and security for the \n``President's base'' and ``Air Force One.''\n  Glen graduated in 1993 from the United States Air Force Academy with\n\n[[Page S2660]]\n\nMilitary Distinction. He is the son of Everett and Sybil Christensen of \nMadelia, MN.\n  Mr. President, I offer my congratulations to Captain Christensen and \nhis family on this award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/21/senate-section/article/S2660-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RETIREMENT OF STEPHAN LEONOUDAKIS\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to take this \nopportunity to draw the Senate's attention to the career of Stephen C. \nLeonoudakis.\n  Stephan was Director of the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and \nTransportation District from 1962 until his retirement this past \nJanuary. Even by the standards set by some members of this chamber, \nthis is a long time. He served continuously in the same position for 38 \nyears. Over the course of this time, he became nearly as integral to \nthe Bridge District as the famous span for which it was named. There \nare few who remember a time when he was not Director. The question is \nnot whether he will be missed, but what will we do without him?\n  Stretching from San Francisco to Marin County across the opening to \nSan Francisco Bay, the Golden Gate Bridge is one of the most \nidentifiable landmarks in the world. People flock to the bridge from \naround the globe, often braving the chilly mid-summer fog to catch a \nbreathtaking glimpse of the city to the east, the seemingly endless \nPacific Ocean to the west, the Bay directly below and the graceful \nstructure itself above and around. It is a truly enchanted place.\n  But, as the name implies, the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and \nTransportation District is more than just a bridge with a million \ndollar view. It is a full-service transportation district complete with \nbuses, ferries, bicycles, pedestrians, staffmembers and all the \nmaintenance and other administrative challenges that come with them. \nThis is where Stephan really shined. Over his tenure, he participated \nin transforming the Bridge District from an agency that essentially \nlooked after a beautiful landmark into an organization which operates a \nworld-class transit agency serving millions of commuters and visitors \nannually. This is a tremendous achievement that Stephan shares.\n  There were times, I imagine, when people thought that Stephan might \njust outlast the bridge he loved and looked after all these years. But \nthanks to solid construction, regular maintenance and a vigorous \nseismic program he began, it looks like Stephan is going to beat the \nbridge into retirement by many years. We can all be grateful for that \neven as we bid a friend a fond, happy and healthy retirement. No one \ndeserves it more.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/21/senate-section/article/S2660-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE LA SALLE ACADEMY FOOTBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nachievement of La Salle Academy of Providence, RI whose football team \nbecame State Champions for the year 2000.\n  In 1871, the de La Salle Christian Brothers came to Rhode Island to \nteach at the ``Brothers'' school. In 1876, that school became an \nacademy and was named La Salle, after the Christian Brothers founder, \nSaint John Baptiste de La Salle. Since its opening 125 years ago, La \nSalle has offered its students a rigorous, value-based education. The \nBrothers' approach to comprehensive student development has been \nevident not only in their academic excellence, but in the successes of \ntheir clubs and athletic teams as well.\n  The athletic department at La Salle has a strong commitment to \ninstilling leadership, sportsmanship, and a healthy approach to \nathletic competition. Since its founding in 1908, the La Salle football \nprogram has been one of the most successful in the state. Legendary \nCoach Jack Cronin guided the Rams to 274 wins during his 44 years \ntenure from 1928 to 1972. In the 1940's and 1950's, La Salle played \nbefore some of the largest crowds ever to see a game in Rhode Island, \nincluding 25,000 in 1945, 40,000 in 1947, and 10,000 in 1955. In the \n1970's and 1980's, the La Salle football team won ten Division A \ntitles.\n  La Salle also participates in the oldest sports rivalry in the state. \nFor seventy-one years, La Salle and East Providence High School have \nmet traditionally on Thanksgiving Day. Up until this past year, the \nseries had been tied, but with La Salle's victory they now proudly lead \nthat series 35-34, with two ties.\n  Through the leadership of Tim Coen, first year Coach of the La Salle \nRams, and Team Captains Toyin Barnisile, Joe Ben, Howie Brown, David \nRegus, and Jon-Erik Schneiderhan, La Salle can boast its first Super \nBowl Division Championship. After winning only four of nine league \ngames in the previous year, the Rams completed the regular season with \nan impressive 9-0 record, including a win over Thanksgiving rival and \ntwo-time defending state champions East Providence.\n  The last time La Salle played in a championship game was nearly a \ndecade ago in 1992, when they lost to Portsmouth High School. The year \n2000 finally brought a re-match as this year's Super Bowl game pitted \nthe Portsmouth Patriots against the La Salle Rams. The Rams were \nvictorious in a very close game, thanks to the exceptional effort put \nforth by the La Salle team supported by their fellow students and \nalumni.\n  As a proud graduate and former member of the La Salle Academy \nfootball team, I know the skills, training, and strength of character \nthat are necessary to achieve what this program has achieved. I would \nask that my colleagues join me in applauding La Salle Academy for its \nremarkable accomplishments this year and throughout its long tradition \nof excellence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/21/senate-section/article/S2660-3", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:02 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

A bill to amend titles XIX and XXI of the Social Security Act \nto provide States with the option to cover certain legal immigrants \nunder the Medicaid and State children's health insurance program; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of Senators Chafee, \nMcCain, Feinstein, Jeffords, Wellstone, Murray, Kennedy, Collins, \nSpecter, Schumer, Clinton, and myself to introduce the Immigrant \nChildren's Health Improvement Act of 2001.\n  This bill will give States the option to provide Medicaid and CHIP \ncoverage to immigrant children and pregnant women who arrived legally \nin this country after August 22, 1996. That is the date Congress passed \nthe Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act--\ncommonly known as welfare reform.\n  The goal of that legislation was to encourage self-sufficiency in \nadults. But it also affected children, including immigrants, citizens, \nand those not yet born. The legislation cut off government-supported \nhealth care for all legal immigrants, regardless of their ages or \ncircumstances.\n  Census data released last week offered good news on the number of \nuninsured people in America. The data shows that the number of \nAmericans without health insurance fell from 44.3 million to 42.6 \nmillion in 1999. This is the first decline since 1987. But the news is \nnot good for everyone who works hard in this country, who plays by the \nrules, who tries to build a better life for themselves and their \nfamilies.\n  What was not in the headlines is the fact that the proportion of \nimmigrant children who are uninsured remains extremely high.\n\n  A new report by the Urban Institute shows that in the last year, \nnearly half of low-income immigrant children in America had no health-\ninsurance coverage. In my State of Florida, that ratio is nearly three \nto one. This is just one of many reports that show that in our zeal to \ndiscourage dependency in adults, we unintentionally punished children.\n  A study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities finds that the \npercentage of low-income immigrant children in publicly-funded \ncoverage--which was low even before welfare reform--has fallen \nsubstantially.\n  Florida is home to more than half a million uninsured children, many \nof whom are in this country legally or are citizens whose immigrant \nparents are ineligible for coverage and so think their children are \nsimilarly barred.\n  Under this bill, States have the option of taking steps to change \nthat by eliminating the arbitrary designation of August 22, 1996, as a \ncutoff date for allowing children to get health care. Giving States the \noption of providing this coverage to legal immigrant children and \npregnant women would cover more than 200,000 people a year. States have \nasked for this option. Many are already trying to provide coverage but \ncan't make up the holes in their budget.\n  In their 2001 Winter Policy Report, the National Governors' \nAssociation endorsed this commonsense policy proposal. The National \nCouncil of State Legislators has also endorsed this bill. More than 200 \nrespected public-interest groups including Catholic Charities, the \nNational Council of La Raza, the National Association of Public \nHospitals, the National Immigration Law Center, the Children's Defense \nFund, and the American Academy of Pediatrics have all joined together \nin support of the bill. Beginning today and for months to come, these \norganizations will be holding events to rally behind this and other \nlegislation that supports the goal of providing healthy solutions for \nhard-working American families.\n  Under this umbrella, Senators Kennedy and Jeffords will be \nintroducing legislation to restore food stamps to legal immigrants and \nRepresentatives Levin and Morella will be introducing a bill to protect \nimmigrant women from domestic violence.\n  Passage of the Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act is an \nimportant step in revisiting the welfare reform legislation.\n  What we now realize, years after passing that landmark law, is that \nlegal immigrant children are, as much as citizen children, the next \ngeneration of Americans. Providing Medicaid and CHIP to legal immigrant \nchildren is critical in order to guarantee that generation can be \nhealthy and productive members of their adopted country.\n  We call upon Congress and the President to act this year and pass \nthis important bill.\n                                   ____\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n        Jeffords, Mr. Graham, Mr. Chafee, and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 583. A bill to amend the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to improve \nnutrition assistance for working families and the elderly, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today Senator Specter, Senator Leahy, \nSenator Jeffords, Senator Graham, Senator Chafee, and I introduce the \nbipartisan ``Nutrition Assistance for Working Families and Seniors \nAct.'' Our goal is to repair specific holes that time has worn in the \nnation's core nutrition safety net--the Food Stamp Program.\n  Hunger is a silent crisis affecting families all across America. No \ncorner of our land is immune from this tragedy.\n  The Nation can well afford to ensure that the average food stamp \nbenefit of\n\n[[Page S2664]]\n\n79 cents per meal is available to everyone who truly needs it. In a \ntime of economic prosperity, the moral imperative to feed the hungry \nmay be clearest. But in a time of economic uncertainty, the need to \nfeed the hungry should be clearest.\n  The bottom line is that too many working families and seniors in \nAmerica have trouble putting enough food on the table. On February 26, \n2001, the New York Times included a compelling account of the \ndifficulties faced by the Payne family from Cleveland, Ohio. Mrs. Payne \nstates that ``it's difficult to work at a grocery store all day, \nlooking at all the food I can't buy, so I imagine filling up my cart \nwith one of those big orders and bringing home enough food for all my \nkids.'' She and her husband, a factory worker, routinely go without \ndinner to be sure that their four children have enough to eat. The \nPayne family was among thousands of working families that have recently \nturned to emergency food pantries and soup kitchens in search of help. \nThe Payne family did not know that they were eligible for food stamps.\n  Nationwide, participation in the Food Stamp Program has declined 34 \npercent since 1996, four times faster than the decline in the poverty \nrate. This means that over 2 million fewer people who live in poverty \nare accessing food stamps today. Over a quarter of the reduction in \nfood stamp participation between 1994 and 1998 resulted from welfae \nreform and its elimination of food stamp eligibility for legal \nimmigrants, both by directly rendering legal immigrants ineligible for \nfood stamps, and by discouraging their U.S. citizen children from \naccessing food stamps.\n  The results are predictable. The U.S. Department of Agriculture \ndetermined that 4.9 million adults and 2.6 million children lived in \nhouseholds that experienced hunger during 1999. The Urban Institute \nfinds that 33 percent of former welfare recipients have to skip or cut \nmeals due to lack of food.\n  The most vulnerable people among us--recent immigrants, children, and \nthe elderly--are the ones who face the greatest difficulty. Republicans \nand Democrats agree that we need to work together in good faith to \ndeliver senior citizens from having to choose between heating and \neating, and from having to choose between paying for their prescription \ndrugs or for their groceries. There is also widespread agreement that \nmore must be done to end childhood hunger. A July 1999 General \nAccounting Office study concludes, ``Children's participation in the \nFood Stamp Program has dropped more sharply than the number of children \nliving in poverty, indicating a growing gap between need and \nassistance.''\n\n  Sadly, the enormity of this crisis is confirmed by a major study \nreleased today by the Urban Institute's National Survey of America's \nFamilies, which focuses upon the impact that welfare reform has had on \nthe children of immigrants. The report finds that 80 percent of the \nchildren of immigrants are United States citizens, but the immigrant \nstatus of parents prevents these citizen children from receiving the \naid they need. According to the Urban Institute, 24 percent of children \nof immigrants live in poverty compared to 16 percent of children of \ncitizens, and 37 percent of children of immigrants live in households \nthat have difficulty putting enough food on the table each month, \ncompared to 27 percent of children of citizens.\n  The report also shows that access to public benefits makes a \ndifference for immigrant families. Largely because Massachusetts pays \nto provide food stamps to all legal immigrants, food insecurity rates \nthere are relatively similar for children of immigrants and children of \ncitizens 28 percent of immigrant children versus 22 percent of native \nchildren). Texas provides no such benefit, however, and this fact is \nreflected in its food insecurity rates. Over 49 percent of children of \nimmigrants lack secure access to adequate nutrition in Texas, compared \nto a third of children of citizens.\n  While hunger and malnutrition are serious problems for people of all \nages, their effects are particularly damaging to children. Hungry and \nundernourished children are more likely to become anemic and to suffer \nfrom allergies, asthma, diarrhea, and infections. They are also more \nlikely to have behavioral problems and difficulty in learning. When \nchildren arrive at school hungry, they cannot learn. If we do not \naddress this silent crisis, our considerable investments in education \nand early learning activities will not have the full positive impact \nthat they should. Clearly more must be done for both the children of \ncitizens and the children of immigrants.\n  A strong Food Stamp Program is essential to ensure that all people in \nAmerica can get the food they need to stay healthy. In seven common \nsense steps, this bill reaches goals shared by Republicans and \nDemocrats alike--promoting self-sufficiency, encouraging transitions \nfrom welfare to work, and eradicating hunger among children and \nseniors.\n  First, this bill restores eligibility for food stamps to all legal \nimmigrants, a matter of fundamental fairness and basic need. The Kaiser \nCommission on Medicaid and the Uninsured reports that immigrant \nfamilies on average pay $80,000 more in taxes than they receive in \nlocal, state, and federal benefits over a lifetime. For 30 years prior \nto welfare reform, food stamps were available to legal immigrants, and \nas today's Urban Institute report confirms, legal immigrants are now \namong those most in need of nutritional assistance. Our laws recognize \nthat legal immigrants need access to employment, education, and health \ncare, yet all of these efforts are compromised when legal immigrants \nare denied access to basic nutrition.\n\n  The effort to prevent legal immigrants from accessing food stamps \nnever made sense from a policy perspective, and I am pleased to see \nconsiderable bipartisan momentum building to restore eligibility. Our \nkey allied in the effort to restore eligibility include the National \nConference of State Legislatures, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the \nNational Association of Counties, the National Black Caucus of State \nLegislators, the Hispanic Caucus, leaders of all major religious \ndenominations, and over 1,400 immigration, hunger, and social justice \norganizations that are active in every state. Over twenty newspapers \nhave published editorials urging restoration of food stamp eligibility \nto legal immigrants. With such strong and broad public support, I am \nhopeful that immigrants will not have to wait another year to have \ntheir access to basic nutrition restored.\n  Second, this bill ends the child penalty under current food stamp \nlaw. Just as the marriage penalty in our tax code unfairly penalizes \nsome couples, existing law unfairly limits nutritional assistance to \nsome families with children. This bill fixes the problem by indexing \nthe food stamp standard deduction to family size in a way that simply \nensures that every family that is in deep poverty, with earnings under \n10 percent of the poverty limit, will receive the maximum current food \nstamp benefit regardless of family size. Over half of the benefit from \nthis provision will go to working families.\n  Third, this bill addresses a core nutritional concern of senior \ncitizens and other low-income families on fixed incomes, many of whom \nqualify for the minimum food stamp benefit. The food stamp minimum \nbenefit has remained at $10 since 1977. This bill raises the minimum \nbenefit to $25 over the course of five years, and then indexes it to \ninflation.\n  Fourth, this bill ensures that food stamp law treats child support \npayments like income when calculating benefits, by disregarding 20 \npercent of these payments in the benefit determinations. This measure \nis consistent with last year's overwhelming House approval of a plan to \nencourage states to pass more child support payments through to low-\nincome families. Parents who know that their children will directly \nbenefit if they pay their child support are more likely to remain on \nthe job, pay their child support, and, most importantly, remain \ninvolved with their children.\n  Fifth, this bill gives states more options for helping families make \nthe transition from welfare to work. Current food stamp law allows a 3-\nmonth state option for a transitional food stamp benefit. This bill \nmirrors Medicaid's six-month Medicaid transitional benefit for food \nstamps, simplifying state recordkeeping, increasing state flexibility, \nand helping TANF families transition to work.\n\n[[Page S2665]]\n\n  Sixth, this bill improves access to food stamp information, helping \nto ensure that families like the Paynes are aware of the help that \nremains available to them. It helps rural families apply for food \nstamps using online and telephone systems, eliminating the need to \ntravel to food stamp offices. It also supports stronger public-private \npartnerships that generate and distribute information about the \nnation's nutrition assistance program.\n  Finally, this bill increases federal support for emergency food \nprograms, 71 percent of which are operated by faith based \norganizations. Sharp increases in requests for help from food pantries \nand soup kitchens have occurred over the past year despite steep \ndeclines in food stamp participation. Many food banks find themselves \nunable to meet the increased requests for help. Nationally, the U.S. \nConference of Mayors and America's Second Harvest have independently \ndocumented a 15 to 20 percent increase in needs over 1998. 79 percent \nof Massachusetts food pantries funded through Project Bread reported \nserving more working poor in 1998, and 72 percent reported helping more \nfamilies with children. To ensure that emergency food needs are met \nwithout unnecessarily tapping Food Stamp resources, this bill increases \nfunding for The Emergency Food Assistance Program by 10 percent.\n  The total cost of this bill amounts to about $2.75 billion over five \nyears, which would increase the cost of the Food Stamp Program by about \n2 percent. This bill's cost is also modest in relation to the current \nten-year non-Social surplus--it uses but 0.2 percent of the projected \nfederal surplus.\n  We've often heard that hunger has a cure. This is a call to action, \nnot a truism, for the many people who have cooperated in developing \nthis legislation. I'm proud to work with them for its prompt passage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 583\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate the United States courthouse located at \n40 Centre Street in New York, New York, as the ``Thurgood Marshall \nUnited States Courthouse''; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, it is an honor to be here today in order \nto join my colleague Congressman Eliot Engel and other members of the \nNew York Delegation in introducing a bill that would designate the U.S. \nCourthouse situated at 40 Centre Street in New York City the Thurgood \nMarshall United States Courthouse.\n  The courthouse on 40 Centre Street is the site where Thurgood \nMarshall served from 1961 to 1965 during his tenure on the U.S. Second \nCircuit Court of Appeals. For over 30 years of his life, Thurgood \nMarshall worked in New York, first as chief counsel of the NAACP, and \nlater as a Justice on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  President Kennedy nominated Thurgood Marshall to serve on the federal \nbench in a recess appointment--at the time there was resistance to an \nAfrican American being named to the federal appeals court. Robert \nKennedy was Thurgood Marshall's sponsor, and sat beside him in a show \nof support throughout his confirmation hearing. The Senate eventually \nconfirmed his nomination.\n  Later, President Johnson went on to name Justice Marshall Solicitor \nGeneral of the United States, and then to nominate him as the first \nAfrican American to serve on the United States Supreme Court. There, he \nbecame one of the most influential and respected justices of this past \ncentury. In a tribute to Justice Marshall, Chief Justice Rehnquist \nsaid:\n\n       Inscribed above the front entrance to the Supreme Court \n     building are the words ``Equal Justice Under Law.'' Surely, \n     no one individual did more to make these words a reality than \n     Thurgood Marshall.\n\n  It is amazing to think that a little boy who grew up under the iron \ngrip of Jim Crow, a talented student who was denied admission to the \nUniversity of Maryland's Law School because of his race and went on to \ngraduate at the top of his law class at Howard University, charted a \ncourse in the courts that led the way for the Civil Rights Movement to \nput an end to the segregation that had plagued our country for so long.\n  Thurgood Marshall will always be our nation's preeminent civil rights \nlawyer. He won 29 of the 32 cases he argued before the Supreme Court. \nDuring his time with the NAACP, he argued one of the hallmark court \ncases of our time, Brown v. Board of Education, which declared \nsegregation illegal.\n  For those of us who were alive then, we will forever have etched in \nour consciousness images of the Little Rock Nine, and the sheer courage \nof those children who would not be deterred from their efforts to \nintegrate Central High School. As foot soldiers of the first true test \nof Brown v. Board of Education, the Little Rock Nine will always be \nAmerican heroes. And so will Thurgood Marshall, whose brilliance and \npersistence in the courtroom made possible the eventual success of the \ncivil rights movement, as it took root in small towns and large cities \nall across America.\n  Thurgood Marshall was a role model to all who knew him in the way \nthat he carried himself and treated his coworkers and friends. He was \nknown for his casualness, and his ability to put people at ease. And he \nenjoyed life--his son, Thurgood Marshall, Jr., has shared with me the \nlove his father held for New York City and the joy he found there. I \nhad the privilege of attending his memorial service, and saw that 85 of \nhis former law clerks were there. This is a great testament to Thurgood \nMarshall, and I believe they, and all the good works they do, may be \none of his greatest legacies.\n  New Yorkers will be proud to have a courthouse named after a man who \ncommitted himself to attaining equal opportunity for every American. \nFor many years of his life, Thurgood Marshall was denied access to the \ninstitutions, restaurants and hotels in New York City and elsewhere. \nBut he always found an open door at the courthouse, and he never gave \nup on his belief that he could right the nation's wrongs through the \ncourts. There could not be a more fitting tribute than to name a \ncourthouse in New York City, a city at the forefront of so many \nnational and global movements, after Thurgood Marshall, an American \nhero and visionary whose work embodies the spirit of our country.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 584\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF THURGOOD MARSHALL UNITED STATES \n                   COURTHOUSE.\n\n       The United States courthouse located at 40 Centre Street in \n     New York, New York, shall\n\n[[Page S2668]]\n\n     be known and designated as the ``Thurgood Marshall United \n     States Courthouse''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REFERENCES.\n\n       Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, \n     or other record of the United States to the United States \n     courthouse referred to in section 1 shall be deemed to be a \n     reference to the Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend my colleagues from New York and \nour colleagues in the House, Congressman Engel, for their introduction \nof this bill. I compliment my friend from New York for her wonderful \nremarks about Thurgood Marshall, who has been an inspiration for a \ngeneration of us who grew up watching him change the law of this \ncountry, making a difference in the lives of millions and millions of \npeople but also for generations to come, who will remember and reflect \non his work as an inspiration in their time to redress the wrongs of \ntheir age.\n  It is appropriate, proper, and fitting that this building in New York \nthat houses the Federal judiciary be named for such an inspiring figure \nof our times.\n  I commend the Senator from New York for offering this, for her words \ntoday, and my compliments to Thurgood Marshall's family. Thurgood \nMarshall, Jr. has been a great friend to many of us here and has been a \nwonderful public servant in his own right. He carries on the great \ntradition his father carried as a judge and Member of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n  I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to be a cosponsor of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank Senator Clinton for her words \nabout Thurgood Marshall. I certainly also would like to be a cosponsor \nof this. I recommend on the floor of the Senate, if it is appropriate, \nJuan Williams' wonderful biography of Thurgood Marshall that I read \nabout 6 months ago, which was a very inspiring biography because it was \nabout such an inspiring civil rights leader and great judge.\n  I thank the Senator from New York for her remarks.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 586. A bill to authorize negotiation for the accession of Chile to \nthe North American Free Trade Agreement, to provide for fast track \nconsideration, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce legislation I \nauthored last year to enable the President to admit Chile into NAFTA. \nNearly 6 years ago, a bipartisan majority of this body ratified the \nNorth American Free Trade Agreement. Since then the promises of new \njobs, increased exports, lower tariffs and a clearer environment have \nall been realized. In other words, Mr. President, NAFTA has succeeded \ndespite the predictions of some that America could not compete in \ntoday's global economy.\n  As I said last year, with the success of NAFTA as a backdrop, it is \nnow high time to move forward and expand the free trade zone to other \ncountries in our hemisphere. To help accomplish that important goal, my \nlegislation will authorize and enable the President to move forward \nwith negotiations on a free trade agreement with Chile.\n  President Bush has stated time and again that he wants to increase \nties with Latin America and more fully engage our neighbors to the \nSouth. Western Hemisphere trade ministers are planning to develop a \ndraft proposal for a Free Trade Area of the Americas at their \nministerial meeting in Buenos Aires in April. This draft will then be \nconsidered by Western Hemisphere leaders at the third Summit of the \nAmericas in Quebec City at the end of that month. I hope that this \nsummit bears fruit. Indeed, I have been working toward a free trade \nagreement of the Americas for many years. We should quickly take the \nfirst step toward economic integration with our Southern neighbors by \nincluding Chile, who has been in negotiations to join NAFTA since early \nJanuary, in our North American trade agreement.\n  Chile is surely worthy of membership in NAFTA. In fact, Chile has \nalready signed a free trade agreement with Canada in 1996. And, in \naddition, Chile has also put in place a free trade agreement with \nMexico. After a brief slowdown last year, today the Chilean economy is \ngrowing at a healthy annual rate of more than 6 percent. Chile is noted \nfor its concern for preserving the environment, and has put in place \nenvironmental protections that are laudable. Chile's fiscal house is in \norder as evidenced by a balanced budget, strong currency, strong \nforeign reserves, and continued inflows of foreign capital, including \nsignificant direct investment.\n  In addition, Chile has already embraced the ideals of free trade. \nSince 1998, the Chilean tariff on goods from countries with which Chile \ndoes not yet have a free trade agreement has fallen from 11 percent to \n8 percent. That tariff is scheduled to continue to fall by a point a \nyear until it reaches 6 percent in 2003. While some goods are still \nassessed at a higher rate, the United States does a brisk export \nbusiness to Chile, sending approximately $3.6 billion in American goods \nto that South American nation. That represents 24 percent of Chile's \nimports. That $3.6 billion in exports represents thousands of American \njobs across the Nation.\n  Our firm belief in the importance of democracy continues to drive our \nforeign policy. After seventeen years of dictatorship, Chile returned \nto the family of democratic nations following the 1988 plebiscite. \nToday, the President and the legislature are both popularly elected and \nthe Chilean armed forces effectively carry out their responsibilities \nas mandated in Chile's Constitution. American investment and trade cay \nplay a critical role in building on Chile's political and economic \nsuccesses.\n  It is unrealistic to think that the President will have the ability \nto negotiate a free trade agreement without fast track authority. Nor \nshould we ask Chilean authorities to conduct negotiations under such \ncircumstances. Therefore, the bill I am introducing today will provide \nPresident Bush with a limited fast track authority which will apply \nonly to this specific treaty. I believe that fast track is key to \nenabling the President to negotiate the most advantageous trade \nagreements, and should therefore be re-authorized. At this point, \nhowever, there are stumbling blocks we must surmount before generic \nfast track can be re-authorized. Those stumbling blocks should not be \nallowed to stand in the way of free trade with Chile.\n  Naysayers claim that free trade prompts American business to move \noverseas and costs American workers their jobs. They will tell you that \nAmerica, the Nation with the largest and strongest economy, the best \nworkers, and the greatest track record of innovation cannot compete \nwith other nations.\n  The past 6\\1/2\\ years since we ratified NAFTA have proven them wrong. \nToday, tariffs are down and exports are up. The environment in North \nAmerica is cleaner. Most importantly, NAFTA has created 710,000 new \nAmerican jobs all across the Nation.\n  The many successes of NAFTA are an indication of the potential \nbroader free trade agreements hold for our economy. Furthermore, trade \nand economic relationships foster American influence and support our \nforeign policy. In other words, this bill represents new American jobs \nin every state in the nation, a stronger American economy and greater \nAmerican influence in our own Hemisphere. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Johnson, \n        and Mr. Roberts):\n  S. 587. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act and title XVIII \nof the Social Security Act to sustain access to vital emergency medical \nservices in rural areas; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Sustaining \nAccess to Vital Emergency Medical Services Act of 2001. This bill would \ntake important steps to strengthen the emergency medical service system \nin rural communities and across the Nation.\n  Across America, emergency medical care reduces human suffering and \nsaves lives. According to recent statistics, the average U.S. citizen \nwill require the services of an ambulance at least\n\n[[Page S2669]]\n\ntwice during his or her life. As my colleagues surely know, delays in \nreceiving care can mean the difference between illness and permanent \ninjury, between life and death. In rural communities, which often lack \naccess to local health care services, the need for reliable EMS is \nparticularly critical.\n  Over the next few decades, the need for quality emergency medical \ncare in rural areas is projected to increase as the elderly population \nin these communities continues to rise. Unfortunately, while the need \nfor effective EMS systems may increase, we have seen the number of \nindividuals able to provide these services decline. Nationwide, the \nmajority of emergency medical personnel are unpaid volunteers. As rural \neconomies continue to suffer, and individuals have less and less time \nto devote to volunteering, it has become increasingly difficult for \nrural EMS squads to recruit and retain personnel. In my State of North \nDakota, this phenomenon has resulted in a sharp reduction in EMS squad \nsize. In 1980, on average there were 35 members per EMS squad; today, \nthe average squad size has plummeted to 12 individuals per unit. I am \nconcerned that continued reductions in EMS squad size could jeopardize \nrural residents' access to needed medical services.\n  For this reason, the legislation I am introducing today includes \nmeasures to help communities recruit, retain, and train EMS providers. \nMy bill would establish a Rural Emergency Medical Services Training and \nEquipment Assistance program. This program would authorize $50 million \nin grant funding for fiscal years 2002-2007, which could be used in \nrural EMS squads to meet various personnel needs. For example, this \nfunding could help cover the costs of training volunteers in emergency \nresponse, injury prevention, and safety awareness; volunteers could \nalso access this funding to help meet the costs of obtaining State \nemergency medical certification. In addition, EMS squads would be \noffered the flexibility to use grant funding to acquire new equipment, \nsuch as cardiac defibrillators. This is particularly important for \nrural squads that have difficulty affording state-of-the-art equipment \nthat is needed for stabilizing patients during long travel times \nbetween the rural accident site and the nearest medical facility. This \ngrant funding could also be used to provide community education \ntraining in CPR, first aid or other emergency medical needs.\n  In addition, this legislation takes steps to help ensure emergency \nmedical providers are fairly reimbursed for ambulance services provided \nto Medicare, Medicare+Choice, and Medicaid managed care beneficiaries. \nAs you may know, the Balanced Budget Act required that Medicare+Choice \nand Medicaid managed care plans provide payment for emergency services \nthat a ``prudent layperson'' would determine are medically needed. \nHowever, regulations implementing this requirement did not include \nambulance services within the definition of ``emergency services.'' \nBecause of this oversight, ambulance providers are sometimes left in \nthe difficult position of providing services to individuals who, by any \nrational review, appear to need immediate medical attention. However, \nwhen it is later determined that the patient's symptoms were the result \nof heartburn, for example, rather than a serious heart condition, the \nambulance provider is denied payment for services. This is simply \nunfair.\n  While it is certainly important that EMS providers take care not to \nprovide unnecessary services, it is unfair to deny ambulance providers \npayment when they provide immediate emergency services to individuals \nwho appear tin serious need of medical care. In my State, EMS providers \nare operating on tight budgets and cannot afford to provide high levels \nof uncompensated care. To ensure EMS services remain available, \nparticularly in underserved rural areas, we must ensure that EMS \nproviders are appropriately reimbursed for the care they provide to our \ncommunities. For this reason, my legislation would revise the ``prudent \nlayperson'' definition to include ambulance services. This change will \nensure that ambulance providers who provide care in situations where a \nresponsible observer would deem this care medically necessary receive \nreimbursement under traditional Medicare, Medicare+Choice, and Medicaid \nmanaged care.\n  It is my hope that the Sustaining Access to Vital Emergency Medical \nServices Act will help ensure EMS providers can continue providing \nquality medical care to our communities. I am happy to say that this \nlegislation is supported by the National Association of State EMS \nDirectors, the National Rural Health Association, and the American \nAmbulance Association. I am also pleased that Senators Thomas, Daschle, \nJohnson, and others are joining me in this effort. I urge my colleagues \nto support this important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce \n``The Sustaining Access to Vital Emergency Medical Services Act of \n2001'' with Senators Conrad, Daschle, Roberts and Johnson. As with all \nrural health legislation I have worked on, I am proud of the bipartisan \neffort behind this bill.\n  ``The Sustaining Access to Vital Emergency Medical Services Act of \n2001'' will provide assistance to rural providers to maintain access to \nimportant emergency medical services, EMS. This legislation is \nnecessary because rural EMS providers are primarily volunteers who have \ndifficulty recruiting, retaining and educating EMS personnel. Rural EMS \nproviders also have less capital to buy and upgrade essential, life-\nsaving equipment.\n  The first section of this legislation is the authorization of an \nannual $50 million competitive grant program. Grantees can use these \nfunds for recruiting volunteers, training emergency personnel, using \nnew technologies to educate providers, acquiring EMS vehicles such as \nambulances and acquiring emergency medical equipment. I think it is \nimportant to note that all of the above eligible uses of funds were \npriority concerns of State EMS Directors in a recently conducted Rural \nEMS Survey with recruitment and retention ranking as number one.\n  The second part of this legislation applies the prudent layperson \nstandard for emergency services currently used in hospital emergency \nrooms to ambulance services. This provision will assist ambulance \nproviders in collecting payments for transporting patients to the \nhospital after answering a 911 call regardless of the final diagnosis. \nThis is a common sense approach and ensures that all aspects of \nemergency care are operating under the same definition of emergency.\n  I believe this legislation is an important part of ensuring rural \nresidents have access to emergency services. It is also flexible so \ncommunities can decide for themselves what is their most imminent EMS \nneed. Our bill is supported by the National Association of State EMS \nDirectors, the National Rural Health Association and the American \nAmbulance Association. I strongly urge all my colleagues interested in \nrural health to consider cosponsoring ``The Sustaining Access to Vital \nEmergency Medical Services Act of 2001.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Frist, Mrs. \n        Lincoln, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Chafee, and Mr. Carper):\n  S. 590. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \nrefundable tax credit for health insurance costs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join with my \ncolleagues in introducing the Relief, Equity, Access, and Coverage for \nHealth, REACH, Act, a bipartisan bill that will provide low and middle \nincome Americans with refundable tax credits for the purchase of health \ninsurance coverage.\n  New Census Bureau data indicate that there are now 43 million \nAmericans with no health coverage. And, for the third straight year, \ninsurance premiums for employer-sponsored coverage have increased \nsignificantly, by as much as 10 to 13 percent. We know from past \nexperience that premium increases cause people to lose their health \ninsurance. By some estimates, as many as 3 million Americans will lose \ncoverage for every 10 percent increase in premiums.\n  With premiums increasing and the economy uncertain, the problem could \nworsen. The impact of these numbers is very real for American families. \nThe uninsured often go without needed health care or face unaffordable \nmedical bills. Access to health coverage for\n\n[[Page S2670]]\n\nthe uninsured must be one of our nation's top priorities.\n  The REACH tax credit is targeted to those who are most in need of \nhelp, Americans who earn too much to qualify for public programs, but \nnevertheless struggle to pay for health insurance. Without additional \nresources, health insurance coverage is either beyond their reach or \nonly purchased by giving up other basic necessities of life.\n  The REACH Act makes a refundable tax credit available to more than 20 \nmillion Americans who do not have access to employer-sponsored \ninsurance and who are ineligible for public programs. The amount of the \ncredit for this group is $1,000 for individuals with adjusted gross \nincomes of up to $35,000 to purchase self-only coverage, and $2,500 for \ntaxpayers with an AGI of up to $55,000 to purchase family coverage.\n  We also want to help hard working Americans who have access to \nemployer-subsidized insurance, but have difficulty paying for their \nshare of the premiums. Over 7 million Americans decline insurance \noffered by their employers. To relieve their financial burden, the \nREACH Act provides a refundable tax credit of $400 for the purchase of \nself-only coverage and $1,000 for the purchase of family coverage under \nthe employer's group health plan.\n  Initial estimates indicate this legislation will provide coverage to \nmore than 10 million Americans who are presently uninsured. In \naddition, it will give needed financial relief to over 60 million low \nand moderate income working Americans who are using their own scarce \ndollars to buy health insurance coverage today.\n  The REACH Act provides a bipartisan, market-based solution to a \ncomplex problem. It will bolster the private health insurance market \nand strengthen employer-sponsored coverage, the cornerstone of our \nnation's health care system. While this legislation will not solve the \nentire problem, it is clearly a substantial step in the right \ndirection.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Jeffords and \nmy colleagues today in a bipartisan effort to address the growing \nnumber of individuals and families without health insurance coverage in \nthis country.\n  The problem has been made clear. Despite last year's decline in \nAmerica's uninsured population, there are still more than 43 million \namericans--one-sixth of our Nation's population, who do not have health \ninsurance. We know that the majority of the uninsured, 32 of the 44 \nmillion, earn an annual income of under $50,000. We also know that the \nrising cost of health insurance is the single most important reason \ngiven for the lack of purchasing coverage. Many Americans simply cannot \nafford to buy health insurance.\n  The solutions are becoming clearer as well. A one-size-fits-all \napproach to expand health coverage and access to health care does not \nmeet the various needs of the uninsured population. However, because \nour workforce is growing and evolving out of the older traditional \nmodels, we must look to common features of the uninsured population. \nAlthough more than 80 percent of the uninsured individuals come from \nfamilies with at least one employed member, the majority of uninsured \nAmericans do not have access to employer-sponsored health coverage. An \nadditional seven million Americans have access to employer-provided \nhealth insurance but are, in many cases, unable to afford it. \nTherefore, my colleagues and I today are introducing the Relief, \nEquity, Access, and Coverage for Health, REACH, Act to build upon the \ncurrent system of employer-based coverage which continues to be the \nmain source of coverage for most Americans.\n  Our goal is to fill the coverage gaps that exist in the current \nsystem while also complementing and expanding the reach of the \nemployment-based system. The central tenet of our proposal is a \nrefundable tax credit for low-income Americans who are not offered a \ncontribution for their insurance through their employer and do not \nreceive coverage through Federal programs such as Medicaid or Medicare. \nFor example, our proposal will help hard working Americans who cannot \nafford to buy coverage on their own, such as the part-time worker who \nis not offered employer-sponsored health insurance. We provide that \nworker with a $1,000 tax credit to purchase coverage. We help a young \nfamily with two children earning less than $50,000 a year by providing \nthem with a $2,500 credit to purchase a health insurance policy for \nthemselves and their children. In addition, the REACH Act also is \ndesigned to assist those Americans who do have access to employer-\nsubsidized health insurance but, too often, decline it because they \ncannot afford the cost-sharing components. We provide these individuals \nand families with up to $400 annually for single coverage or $1,000 for \nthemselves and their families. Overall it is estimated that these \nprovisions would expand new health insurance to as many as 17 million \npreviously uninsured Americans.\n  I appreciate the work my colleagues have done on this bill, and I \nlook forward to seeing the REACH Act passed into law this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. \n        Durbin, Mr. Brownback, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Bayh, and \n        Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 592. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to create \nIndividual Development Accounts, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today, I am introducing with Senator Joe \nLieberman ``the Savings Opportunity and Charitable Giving Act of \n2001.'' Other bipartisan cosponsors include Senators Hutchinson, \nDurbin, Brownback, Landrieu, Lugar, and Bayh. Within a month of the \nWhite House's formation of the Office of Faith-Based and Community \nInitiatives, we are moving the process forward in Congress by the \nbipartisan introduction of the key tax relief provisions of the \nPresident's Faith-Based Initiatives including Individual Development \nAccounts, IDAs, which President Bush endorsed in his campaign as part \nof the New Prosperity Initiative. Representatives J.C. Watts, Jr. and \nTony Hall will be introducing a similar measure in the House of \nRepresentatives within the coming weeks. Beneficiary Choice expansion \nand other provisions will be pursued in a thoughtful manner but on a \nseparate track from the tax provisions in the Senate.\n  Success in today's new economy is defined less and less by how much \nyou earn and more and more by how much you own, your asset base. This \nis great news for the millions of middle-class homeowners who are \ntapped into America's economic success, but it is bad news for those \nwho are simply tapped out, those with no assets and little hope of \naccumulating the means for upward mobility and real financial security. \nThis widening asset gap was underscored in a report issued earlier this \nyear by the Federal Reserve. The Fed found that while the net worth of \nthe typical family has risen substantially in recent years, it has \nactually dropped substantially for low-income families.\n  For families with annual incomes of less than $10,000, the median net \nworth dipped from $4,800 in 1995 to $3,600 in 1998. For families with \nincomes between $10,000 and $25,000, the median net worth fell from \n$31,000 to $24,800 over the same period. The rate of home ownership \namong low-income families has dropped as well. For families making less \nthan $10,000, it went from 36.1 percent to 34.5 percent from 1995 to \n1998; for those making between $10,000 and $25,000, it fell from 54.9 \npercent to 51.7 percent.\n  How do we reverse this troubling trend? IDAs are the unfinished \nbusiness of the Community Renewal and New Markets Empowerment \ninitiatives which became law in December of 2000 and will increase job \nopportunities and renew hope in what have been hopeless places. But to \nsustain this hope, we must provide opportunities for individuals and \nfamilies to build tangible assets and acquire stable wealth.\n  Our legislation is aimed at fixing our nation's growing gap in asset \nownership, which keeps millions of low-income workers from achieving \nthe American dream. Most public attention focuses on our growing income \ngap.\n\n[[Page S2673]]\n\n Though the booming American economy has delivered significant income \ngains to the nation's upper-income earners, lower-income workers have \nbeen left on the sidelines. This suggests to some that closing this \ndivide between the have-mosts and the have-leasts is simply a matter of \nraising wages. But the reality is that the income gap is a symptom of a \nlarger, more complicated problem.\n  How do we do this? We believe that the marketplace can provide such \nopportunity. Non-profit groups around the country have launched \ninnovative private programs that are achieving great success in \ntransforming the ``unbanked,'' people who have never had a bank \naccount, into unabashed capitalists. Through IDAs, banks and credit \nunions offer special savings accounts to low-income Americans and match \ntheir deposits dollar-for-dollar. In return, participants take an \neconomic literacy course and commit to using their savings to buy a \nhome, upgrade their education or to start a business.\n  Thousands of people are actively saving today through IDA programs in \nabout 250 neighborhoods nationwide. In one demonstration project \nundertaken by the Corporation for Enterprise Development, CFED, a \nleading IDA promoter, 1,300 families have already saved $329,000, which \nhas leveraged an additional $742,000.\n  While the growth of IDAs has been encouraging, access to IDA programs \nis still limited and scattered across the nation. The IDA provision of \nthis legislation will expand IDA access nationwide by providing a \nsignificant tax credit to financial institutions and community groups \nthat offer IDA accounts. This credit would reimburse banks for the \nfirst $500 of matching funds they contribute, thus significantly \nlowering the cost of offering IDAs. Other state and private funds can \nalso be used to provide an additional match to savings. It also \nbenefits our economy, the long-term stability of which is threatened by \nour pitiful national savings rate. In fact, according to some \nestimates, every $1 invested in an IDA returns $5 to the national \neconomy.\n  IDAs are matched savings accounts for working Americans restricted to \nthree uses: 1. buying a first home; 2. receiving post-secondary \neducation or training; or 3. starting or expanding a small business. \nIndividual and matching deposits are not co-mingled; all matching \ndollars are kept in a separate, parallel account. When the account \nholder has accumulated enough savings and matching funds to purchase \nthe asset, typically over two to four years, and has completed a \nfinancial education course, payments from the IDA will be made directly \nto the asset provider.\n  Financial institutions, or their contractual affiliates, would be \nreimbursed for all matching funds provided plus a limited amount of the \nprogram and administrative costs incurred, whether directly or through \ncollaborations with other entities. Specifically, the IDA Tax Credit \nwould be the aggregate amount of all dollar-for-dollar matches \nprovided, up to $500 per person per year, plus a one-time $100 per \naccount credit for financial education, recruiting, marketing, \nadministration, withdrawals, etc., plus an annual $30 per account \ncredit for the administrative cost of maintaining the account. To be \neligible for the match, adjusted gross income may not exceed $20,000, \nsingle, $25,000, head of household, or $40,000, married.\n\n  President Bush has expressed support for IDAs in his campaign and we \nare working with the Administration to coordinate efforts to the \nfullest extent possible. Supporting groups include the Credit Union \nNational Association, the Financial Services Roundtable, the \nCorporation for Enterprise Development, the National Association of \nHomebuilders, the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, the \nNational Federation of Community Development Credit Unions, the \nNational Council for La Raza, and others.\n  Individual Development Accounts, combined with other community \ndevelopment and wealth creation opportunities, are a first step towards \nrestoring faith in the longstanding American promise of equal \nopportunity. That faith has been shaken by stark divisions of income \nand wealth in our society. With the leadership of President Bush and \nSpeaker Hastert, I am hopeful, along with our other cosponsors, that \nCongress will take this first step toward restoring the long-cherished \nAmerican ideals of rewarding hard work, encouraging responsibility, and \nexpanding savings opportunity this year.\n  The Non-Itemizer Charitable Deduction provision will initially allow \nnon-itemizers to deduct 50 percent of their charitable giving, after \nthey exceed a cumulative total of $500 in annual donations, $1,000 for \njoint filers. The deduction will be phased into a 100 percent deduction \nover the course of 5 years in 10 percent increments. Under current law \nnon-itemizers receive no additional tax benefit for their charitable \ncontributions.\n  More than 84 million Americans cannot deduct any of their charitable \ncontributions because they do not itemize their tax returns. In \ncontrast, there are 34 million Americans who itemize and receive this \nbenefit. For example, in Pennsylvania, there are nearly 4 million \ntaxpayers who do not itemize deductions while slightly more than 1.5 \nmillion taxpayers do itemize.\n  While Americans are already giving generously to charities making a \nsignificant positive impact in our communities, this provision provides \nan incentive for additional giving and allows non-itemizers who \ntypically have middle to lower middle incomes to also benefit from \nadditional tax relief. In fact, non-itemizers earning less than $30,000 \ngive the highest percentage of their household income to charity. It is \nestimated that restoring this tax relief provision to merely 50 percent \nwhich existed in the 1980's would encourage more than $3 billion of \nadditional charitable giving a year. The phased in increase to 100 \npercent will result in even more additional giving. The floor is \nincluded because the standard personal deduction encompasses initial \ncontributions.\n  One important dimension of promoting charitable efforts helping to \nrevitalize our communities, empower individuals and families, and \nenhance educational opportunities is encouraging charitable giving. \nThis legislation is a great opportunity to lower the tax burden on the \nmany Americans who have not received any tax relief for their \ncharitable contributions since 1986.\n  The IRA Charitable Rollover allows individuals to roll assets from an \nIRA into a charity or a deferred charitable gift plan without incurring \nany income tax consequences. The donation would be made to charity \ndirectly without ever withdrawing it as income and paying taxes on it.\n  The rollover can be made as an outright gift, for a charitable \nremainder annuity trust, charitable remainder unitrust or pooled income \nfund, or for the issuance of a charitable annuity. The donor would not \nreceive a charitable deduction. This incentive should assist charitable \ngiving in education, social service, and religious charitable efforts.\n  Food banks are finding it increasingly difficult to meet the demand \nfor food assistance. In the past, food banks have benefitted from the \ninefficiencies of manufacturing, including the over-production of \nmerchandise and the manufacturing of cosmetically-flawed products. \nHowever, technology has made businesses and manufacturers significantly \nmore efficient. Although beneficial to the company's bottom-line, \ndonations have lessened as a result. The fact is that the demand on our \nnation's church pantries, soup kitchens and shelter continues to rise, \ndespite our economy.\n  According to an August 2000 report on Hunger Security by the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, 31 million Americans, around 10 percent of \nour citizens, are living on the edge of hunger. Although this number \nhas declined by 12 percent since 1995, everyone agrees that this figure \nremains too high.\n  Unfortunately, many food banks cannot meet this increased demand for \nfood. A December '99 study by the U.S. Conference of Mayors found that \nrequests for emergency food assistance increased by an average of 18 \npercent in American cities over the previous year and 21 percent of \nemergency food requests could not be met. Statistics by the United \nStates Department of Agriculture show that up to 96 billion pounds of \nfood goes to waste each year\n\n[[Page S2674]]\n\nin the United States. If a small percentage of this wasted food could \nbe redirected to food banks, we could make important strides in our \nfight against hunger. In many ways, current law is a hindrance to food \ndonations.\n  The tax code provides corporations with a special deduction for \ndonations to food banks, but it excludes farmers, ranchers and \nrestaurant owners from donating food under the same tax incentive. For \nmany of these businesses, it is actually more cost effective to throw \naway food than donate it to charity. The hunger relief community \nbelieves that these changes will markedly increase food donations-\nwhether it is a farmer donating his crop, a restaurant owner \ncontributing excess meals, or a food manufacturer producing \nspecifically for charity.\n  This bipartisan legislation was introduced separately by Senators \nLugar and Leahy with 13 additional cosponsors including myself. It has \nbeen endorsed by a diverse set of organizations, including America's \nSecond Harvest Food Banks, the Salvation Army, the American Farm Bureau \nFederation, the National Farmers Union, the National Restaurant \nAssociation, and the Grocery Manufacturers of America.\n  Under current law, when a corporation donates food to a food bank, it \nis eligible to receive a ``special rule'' tax deduction. Unfortunately, \nmost companies have found that the ``special rule\" deduction does not \nallow them to recoup their actual production costs. Moreover, current \nlaw limits the ``special rule'' deduction only to corporations, thus \nprohibiting farmers, ranchers, small businesses and restaurant owners \nfrom receiving the same tax benefits afforded to corporations.\n  This provision would encourage additional food donations through \nthree changes to our tax laws: This bill will extend the ``special \nrule'' tax deduction for food donations now afforded only to \ncorporations to all business taxpayers, including farmers and \nrestaurant owners. This legislation will increase the tax deduction for \ndonated food from basis plus  deg. markup to the fair market value of \nthe product, not to exceed twice the product's basis. This bill will \ncodify the Tax Court ruling in Lucky Stores, Inc. v. IRS, in which the \nCourt found that taxpayers should base the determination of fair market \nvalue of donated product on recent sales.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues for joining me in this important \neffort to increase savings opportunities for lower income working \nAmericans, to encourage the charitable giving of all Americans, to \nprovide additional resources for the charitable organizations which \nserve their communities, and to encourage additional donations of food \nto alleviate hunger. I would also encourage my other colleagues to \nconsider supporting this important initiative.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/21/senate-section/article/S2674-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2674]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 61--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \n  SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS SHOULD RECOGNIZE BOARD CERTIFICATIONS \n   FROM THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF PHYSICIAN SPECIALISTS, INC., FOR \n     PURPOSES OF THE PAYMENT OF SPECIAL PAY BY THE VETERANS HEALTH \n                             ADMINISTRATION\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Veterans' Affairs:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer a resolution \nconcerning our nation's veterans' population and the quality of health \ncare that they receive.\n  As a member of this Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, the chairman \nof the Personnel Subcommittee on the Senate Armed Services Committee, \nas well as the former chairman of the Health and Hospitals Subcommittee \non the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, I am very concerned that \ntoday's veterans' community receive the best possible health care \ncoverage that we can provide.\n  Recently, it was brought to my attention that the Department of \nVeterans Affairs only recognizes two organizations for physician \ncertification credentials. However, there are other organizations that \nhave pressed the VA to consider their credentials and have been met \nwith a closed door.\n  While it is my understanding that very recently the Department has \nrescinded this decision due to the VA General Counsel ruling it to be \nillegal, the VA still does not recognize other board certifications in \nthe matter of specialty pay.\n  Within the last few weeks, Congressman Joe Scarborough, my good \nfriend and former colleague, has introduced legislation on behalf of \none of these excluded organizations, the American Association of \nPhysician Specialists. His resolution addresses the issue of board \ncertification recognitions by the new Secretary of the VA to include \nthis organization in the list of organizations that are recognized for \ncertification and special pay.\n  Today, I am pleased to offer the Senate counter-part to Congressman \nScarborouogh's legislation in the hopes that this vehicle may rectify a \npolicy and system that seems faulty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/21/senate-section/article/S2674-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2674-S2675]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 27--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT \n    THE 2008 OLYMPIC GAMES SHOULD NOT BE HELD IN BEIJING UNLESS THE \n  GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA RELEASES ALL POLITICAL \n PRISONERS, RATIFIES THE INTERNATIONAL COVENANT ON CIVIL AND POLITICAL \n      RIGHTS, AND OBSERVES INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED HUMAN RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. HELMS (for himself, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Hutchinson, and Mr. Smith \nof New Hampshire) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which \nwas referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S.
