Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 1052, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A motion to proceed to the bill (S. 1052) to amend the \n     Public Health Service Act and the Employee Retirement Income \n     Security Act of 1974 to protect consumers in managed care \n     plans and other health coverage.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 9:30 \na.m. shall be equally divided between the managers of the bill or their \ndesignees.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, as I understand, the time between 9:20 \nand 9:30 is evenly divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. That is the order.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Madam President, this is a very important day in the lives of \nfamilies across this country. Today we are addressing one of the \nprincipal concerns of families from Maine to Florida, from the State of \nWashington to California, and the heart of the Nation. That is, are we \ngoing to make sure that medical decisions, decisions being made by \ndoctors, nurses, and families, are going to be the final decisions in \nterms of treatment and care for those particular patients? That is what \nthe issue is all about.\n  As all of us have seen, we have countless examples where those \ndecisions are\n\n[[Page S6534]]\n\nbeing overridden by HMOs and bureaucrats and bean counters. They are \nmaking medical judgments, effectively practicing medicine, which they \nare clearly not qualified to do. As we have seen in the Senate with \ncountless illustrations, that just about every Member has shared, they \nhave caused enormous damage to, and sometimes even cost the lives of, \nthese patients.\n  The protections we stand for are reasonable. They are sensible. They \nare common sense. When we get to the debate on this issue, we will have \na chance to review them.\n  We have waited 5 long years since this legislation was introduced to \ncome to this day. We have not had the opportunity to the present time. \nWe have had 14 days of hearings. We have the support of more than 800 \norganizations. There are few, if any, medical organizations which \nrepresent children, women, parents, the disabled, or any of the other \npatients organizations, that do not support the proposal which has been \nintroduced by Senators McCain, Edwards, myself, and others. We take \nheart that we are advocating for the doctors and nurses in America. \nThey have committed themselves to help those in need, and have acquired \nthe skill and training to make a difference in the lives of these \npatients.\n  The fact is, this should not be a partisan issue. It is not. It is \nbipartisan in the Senate, and it is bipartisan in the House. We welcome \nour friends on the other side to join with us. As was mentioned \npreviously, the essential aspect of this legislation has been supported \nby 63 Republicans in the House of Representatives. There are important \nleaders in the Republican Party, including Dr. Norwood, who have led \nthis crusade in the House and continue to do so.\n  This bill is bipartisan, and has the virtual unanimity of the medical \nprofessions and patient organizations behind it. It comes with a series \nof recommendations which are common sense in their nature, and \neffectively holds the HMOs liable if they take action that is going to \ncause injury. This is an important formula for good quality health care \nin America.\n  As we have said so often, when we have effective accountability and \neffective liability, these provisions are rarely used. We have seen \nthis in recent examples from California and Texas. What they do reflect \nis additional quality protections when they are included in the law.\n  That is what we are interested in. Those of us who are supporting \nthis measure know what it is all about: It is for the care and \nprotection of patients. We have had a chance to examine it. This issue \nhas been studied, restudied, and studied again.\n  I look forward to a strong vote at the appointed hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, how much time do we have on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I rise to support the commitment, the \nvote we will take in a few minutes, to proceed.\n  As the Senator from Massachusetts said, America is ready for strong \npatient protections. America is ready to hold HMOs accountable when \nthey are making medical decisions. The debate that will ensue today and \nwill take some time, I believe, is an important one to the American \npeople because all 170 million people who receive their health care \nthrough employer-sponsored plans will be affected. All of them are \ngoing to pay more money for their premiums because of the legislation \non the floor.\n  These are new rights, new protections. We will see a bill that will \nbe ultimately signed by the President, I am confident of it, if it is a \nbill that is balanced, that respects this balance which all Americans \ndeserve--the balance between accountability and patients' rights.\n  We do need to get the HMOs out of the business of practicing \nmedicine. There is no question the pendulum has swung over the last 10 \nto 15 years to the point that HMOs have gone too far and gotten away \nfrom medical decisionmaking, medical decisionmaking being made locally \nwith the doctor-patient relationship. Now it is time to swing that \npendulum back.\n  We need to hold HMOs accountable for decisions they make that are \nmedical decisions. We need to return that decisionmaking back to the \ndoctor-patient relationship. At the same time, we can't unnecessarily \npass mandates that don't add protections, that drive the cost of \npremiums up, that drive the cost of health care up to all 170 million \nAmericans out there unnecessarily because that does drive people to the \nranks of the uninsured.\n  We know if you don't have insurance, you don't have access to as good \nquality of care. It is that balance that I am very hopeful we can \nachieve in the Senate.\n  As the Senator from Massachusetts said, it is not a partisan issue; \nit should not be. The President of the United States, a Republican, is \nleading on this issue with the principles he put forth in February. The \nlead sponsor of the Kennedy bill is a Republican, Senator McCain. The \nlead sponsor of the Breaux-Frist-Jeffords bill is a Republican. It is a \nnonpartisan issue, as we reach out to get patients the protections they \ndeserve.\n  The time element we will be discussing because, although people say \nwe debated this over and over, we have not debated these liability \nprovisions. We did not mark up, so-called mark up, these liability \nprovisions in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. The \nlast hearings we held on patient protection legislation were 2 years \nago, and that was on the Jeffords bill that did not have liability or \nsuing HMOs in it at all. What we will have over the next several weeks, \nfor the first time on the floor of the Senate, is a debate on a bill \nthat was introduced last Thursday, beginning the discussion on \nliability.\n  Very quickly, let me illustrate what this entails because it is \ncomplex, as we go forward.\n  Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A minute 22 seconds.\n  Mr. FRIST. This chart is an outline of the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy \ncoverage determination and liability process. I have started to walk \nthrough it as it was in the bill introduced last Thursday. As you can \nsee, it is quite complex. We are going to have to go through the \ninternal appeals process, the external appeals process, and march \nthrough and see how much liability should be at the Federal level, how \nmuch should be at the State level, and should you go back and forth \nfrom Federal to State.\n  Those are the issues we are going to have to debate as we look at how \nthe whole HMO is accountable. I encourage my colleagues to vote in \nfavor of proceeding so we can engage in the debate and improve the \nunderlying bill.\n  With that, I look forward to the first amendment at about noon today \nas we go forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. \nMcConnell) and the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nKentucky (Mr. McConnell) would vote ``aye.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, after years of delay--and I want to \nemphasize years of delay--and blocking of consideration of this \nlegislation, this important issue, the Patients' Bill of Rights, we are \nnow, finally, going to take up this issue. I am very pleased to hear of \nthe new-found commitment on the part of those who had blocked \nconsideration of this legislation to seeing this legislation through to \nits completion. I point out again, it is long overdue that we address \nthis issue. I am glad we are going to address it in a format where \namendments are offered, we have debate, and votes are taken without \nfilibustering and without obfuscation of the issue.\n  There are important issues, there are important negotiations, and \nimportant amendments that need to be discussed and debated. Again, I \nappreciate the commitment on the part of those who blocked--who \nblocked--consideration of this legislation for years on the floor of \nthe Senate and am pleased to be bringing this issue to a conclusion. I \napplaud the majority leader who has stated we will not leave for the \nFourth of July recess until we resolve this issue and have a final vote \non it. I believe it deserves that attention. I hope all of my \ncolleagues will devote their efforts and good-faith energies towards \nresolving it.\n  Our personal health and the health of our loved ones is the most \nvaluable thing we possess. Unfortunately, we often take good health for \ngranted until tragedy strikes and the health or well-being of a family \nmember is jeopardized by disease, accident, or infirmities associated \nwith aging.\n  When one of us or a loved one becomes ill, the obstacles of daily \nlife become insignificant in comparison to ensuring the best health \ncare services are available to our families.\n  Unfortunately, too many Americans are powerless when faced with a \nhealth care crisis in their personal life. Too many Americans have had \nimportant, life-altering medical decisions micro-managed by business \npeople rather than medical professionals. Too many Americans believe \nthey have no access to quality care or cannot receive the necessary \nmedical treatment recommended by their personal physician.\n  Many Americans work hard and live on strict budgets so they can \nafford health insurance coverage for their family. But the moment they \nneed it, they are confronted with obstacles limiting which services are \navailable to them. They are confronted by frustrating bureaucratic \nhoops; and confronted by health plans that provide little, if any, \nopportunity for patients to redress grievances. This happens too often \nand can be attributed to several factors.\n  Our health care system is very complicated and can be attributed to \nseveral factors.\n  Our health care system is very complicated. Its language is comprised \nof thousands of acronyms and codes. Even its acronyms have acronyms. \nOur overly complex health insurance system intimidates and confuses \nmany Americans. Many of us fail to fully examine the coverage provided \nby our health plans until we become ill, and then it is difficult to \nunderstand the plan's legalese. Health care has become increasingly \ndepersonalized, focused more on profits than on proper patient care.\n  I am not embarrassed to admit that I am often overwhelmed by the \ncomplexity of the health system. I can certainly relate to the majority \nof Americans who are overwhelmed by a system which does not meet their \nbasic needs in a simple, efficient and affordable manner.\n  Over the last few years I had an invaluable opportunity to travel \naround our great country; meeting and speaking with people from all \nsectors of life and regions of our nation. No matter how small or large \na community I visited or where I held a town hall meeting, I repeatedly \nheard complaints that people's health plans denied or delayed the \nappropriate medical care, resulting in injury or even death to a loved \none.\n  This is why I began working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle over a year ago to craft a bipartisan bill that truly protects \nthe rights of patients in our nation's health care system.\n  The following are the core principles I insisted be contained in our \nbipartisan bill:\n  First, our bill is about getting patients the health care they need \nand not about promoting lawsuits. We have worked hard to ensure that \nour bill focuses on getting patients the medical care they need. This \nis not about promoting frivolous lawsuits that could drive up health \ncare costs and increase the number of uninsured in our country. Our \nbill provides a fair and independent grievance process in the event an \nHMO denies or delays medical care. A mother should have options when \nshe is told her son or daughter's cancer treatment is not necessary and \nwill not be covered by her insurance. She must have access to both \ninternal and external appeals processes which are fair and readily \navailable and which use neutral experts who are not selected, or \notherwise beholden to the HMO. In life-threatening cases, there must be \nan expedited process.\n  Our bipartisan bill puts Americans in charge of their own health \ncare. Patients and their doctors should control health care decisions, \nnot HMOs or Washington bureaucrats. Physicians utilizing the best \nmedical data must make the medical decisions, not insurance companies \nor trial lawyers. We need to put in place a balanced system that allows \nmanaged care companies to reduce costs but also reinvigorates the \npatient-doctor relationship, the essence of quality health care.\n  This bill protects employers from liability. We protect employers \nfrom being exposed to any liability unless they are directly \nparticipating in medical decisions. This bill will not make employers \nvulnerable for health care decisions they are not directly making and \nwill not cause them to drop health care coverage for their employees \nout of fear of exposure to frivolous and unlimited liability.\n  Our bipartisan bill provides all Americans with patient protections. \nOur compromise includes strong patient protections that will ensure \ntimely access to high quality health care for the\n\n[[Page S6536]]\n\nmillions of Americans with private health insurance coverage either \nthrough their employer or through the individual market place. The \nprotections include: access to emergency care, access to specialty \ncare, access to non-formulary drugs, access to clinical trials, direct \naccess to pediatricians and ob-gyns, continuity of care for those with \nongoing health care needs, and access to important health plan \ninformation. The bill also protects the doctor-patient relationship by \nensuring health professionals are free to provide information about a \npatient's medical treatment options.\n  Our bipartisan bill empowers states. It allows states to develop \ntheir own patient protection laws, and empowers the Governors to \ncertify that they are comparable to federal law. If the State law is \ncomparable to those at the Federal level, the State law will remain in \neffect. We allow States to enforce their own laws for their citizens \nwhile ensuring that a minimum level of protections are available for \nall Americans. We want to ensure that a mother in Arizona can take her \nson directly to a pediatrician in the same way a mom in Texas can.\n\n  Our bill allows Americans to seek reasonable relief once all options \nto receive medical care have been exhausted. I find it incredible that \nHMOs and their employees are able to avoid responsibility for negligent \nor harmful medical care. Americans covered by ERISA health plans should \nhave the same right of redress in the courts as those who are enrolled \nin non-ERISA plans if they are unable to receive a fair resolution \nthrough an unbiased appeals process. We must ensure that patients \nreceive the benefits for which they have paid and rightfully deserve. \nWe must also ensure that unscrupulous health plans not go unpunished \nwhen they act negligently, resulting in harm or death to a patient.\n  Out bill protects state laws that allow patients who have been harmed \nor killed due to the medical decisions of an HMO to seek redress in \nstate court. However, we worked hard to strike a compromise and help \nemployers by allowing contract disputes to be handled in federal court. \nThis will help employers and insurance companies have that offer multi-\nstate plans have uniformity without obviating state laws.\n  Finally, we must improve access to affordable health care. It is \nsimply disgraceful that 44 million Americans cannot afford health care \ncoverage. This is the largest number of uninsured citizens in over a \ndecade, despite our solid economy and past actions to provide greater \naccess to medical care. We must continue building upon already enacted \nreforms by expanding medical savings accounts, providing full tax \ndeductibility for self-employed health insurance costs, and allowing \ntax credits for helping small businesses provide access to health care \ncoverage for their employees.\n  These provisions continue to be a crucial component of the bipartisan \ncompromise I reached with Senators Edwards and Kennedy. I am working \nwith both of them and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, \nincluding Finance Chairman Baucus to ensure that these provisions are \naddressed as a part of this bill or in the next legislative vehicle \nthat the Senate deliberates.\n  America has been patiently waiting for far too long for Congress to \npass a Patients' Bill of Rights that will grant American families \nenrolled in health maintenance organizations the health care \nprotections they deserve, including the right to remedy insurance \ndisputes through the courts if all other means are exhausted.\n  For far too long, this vital reform has been frustrated by political \ngridlock, principally by trial lawyers who insist on the ability to sue \neveryone for everything, and by the insurance companies who want to \nprotect their bottom line at the expense of fairness.\n  If I have ever seen a more living, breathing argument for campaign \nfinance reform, it is in the failure to act on this legislation.\n  Both sides hope to continue affecting their agenda with ``soft \nmoney'' contributions they hand over to the political parties, while \nneither represents the hopes, expectations, and best interests of the \nAmerican people.\n  I have always found the American people to be reliable counsel when \nCongress attempts to assess the gravity and urgency of a problem \naffecting the entire nation. I have listened to countless thousands of \nAmericans demand immediate action on a Patients' Bill of Rights. I have \nheard countless thousands demand a reasonable standard of \naccountability for health insurers who have too long and too often \nescaped virtually all accountability. I have heard countless thousands \ndemand, what any American recognizes as basic fairness, that their most \nprecious possession, their health, not be subordinate to profits for \ninsurers or lawyers, or to political advantage of one part or another.\n  I have heard from very few people who claim that HMOs should continue \nto be the sole decisionmakers for who gets decent health care and who \ndoes not, for who lives and who dies. I have heard very few people \ndefend an HMO's right to escape all accountability for those decisions. \nI have heard from very few people except those starring in radio and \ntelevision ads underwritten by insurers who say HMO reform is \nunnecessary. I have heard from very few people who have claimed that \ntheir health, or their child's health is less important to them than \nthe amount of damages they can recover from negligent health insurers.\n  But in every reliable public survey, and in every conversation I have \nhad with the American people, in groups of ten or crowds of a thousand, \neveryone recognizes that a Patients' Bill of Rights is an urgent, \nnecessary improvement if America is to have the kind of health care \nthat befits a great and prosperous nation.\n  Men and women of good will, on both sides of the aisle, in Congress \nand in the administration, are working to bridge differences between \nour different remedies to this problem. I am encouraged by that, and \npledge my cooperation in any sincere effort to reach fair compromises \non the outstanding issues that still divide us. Whether in the \namendment process or in discussions with colleagues and members of the \nadministration, the sponsors of this bill want to reach agreement on \ngenuine reform that will be enacted into law. But we cannot compromise \non our resolve to return control of health care to medical \nprofessionals, and to hold insurers to the same standard of \naccountability that doctors and nurses are held to. That is all we seek \ntoday and all that the American people expect from us, a fair and \neffective remedy to a grave national problem. I urge all my colleagues \nto join us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Madam President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nBipartisan Patients' Protection Act. I thank my colleague from Arizona \nwith whom I have worked for many months to help draft this legislation. \nI also thank my colleague from Massachusetts who has worked on this \nissue for many years. It is a critically important issue to the \nAmerican people.\n  Let me talk a little bit about this issue, what this legislation \ndoes, and what this debate is about. We start with a very simple idea. \nThat idea is to put the law on the side of patients, doctors, and \nhealth care providers. For many years, the law has given privileged \nstatus to HMOs and big health insurance companies in America. They are \ntreated differently than any other group in this country is treated. \nThey can do whatever they want. They can make decisions solely on the \nbasis of cost and money, the bottom line and the profit, and they \ncannot be held accountable in any way. If they deny coverage for \ntreatment that a child needs, or for a test that someone needs, or a \nvisit to the emergency room by a family who had a true emergency, there \nis nothing that family can do. There is nothing that child can do. \nThere is nothing that patient can do. They are stuck with whatever \ndecision is made by the HMO. They are privileged citizens.\n  Not surprisingly, they like their privileged status. They want to \nstay right where they are. They do not want the law changed. They do \nnot want to be treated like everyone else. They do not want to be \ntreated like others. They do not want to be treated like any other \nsmall business or big business in this country.\n  It is time to change that. It is time to give real rights to \npatients.\n\n[[Page S6537]]\n\n  That is what this legislation is about. It is time to put the law on \nthe side of families, patients, and doctors.\n  We have some very specific protections that are critical in this \nbill. We start with the simple principle that every American who is \ncovered by health insurance or an HMO is covered by our legislation. If \nyou have HMO coverage, or if you have health insurance coverage in this \ncountry, our Bipartisan Patient Protection Act covers you, period.\n  If a State has a stronger protection law, if a State has a provision \nthat is stronger than the provisions of our bill, that State law will \nremain in effect. But our law provides the floor below which no State \ncan go. We cover every single American who has health insurance or HMO \ncoverage.\n  Second, we also provide that women can be seen by an OB/GYN as their \nprimary care provider. Women across this country have had this issue \ncome up over and over where they have to go through a gatekeeper in \norder to go see the physician who is, in fact, their primary care \nprovider, an OB/GYN. We eliminate that problem. We provide direct \naccess to specialists.\n  For example, if a child who has developed cancer needs to be seen not \nby a general cancer doctor--just a general oncologist--but by a child \nspecialist, a pediatric oncologist, we specifically provide that the \nchild can see the specialist the child's family believes their child \nneeds to see.\n  That is what we mean when we say we provide direct access to \nspecialists so that people can see the specialist they need.\n  Emergency room care: If a family has an emergency at home, in an \nautomobile--wherever--and needs to go to the emergency room, the last \nthing in the world they want to be thinking about is, Do I need to call \nmy insurance company? Do I need to call my HMO before I go to the \nemergency room to get the treatment I need?\n\n  We have eliminated that--no 1-800 numbers; no trying to look through \nthe drawers to figure out where your insurance company is and how to \ncall them. If somebody gets hurt, and they need to go to an emergency \nroom, it is very simple. You go to the nearest emergency room, and you \nare covered. That is the way it ought to be. Unfortunately, it has not \nbeen as it should have been. We protect patients in emergency \nsituations.\n  These rights: Access to specialists, emergency room care, women being \nable to be seen by an OB/GYN, access to clinical trials--we \nspecifically provide that if a patient participates in a clinical \ntrial, the costs that are not covered by the sponsor of the trial, the \nattendant costs, the hospital care or other things, in fact will be \ncovered by the HMO and the insurance company.\n  Clinical trials are critical, not only to patients for whom they are \noften the last hope, but they are also critical to our Nation in \ncontinuing to lead the way in this world in advancements in medicine. \nWe make sure clinical trials are covered.\n  In the area of specialist care, clinical trials, access to emergency \nrooms, and access by women to an OB/GYN, we have real substantive \npatient protection. But those rights are meaningless unless they are \nenforceable. It is not a Patients' Bill of Rights unless there are \nenforcement provisions. Without meaningful strong enforcement, it is \nnot a Patients' Bill of Rights. It is a patients' bill of suggestions.\n  We want a real Patients' Bill of Rights. That is what our bill is. We \nhave real enforcement. The entire bill is designed to get patients the \ncare, the treatment, and the tests they need and should have gotten to \nbegin with from the very outset.\n  We want the insurance company and the HMOs to know that if they do \nsomething wrong, their decision can be reversed.\n  The first thing we have is what is called an ``internal review \nprocess'' within the HMO. If a child needs a test, and the HMO says \nthey are not paying for it, and the family doctor says the child still \nneeds it and they overrule the doctor--if that occurs, that family has \nsomewhere to go. They go to an internal review process within the HMO. \nIf that is unsuccessful, and for a second time the HMO says no, then \nthe third step is an external independent review. We set up a system, a \npanel of doctors and experts who have no connection at all with the \npatient or the doctor involved--no connection at all with the HMO that \ncan then look at the medical facts and determine whether that child \nneeds that test and can reverse the decision of the HMO.\n\n  So there are three stages through which the right decision can be \nmade. Hopefully, the HMO will do the right thing to begin with, as on \nmany occasions in the past. If they do not, then they can be reversed \nby an internal review process. If that is unsuccessful, then you can go \nto an independent appeal board. This is all before anybody goes to \ncourt. You can go to an independent appeal board that can reverse the \ndecision of the HMO.\n  So we have set up a system designed to make sure the patients get the \ncare they need, and get it as quickly as they possibly can. That is \nwhat our whole system is designed for. It is designed to avoid anybody \never having to go to court.\n  Unfortunately, there will be occasions where that system does not \nsolve the problem--they are rare, but they will occur--and where a \npatient has been hurt because of some arbitrary or intentional decision \nby an HMO, where an HMO says: We are not paying for that. We don't care \nwhat the doctor said. We don't care what this child needs. We're not \npaying for it. And a child suffers a serious injury. As a result, those \ncases can then go to court.\n  We have heard lots of arguments in the public debates on this issue \nin relation to the creation of lawsuits. That is not what this \nlegislation is about. This legislation is about real patient \nprotection. It is about a system to reverse a bad decision by an HMO, \nand then ultimately treating HMOs like everyone else in this country--\nevery other business, every other American.\n  You and I, when we do something, we are responsible for it. We \nbelieve in that in this country. We believe in individual \nresponsibility. When we make a decision or we take some action, we \nbelieve we ought to be held accountable for that and we ought to be \nresponsible for it. We believe it all the way down the line.\n  That is the concept this bill enforces. We take away the special \nprotections HMOs have had in the past, where they can in no way have \ntheir decision reversed. If they deny coverage to a family, they are \nstuck with that decision. It cannot be appealed, cannot be challenged, \ncannot be taken to court. They are stuck with that decision.\n  We change all that. Now, under this legislation, they are treated \nexactly the same. If all the appeals have failed--if an HMO denies \ncoverage, and the internal appeal fails, the external appeal fails, and \nsomeone is hurt, then we treat them like anybody else. They have made a \nmedical decision. They have overruled the doctor, who has years of \ntraining and experience and who has actually seen the patient. So we \nput them in the shoes of the doctors. If they want to make medical \ndecisions, they ought to be treated like people who make medical \ndecisions.\n  For that reason, we send the majority of the cases to State court, \nwhich is where doctors and hospitals and businesses go.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is it true that we have significant protections for \nemployers with regard to liability, including the self-insured? But \nisn't it also true--because allegations will be made to the contrary--\nthat we are interested in actively pursuing further agreements with all \nparties to try to address and tighten this language so we can achieve \nthe goal we seek; and that is, to remove employer liability where the \nemployer had no voice in the medical decision and to make sure the \nself-insured are able to avoid unnecessary lawsuits and be protected as \nwell?\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I thank the Senator for his question.\n  The Senator knows, of course, because he and I have worked on this \nissue over a period of many months, that we both believe very strongly \nthat we ought to protect employers from liability, period. What we have \ndone in our legislation is we have followed the outline of the \nPresident's principle. The President has said, in his principle, that \nhe does not want employers held responsible for liability unless they \nactually make individual medical judgments, which, of course, is \nextraordinarily rare. Our bill does exactly the\n\n[[Page S6538]]\n\nsame thing. It specifically protects employers unless they make an \nindividual medical decision.\n  But the Senator is also correct that we start with the idea that we \nwant employers protected, and to the extent our colleagues have ideas \non this subject, we welcome those ideas and are willing to talk about \nthis. The Senator and I have talked about this not only from the outset \nbut over the course of the last several days. So we are more than \nwilling to consider other possible ideas on this subject that will more \nstrongly protect employers from liability.\n  Basically, the entire legislation is intended to do two things: One, \ngive real rights to patients, so the law does not continue to be just \non the side of the big HMOs; and, two, to make those rights \nenforceable, so that when a patient or family is denied coverage, they \ncan do something about it. It is just about that simple. And it is \ndesigned to get the care to the patient as quickly as we possibly can.\n  My colleague from Arizona just asked a question about employer \nliability, which we have just talked about. We believe very strongly \nthat employers ought to continue to provide coverage, and we want to \nprotect employers from liability.\n  Second, there is an argument made that this will result in lots of \nlawsuits. The truth of the matter is, all we are doing is taking away \nthe shield, the privileged status HMOs have today that makes them \ndifferent from all the rest of us. We just want them to be treated like \nevery other American, which I think is fair and equitable.\n  But what we have learned from the three States--Georgia, California, \nand Texas--that have similar laws, is that almost all claims are \nresolved either with the internal appeal or the external appeal. In \nthose three States, I think there has been a total of about 17 \nlawsuits. In the State of Georgia, Senator Miller indicated yesterday \nthere has been none. And those are three large States.\n  So the evidence does not support the argument that this is going to \nresult in lots of lawsuits. In fact, we believe that is not true. \nSenator McCain and I have worked very hard to design this bill to avoid \nthat occurrence. But rarely it will occur. And if it does occur, we \njust want the HMOs treated like everybody else.\n  There are real differences between our legislation and the competing \nlegislation. I will not go through the details of those differences, \nbut let me just say they begin from the very outset of the bill and \nflow to the end.\n  We make it clear that every American is covered, and their language \nis less clear about that. We allow patients to have direct access to \nspecialists outside the plan. They allow the HMO to make those \ndecisions. We make clear that people have access to clinical trials, \nincluding FDA-approved clinical trials. They do not. We have a clearly \nindependent review process where no one, including the HMO, can be \ninvolved in who is on the appeal panel. They do not. We send cases to \nState court, so HMOs are treated just like the doctors and the \nhospitals and all the rest of us. They give them special, privileged \ntreatment by sending their cases to Federal court, where they are less \nlikely to get hurt and it is harder for the patient to actually have a \ndetermination of their case or their claim.\n\n  So in every single case where there is a difference, they favor the \nHMOs, we favor the patients. That is the reason that the American \nMedical Association and, I think, over 300 or 400 medical groups in \nthis country support our legislation. Virtually every medical group in \nthe Nation supports our legislation--and consumer groups. There are a \nhandful that support both.\n  But there is a reason that all those groups favor our legislation. \nThere is a reason the HMOs favor their legislation. The reason is very \nsimple. We have real and strong patient protection. And in every case \nthere is a difference, their bill favors the HMOs, our bill favors the \npatients.\n  I would like to tell you a quick story about a patient in North \nCarolina. He is a young man named Michael Gray Whitt, who is shown in \nthis photograph. Today he is a beautiful, happy 2-year-old little boy. \nHe and his family live in Fleetwood, NC. His parents are Marc and \nTerri. Unfortunately, at the time he was born, he was not as healthy \nand happy as he is here shown in this picture.\n  He was born 4 weeks early at Watauga Medical Center in Boone, NC, \nbecause of a blood disorder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 30 minutes controlled by the majority has \nexpired.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, as long as the opponents of \nthe bill get 5 minutes also.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Absolutely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I thank my colleagues.\n  Madam President, when Michael Gray Whitt was born, he suffered from a \nblood disorder known as RH isoimmunization, which occurs when the \nmother has one blood type and the baby has another. The mother's body \nreacts by producing antibodies that attack the baby's blood. It can \ncause anemia, jaundice, enlargement of the liver and spleen, and it can \neven cause death.\n  It is usually prevented by taking a drug, which Michael's mother \ntook, but it did not work in her case.\n  When baby Michael was born, he was at risk for liver failure, \nseizures, and brain damage. A newborn medical specialist recommended \nthat he remain in the hospital where he could be watched in case any of \nthese problems developed. He was very much at risk, very much in peril. \nThe doctor specialist who was taking care of him knew he needed to be \nin the hospital so if anything went wrong they would be able to do \nsomething about it. He was right to be worried.\n  Michael's liver was not working properly, and he was kept in the \nhospital, in fact, for treatment. You can imagine how his parents Marc \nand Terri felt when less than 72 hours after he was born the HMO wanted \nhim discharged from the hospital. Luckily for Michael, his doctor \nrefused to follow the HMO's order. But when he showed some marginal, \nslight signs of improvement after 2 days, the HMO insisted that he be \ndischarged. So he was sent home.\n  His parents were in shock. Why in the world would their HMO send a \nsick baby home who everyone knew needed to be watched carefully in case \nproblems developed?\n  Less than 24 hours after the HMO sent him home, he got sicker than he \nhad ever been. He was lethargic. He had jaundice, and he was eating \npoorly. Tests showed his liver problems had gotten worse. So less than \na day after he was sent home against his doctor's wishes, he was back \nin the hospital.\n  I would like to share some words of Michael's dad, Marc Whitt, about \nhis ordeal. This is what he said:\n\n       I could never put into words the amount of stress and \n     anxiety my wife suffered throughout this first week of our \n     child's life.\n       It was hard to deal with a helpless, sick newborn but \n     impossible to understand and tolerate an insurance company's \n     total disregard for our child's life.\n       I wonder how many people's lives will be ruined by the \n     actions of an HMO before HMOs are held accountable for their \n     behavior.\n\n  That is a good question. How many more children will suffer serious \ninjury or death before we do something about what these HMOs are doing?\n  A couple of days ago one of the chief spokespeople for the HMOs was \nquoted in the New York Times as saying: We are prepared to spend \nwhatever is necessary on public relations, on lobbyists, on television \nads. But they were not prepared to spend what was necessary for this \nyoung child to get the care his doctor knew he needed and his parents \nknew he needed.\n  We have a message for the HMOs. Whatever millions of dollars they are \nwilling to spend, whatever the power of their lobbyists here in \nWashington, we are prepared to stand and fight along with Michael and \nfamilies like his all around America, as long as is necessary, to \nensure that finally in this country HMOs, just like all the rest of us, \nwill be held responsible for what they do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the last \norder entered by the Chair be revised to take the 5 minutes or whatever \ntime the\n\n[[Page S6539]]\n\nSenator from North Carolina used from our next 30 minutes. That way we \nwill still be able to start the amendment process at noon. Does the \nChair understand the request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair does understand. Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Chair. I knew the Chair would understand, if I \nmade sense in explaining. I wanted to make sure I had done that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield myself 15 minutes.\n  Madam President, I rise in support of a Patients' Bill of Rights. We \nneed a Patients' Bill of Rights in this country. I spent most of last \nyear working on a conference committee to get a Patients' Bill of \nRights. I am told by more senior colleagues that we spent more time \nmeeting as members than on any other bill they could remember. We got \nthat close to having an agreement.\n  In fact, people could see that we were going to get agreement on a \nPatients' Bill of Rights. There were some people who chose to have it \nas an issue instead of a solution. That is why we are back again \nworking on a Patients' Bill of Rights. We do need a Patients' Bill of \nRights but not this one, the way it reads.\n  I will give some rebuttal to a McCain-Kennedy factsheet on protecting \nemployers. The sponsors of the bill distributed a white paper to the \nDemocrat caucus, and I can't let that go unrebutted. This is the \nassertion: Employers are explicitly protected from liability in almost \nevery case. But that is not what the bill says.\n  For the record, let me say that you would need a bushel basket of \nbreadcrumbs to weave your way through this bill without getting lost. I \ntried at first with string, but it got so interwoven I thought it was \nmacrame.\n  This is going to be extremely hard to follow. It is much easier to \ngive examples, as we just heard of people who have been wronged by the \nsystem. We need to clear that up.\n  It is much more difficult, though, to make sure it reads properly in \nthe details. You will be able to see why the average person is not \nentirely clear on how this bill fails to meet the assertion that \nemployer-sponsored health care is protected. I am not a lawyer so my \nexplanation may go a little more slowly than the compelling \npresentation made by my colleagues Senators Gregg and Gramm on Tuesday. \nBut I can assure you that I will lead you through the language of the \nMcCain-Kennedy bill and show that it clearly sues employers and, \ntherefore, threatens Americans' access to employer-sponsored health \ncare.\n  I was a small businessman. Small business does not have the experts \nand specialists to interpret all of this, but they are going to have to \nabide by this stuff, too. See if you can follow this.\n  Here's what the bill language in S. 1052 actually says. On page 144 \nline 18, there is a subparagraph entitled, ``Cause of Action Against \nEmployers and Plan Sponsors Precluded.'' Nice title. This is \nsubparagraph (A). It literally begins with, ``Subject to subparagraph \n(B).'' In other words, the provision whose title implies that employers \nare protected from lawsuits begins with an exception tot hat \nprotection. As you can probably already guess, subparagraph (B) is \nentitled, ``Certain Causes of Action Permitted,'' which started out \nwith, ``Notwithstanding subparagraph (A),'' which means, despite the \nprotection from lawsuits they just said they were giving employers in \nthe preceding paragraph, here's how ``a cause of action may arise \nagainst an employer.'' We're still on page 145 still under subparagraph \n(B). On line 7, there is a reference back to page 140, where you're \nsent to paragraph (1), subparagraph (A), which is all captured under a \nnew subsection of ERISA, entitled ``Cause of Action Relating to \nProvision of Health Benefits.''\n  This subparagraph first identifies who would be subject to liability, \nsaying: ``In any case in which a person who is a fiduciary of a group \nhealth plan''--meaning an employer under ERISA--a health insurance \nissuer offering health insurance coverage in connection with the plan, \nor an agent of the plan, issuer or plan sponsor.'' Then the paragraph \ngoes onto page 140 and lists what actions would make that category of \nemployers and health plans liable, saying, ``upon consideration of a \nclaim for benefits of a participant or beneficiary under section 102 of \nthe Act, or upon review of a denial of such claim, fails to exercise \nordinary care in making a decision.'' Section 102 captures any \nconsideration of a claim for benefits--whether its written or oral--and \nsection 103 is the entire internal appeals process. Confusing? \nIntentional?\n  Then page 140 goes on to list the following actions with respect to \nmaking a decision. It reads, ``regarding whether an item or service is \ncovered under the terms and condition of the plan or coverage; \nregarding whether an individual is a participant or beneficiary who is \nenrolled under the terms and conditions of the plan or coverage; as to \nthe application of cost sharing requirements or the application of a \nspecific exclusion or express limitation on the amount, duration, or \nscope of coverage of items or services under the terms and condition of \nthe plan or coverage; or, otherwise fails to exercise ordinary care in \nthe performance of a duty under the terms and conditions of the plan \nwith respect to a participant or beneficiary. Then the employer must \nprove that none of those actions were the ``proximate cause'' of the \npatient's personal injury. If they can't, then the employer is liable \nfor economic and non-economic damages, and punitive damages of $5 \nmillion will be awarded, see page 153, line 23, for ``bad faith and \nflagrant disregard for the rights of participants.'' I am told that is \na fairly high legal standard to meet.\n  But then I remind myself that there is a band of trial lawyers right \nnow trying to sue health plans under Federal racketeering laws. That is \nwhat we use to prosecute mobsters. If I were an employer--particularly \na small employer--that kind of zeal by lawyers sure would not make me \nfeel any better, and trying to read this bill would not make me feel \nany better.\n  I am running a little low on breadcrumbs, but let me skip back for a \nminute to the ``liable actions'' listed on page 140. In particular, the \nlast one I mentioned, which refers to ``fails to exercise ordinary care \nin the performance of a duty under the terms and conditions of the \nplan.'' This phrase, ``terms and conditions of the plan,'' is defined \nin the bill on page 122, line 14--another page--as ``to include, with \nrespect to a group health plan or health insurance coverage, \nrequirements imposed under this title with respect to the plan or \ncoverage.''\n  Well, page 122 falls into title I of the bill. Title I of the bill \nincludes a plan's utilization review activities, which cover everything \nfrom disease management to quality-of-care decisions to cost-benefit \nanalysis; all claims-related activity, including internal and external \nreview; all of the patient protections, from allowing patients direct \naccess to the nearest emergency room to paying the cost of an \nemployee's participation in a clinical trial, and on, including nine \nmore separate patient protections; five additional rights for health \ncare providers, including a whistleblower protection provision, which I \nwill take issue with later; and a series of broad new definitions of \nprovider categories and plan functions, coverage of limited scope \nplans, which are the dental and eye care plans, and a blanket inclusion \nof any and all new regulations--listen to that; pay attention here \nbecause, besides all of the stuff actually in print, you are going to \nbe subject to any and all new regulations that the Secretary, who is \ncompletely at will to draft anything in relation to the act.\n  I would like to note that also included in title I is the overriding \nof existing State laws that deal with the standards in this bill. I \nguess that is now also a part of the health plan contract.\n  Confusing? Intentional? Now, after saying all of that, we need to tie \nall of these duties, obligations, named functions of the employer which \nagain is voluntarily providing health coverage, back to the original \ntrigger, into the employer liability section of this bill. If you \nremember, that is back on page 145. You will notice that it skips \naround. That is the subpart of subparagraph (B) I mentioned before, \nstarting on line 7, which says the employer is liable to the extent \nthere was direct participation by the employer or other plan sponsor in \nthe decision of the plan under section 102 of the act upon \nconsideration of a claim for benefits or under section 103 of such act \nupon review of a denial of a claim for benefits,\n\n[[Page S6540]]\n\nor to the extent there was direct participation by the employer or \nother plan sponsor in the failure described in clause (ii) of paragraph \n(1)(A)--paragraph (1)(A), of course, being when a plan ``fails to \nexercise ordinary care in the performance of a duty under the terms and \nconditions of the plan.''\n  Heard that before? You heard me read that definition a moment ago \nfrom page 122, line 14, as being essentially everything under the Sun \nwith which an employer has to comply.\n  OK, we are almost there. So bear with me. We still have a breadcrumb \nor two left here.\n  The employer liability provision in the bill goes on to further \ndefine direct participation, found on page 145, line 21, as meaning \n``in connection with a decision described in clause (i) or a failure \ndescribed in clause (ii).''\n\n  These are the two things I just described to you; remember, it was \neither the consideration of a claim for benefits or the failure to \nexercise ordinary care. Direct participation means, ``the actual making \nof a decision''--we all agree on that--``or the actual exercise of \ncontrol in making such a decision''--we all agree on that--``or in the \nconduct constituting the failure.''\n  We didn't know they were going to increase the decision so much, \nthough. It sounds to me like every activity in this bill legally \nrequires employers to do that which they are already legally bound to \ndo under the fiduciary obligations of ERISA, which under Federal law \nbusinesses have to meet, which is now included in this, and it would \nconstitute direct participation and, therefore, exposure to unlimited \nnew liability.\n  Now, the sponsors have tried to define what direct participation is \nnot. There are a whopping four things, all of which--and this is \nimportant--are conditioned by the clause found on page 146, line 12 and \nline 16, which reads: ``conduct that is merely collateral or precedent \nto the decision or failure.'' In other words, this so-called employer \nprotection only applies if any ``actual'' action by the employer \noccurred long before or away from the decision. I read that to mean \nthat if an attorney links any employer activity covered in the four \nexceptions to the lawsuit against the employer, then the ``exceptions'' \ndo not apply.\n  But let me tell you what they are anyway. Starting on page 146 and \ngoing to 147, they include, an employer's selection of health plan, or \nthird party administrator; an employer engaging in cost-benefit \nanalysis when choosing or maintaining a plan; the employer creation, \nmodification, or termination of the plan; the employer participation in \nbenefit design, and copayments, or limits on benefits. Show me an \nemployer that probably isn't doing all four of those things and I will \nshow you an employer that doesn't have a health plan. You have to do \nthose things; it is a business requirement. If you are going to pick a \nplan or a third party administrator, you probably have to have some \ninvolvement in that. You have to do some cost-benefit analysis. You \nhave to do at least the creation of the health plan, or you don't have \na health plan. It sounds like a lot of upfront paperwork as well. That \nmay be what it is all about, too. All other plan administration by an \nemployer is subject to liability. But then so are these functions if we \nare to apply the ``collateral or precedent'' limitation on the employer \nprotection I just referenced.\n  I mentioned this to show you that it isn't quite as easy as some \nmight be trying to purport here. This is seriously complicated, and it \nappears that around every corner in this bill there is an exception \nthat swallows the rule. And the exceptions purported to protect \nemployers are swallowed, too. There is no way anybody is going to \nconvince the American people this bill doesn't sue employers, and for \njust about anything.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 15 minutes.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield myself 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 1 more minute.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I am not a lawyer; I am an accountant, and \nI can tell you that this adds up to employers scaling back, even \ndropping the coverage they now provide. Is this how we propose to \nprotect patients? The problem, at the end of the day, is that there is \nno fairy tale for hard-working Americans who currently receive health \ncare from their employer. Instead, they are left with the nightmare of \nmore expensive care, reduced benefits, or, in the worst case, losing \naccess to care altogether. That is unacceptable for insured Americans. \nThe logical question is, How in creation does this address the problem \nof uninsured working Americans? I leave my colleagues to mull that \nover.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I yield myself 15 minutes off of the \ntime of the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you, Madam President. I thank my colleagues for \npresenting this bill on the floor. I appreciate taking up this topic--\nthe key topic facing the United States, the Government, and the health \ncare industry within this country.\n  I strongly believe and I strongly urge that this should have gone \nthrough a committee process so we could have had amendments taking \nplace and could have had this dealt with in depth in a committee. I \nthink that it did not is regretable, particularly on such a large piece \nof legislation that affects so many people. But that wasn't the choice \nof the majority that is running the floor. They decided not to go \nthrough that process, and so we are here as we are today.\n  I hope, since this bill did not go through the normal committee \nprocess, we can have an extended amendment process to improve the bill \nin substantial ways as we proceed through this debate and consideration \nof this key legislation affecting much of health care delivery in this \ncountry. Through a good, strong, open amendment process, we can, \nhopefully, at the end of the day, vote on this bill and have something \nwith which we are all pleased.\n  Having made those initial comments, I want to point out legitimate \nand serious concerns I have about the effects of this legislation on \npeople throughout the country.\n  Make no mistake about it, I shed no tears for the HMOs. My colleagues \nhave brought to the Senate Chamber for consideration some shocking \nphotographs and anecdotal information of treatment at its worst by the \nHMOs. Like everybody else who has heard these anecdotes and seen the \nphotographs, it offends my sensibilities.\n  We need to examine the organization of the health maintenance \norganizations established by the Congress over the past few decades and \nhow they were established and why they were established.\n  The truth of the matter is, over the past few decades Congress \ncreated and charged the health maintenance organizations with keeping \ndown the cost of health care, and the tool with which we have entrusted \nthem is a bureaucracy.\n  The truth of the matter is, using a bureaucracy to control a system \nis inefficient, many times difficult, unwieldy, and certainly not very \npersonal.\n  The truth of the matter is, patients and physicians are sick and \ntired of dealing with this unresponsive bureaucracy and its difficult \nsystem. We need to make changes to provide personalized decisionmaking \nin health care. We need to change the system Congress has created. We \nneed to make it work better. We need to do it in such a fashion that it \ndoes not drive up the cost to the point that we start increasing, \nagain, the number of insured in America.\n  There has pretty much been an iron rule on health care that as we \ndrive up cost, the number of insured goes down, and that is a policy \ntrend we do not want to cause with this bill. There are ways we can \namend it to reduce that overall cost factor to limit the drop in the \nnumber of insured.\n  We want people to get insurance. We want people to be insured. We do \nnot want people to be uninsured in this process. We can change HMOs to \nmake it a more personal decisionmaking process between patient and \nphysician so that they are the ones making the choices rather than a \nlarge, unresponsive bureaucracy.\n\n[[Page S6541]]\n\n  As the blues song goes, ``Before you accuse me . . . take a look at \nyourself.'' HMOs and private sector insurance are not the only ones who \nrely on a heavy-handed bureaucracy in the health care field. The truth \nis Medicare, the health insurance we are responsible for administering, \nhas been one of the most difficult bureaucracies in the Federal \nGovernment. If you want to talk about bureaucracy, let's talk about \nPPSs, DRGs, and NSFs. Let's talk about a system that tells physicians: \nProvide the care, and then we will tell you whether we are going to pay \nfor it or not.\n  HCFA is a bureaucracy that has gotten so out of control that this \nadministration has wisely decided they cannot reform it, they have to \ncompletely remake it and rename it. This is a bureaucracy unto itself \nthat is unresponsive. I get complaints on a regular basis. HCFA is \ngetting right up there with the IRS on complaints, and that is a \nbureaucracy, which we run, which manages health care in the country, \nwhich clearly needs fixing.\n\n  For the past several decades, this Nation has relied almost solely on \nbureaucracies of one type or another, either ones we run or others, to \nhold down the cost of health care. That is the heart of what we are \ndebating today: health care costs.\n  Many of us believe the solutions offered by some of my colleagues do \nnot adequately address this problem. We are going to drive that cost \nup, and the number of insured is going to go down. That is a genuine \nconcern of a number of people.\n  Who feels this way? Some of my colleagues have stated that the people \nare saying: You have a bureaucracy that has been unresponsive. Let's \nmake these changes and drive the cost up, not noting they are driving \nthe number of insured down in that process. We need to avoid that \nresult.\n  I want to read a letter my office received, as well as a number of \nother offices, on June 15, regarding who feels this way about health \ncare. This is a quote from this letter:\n\n       We urge Congress to oppose this legislation--\n\n  That is, the pending bill--\n\n     and avoid the dire consequences it would have on our \n     employer-based health care system.\n\n  The letter went on to say that the Kennedy-McCain Patients' Bill of \nRights--\n\n     would discourage employers from offering health care coverage \n     and make coverage more difficult for workers to afford.\n\n  Who signed that letter? It is interesting, not a single HMO appeared \non that letter. The letter came to my office signed by the National \nFederation of Independent Businesses, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \nAssociated Builders and Contractors, Printing Industries of America, \nBusiness Roundtable, and 14 other business associations representing \nvirtually everyone in this Nation who voluntarily provides health care \ncoverage to their employees and wants to continue to provide that \nhealth care coverage. They are saying: Do not change this in such a way \nthat we cannot afford to make these changes and they are going to drive \nus out of health care; don't do that.\n  We do not need to do that; we should not do that. We can amend this \nbill to make it so that does not happen.\n  I suggest my colleagues follow the Kansas tradition and take these \ngroups at their word.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has suggested the \nKennedy-McCain-Edwards bill will increase premiums for employer-\nsponsored health plans by an average of 4.2 percent, with a 1.7-percent \nincrease being passed through to workers.\n  What about the remaining 2.3 percent? CBO says 60 percent of the \nincrease would be offset by, among other things, ``purchasers switching \nto less expensive plans, cutting back on benefits, or dropping \ncoverage.''\n  Is that the conclusion we want to produce from this legislation? I \ncertainly do not think the directors and people who are putting forward \nthis bill want that conclusion, and yet that is what CBO is citing.\n  It is not just the CBO or national business organizations that have \nthis grave concern. On June 6, I received a letter from Harvey Young. \nHarvey owns Young's Welding, a small welding shop that has been in \nChanute, KS, since 1934. Harvey wrote this ``health care legislation \nwould be a disaster for small employers in the Nation.''\n  In addition, while they do not know it yet, the 3,200 Kansans and \nnearly 340,000 Americans who could lose some health insurance as a \nresult of this legislation are going to have a big problem with this \nbill.\n  We do not need to go there if we amend this legislation to reduce \nthose areas that will drive people from getting health insurance.\n  I understand it is not the intent of my colleagues to increase the \ncost of insurance and drive employers and workers out of the health \ninsurance marketplace. My friends are pure in their intentions to \naddress the problems that have arisen from the bureaucratic state of \nour health care economy.\n  The cases of denied coverage they bring before the Senate are \ndisturbing to all of us. However, I hope my colleagues will concede \nthat the concerns we raise about the manner in which this bill \naddresses the problem are just as genuine.\n  Many are concerned adding new liability and legal cost to an already \nlarge cost of health care will create problems in the system. We are \nworried by reports that 44 insurers have pulled out of Mississippi \nciting large jury verdicts as the reason. Considering that the cost of \nhealth insurance has risen for 7 straight years, and considering that \nlast year the cost of insurance was up a whopping average of 13 \npercent, I hope supporters of this legislation will understand my \nconcerns.\n  No Senator has risen in defense of bureaucratic health care either of \nthe United States through HCFA, or health maintenance organizations. \nNone has risen to defend the indefensible actions of some HMOs that \nhave denied necessary coverage to a child; nor shall we, nor should \nanyone. Rather, we rise to express concern about a bill that could \nresult in more harm than good in driving up the number of uninsureds in \nAmerica rather than giving more coverage, and actually at the end of \nthe day producing less.\n  On Tuesday, addressing a rally in front of the Capitol, my colleagues \nexpressed there was room for compromise on this issue. They expressed \nthe hope we could send a bill to the President that the President would \nbe able to sign. I share my colleagues' hope and dream we will be able \nto do that. Generally, as we saw with the historic education package we \npassed last week, the bulk of the work reaching compromise is done in \nthe committee process. However, due to the circumstances the Senate now \nfinds itself, the majority has decided that may not be possible. Such \nis the privilege of the majority. However, it is my hope before we move \nto final passage, we can work out a bill to address some of the \nproblems our Nation's health care economy is truly facing without \nwrecking the Nation's health care economy in total, and without driving \nup the number of uninsureds.\n  At that point, we will have a bill I can support and I believe the \nPresident can sign and, hopefully, we can be proud of in providing more \nhealth care coverage to Americans, not less. We are not there yet.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  I listened with great interest to the points made by my friend from \nWyoming, Senator Enzi, on the issues regarding employer responsibility. \nIt was a good discussion. I hope he will have an opportunity to read \nwhat the President of the United States urged Members to do: Only \nemployers who retain responsibility for making final medical decisions, \nshould be subject to the suit.\n  I know what he is against; I am not quite sure what he is for.\n  Here is the principle to which we are committed, and to which the \nPresident is committed. If he has some problems, or suggestions on how \nto achieve it, we welcome that. We strongly support what the President \nhas stated is his objective in terms of employer responsibility. We \nwill have more of an opportunity to address that issue.\n  I listened to just about every speaker from that side talk about \ntheir concern for the growing number of the uninsured. That is \nmentioned in every speech. I yield to no one in my strong\n\n[[Page S6542]]\n\ncommitment towards getting coverage for the uninsured. However, I \nremind them of their own priorities. They believe the best way to \nextend coverage is to try and provide tax credits and tax incentives. I \nhave a real concern about that because the people who don't have that \ninsurance don't pay the level of taxes to benefit from the credits or \nthe deduction.\n  We can debate that another day. However, 75 to 80 percent of those \nwho do not have insurance will not benefit. It will benefit others who \nhave the insurance, but it will not extend the coverage.\n  Nonetheless, that is a debatable point. The Republicans had \nprovisions in their budget to extend coverage. They dropped them all. \nThey dropped them all in conference with the House of Representatives. \nThey didn't fight for those provisions. They fought for greater tax \nbreaks for the wealthiest individuals in the country, but they cast \nthose provisions aside. I hope they do not continue raising this issue \nin the Senate. I wish they had fought for this issue in their \nconference. They let those provisions go. That bill had anywhere from \n$60 to $70 billion in provisions to extend coverage when it left, and \nthose provisions were wiped out.\n  If they were committed to it, we want to know what they intend to do \nnow. It is a nonissue because, as was pointed out yesterday by the \nSenator from North Carolina and others, when the States have enacted a \nstrong Patient's Bill of Rights, the actual number of the uninsured has \ngone down. The total number of insured has gone up. That is true in \nCalifornia, that is true in Georgia, and that is true in Texas. They \ncan use whichever argument they want, but they have to get their facts \nstraight. The facts are, even in the States which passed tough HMO \nbills, there have not been the increases that some expressed concern \nabout. We have seen that expansion of coverage to the uninsured has not \nbeen their priority. These are effectively smokestacks. We want to keep \nfocused on the target.\n  I listened to my good friend, Senator Brownback, talk about the \nBusiness Roundtable and their concerns about the legislation. He feels \nthat we ought to heed their concerns. We heard their concerns when we \nwere dealing with the Family and Medical Leave Act. They said it would \ncost anywhere from $25 to $27 billion; we cannot do it. We will lose; \nwe will have more people laid off; it will be the end of the free \nenterprise system, they said.\n  Guess what. It is working. We intend to try and expand it. It has \nmade a big difference. It still has not done all the things many who \nsupported the program desired. There are too many workers who will not \ntake the family and medical leave because they lose their pay. They \nlose pay because they are always caught between the child who is sick, \nthe parent who is desperately ill, and taking the family and medical \nleave to tend to that. These are hard-working Americans who need that \npaycheck every week, and many of them cannot take the leave. Most other \nindustrial nations have paid family and medical leave. We don't.\n\n  The Business Roundtable opposed that legislation, but it is working \ntoday. I don't hear a single Republican trying to repeal it. They are \nnot out there trying to repeal it. Then we had the Kassebaum-Kennedy \nbill to provide portability on health insurance for disabled. We heard \npremiums would go up from 25 percent to 31 percent, and that this would \nbe the end of the employer-based health insurance program. It has not \nhappened. It has gone up 2.7 percent over a 3-year-period, which was \nthe estimate at the time that was used by those who supported the \nprogram. The other estimates were widely off base.\n  Regarding the increase in the minimum wage, the last time we had an \nincrease in the minimum wage they said we would lose 400,000 workers. \nIn the first quarter, we increased employment by 300,000 workers. They \nwere wrong. They said it would add to rates of inflation, and we had \nthe greatest rate of growth in the country. They were wrong. Three for \nthree, they were wrong.\n  Rather than listening to their theories, look at what is happening in \nthe country today. Look at the States where they have a tough, \neffective, Patients' Bill of Rights and what has been the result of the \nemployer-based system. We find still that the number of insured or \nuninsured is not related to this issue. The increase in the numbers \ncovered are primarily a result of the expansion of the CHIP program. It \nhas been a modest change.\n  Second, there have not been great abuses of employers' liability. The \nmost recent example is the State of California which passed a very \ngood, effective, tough, HMO bill that has been in effect 9 months. \nThere has not been a single case that has actually gone to trial. There \nhave been over 200 cases that have gone to appeal, and they have been \ndecided 65 percent for the HMO, and the rest for the patient. The HMOs, \nas well as the consumer groups, are incredibly impressed by the way it \nis working. That is what we want this bill to do.\n  It is a favored technique around here: If you are opposed, distort \nit, misrepresent it, exaggerate different provisions on it, draw up all \nkinds of smokescreens and red herrings. But these distortions won't \nwork because we have practical experiences to draw upon. We can see in \nthe States how this can work, how we can function, and what the impact \nwill be.\n  I will spend a few minutes talking about what this bill is about. \nThere are efforts to bring the Senate off message on this but it is \nimportant to remember what the debate is about. It is not about \nlawyers. It is not about insurance companies. It is about patients. It \nis about people who are mothers, daughters, fathers and sons, sisters \nand brothers. It is about families all over the country who will some \nday face the challenge of serious illness and deserve the best in \nhealth care. They deserve the same care that all Members of the Senate \nwould want for themselves and their loved ones. Too many of those \nfamilies are denied the care they need and deserve because of the \nabuses of HMOs and the other insurance companies.\n  The legislation we are considering today will end those abuses, and, \nas we enter this debate, I would like to spend a few moments talking \nabout the importance of three of its provisions--access to needed \nspecialty care, access to clinical trials, and access to needed \nprescription drugs. In each of these areas, needed care has too often \nbeen delayed and denied by insurance companies that are more interested \nin profits than in patients. In each of these areas, the opponents of \nour bill want to create loopholes that will make these guarantees only \nan empty promise.\n  Access to specialty care when serious and complex illnesses strike is \na critical element of good health care. Denial of access to needed \nspecialists is also one of the most common abuses in the current \nsystem. According to a survey by the University of California School of \nPublic Health, 35,000 patients every day are denied specialty \nreferrals. One of those patients was little Sarah Pederson of San \nMateo, California. This is her picture.\n  Sarah was born with a brain tumor. When she was three, it became \nclear that she needed aggressive treatment to save her life, including \nbrain biopsies and chemotherapy. Her neurosurgeon knew that Sarah \nneeded to be seen by a doctor specializing in brain tumors in \nchildren--and there was no qualified doctor in the plan. When Sarah's \nmother, Brenda, a nurse, asked to go outside the network, her HMO said, \n``No.'' The HMO told her, ``We're not giving you second best, we're \ngiving you what's on the list.'' After months of fighting with the HMO, \nit finally agreed to let Brenda see someone qualified to treat her \ncondition.\n  When Sarah finally got to the right doctor, her chemotherapy began. \nEveryone knows chemotherapy causes severe nausea and vomiting. The HMO \ndenied Sarah's $54 prescription for antinausea medication, because it \nwas ``too expensive.'' Finally, Sarah's family was able to switch \ninsurance companies and get proper care for their child.\n  So there you have it. Two parents facing one of the worst nightmares \na family can have--a child with a cancer--and instead of being able to \nfocus on dealing with the terrible stress and working to give their \nchild all the comfort and assistance they can--they have to spend their \nenergy fighting with an insurance company simply to get the child to an \nappropriate specialist. Sarah was lucky, in the sense\n\n[[Page S6543]]\n\nthat the HMO's delays did not kill her. But what a burden for her \nfamily to face. What a travesty of common decency. Passage of our \nlegislation will assure that every family with a child who has cancer \ncan get the specialty care they need without dangerous delays.\n  Women with cancer face special burdens. They must cope with a dread--\nand often deadly--disease. They need prompt specialty care. And often, \ntheir best hope for a cure or precious extra months or years of life is \nparticipation in a clinical trial. But, too often, both are lacking.\n  In one of the many forums we held on the issue of access to \nspecialists for cancer patients, we heard from Dr. Mirtha Casimir, a \ndistinguished Texas oncologist. Dr. Casimir talked about the \nheartbreaking stories of cancer patients whose HMOs delay and deny \naccess to specialty care--often until it is too late. She said that \nwhen she gets a patient whose cancer has progressed substantially from \ninitial diagnosis to the time they are allowed to seek needed specialty \ncare, she often flips to the front of the chart--and nine times out of \nten the insurer is an HMO. Every centimeter a cancer grows can mean the \ndifference between a good chance at life--and the likelihood of death. \nEvery centimeter represents potentially devastating--and avoidable--\npain, suffering, and death for a patient and a family. Dr. Casimir's \nmessage was clear: pass the Patients' Bill of Rights so that more \ncancer patients will not die needlessly.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleagues who wish to speak.\n  I think we have about 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Twelve minutes. I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia and 6 minutes to the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair. I thank Senator Kennedy for his \ncourageous leadership with Senators Edwards and McCain, Senator \nDaschle, and others in fighting for this bipartisan bill.\n  Mr. President, this is a new day in the Senate. We promised a new day \nwhen we saw the leadership change and we meant it. We have this bill in \nfront of us because we want to do something to help the American \npeople. There is no more important issue than this one. The American \npeople have been waiting too long to have their grievances addressed.\n  Our bill offers real protection to those patients. It is in fact \nbipartisan. The compromises have been made, and when the President says \nhe will veto it, I say to the people in this country: Do not stand by \nsilently. This bill protects you against the abuses of the HMOs. The \nPresident stands with the HMOs. We here pushing for this bill stand \nwith you, the people. And I keep coming back to that because the HMOs \noppose our bill and they support the Bush principles.\n  Let me tell you why it is so important to pass this bill. Every day, \n35,000 patients do not have access to the specialty care they need. \nEvery day, the delay results in 10,000 patients being denied the \ndiagnostic tests they need.\n  Let me talk about a couple of cases in the time I have. One such case \nis that of Joyce Ching from Agoura, CA.\n  Mr. President, 5 years ago I told her story--5 years ago when we \nshould have passed this bill. I am going to tell her story again.\n  In the summer of 1994, Joyce got sick. She suffered from severe \nabdominal pain. She could not get out of bed to play with her son. She \ngoes to her HMO, and the doctor says: we don't need any tests; change \nyour diet; something is wrong with your diet. So Joyce changes her \ndiet. She is in agony. She calls again and again. The doctor says, oh, \njust give this diet a chance to work. Still, she begged him for tests. \nShe was afraid maybe something would happen, that she would not be able \nto have another child.\n\n  Finally she receives the referral to a gastroenterologist she had \nasked for months before, but it was too late. Joyce was in the late \nstages of colon cancer, and there was nothing anyone could do for her. \nThirty-four years old. Why did it happen? If you look at the structure \nof the HMO, what happened was they capped her monthly expenses at \n$27.94. Why? Because she was only 34; actuarial tables said she was \nhealthy. And the HMO said to her clinic, if you pay any more than that \nfor that patient a month, you will get ``fined.'' You will have to pay \nfor it at the end of the year. So the effort to keep the costs down \ncost Joyce her life. It took away a mother from a little boy. This bill \nwill stop that because this bill will allow a referral to a specialist. \nThis bill will allow us to make sure you see the doctor that you need.\n  How about the story of Sarah Pedersen of San Mateo, CA, born with a \nbrain tumor? When she turned 3 years old, the doctor determined that \nshe needed to see a doctor who had expertise in brain tumors in \nchildren. Now, I have to say something. I am a little adult. I am only \nabout 5 feet tall. Some even question if that is exactly accurate. I am \nnot a child, though. A child is different. They are little and they are \ndifferent. Their bodies are changing and growing. Their hormone levels \nare different and they need specialized care. So her doctor said she \nneeded the expertise of a doctor who specialized in brain tumors in \nchildren.\n  When Sarah's parents tried to get the appropriate referral, here is \nwhat they were told by the HMO: What difference does it make? Cancer is \ncancer.\n  And by the way, I had the same incident in another case in San Mateo, \na little girl who had a Wilms' tumor, which is a tumor of the kidney, \nand the HMO again said: We don't have a pediatric surgeon who deals \nwith cancer. Just go see the surgeon who deals with adults.\n  Had they ever operated on a child before? No. So Sarah's parents \ntried to get the appropriate referral, and they could not do it. Now, \nfinally after too long a period, this little child with a brain tumor \nwas allowed to see a specialist and her chemotherapy began. And as many \nof you are aware, my friends, chemotherapy causes severe nausea and \nvomiting, and the little girl suffered greatly. But when her parents \ntried to get the medicine to quell the nausea and the vomiting, Sarah \nwas denied a $54 prescription because it was ``too expensive,'' says \nthe HMO. A little girl of 3 years old is vomiting; she is nauseous; she \nis sick; she cannot get a prescription through the HMO.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that I be given 1 additional \nminute and Senator Nelson 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. We will give 2 additional minutes to the Republicans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend and I will talk even faster.\n  This HMO that denied a $54 prescription for a very sick little girl \npaid its chief executive officer $895 million in a merger.\n  I ask you, where is the justice and the fairness in this? In her \nbattle with cancer she is denied hope with a $54 prescription.\n  One time during their battle, Sarah was denied a dose of a common \nchemotherapy drug, by her HMO because the HMO clerk did not know the \ncomputer code for the drug. Do you want people other than doctors \nmaking medical decisions about the fate of your loved ones?\n  Luckily, her parents were able to switch insurance plans in the \nmiddle of their daughter's medical crisis. They believe that if they \nhad not had this option that Sarah never would have made it.\n  Sarah is now eight years old, but she still has a tumor and continues \nto be monitored.\n  Or take the story of cancer patient, Ed Mycek of La Quinta, \nCalifornia. In 1997, Ed was diagnosed with prostate cancer. He \ndiscussed treatment options with his doctor and together they decided \nthat the best option was a proton and 3-D conformal radiation \ntreatment.\n  His doctors then contacted the insurer about the treatment. The \ninsurer agreed to pay for the full treatment and said that the \nauthorization was on the way to the facility. But the authorization \nnever arrived. When Ed contacted the insurance company about the delay, \nhe was told that their decision had been reversed because the treatment \nwas experimental.\n\n[[Page S6544]]\n\n  Patients that undergo this form of radiation treatment have a 98 \npercent chance of recovery, vs. the 83 percent recovery rate associated \nwith prostate surgery.\n  After weeks of tossing and turning, Ed decided to pay for the \ntreatment up front in an attempt to save his own life. Ed survived, but \nhe now faces a huge financial burden as a result of his insurance \ncompany's unwillingness to pay for his treatment.\n  The stories I have just relayed to you are just a few examples of the \ntragedies that my constituents have endured as a result of healthcare \nin this country. They are strong reminders of why this nation needs a \nPatients' Bill of Rights now more than ever.\n  I believe that the McCain-Edwards bill offers the best possible \noption for preventing these kinds of senseless tragedies from occurring \nin the future.\n  The McCain-Edwards bill would provide coverage to 190 million \nAmericans, including those in state and local government-sponsored \nplans and church plans.\n  McCain-Edwards provides access to specialists even if such care isn't \ncovered by a patient's plan.\n  It also provides patients with other essential protections, like \naccess to specialty care, women's health care services, emergency \ncare--including emergency ambulance services, needed drugs, and \nclinical trials.\n  The bill bans the use of financial incentives to health care \nproviders to limit medically necessary services.\n  It also prohibits plans from providing compensation to employees for \nencouraging denials.\n  It holds HMOs accountable, and permits a patient to sue in state and \nfederal court without preempting those states with laws regarding caps \non damages.\n  The bill allows a participant to designate a pediatrician as the \nprimary care provider for a child.\n  It allows a woman to obtain gynecological and pregnancy related care \nfrom an OB/GYN without requiring a referral or authorization by a \nprimary care doctor.\n  McCain-Edwards provides for inpatient hospital care for a patient \nfollowing a mastectomy, lumpectomy or lymph node dissection for the \ntreatment of breast cancer.\n  It bans health care plans from prohibiting or restricting medical \nproviders from freely communicating with their patients regarding their \nmedical care and treatment.\n  The McCain-Edwards bill requires the prompt payment of claims with \nrespect to covered benefits and contains important whistleblower \nprotections.\n  Nearly every doctors' and nurses' association and patients' rights \ngroup in the country supports a strong, enforceable Patients' Bill of \nRights.\n  S. 1052 is supported by some 300 consumer and health care provider \nadvocates.\n  It has garnered this support precisely because it represents a \nbalanced and even-handed approach and because it will ensure patient \nsafety and health plan accountability without significantly raising \nemployer costs or health plan premiums.\n  In conclusion, the American people have waited far too long for a \nPatients' Bill of Rights. We have been debating this issue for 5 years. \nAnd far too many of our people are suffering as a result.\n  I'm all for having a fair and open debate here in the Senate on this \nissue. The American people expect no less of us.\n  But what the American people do not deserve and will not tolerate is \nan unnecessarily protracted debate cluttered with offers of ``poison \npill'' provisions intended to cripple passage of this critically needed \nlegislation. Unfortunately, I fear that this is exactly what will \nhappen--a filibuster by amendment, as amendment after amendment after \namendment is offered in an attempt to kill this bill, while its \nopponents talk about compromise.\n  In reality, this bill is already a compromise. A balanced and fair \ncompromise. Here's why:\n  It strengthens protections for employers, ensuring that they are not \nliable unless they have participated directly in a health plan \ndecision; it increases a state's flexibility, allowing it to maintain \nor develop its own patient protection laws if they are substantially \nequivalent to those in S. 1052; and it protects a patient's right to \nsue for damages in State and federal court, while including key \ncompromises on liability.\n  The American people not only deserve a strong, enforceable Patient's \nBill of Rights. They deserve this bill to be passed as swiftly and as \nfairly as possible.\n  Today is truly a new day in the Senate because today we have the \nopportunity to deliver on a promise--a promise to help our people live \nlonger, healthier lives free from the horrors of red tape and \nlitigation. A promise to make it a little easier for Americans to get \nthe help they need from their doctors at the times when they need it \nthe most.\n  Today we have a chance not only to deliver on the promise that we \nhave made to our constituents--our promise to take up this bill--but a \nchance to restore the promise of health care in this country.\n  I say to my friend in the chair, who is such a fighter, that this is \nabout why we are here, who we are, whom we represent, for whom we \nfight, and in whom we believe.\n  Let's pass this bipartisan bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support \nof this bipartisan Patients' Bill of Rights. I rise on behalf of \nthousands of Florida consumers who would like to see control over their \nmedical care returned to their doctors.\n  As the former elected insurance commissioner in Florida, I have \ntalked with many of these consumers. And I've seen first-hand what some \nof the big insurance companies will do to them, if you let them.\n  For too long, these same insurers have killed efforts in the Congress \nto hold them accountable.\n  These lobbying efforts would merely be tiresome, if it were not for \nthe real life horror stories that prove the industry's claims that this \nis a bad bill are false claims.\n  Over the last two days, all of us have heard the horror stories from \nmany of these consumers--stories of HMOs denying care to sick patients; \nstories of accountants, not doctors, making decisions about medical \ntreatment.\n  Some of these stories involve injury, harm, and even death.\n  Let me tell you about a couple of examples from Florida.\n  One 62-year-old south Florida woman began complaining of headaches \nand was referred to a neurologist, who ordered a CT scan and MRI of her \nbrain.\n  The HMO refused the request.\n  The doctor persisted, but to no avail.\n  The appeals went on for 6 weeks, until the woman was admitted into \nthe hospital paralyzed on her left side.\n  There, she underwent a CT scan that revealed a tumor the size of an \norange. She was immediately taken into surgery. She remains paralyzed. \nTwo days after the surgery, her HMO finally approved the procedures \nrequested by her doctor.\n  Sadly, current law only allows this patient to sue her HMO for the \ncost of the scan. She has no other legal recourse.\n  I will give you another example. A Pensacola woman was told by her \nHMO that she must see a network physician for a referral to a special \nhospital that could treat her rare cancer.\n  After switching to this new doctor, who concurred with the need for \ntreatment, the HMO again denied her coverage.\n  Her medical bills are expected to reach $180,000. And despite her \nlife-threatening illness, her HMO continues to deny full coverage.\n  The newspapers are full of such stories. And the common denominator \nseems to be that none of these patients have any recourse against their \nHMO.\n  This is unacceptable.\n  Medical decisions should be made by doctors, not accountants. HMO \naccountants are making life-threatening decisions, and the patients are \nsuffering the consequences.\n  These stories from Florida illustrate the need for Federal \nlegislation.\n  We must stop the practice of denying care, denying claims and putting \nprofits ahead of patients.\n  The legislation we are finally debating lets people and their \ndoctors--not HMO accountants--decide on the best medical treatments, \nnot the cheapest.\n  Sick patients should not have to battle an illness and their HMO at \nthe same time.\n\n[[Page S6545]]\n\n  The issue before us in this debate is simple: either you are for \nprotecting patients, or you are for maintaining the status quo, which \nprotects HMOs.\n  I support this legislation because it provides patients with the \nprotections they currently lack. This bill guarantees access to \nnecessary medical care.\n  It puts the decisionmaking back in the hands of doctors.\n  Under this legislation, patients can participate more easily in life-\nsaving clinical trials.\n  Chronically ill patients can receive the care they need because \ndoctors will determine what is necessary medical treatment.\n  Patients will be able to change doctors without facing delays because \nthey will have more choices.\n  Under this bill, patients will receive prescription drugs on a timely \nbasis.\n  Doctors and patients won't be bound by red tape, and patients will \nget the drugs prescribed by their physicians, not their HMO \naccountants.\n  Patients also will be able to designate a specialist as a primary \ncare provider. This means that a cancer patient could use a radiologist \nas a primary care physician.\n  For sick patients, this makes sense.\n  This Patients' Bill of Rights also allows someone to seek emergency \nroom care, without first contacting their health plan.\n  This bill also addresses another critical issue; that is, financial \nrewards for doctors.\n  HMOs will no longer be able to offer financial incentives to doctors \nwho limit care.\n  This legislation also prevents HMOs from punishing doctors who \nadvocate on behalf of their patients. By putting the medical decisions \nback in the doctor's hands, this bill protects the doctor-patient \nrelationship.\n  As expected, insurance companies and managed-care companies are \nlining up against the proposal that consumers should be able to sue \nthem for harmful treatment.\n  Insurers say the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill will drive up premiums, \nincrease the number of people without insurance and cause employers to \ndrop coverage for their employees.\n  In Texas, where a right-to-sue law has been in effect since 1997, \nit's been reported that premiums actually declined last year.\n  Further, the Congressional Budget Office says that under this reform \nlegislation, litigation costs related to the patients' right to sue \nwould increase less than 1 percent during 5 years.\n  I ask the assistant Democratic leader if there is any chance for any \nadditional time so I can complete my statement.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, we need to get to the amendment \nprocess. How much more time do you need?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I think I can conclude in 1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Florida be extended another 2 minutes, and the minority be \nextended 2 minutes, which will give them an extra 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Democratic leader.\n  Mr. President, I end by saying our health care delivery system is \nfailing, and it is failing doctors and nurses and providers as well as \nthe patients.\n  Only recently I learned of a doctor in Boca Raton who has started \ncharging his existing patients a $1,500 annual membership fee in order \nto continue his patients' medical care. This is outrageous, and it is \nsymptomatic of the need for reform of the entire health insurance \nsystem.\n  Clearly, we need reform. This Patients' Bill of Rights is just a \nfirst step, but a necessary step, toward health care reform. We cannot \nafford to miss the opportunity. We cannot allow the special interests \nto stall and delay any longer. We must act now. The people deserve no \nless.\n  I thank you, Mr. President, for your indulgence, and I thank the \nDemocratic leader very much for the additional time so I could conclude \nmy statement on this very important piece of legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask that I be yielded 10 minutes of the \ntime of the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we have been involved now all week--and, I \nam sure, will be involved for some time longer--on the Patients' Bill \nof Rights. It is an issue that is very broad. Quite frankly, there are \ndifferent points of view. I cringe a little bit when I constantly hear \nfrom the other side of the aisle that special interests are what is \nguiding it. I have to tell you, if there are special interests on one \nside, there are special interests on both sides. But I really do not \nthink that.\n  There are different points of view as to how we best help deliver \nhealth services. I am getting a little weary of this special interest \nidea, when it is perfectly legitimate for us to have different ideas \nabout how we do it. That is what this is all about. I think we ought to \nmaybe go back to some basics and talk about it a little bit.\n  I do not think it ought to be a political issue. I do not think \npeople on this side, who are concerned about driving up the costs or \nwho are concerned about having an excess of litigation, are driven by \nspecial interests. They have views on that. I respect that. And I \nrespect it on both sides.\n  We have been dealing with a very complicated issue. In fact, this \nissue has been around the Senate now at least for 3 years. We have \npassed bills very similar, as a matter of fact, to what we are talking \nabout now. We have tried to put them together with bills over in the \nHouse and have not succeeded in doing that.\n  So there are differences of view in how you do it. It seems to me \nthat it might be useful for us to take a little bit of time to go back \nto some fairly basic things and, I guess, examine, more than anything \nelse, what our goals are, what it is, when this is over, we want to \nhave accomplished.\n  I get concerned sometimes that we get so involved in the details of \neverything, and get argumentative about this and about that, when \nreally the purpose ought to be to achieve certain goals when we are \nthrough. I think from time to time we should go back and sort of \nrefresh ourselves as to what our goal is. That would be very important. \nEverybody in this body wants to promote and provide for better health \nservice. Is there a question about that? Of course not. Everybody wants \nto do that.\n  I argue a little bit with the idea that our health care is not good. \nI think our health care is quite good, as a matter of fact. Could it be \nbetter? Of course. Should we have a Patients' Bill of Rights? Of \ncourse. We ought to ensure that people receive what they are entitled \nto receive.\n  Everybody wants patients to be treated by medical providers and not \nby accountants. We agree on that, certainly. Everybody wants to pass a \nbill that will improve the fairness and ensure that patients receive \nwhat they are entitled to under their health contract. I say \n``contract'' because I want to remind ourselves that those of us who \nhave insurance buy a service. That service is defined, and what we \nshould expect to receive is the service that we have purchased, the \nservice that is in that contract.\n  From the conversation that goes on in this Chamber, sometimes I get \nthe notion that if this bill passes everything in health care will be \nprovided. That is not the case. What this does is seek to ensure that \nwhat you are entitled to under your insurance is provided, and the \ndefinitions are made by medical providers and not by attorneys. I think \nall of us would support that.\n\n  There are quite different views, of course. Indeed, that is \nlegitimate. That is why we have debate. That is why we have discussion.\n  Yesterday we had a little back and forth on whether we were holding \nthis bill up. I do not think it has been held up at all. It is a very \ncomplicated issue. We talked about it all day. We should talk about it. \nWe need to know what is in the bill. The newest bill was only put in \nthe Record on Tuesday. So it is quite a healthy bill and, in fact, \nneeds to be reviewed. That is what we are doing. Should we stall it? Of \ncourse not. But we should have a thorough discussion about it.\n  What are our goals? I guess one of the obvious ones, as I mentioned, \nis to ensure, to the best of our ability, that\n\n[[Page S6546]]\n\nwhatever you are entitled to in your insurance coverage is made \navailable to you. I think, along with that, we ought to say: made \navailable to you as quickly as possible. This idea that somehow you \nfeel as if you are being held up by some other decision, that you have \nto go to court to figure it out--I can tell you what, it may be a long \ntime before you come to that decision, so there needs to be a method \nand methodology, of course, for coming to a nonbiased third party \ndecision before you go to court. I think that should be one of them.\n  What are some of the techniques that we ought to have? That is what \nwe are really talking about. Are we talking about an independent \nmedical appeal? It seems to me that makes a lot of sense. Or do we \ncontinue to talk about the fact that you have to go to court? Court is \nnot a very satisfactory remedy for some kind of an argument in terms of \nhealth benefits. You usually need those resolved more quickly than \nwould come from that.\n  I think we have to talk a little about the costs. We talk all the \ntime about the cost of insurance going up. We had what we called a \nseries of 20/20 meetings in Wyoming, trying to get a vision of where we \nwanted to be over time, so that the decisions we make in the interim \ncould help, hopefully, to get us there.\n  I recall in one of the meetings--one of the last meetings we had in \nCasper, WY--the big emphasis was on small employers that couldn't \nafford insurance. Part of that is insurance. Part of that is the cost \nof health care, of course.\n  So I guess my point is, health care can be the best in the world, but \nif we can't afford it, and it is out of our reach because it is \nunaffordable, then we have not accomplished a great deal.\n  One of our goals ought to be to find ways to keep the costs of health \ncare within a manageable range so that people can indeed take advantage \nand participate. We need to ensure that the insurance coverage used by \nmany people--maybe most people--comes from their employer, that it is \npart of their job benefits. There are some disadvantages to that, of \ncourse. That is one of the reasons we find ourselves where we are with \nHMOs to some extent. The employees do not normally have much input into \nwhat kind of coverage they have. If the coverage is not what they \nchoose, then that is something between them and the employer.\n  But we need to make sure that we don't price, particularly small \nbusinesses, out of that coverage that people have become accustomed to \nand, indeed, is really a better way to provide it. The more we can \nbring people together, large employers, makes insurance coverage \neasier. The idea of health insurance was to bring together a number of \npeople into a group so that those who are healthy and those who are a \nlittle less healthy could share the costs.\n  Again, in my experience, I remember the Farm Bureau in Wyoming \nstarted Blue Cross. And after a little bit, we found that generally \nagricultural people were a little older and the costs that we had were \nhigher. Our least expensive participants were finding cheaper insurance \nsomewhere else and were selecting against us. That didn't work. So you \nneed to have larger groups that employers help provide.\n  These are some of the things that are part of this. We act like it \ndoesn't matter what the system is, that we can make these changes and \nthey will fix it. We do have to be a little more aware of how this \nthing is handled and what is going on.\n  Again, we want employers to continue to provide insurance, but we \nhave to ensure that they are not subject to all kinds of litigation, \nall kinds of liability. That is not clear in the bill. We hear from one \nside that it is one way; we hear from the other side that it is another \nway. What is our goal? Is our goal that we should, to the extent \npossible, eliminate the liability from employers in terms of them \ncarrying and providing insurance? It seems to me that ought to be one \nof the results we seek.\n  There are lots of pretty basic issues that we need to address and \nthen take a look at the details to see if, in fact, those details are \ngoing to produce the kinds of a outcomes for which we are looking.\n  Again, we ought to try to make certain that every patient, every \ncovered person gets those things they are entitled to under their \ncontract. Certainly that is what we need to do. We need to find the \nsimplest, easiest, least expensive technique for ensuring that that is \nthe way that it is done. We need, along with that, to ensure that we do \nnot have an excessive cost which causes people to stop providing \ninsurance and that we have a higher number of uninsureds than we now \nhave.\n  In order to do that, we have to make sure that unless there is an \ninvolvement in that decision with regard to the contract, employers \nshould not be liable.\n  Those are the kinds of things we hear from the sponsors of each of \nthese bills. I appreciate the opportunity to talk on it. I hope we will \nmove forward. I hope we end up with a bill that will provide the \nprovisions we seek.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 10 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, the Senate has begun to consider \nsweeping legislation which, if passed and enacted, will have \nsignificant consequences for all Americans and our health care system. \nThis is an unprecedented opportunity to frame the debate for improving \nthe quality of health care in this country.\n  As most Americans know, we here in America have the best medical care \nin the world. The question is how to make that excellent care \naccessible and affordable for all Americans.\n  We have an excellent health care system in our Nation, yet there are \nthose who are not able to get good care when they need it. And, there \nare many in our Nation who tax and over-use the system. Somewhere \nbetween the excellence of our medical procedures and the demands placed \nupon them, we have a problem with delivery.\n  In the debate now underway, we will be grappling with big questions. \nHow do we make that excellent care available to everyone? Who gets the \ncare? Who pays? Who is accountable? Those are the questions that need \nto be answered. Common sense demands we act reasonably in answering \nthose questions.\n  The debate is about the American right to have access to the best \nhealth care available. It is not a Republican or Democrat issue. It is \na national issue as important as any we face, and to keep score now \ndoes not address our Nation's best interest.\n  Let me be very clear: the best thing we can do for Americans is to \nensure, and when possible, expand their access to quality, affordable \nhealth care. Let's use the debate on the differing proposals pending \nbefore us to work toward this goal.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, this week the Senate began discussion of \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights, a long overdue bill which patient \nadvocates have fought to pass for nearly 5 years. I am disappointed \nthat we were not able to move directly to a full discussion of the bill \nearlier this week as Majority Leader Daschle attempted to do, but I am \npleased that we finally began this critically important discussion. I \nalso want to commend the distinguished Senate Majority Leader Daschle \nfor his leadership in bringing this crucial legislation to the floor \nand making this top priority legislation his first directive as Senate \nMajority Leader.\n  The Senate begins debate of a bipartisan bill that was introduced in \nboth the House and Senate which covers all Americans and holds HMOs \naccountable when they make medical decisions. I am proud to be \ncosponsoring the Senate Bipartisan Patient Protection Act which is \nsponsored by Senators McCain, Edwards, and Kennedy. Approximately 500 \nprovider and patients' rights groups have endorsed this bipartisan \nlegislation which achieves overwhelming support because it represents a \nbalanced approach to ensuring patient safety and health plan \naccountability without significantly raising health plan premiums or \nemployer costs.\n\n[[Page S6547]]\n\n  The last time the Senate debated this legislation was in July of \n1999. At that time, the Senate ended up passing a much weaker patient \nprotection bill while the House passed a strong bipartisan patients' \nbill of rights by a vote of 275 to 151. The McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill \nthat we will be debating this week and next is a carefully, crafted \nbipartisan compromise and the only patients' rights legislation \ncurrently under consideration that assures patients the protections \nthey need.\n  Although penetration of HMOs in South Dakota is not all that \nprevalent as it is in other parts of the country, South Dakotans still \ndeserve the same patient protections as individuals living in New York, \nWashington or California.\n  The Bipartisan Patient Protection Act will guarantee access to \nessential prescription drugs; allow access to needed health care \nspecialists; ensure patients can access emergency room care where and \nwhen the need arises; require continuity of care protections so that \npatients will not have to change doctors in the middle of their \ntreatment; provide access to a fair, unbiased, and timely internal and \nindependent external appeals process to address health plan grievances; \nassure that doctors and patients can openly discuss treatment options; \nand includes an enforcement mechanism that ensures these rights are \nreal.\n  Also, the McCain-Edwards bill ensures that States have flexibility \nwhile protecting all Americans in all health plans. This compromise \nlegislation clarifies that in the case of a State that has enacted \nprotections that are ``substantially equivalent,'' the State may seek \ncertification from the Department of Health and Human Services to use \nits standard rather than the Federal one. The standards for certifying \nState laws that meet or exceed the Federal minimum standard ensure than \nonly more protective State laws will replace the Federal standards \nwhile providing for strong oversight.\n  The McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill is a true bipartisan compromise and \nshould not be watered down or weakened before passage. The McCain-\nEdwards-Kennedy bill builds on the progress made by the Norwood-Dingell \nbill--which had the votes of approximately 60 Republicans in the \nHouse--on a number of key provisions, including strengthening \nprotections for employers to ensure that they are not liable unless \nthey have directly participated in a health plan decision; compromising \non liability and placing suits based on administrative plan decisions \nin Federal court to ensure that insurers have uniform standards; and \nincreasing State flexibility and allowing them to keep their own \npatient protections if they are substantially equivalent.\n  I am concerned that opponents of this bill will want to load up the \nbill with proposals that will weigh down its chances for passage. They \nwill propose inefficient tax credits that do little to expand health \ninsurance coverage, medical savings accounts, and association health \nplans and include other tax cuts to try and make it a tax-break \nChristmas tree for the special interests. I hope that we can avoid \nparliamentary maneuvers that serve only to sink this long-overdue \nlegislation. I believe that Americans deserve a bill that assures them \nthe patient protections they need.\n  Nearly every doctors' association, every nurses' association, and \nevery patients' rights group in America agrees that we need a strong, \nenforceable, Patients' Bill of Rights now. Recent polls indicate \noverwhelming support for this legislation. As the Washington Post \nreported today, ``Patients' Rights Debate Opens On Angry Note,'' June \n20, 2001, a recent Pew Research Center said that 77 percent of those \nsurveyed favored passage of a bill giving patients the right to sue \nHMOs, with overwhelming support across all party lines. We need to put \npeople's interests ahead of the special interest here on Capitol Hill \nand move forward with passage of this critical legislation. I am \nlooking forward to an open and fair debate and the passage of a real \nPatients' Bill of Rights that will truly strengthen our health care \nsystem, protect South Dakota families, and enrich our Nation for the \n21st century.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I will continue the discussion we have been \nhaving over the last few days about some of the concerns relative to \nthe McCain bill in the area of liability, especially as it relates to \nemployers ending up being sued. It is important to put it in context.\n  We continue to hear a lot of anecdotal stories which are compelling \nabout people who have been maltreated by their HMOs or by their \ninsurers. It is important to remember that there has not yet been a \nstory related on the floor, as compelling as they are, that would not \nhave been addressed not only by the McCain bill but by the Breaux-\nFrist-Jeffords bill or by the Nickles bill which was on the floor last \nyear.\n  So those are not the issue. We all intend to introduce a bill that \nmakes sure that people have adequate recourse when they are treated \nimproperly by HMOs or by their health insurer. The problem we have with \nthe McCain bill is that it is essentially a gross expansion of the \nability to sue. It is a bill that was designed for the purpose of \nallowing lawsuits against employers at a rate which has never been \nconceived of under present law or in other bills being considered.\n  The bill creates all sorts of new causes of action and new \nopportunities for these lawsuits. As a result of the expansion and \nexplosion of lawsuits, you are going to see employers dropping \ninsurance and people being left without insurance. So instead of being \na Patients' Bill of Rights, it is going to be a bill that creates \nemployees who have no insurance.\n  It would be just the opposite result that we should be looking \ntoward. In fact, CBO has scored the McCain bill as being a bill that \nwill cost 1.3 million Americans their insurance, because it will be \ndropped by their employers. The reason is simple: The bill just was \nwritten for lawyers by lawyers and of lawyers--trial lawyers.\n  For example, it allows forum shopping, one of the age-old games that \nis played in the legal community. I used to be a lawyer and we used to \nforum shop when I was doing trial work. It allows forum shopping, which \nis something that should not be allowed and is not allowed today \nbecause ERISA controls this area, and the Federal courts are \nresponsible. But under this bill you can go to Federal court or State \ncourt, depending on where you think you are going to get the most \nrecovery. Some States have no compensation caps, no liability caps, and \npunitive damages are available in State courts; sometimes you may pick \nthe State court and other times the Federal court, depending on the \njudge and the type of jury you expect to get. Forum shopping allows the \nemployer, as I have talked about, to be sued for minor offenses that \nare administrative. Literally hundreds of new causes of actions are \ncreated under this bill--hundreds--where the employer can be sued in \nprivate causes of action. It allows employers to be sued for unlimited \ncompensatory damages, and for punitive damages, which is something that \ncannot occur today under Federal law.\n  It has a new title--``special assessments,'' I think, is the term in \nFederal court--with a $5 million cap. Today, you can't sue for punitive \ndamages. But that is really irrelevant to the cap because you can get \naround the cap by going to State court with the forum shopping \nopportunities. So punitive damages are there.\n  Punitive damages is one of the things that worries employers the \nmost. Most employers accept the risk of punitive damages if it is for a \nproduct they produce. If I am an employer and I am making desktops, I \naccept the risk that I make a good desk top and I sell it. If something \ngoes wrong with that, I accept the risk that I should be subject to \nliability. But what we are talking about here is making the employer \nliable for medical treatment that his or her employee gets because the \nemployer presented his or her employee, as part of employment, health \ninsurance.\n  The employer doesn't have any control over a doctor that acts poorly \nor an HMO that acts irresponsibly, but under this bill an employer can \nbe subject to punitive liability. That is something most employers find \ntotally unacceptable--and they should. That is why you will have \nemployers walking away from the insurance concepts and from giving \ninsurance if this bill passes. That is why you will have more people \nuninsured. It permits a lawsuit right out of the box. You do not have\n\n[[Page S6548]]\n\nto go through the administrative appeals process.\n\n  Now, the great strength of both the Frist bill and the Nickles bill \nis that they try to avoid lawsuits while still giving the person who \nhas been injured redress. The way they do that is through an \nadministrative appeals process that has independent doctors, \nindependent reviewers, people who have nothing to do with the HMO, \nnothing to do with the employer, reviewing the situation when you think \nyou have been maltreated or poorly treated by your HMO or your doctor, \nand they are totally independent and you get a fair and honest \nevaluation. That is called the external appeals process. That is an \nimportant reform and an important right for patients--a huge right and \nan important right for patients.\n  But what the McCain bill does is say you don't have to go through \nthat stuff. You can go directly to court and bypass the external \nappeals process. This is a huge loophole for the purpose of creating \nmore lawsuits. Any good lawyer is going to be able to skip the external \nappeals process and go directly to court and sue not only the HMO and \nthe doctor--potentially, but also sue the employer. Under this bill, \nthe lawyer would be committing malpractice if they didn't sue the \nemployer. So that is another area where you have this huge expansion of \nlawsuits. Not only that, but you undermine what is true reform. True \nreform is destroyed by that proposal.\n  Another area where the plaintiff's trial lawyer language and \nfingerprints are all over this bill is that there basically is no time \nlimit for when you can bring the action. If, after the 180-day appeals \nprocess has expired, you decide you have a cause of injury, you can \nclaim a cause of injury and you toll the statute of limitations. You \ncould be 10 years out under this bill and still energize an action \nagainst the HMO, the insurance company, and the employer. It is \nbasically open-ended. It is lawsuits to infinity.\n  In addition, of course, it allows for simultaneous lawsuits. Not only \ndo you have forum shopping, you can sue in all the forums, all the \ntime, altogether. You might have some employer who is running a small \nrestaurant, with maybe 30, 40 employees, or who has a small startup \nbusiness, with maybe 20 or 30 employees, or a few gas stations that he \noperates, or a repair station with 20, 30, 50 employees; they can \nsuddenly find themselves defending a case on literally hundreds of \ndifferent causes of action in two different forums within one State, in \nthe Federal court and the State court. This could be so multiplied that \nthey would have to hire 16 law firms to defend themselves. And the cost \nis extraordinary.\n  The average cost of defending a malpractice issue is $77,000. That is \nmore than the profits of many small businesses in America today. And \nthey all can be drawn into these lawsuits. It won't be the insurance \ncompanies they will have to defend--they will, too, but the employer \nwill also have to defend under this bill. So you can have consecutive \nand simultaneous claims both in State and Federal court. Plus you can \nhave multiple and duplicative class action lawsuits.\n  Class action lawsuits are not allowed under present law. I do not \nthink they are allowed under the Nickles bill. I am pretty sure they \nare not allowed under the Frist-Breaux bill, and they are not allowed \nin present law under ERISA. Under this bill one can have multiple class \naction suits under ERISA and under RICO for the same violation.\n  That is why, because of all these different opportunities to sue, I \nhave called it the ``Lawyers Who Want to be Millionaires Act.'' That is \nwhy this bill generates such a huge loss of insurance to people. Of \ncourse, our goal should be to cause people to be insured, not to become \nuninsured, but the result of this bill is that the people become \nuninsured instead of being insured to the tune of at least 1.3 million \npeople, according to CBO's estimate. That is extraordinarily low, by my \nestimate, but that is still a huge number.\n  Some want to increase the number of uninsured because they see that \nas the vehicle of putting more pressure on the Federal Government to \nstep in and insure everyone through some nationalized system. But I \nthink we have seen from the experiences of our neighbors in Canada and \nour friends in England that a nationalized system is not the solution. \nIt produces a huge penalty, and it means that health care deteriorates, \nit is rationed, and that research and movement into new types of \ntreatments are significantly limited and severely impaired.\n  This bill which creates all these new uninsured, creates all these \nnew lawsuits, and which puts the employer at risk, is off in the wrong \ndirection. We have proposals which do address the needs of patients. \nThey have been proposed by Senators Jeffords, Frist, and Breaux. They \nhave been proposed by Senator Nickles. They are good proposals, and \nthey address the needs of Americans who interface with their HMOs or \ntheir other insurers and do not get fair treatment. We are very \nstrongly supportive of those, but we cannot support a bill which, in \nthe name of patients' rights, actually puts more people out on the \nstreet and makes more people uninsured, so actually reduces rates. I \nbelieve my time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from New Hampshire \nhas 6\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GREGG. I reserve that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator reserves his time. Who yields \ntime?\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, it is my understanding that amendments \nare now in order and the Republican side will have the first \nopportunity. I call up amendment No.----\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will yield, I yield back the remainder of \nmy time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By yielding back the remainder of time, the \nSenate can now proceed to amendments. The Senator from Arkansas is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 807\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 807, which is \nat the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Hutchinson] for himself and \n     Mr. Bond, proposes an amendment numbered 807.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a \n deduction for 100 percent of health insurance costs of self-employed \n                              individuals)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. DEDUCTION FOR 100 PERCENT OF HEALTH INSURANCE COSTS \n                   OF SELF-EMPLOYED INDIVIDUALS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Paragraph (1) of section 162(l) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(1) Allowance of deduction.--In the case of an individual \n     who is an employee within the meaning of section 401(c)(1), \n     there shall be allowed as a deduction under this section an \n     amount equal to 100 percent of the amount paid during the \n     taxable year for insurance which constitutes medical care for \n     the taxpayer and the taxpayer's spouse and dependents.''.\n       (b) Clarification of Limitations on Other Coverage.--The \n     first sentence of section 162(l)(2)(B) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to read as follows: \n     ``Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any taxpayer for any \n     calendar month for which the taxpayer participates in any \n     subsidized health plan maintained by any employer (other than \n     an employer described in section 401(c)(4)) of the taxpayer \n     or the spouse of the taxpayer.''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2001.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, earlier this morning as I left the \nChamber after the vote to proceed to the Patients' Bill of Rights, I \nwas approached by a reporter who said: Senator Hutchinson, what do you \nhave to say about all of these terrible stories, these horror stories \nthat are being presented on the floor of the Senate?\n  My response was: They are true; they are right. We are all horrified \nby some of the abuses that have occurred and the need for patient \nprotection.\n  I went on to say: Whether it is the Nickles bill from last year on \nwhich many worked so hard, whether it is the Frist-Jeffords bill this \nyear, or whether it is the Kennedy-McCain bill, all of them have agreed \nupon basic patient protections; that every one of these stories that \nhave been graphically portrayed in the Senate will have been addressed \nby these pieces of legislation.\n\n[[Page S6549]]\n\n Whether it is access to the closest emergency room, whether it is \ndirect access to an OB/GYN, or any of the basic protections, all of \nthese bills address those concerns.\n  The biggest point of contention, I went on to comment, is on whether \nor not there is going to be an open-ended right to sue that will cost \nmillions of Americans health insurance coverage. Are we going to have a \nbill that is so prone to lawsuits that those lawsuits will increase the \ncost of premiums and, as a result, employers are either going to drop \ntheir insurance or increase the copays and, as a result, we are going \nto see millions more lose their health insurance? That is the debate.\n  We are talking about people in need. We need not just focus upon \nthose terrible stories where an insurance company may have overruled a \nmedical decision of a doctor. We need to address that, but there is a \nconsensus on that. What we need to remember is we must not in this \nlegislation do such harm to our system that we actually have a cure \nthat is worse than the malady.\n  We have to keep in mind the whole issue of access, and the amendment \nthat Senator Bond and I offer today addresses specifically how we can \ndecrease the number of uninsured in this country instead of \nexacerbating a situation that is growing worse year by year.\n  The Kennedy-McCain bill before us, I am afraid, will, without \nquestion, increase premiums, CBO says, by 4.2 percent. That surely is a \nconservative estimate. But even with the 4.2 percent, we will see \n300,000 new uninsured for every percentage point of increase in health \ncare premiums. We are going to see well over a million, 1.3 million, \nlose their health care benefits. I think it will be far more than that.\n  This is of deep concern to me. Forty-three million Americans are \ncurrently uninsured, and in my home State of Arkansas, there are almost \na half million people who do not have health insurance. Twenty-two \npercent of the State population is uninsured.\n  We must not, I believe, in our zeal to have new patient protections \nopen the door to increases in premiums that are going to result in \nhundreds of thousands of people losing their health insurance.\n  Roughly half of employers, 46 percent, reported ``they likely would \nget out of the business of providing health care coverage if exposed to \nincreased liability.'' And that is what we are confronted with in the \nKennedy-McCain bill: increased liability.\n  Similarly, 48 percent said expanded liability would hinder care, and \n80 percent said it would increase consumer costs.\n  I know that as the American people become more familiar with the \nKennedy-McCain bill and what its liability provisions are, they are \ngoing to be less and less enamored by the Kennedy-McCain version of the \nPatients' Bill of Rights.\n  We are going to pass, I believe with all my heart, a Patients' Bill \nof Rights. It is my hope we will pass one that will not add to the \nranks of the uninsured.\n  According to the Urban Institute, medical malpractice claims take an \naverage of 60 months to file, 25 months to resolve, and 5 years to \nreceive payment.\n  With increased liability, we are not talking about increased health \ncare for patients, we are talking about increased dollars for trial \nlawyers.\n  The Kennedy-McCain bill allows unlimited economic damages, unlimited \nnoneconomic damages, unlimited punitive damages, both in State court \nand Federal court, taking two bites out of the apple. This whole issue \nof access is what concerns me.\n  Our amendment will provide an immediate 100-percent deductibility for \nthe self-employed. The Senate has taken a position on this in the past. \nThis bill that Senator Bond has courageously taken the lead on for \nyears had 52 cosponsors in the Senate, so we know where the Senate \nstands on this issue. It is one of equity, it is one of fairness, it is \none of decreasing the number of uninsured in this country.\n  As current law stands, self-employed individuals are only allowed to \ndeduct 60 percent of their health insurance costs this year, 70 percent \nnext year, and only in the year 2003 will the self-insured be allowed \nto deduct 100 percent of health insurance costs.\n\n  Corporations are allowed 100-percent deduction for their health \ninsurance costs right now. Employees receive 100-percent exclusion for \ntheir health insurance paid by their employers right now. However, to \nthe self-employed individual, we have said: We know it is unfair, we \nknow there is a disparity, we know there is an inequity. You wait. You \nhave waited years, wait 2 more years. In 2003 we will finally give you \nequal treatment.\n  There is no excuse as we deal with this Patients' Bill of Rights \nlegislation, not to make that 100-percent deductibility immediate. \nUnder this amendment, beginning January 1 of next year, there is a 100-\npercent deductibility allowed.\n  This is an appropriate step to take. Self-employed individuals under \nthis amendment are allowed to deduct 100 percent of the costs of health \ninsurance for themselves and their families beginning next year. This \nis one small step, and a very important and significant step, in \nturning back the direction of this legislation, which is to increase \nthe number of uninsured.\n  It also corrects the disparity under current law that prohibits a \nself-employed individual from deducting his or her health care costs if \nhe or she is simply eligible to participate in another health insurance \nplan, whether offered through a second job or by a spouse's employer. \nThe Hutchinson-Bond amendment addresses this by disallowing the \ndeduction only if the self-employed individual actually participates in \nanother health insurance plan.\n  The question might be asked, and should be asked, Who are the self-\nemployed? I received an e-mail from one of our small self-employed \nbusinesses in Arkansas. I will read but the pertinent aspect:\n\n       Patrick Burnett, PB& J Creative Communications, Little \n     Rock, Arkansas.\n       Senator Hutchinson: The main issues plaguing those of us \n     who decide to work independently are unaffordable and nontax \n     deductible health insurance. I have no insurance right now \n     because I can't afford it.\n\n  The bill before the Senate, unless we address some of these issues, \nwill only make that situation worse. Who are these people? Of the 12.5 \nmillion self-employed individuals in this country, 3.1 percent are \nuninsured. These self-employed, almost one out of four, cannot afford \nto buy insurance. Almost one out of four of the self-employed in this \ncountry could write exactly the e-mail I received in which he said, ``I \ncan't afford to buy insurance.'' One-hundred-percent deductibility \nhelps relieve that.\n  Who are these people? Nearly 70 percent of these individuals earn \nless than $50,000 annually. Some might say: Self-employed equates to \naffluent, high income. Why should we provide 100-percent deductibility \nfor those who can afford it?\n  The fact is, one out of four self-employed are not insured because \nthey cannot afford it, because 70 percent of these individuals earn \nless than $50,000 annually. When you count the number of family members \na self-employed family has, 21.6 million Americans benefit from the \nHutchinson-Bond amendment, including--and I emphasize this to my \ncolleague--including 6.4 million children, of whom 1 million are \ncurrently not insured at all.\n\n  If we want to talk about caring about people, if we want to display \nemotional, heart-rending pictures in the Senate that tear at the very \nheart of all who care about those who are hurting and vulnerable in our \nsociety, think about those 1 million children today in the homes of the \nself-employed who are uninsured because--at least in part--because we \nhave not given them treatment equal to that of the large corporations. \nWe have not given them the 100-percent deductibility.\n  The purpose of this amendment is simple. Increasing the deductibility \nof health insurance for the self-employed is an important step toward \nequalizing the Tax Code treatment of health insurance and increasing \nits affordability.\n  What difference will it make? The tax savings will be substantial. If \na self-employed individual trying to buy health insurance finds out the \npremiums are $6,000 per year--not unlikely; it could well be higher \nthan that; perhaps they have insurance and they are paying that $6,000 \nper year--current law allows the current deduction, 60 percent for the \nself-employed.\n  If they are in the 27-percent tax bracket, they currently have tax \nsavings at that 27-percent tax bracket of\n\n[[Page S6550]]\n\n$972. Under the Hutchinson-Bond amendment, under the 100-percent \ndeduction that we allow, that $3,600 they can deduct currently \nincreases to $6,000 and the $972 in savings increases to $1,620. That \nmeans an additional savings from this amendment for that self-employed \nindividual of $648. That is very significant, very meaningful. It may \nwell be the difference for literally millions and whether they have the \nability to purchase that insurance or whether they stay in the ranks of \nthe uninsured or join the ranks of the uninsured.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates this amendment reduces \nrevenues by $214 million in fiscal year 2002, $642 million in fiscal \nyear 2003, for a total of $856 over 10 years, and that minimal revenue \nloss is easily accommodated under the budget resolution.\n  I am very pleased the first amendment on this Patients' Bill of \nRights is one that will deal with the issue of access and is going to \nreduce the number of uninsured and try, in so doing, to improve this \nbill.\n  I am pleased to be joined in cosponsoring this amendment with a man \nwho has led this fight for years and deserves enormous credit for the \nprogress that has been made on this issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Collins and Senator Allen as \ncosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I inquire of the Senators, would they be interested in \nentering into a time agreement for this amendment?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. This is at the very heart of this bill on access, and \nI think we need a lot of time to talk about this.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I commend my colleague and neighbor from \nArkansas for offering this amendment which will fulfill the promise we \nhave been making to the self-employed in America for a long time.\n  Small business owners, farmers, and others have suffered. Their \nfamilies have been denied health insurance because the Tax Code has \nunfairly discriminated against those who are self-employed.\n  They say if you work for a large organization, if it is a taxable \norganization, it deducts all of the health insurance premiums paid by \nthat organization. The recipient, the employee, does not have to report \nthat health insurance as income. Therefore, there is an incentive to \nprovide health care coverage.\n  I have been involved in debate on health care coverage in this body \nalmost since I came here. We have talked about how we can make sure \nthat every American is covered. What the Senator from Arkansas is doing \ntoday in offering this amendment is saying now is the time, we are \ngoing to provide 100-percent deductibility for those who are self-\nemployed.\n  Over the years--and I will talk about it later--we have gradually \nmoved up the deductibility. But when I go home and I talk to a group of \nfarmers or small business owners who have come together to ask what the \nU.S. Government is doing for them or to them, I say: Well, if you can \njust hold off until the end of 2003 to get sick, we will allow you to \nhave 100-percent deductibility. They say: Well, I want to ensure that \nneither I nor my family suffers an illness that requires us to get \nhealth care. And what the Senator from Arkansas is doing today is \nsaying if we are going to debate a significant bill on health care that \nfocuses on the patients, let us make sure we cover those who need to be \ncovered.\n  Access to health care is one of the greatest challenges we face.\n  Yesterday I discussed a number of serious problems I have with the \nMcCain-Kennedy bill. Today as we start the long and arduous process of \nactually working on the bill, as we should have in committee--we are \ngoing to have to mark up the bill in the Chamber--we all hold in our \nhearts the high goal, the high hope that we will pass patient \nprotection legislation that works, that gets health care coverage, that \nprovides the patients the protection from health care organizations, \nHMOs or insurance companies, that want to put their bottom line profits \nahead of the well-being of patients.\n  In its zeal, however, to provide patient protections, the McCain-\nKennedy bill adds significantly to the cost of health care. The end \nresult? More than 170 million Americans will pay more for health care. \nThe lucky ones will pay more. The unlucky ones will actually lose their \ninsurance.\n  The CBO tells us that McCain-Kennedy increases costs on average by \n4.2 percent. When you use the general rule of thumb that a 1-\npercentage-point increase in premiums means a loss of insurance for \n300,000 people, this means the McCain-Kennedy bill will cost 1.25 \nmillion Americans their health care coverage. But we can be a little \nmore specific.\n  Yesterday I pointed out that we had had phone calls, faxes, letters \nfrom small businesses in Missouri telling us what they would do if they \nwere subjected to the potential liabilities of the McCain-Kennedy bill. \nYesterday we had 1,042 Missouri citizens who would stand to lose their \ncoverage. Today I want to read a letter from a woman with a small \nconvenience store in a rural part of Missouri. She says:\n\n       About 2 years ago we started carrying a group health \n     insurance plan for our employees. We currently have 6 \n     employees and 4 dependents on this plan. We pay 100 percent \n     of the employees costs and make payroll deductions for the \n     dependents. None of our employees had any major illnesses or \n     hospital stays in the previous year, but we had a 22 percent \n     increase in our premiums anyway. This year one of our \n     employees was diagnosed with breast cancer. She's had surgery \n     and has completed chemotherapy. She now has to go through \n     radiation therapy for 6 weeks and then reconstruction \n     surgery. She told me that had she not had insurance she would \n     have died because there was no way she could have afforded \n     this treatment and surgery. She is 42 years old. I am very \n     concerned about ever-increasing costs of health care, but I \n     am personally afraid not to carry it. If expanded liability \n     were to pass, we would definitely have to drop our group \n     coverage because we could not financially put ourselves at \n     risk if workers were allowed to sue their employers as well \n     as HMOs, if they felt like they had been denied some \n     coverage.\n\n  So today, Mr. President, I give you an update on the numbers. It is \nnow 1,287 people who will lose their health care coverage from the \nexpanded liability of the McCain-Kennedy bill.\n  I would point out that the woman who wrote me that letter is self-\nemployed. She only gets to deduct a portion of her health care \ncoverage. This amendment offered by the Senator from Arkansas would \nincrease to 100 percent the deductibility of her health care coverage. \nSo it obviously would enhance her ability to continue to pay for \nherself and her family. But with the expanded liability of the McCain-\nKennedy bill, there would be another 10 people denied health care \ncoverage in Missouri.\n  Apparently the proponents of this piece of legislation before us \nthink that is worth it--enriching trial lawyers is important enough \nthat they place a higher priority on them than on coverage for almost \n1.3 million Americans. Is this a Patients' Bill of Rights or a lawyers' \nbill of rights?\n  If we are going to do something, however, that threatens to reduce \ncoverage, should we not at least do something that makes sense at the \nsame time to try to increase coverage and access to health insurance? \nApparently some on the other side would say no. With this bill, they \nsay we are going to take coverage away from more than 1 million \nAmericans but we are not going to do a single thing to help people who \nare not covered get the coverage they deserve.\n\n  This first amendment offered by the Senator from Arkansas tries to \ncorrect this callous approach. I am sure there will be a variety of \nattempts to increase access to coverage during this debate. This route \nfocuses on the 21.6 million Americans who are self-employed or in \nfamilies headed by a self-employed individual.\n  On January 22 of this year I introduced S. 29, the Self-Employed \nHealth Insurance Fairness Act of 2001. I am pleased that the Senator \nfrom Illinois, Mr. Durbin, is the lead cosponsor out of the 52 \ncosponsors who have joined this bill so far. Obviously, this is \nimportant to many Members of this body.\n  During the time I have served as chairman of the Senate Committee on \nSmall Business--and now as its ranking member--one of my top priorities \nhas been to ensure full deductibility of health insurance for the self-\nemployed, and to provide it now.\n\n[[Page S6551]]\n\n  Today, while the self-employed can deduct 60 percent of their health \ninsurance costs, they are still not on a level playing field with large \nbusinesses which can deduct 100 percent. While the self-employed are \nslated to have full deductibility in 2003, these small business owners \nand their families should not have to wait any longer to get sick.\n  With only partial deductibility, it comes as no surprise that a \nquarter of the self-employed still do not have health insurance. In \nfact, 4.8 million Americans live in families headed by a self-employed \nindividual, and those families include more than a million children who \nlack adequate health insurance coverage due at least in part to our \nfailure to provide full deductibility for their health insurance costs.\n  Coverage of these self-employed individuals and their children \nthrough the self-employed health insurance deduction will enable the \nprivate sector to address the health care needs of these individuals \nrather than an expensive and intrusive Government program.\n  Full deductibility has been on the must-do list of the national small \nbusiness groups for too long. I know the farm groups and the Farm \nBureau and other groups have long argued for this.\n  Last year when I convened the National Women's Small Business Summit \nin Kansas City, having full deductibility of health insurance for the \nself-employed was one of their top goals. I assured them at the time \nthat we would bring this to the attention of our colleagues in this \nbody, and I do so again today.\n  In the 107th Congress we have a tremendous opportunity to see this \ngoal achieved in a bipartisan manner to the benefit of all the \ncountry's self-employed individuals. We have had bipartisan support for \nthis proposition in the past, and I expect we will do so today.\n  For some of you who may not remember or may not have been here or \nprobably have just forgotten, this battle has been going on in this \nbody for a long time.\n  In 1995, I offered an amendment to the Balanced Budget Act which \nwould have increased the health insurance deduction to the self-\nemployed to 50 percent. I thought this was a great start. \nUnfortunately, President Clinton vetoed it.\n  In 1996, I worked with Senator Kassebaum to include in the Health \nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act an increase in the self-\nemployed health insurance deduction incrementally to 80 percent over 10 \nyears.\n  In 1997, provisions of my Home-Based Business Fairness Act were \nincluded in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 to finally increase the \ndeduction to 100 percent, with full deductibility occurring in 2007. \nThe Taxpayer Relief Act also accelerated the phase-in over then \nexisting laws.\n  In 1998, as part of the omnibus appropriations bill, I worked to see \nthat the phase-in of 100-percent deductibility was accelerated from \n2007 to 2003. We also succeeded in substantially increasing the \ndeduction in the intervening years. Under that measure, the deduction \nwas raised to 60 percent for 1999, 2000, and 2001, to 70 percent for \n2002, and to 100 percent in 2003. These were increases of 10 to 20 \npercent.\n  In 1999, I worked to include in the Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act \n100-percent deductibility in 2000. Unfortunately, former President \nClinton vetoed that bill. Had he not done so, the self-employed in \nAmerica would be enjoying full deductibility of health insurance costs \ntoday.\n  In 2000, I worked to provide immediate full deductibility in the \nminimum wage tax package, the Patients' Bill of Rights legislation, and \nthe yearend small business tax package. There is no surprise to say \nthat the veto threats from the Clinton administration derailed those \nbills, and, once again, the self-employed were denied full \ndeductibility.\n  This year, the Finance Committee, on a bipartisan basis, was good \nenough to provide immediate full deductibility in the package that was \nbrought to the Senate floor and which passed the full Senate. Thank \nyou, leaders of the Finance Committee, Senator Grassley and Senator \nBaucus. Unfortunately, I must tell you that the provision was removed \nin the conference and did not pass into law with the rest of the \nPresident's tax cut package.\n  The bottom line, immediate full deductibility for the self-employed \nhas overwhelming bipartisan support. It was passed by the Senate \nFinance Committee and the full Senate multiple times in the past.\n  As my colleague from Arkansas has pointed out, according to the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, the amendment is expected to cost $214 million \nin 2002 and $641 million in 2003.\n  As a result, the 5- and 10-year costs of the amendment is really only \nthe first 2 years when we get to 100-percent deductibility, and that \ntotal cost is $855 million. That is within the budget parameters that \nwe adopted and under which we operate.\n  In summary, let me say that after waiting for too long we now have \nanother chance to see that self-employed Americans get health insurance \nby passing this important provision. Our chance to pass it is on a bill \nthat desperately needs to deal with the problem of insurance coverage \nand insurance access.\n  As we look to protect patients, we must be expanding--not limiting--\naccess to care. We will have further amendments that deal with some of \nthe problems that could substantially limit access to care, could drive \nout small businesses--such as the small businesses that have already \ntold me that, without change in the liability provisions of the McCain-\nKennedy bill, they will have to cut off health care to 1,287 Missouri \ncitizens.\n  This is just the beginning, good friends. Wait until you start \nhearing from small businesses in your State that I believe will tell \nyou they will not be able to continue to provide health care coverage \nfor their employees if they are going to be subjected to liability \nwhenever there is a problem with their health insurance coverage.\n  We believe more than 1 million Americans will lose their coverage as \na result of the increased costs and the expanded liability of the \nMcCain-Kennedy bill.\n  This amendment offered by my good friend and colleague from Arkansas \nis our chance to mitigate that approach by trying to help more \nAmericans get coverage.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Hutchinson-Bond amendment. I \nbelieve it is a most important step for us to take as we begin debate \non this bill and work to see that more and not less Americans get the \nhealth insurance coverage we want to see all of them have.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. BOND. I am finished and happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Is this the tax deductibility amendment that the \nSenator from Missouri and I cosponsored previously?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the Senator from South Carolina has been a \nvery active sponsor. I mentioned Senator Durbin. During my period in \nthe Senate, I have had great support from the Senator from South \nCarolina and others on both sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. If the distinguished Senator pleases, I hate to demur \nat this particular point. But I don't think this particular bill is \nappropriate on a matter of procedure. So I didn't want to be associated \nwith the amendment on this particular bill. This is not a tax bill, \nobviously. I wish to withdraw my name as a cosponsor because I have to \nvote against the amendment.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we have not included the distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina as a cosponsor of the bill. We know his \nheart is with us. We are sorry his vote is not with us.\n  I think you will find before this bill is over with that there will \nbe many issues in the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee, and what \nwe should be talking about on this bill is making sure that we protect \npatients, we protect Americans who must have health care coverage. This \nbill goes in the wrong direction. We will have an opportunity for all \nSenators to express themselves on whether they believe the self-\nemployed and their families deserve to have 100-percent deductibility. \nI hope we will have the same bipartisan support, maybe with one \nexception that we have had in the past because the self-employed, the \nfarmers, the truck drivers, the daycare operators, the mom-and-pop \noperations, the 21.2\n\n[[Page S6552]]\n\nmillion Americans who own small businesses who are taxed under \nindividual rates will have full benefits.\n  Again, the principle is very important. I don't think the American \npeople are going to care much about procedure when this bill really \nturns into a bill with significant Finance Committee implications. We \nought to take a look at what is going to make a difference to the self-\nemployed, and the Hutchinson-Bond amendment will help us get coverage \nto many who are now not covered.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to discuss my vote on the \nHutchinson-Bond amendment. I commend Senators Hutchinson and Bond for \nraising the issue of accelerating full deductibility for the self-\nemployed. I support, and have always supported, this important effort \nand wish to see it realized. I am confident that with the leadership of \nSenators Hutchinson and Bond it will become reality.\n  However, as the recent experience with the $1.35 trillion tax relief \nbill has shown, it is critical that tax legislation be first considered \nby the Finance Committee as part of a tax bill.\n  I have sought and have received agreement from the chairman of the \nFinance Committee that this measure and similar health tax related \nmatters will be subject to a markup in the Finance Committee in the \nnear future. I look forward to pursuing this issue at that time.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of the bill by Senator \nBond that is identical to this amendment. This proposal will provide a \nvital acceleration of the phase in of full tax deductibility for the \nhealth insurance costs of the self-employed. This is a much-needed \nchange to provide relief and level the playing field for small \nbusinesses, farmers, and independent contractors.\n  I voted for this provision when it was included as part of the \nSenate's $1.35 trillion tax cut bill and was disappointed that it was \nnot included in the Conference Report.\n  Although I strongly support Senator Bond's legislation, I regret that \nI cannot support this amendment to the Patients' Bill of Rights. First, \nthe tax cuts in the amendment are not offset and therefore would \nincrease the national debt. Now that the $1.35 trillion tax cut has \nbeen adopted, we need to exercise restraint when considering additional \ntax cuts. Furthermore, I do not believe the amendment is an appropriate \naddition to the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  We need to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights to improve patient care \nand hold HMOs accountable for their health care decisions. Reducing the \nnumber of Americans that lack health coverage is a vitally important \nsubject, but one that should be addressed separately from the Patients' \nBill of Rights.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, may I first express my appreciation to \nthe distinguished Senator from Missouri for his leadership, not only on \nthe issue of 100-percent deductibility for the self-employed but for \nhis strong advocacy for small business. He has been one of the great \nchampions for small business in this country, and he continues to be as \nthe cosponsor of the amendment. I am pleased to be associated with him \non this important effort.\n  If I might say in response to the concerns of my good friend, the \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina, about the Finance \nCommittee's jurisdiction, in fact, no Senate committee ever reviewed S. \n1052 before we proceeded to it on the floor of the Senate.\n  While it is true that there have been other Patients' Bill of Rights \nlegislation debated in the past, the fact is that this bill contains \nseveral provisions within the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee, \nincluding customs user fees, Medicare payment shifts, Social Security \ntransfers--all of which come under the jurisdiction of the Finance \nCommittee, which has never marked up this bill.\n  In fact, this amendment is most appropriate for this bill because the \nconcern of many on this side of the aisle--and I think many on the \nother side of the aisle--has been that the Kennedy-McCain version of \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights, because of the liability provisions and \nsome of the other concerns in it, but particularly the liability \nprovisions--the wide open right to sue provisions, the ability to \ncircumvent the internal and external appeals process and go straight to \ncourt, and the impact that liability will have upon increasing \npremiums, increasing costs of health care, and increasing, in fact, the \nnumber of uninsured--that dealing with an access amendment is the most \nappropriate way we could start the amendment process on the Patients' \nBill of Rights.\n  This is the most germane, most appropriate amendment with which we \ncould begin. There are going to be many very important amendments and a \nlot of important issues addressed, but what could be more important \nthan ensuring that there are going to be literally millions more people \nwho will be able to get insurance because we are giving 100-percent \ndeductibility a year sooner than they would get under current law?\n  So the Senate has spoken, saying this is a matter of fairness. We \nhave voted in the past in favor of 100-percent deductibility. There is \nno need for us to phase that in, particularly in light of a bill that \npromises to increase the number of uninsured.\n  I want us to put a human face on those people. We talk about a 1-\npercent increase in premiums. That is 300,000 more uninsured; 4.2 \npercent. That is 1.3 million more people who lose their insurance. If \nyou think about the number--1.3 million--it becomes very impersonal, \nbut every one is a human being. And those are people who currently have \nhealth insurance, currently are covered, currently have the assurance \nand the confidence each day that when they get up, if something \nhappens--if an illness strikes--they are covered, protected in this \nemployer-based health insurance system. And they are not going to have \nit when we pass the Kennedy-McCain bill. We need to keep that in mind. \nWe need to keep the focus upon those uninsured.\n  I would like to share with my colleagues an important statement of \nadministration policy which was just issued today. I have just been \nhanded this. This is a June 21 ``Statement of Administration Policy'' \nregarding the Kennedy-McCain Patients' Bill of Rights. All who have \nfollowed this issue know the President wants to sign a good Patients' \nBill of Rights. He signed a bill in Texas. He campaigned in support of \na Patients' Bill of Rights. He outlined his principles. He is on record \nas not only supporting this, but enthusiastically believing we need to \ndo it. But he has expressed deep concerns about this Kennedy-McCain \nbill. The ``Statement of Administration Policy'' reads as follows:\n\n       The President strongly supports passage of a patients' bill \n     of rights this year and has been working with members of both \n     parties since the first week of the Administration to forge a \n     compromise. Congress has been divided on this issue for far \n     too long at the expense of patients and their families. The \n     President strongly urges Congress to pass a strong patients' \n     bill of rights this year that provides meaningful protections \n     for patients, not a windfall for trial lawyers or a threat to \n     Americans' ability to obtain and afford quality health care. \n     On February 7, 2001, the President transmitted to Congress \n     his principles for a bipartisan patients' bill of rights and \n     urged Congress to move quickly on this important issue.\n       The President's principles called for passage of a \n     patients' bill of rights that ensures all Americans enjoy \n     strong patient protections, including: access to emergency \n     room and specialty care; direct access to obstetricians, \n     gynecologists, and pediatricians; access to needed \n     prescription drugs and approved clinical trials; access to \n     health plan information; a prohibition of ``gag clauses''; \n     consumer choice provisions; and continuity of care \n     protections. The President also recognizes, however, that \n     many States have passed strong patient protection laws \n     already, some of which have been in force for over a decade. \n     To the extent possible, a Federal patients' bill of rights \n     should give deference to these effective State laws.\n       The President's principles emphasized the importance of \n     providing patients who have been denied medical care with the \n     right to a fair, prompt, and independent medical review, \n     which will ensure that disputes are resolved quickly and \n     inexpensively and that patients receive the quality care they \n     deserve.\n       The President stated that only after this independent \n     review decision is rendered should we resort to the costlier, \n     time-consuming remedy of litigation in Federal courts to \n     ensure that health plans are held liable for wrongful \n     decisions.\n       The President's principles also reminded Congress of the \n     necessity of avoiding unnecessary and frivolous lawsuits, \n     which will only serve to drive up costs and leave more \n     individuals without insurance coverage. S. 1052--\n\n\n[[Page S6553]]\n\n\n  That is the Kennedy-McCain bill.\n\n     will significantly increase health insurance premiums and the \n     number of uninsured. According to the Congressional Budget \n     Office, health insurance premiums under S. 1052 as originally \n     drafted would increase by over 4%. If the effects of \n     litigation risk on the practice of medicine and of the \n     reduced ability of health plans to negotiate lower rates were \n     included, CBO's estimated cost impact could be much higher, \n     by 4-5% or more. This is in addition to the estimated 10-12% \n     premium increases employers are already facing in 2001. \n     Further, leading economists have predicted that employers \n     drop coverage for approximately 500,000 individuals when \n     health care premiums increase by 1%. According to these \n     estimates, S. 1052 could cause at least 4-6 million \n     Americans to lose health coverage provided by their \n     employers.\n       The President is encouraged by efforts in the Senate, Like \n     those of Senators Frist, Breaux, and Jeffords, to develop a \n     common sense compromise that forges a middle ground on this \n     issue and meets the President's principles.\n       While the President strongly supports a comprehensive and \n     enforceable patients' bill of rights and has been working \n     with members of both parties to enact legislation this year, \n     he believes that S. 1052 would encourage costly and \n     unnecessary litigation that would seriously jeopardize the \n     ability of many Americans to afford health care coverage.\n       The President objects to the liability provisions of S. \n     1052. The President will veto the bill unless significant \n     changes are made to address his major concerns. In \n     particular, the serious flaws in S. 1052 include:\n       S. 1052 circumvents the independent medical review process \n     in favor of litigation. The President believes that patients \n     should be given care first--litigation should be the last \n     resort. Patients should exhaust the medical review process \n     first, allowing doctors, not trial lawyers, to make decisions \n     about medical care.\n       S. 1052 jeopardizes health care coverage for workers and \n     their families by failing to avoid costly litigation. S. 1052 \n     overturns more than 25 years of Federal law that provides \n     uniformity and certainty for employers who voluntarily offer \n     health care benefits for millions of Americans across the \n     country. The liability provisions of S. 1052 would, for the \n     first time, expose employers and unions to at least 50 \n     different, inconsistent State-law standards. The result will \n     inevitably be that employers and unions will be forced to pay \n     for different benefits from State to State, even within a \n     particular State, based on varying precedents set in State \n     courts and leading to inconsistent standards of care of \n     patients. Further, S. 1052 imposes no limitations on State \n     court damages, and it is not clear whether existing State-law \n     caps would apply to the broad, new causes of action in State \n     courts that S. 1052 creates.\n       S. 1052 also would allow causes of action in Federal court \n     for a violation of any duty under the plan, creating open-\n     ended and unpredictable lawsuits against employers for \n     administrative errors. These new Federal claims do not have \n     any limitations on the amount of noneconomic damages, \n     creating virtually unrestrained damage awards that are \n     limited only by an excessive $5 million cap on punitive \n     damages.\n       Moreover, S. 1052 would subject employers and unions to \n     frequent litigation in State and Federal court under a vague \n     ``direct participation'' standard, which would require \n     employers and unions to defend themselves in court in \n     virtually every case against allegations that they ``directly \n     participated'' in a denial of benefits decision. Because such \n     determinations are inherently fact-specific, any such \n     allegation will force a costly and time-consuming court \n     process and result in varying State interpretations of \n     ``direct participation,'' forcing employers to adhere to \n     different standards in every State.\n       S. 1052 fails to provide a fair and comprehensive remedy to \n     all patients. The President believes the new Federal law \n     should establish a comprehensive set of rights and remedies \n     for patients. S. 1052 instead encourages costly litigation by \n     providing no effective limitations on frivolous class action \n     suits and allows trial lawyers to go on fishing expeditions \n     to seek remedies under other Federal statutes.\n       S. 1052 subjects physicians and all health care \n     professionals to great liability risk. S. 1052 would expand \n     liability for physicians and all health care professionals in \n     State courts well beyond traditional medical malpractice by \n     permitting new, undefined causes of action in State courts \n     for denials of medical benefits. This expanded litigation \n     against physicians and all health professionals will create \n     an opportunity to circumvent State medical malpractice caps \n     that may not apply to these new causes of action.\n       Extraneous User Fee Provision. The Administration objects \n     to inclusion in S. 1052 of an extraneous revenue-raising \n     provision (section 502), which extends for multiple years \n     Customs charges on transportation, passengers, and \n     merchandise arriving in the country.\n\n\n                         pay-as-you-go-scoring\n\n       S. 1052 would affect direct spending; therefore, it is \n     subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus \n     Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring \n     estimate of the bill is under development.\n\n  Just before I yield the floor to our distinguished deputy minority \nleader, I will re-cite the President's Statement of Administration \nPolicy in which the President says he will veto the bill unless \nsignificant changes are made to address his major concerns.\n  The amendment before us, providing 100-percent deductibility, is one \nstep in addressing the concerns of our President, by increasing the \navailability and affordability of health insurance to those who have \nfaced an inequitable Tax Code in the past.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my friend and colleague from \nArkansas for this amendment. I ask unanimous consent to be listed as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I also thank my colleague, Senator Bond \nfrom Missouri. He and I and the Senator from Arkansas have been \nfighting for this provision for years, and we are going to get it done.\n  This provision is basic tax equity. Why in the world wouldn't we \nallow self-employed individuals to deduct 100 percent of their health \ncare premiums if we allow corporations to do so?\n  I used to be self-employed. I used to run a corporation. Corporations \nget to deduct 100 percent. Every corporation in the country, if they \nwant to provide health care for their employees, gets to deduct 100 \npercent of the expense of that health care. They get to deduct it. A \nself-employed person this year gets to deduct 60 percent. That is not \nfair. That is not right. It needs to be changed. It can be changed in \nthis bill.\n  You might ask, why are we changing this bill? There are a lot of \nreasons. Unfortunately, the bill we have before us, the so-called \nMcCain-Kennedy bill, will increase the number of uninsured in the \nmillions. Some have estimated 1 million, some 2, 3, 4 million. I think \nit is a higher figure, but millions of people will lose their insurance \nif we don't improve the bill.\n  Last year when Congress passed a Patients' Bill of Rights, we called \nit the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus. Not only did we have patient \nprotections, but we also put in some very positive provisions to help \npeople buy health care. So we would increase access, and we would \nincrease the number of people who have insurance. This amendment was \none part of that--a small part but a vital part, an important part.\n  Some of the people who are going to be hit the hardest under this \nbill are self-employed individuals, people who own their own business, \npeople who are very small employers from a variety of different \nbusinesses. Many of these are new businesses, not the old, established \nones that have been around for decades. These are new businesses that \nwere just created. And many of them are asking what kind of \ncompensation package do we have for our employees. They are adding \nhealth care or they hope to add health care. Then when they find out \nthey only get to deduct 60 percent of the cost, they realize that is \nnot fair--not when General Motors gets to deduct 100 percent, not when \nevery corporation in America gets to deduct 100 percent. So many times \ntheir compensation package for their employees will not include health \ncare.\n  They might say: We will pay your salary and we hope that you will buy \nhealth care. It might be a hope. It might be a wish, but it is not a \nreality because the Tax Code discriminates against self-employed \nindividuals.\n  We can change that. The amendment of the Senator from Arkansas would \nchange that. This Congress has passed this amendment. We passed it last \nyear when we passed the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus. We passed it \nlast year when we passed the minimum wage bill. We added this provision \nas well.\n  We are going to give everybody a chance to pass it in this bill. I \ncompliment my friend and colleague. If we have a bill that increases \nthe number of uninsured and directly hits a lot of people who are self-\nemployed, let's do something to help the self-employed. If we want to \nhelp the self-employed individual, this is one amendment that can do \nso.\n  Not only that, it is basic equity. Why in the world would we have a \npolicy where we allow corporations to deduct 100 percent and the self-\nemployed 60 percent, next year 70 percent. It is not right. It is not \nfair.\n\n[[Page S6554]]\n\n  Somebody asked, what does this amendment really boil down to? It \nboils down to the difference in deducting 60 percent versus 100 \npercent. For an individual who has health care costs of about $6,000, \nit means deducting $1,600 instead of about $1,000, a difference of $600 \nsavings in taxes for self-employed individuals.\n  This amendment is a serious amendment. This amendment is an amendment \nthat should be adopted. I hope this amendment will be adopted \noverwhelmingly.\n  Other people have said we shouldn't be doing taxes on this bill. This \nis not a Finance Committee bill. This bill never went through the \nFinance Committee. That is correct, but it is also correct that the \nbill never went through the labor committee. This bill never went \nthrough the Judiciary Committee. It has a whole new tort section that \ncreates new sections of legal action against employers and medical \nhealth care providers, HMOs, and so on, all new legal actions, tort \ncases, but it didn't go through the Judiciary Committee. This bill \nnever went through the Labor Committee, and it didn't go through the \nFinance Committee.\n  This bill also has sections in it that deal with the Finance \nCommittee. I happen to be a member of that committee. I was kind of \nsurprised to find out that there is language in here extending custom \nuser fees for 8 years. What does that have to do with the Patients' \nBill of Rights? At least the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas \nsays we want to help people buy health care. We want to help those \npeople who are targeted by this bill. Self-employed people who may not \nbe able to afford insurance because of this bill, let's help them a \nlittle bit.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Arkansas is pretty relevant. I \ndon't know what custom fees have to do with a Patients' Bill of Rights. \nI don't know what doing some jiggling with Social Security trust funds \nand Medicare payments--there is a little tinkering going on with those \nprovisions. I am not sure why they are in here. Maybe it is because CBO \nestimates that there will be billions of dollars less in the Social \nSecurity and Medicare trust funds as a result of this bill. Maybe those \ntrust funds have some problems because there is not as much money going \ninto it.\n  You might ask, why is there less money going into the trust funds. \nBecause CBO says if you greatly increase people's premiums, they are \ngoing to get less payment in wages. This is not my estimate. It is \nCBO's estimate. They estimated $56 billion less in wages over the next \n10 years as a result of this bill; a reduction in Social Security \npayments of about $7 billion less going into the trust fund as a result \nof this legislation.\n  Maybe that is what this is. I haven't quite figured out what the \npurpose is. Maybe I will ask the authors of the legislation who I don't \nbelieve are members of the Finance Committee, but I am sure there is a \nmethod in their madness. I will not cast any aspersions, but I do know \nit deals with the Finance Committee. I do know it deals with taxes. I \ndo know we have a tax increase in extending custom user fees. I don't \nknow how relevant those are to patients, but I do know the Hutchinson \namendment is very relevant because he is trying to help self-employed \npeople be able to afford insurance.\n  This bill will greatly increase the cost of insurance for the self-\nemployed and all employers and all employees. I say ``all employees'' \nbecause a lot of employers are going to be passing the additional cost \non to their employees.\n\n  I have heard some people say: It is only 50 cents. It is only a \ndollar. It is only a Big Mac. That is being pretty loose with the \nexpenses and costs. Maybe people aren't figuring the cost of health \ncare nationwide is about $7,000 per family. That is the total cost. \nEmployers maybe pay all of it in some cases; maybe they pay half of it \nin other cases. If they are paying all of it, that means the employee \nis getting less in wages because the employer is expending that amount.\n  Maybe it is some kind of copay. More and more employers and employees \nhave cost sharing. Or maybe the employer is picking up 70 or 80 \npercent, and the employee picks up the balance. Those are all very \nlegitimate ways of paying for health care; the point being, this bill \nis going to greatly increase health care costs on both the employer and \nthe employee. If they are paying 20 or 30 percent of the health care \ncosts, they are going to be paying more. They may have a higher \ndeductible. They may have a higher copay.\n  The total cost of the bill will go up. How much will it go up? CBO \nsays 4.2 percent; 4.2 percent on $7,000 is about $300 per family. It is \ninteresting, that is the size of the tax cut for a lot of Americans. \nWell, we gave Americans a tax cut they will be receiving in July and \nAugust and September of this year. That is great. We are going to take \nit away with this bill.\n  I think that estimate of 4.2 percent is grossly underestimated. I \nnotice the administration does, too. They said if the effects of \nlitigation risk on the practice of medicine and the reduced ability of \nhealth plans to negotiate lower rates were included, CBO's estimated \ncost impact would be much higher, by 4 or 5 percent more. So instead of \nincreasing the cost of health care by 4 percent, it is probably 8 or 9 \npercent. Clearly, when you add 8 or 9 percent on health care costs that \nare already rising at 12 percent in some cases, in most cases, 20 \npercent, you are looking at astronomical price increases for your \nhealth care costs. A lot of people won't be able to afford it. They \nwill drop their health care as a result. Or they will say, employees, \nyou pick up a greater share. Or they will say, employees, we can't \nprovide this with the extended liability we now have on us and, \ntherefore, we will give you the money. We hope you will purchase health \ncare on the individual market.\n  It might be more expensive for them to do it in the individual \nmarket. Some would do it and many would not. So it is this threat of \nliability that would greatly increase health care costs and greatly \nincrease the number of uninsured--not to mention the fact that it would \nincrease defensive medicine costs because plans would have to go \nthrough an appeals process. Employers might say: Wait a minute, it is \ncheaper to pay for the coverage even though it is not a contractual \nbenefit, and we will do it because it is cheaper than to go through the \nappeals process. Maybe you will have some situations where people will \nsay: Let's pay for it because we don't want a threat of liability.\n  So everything is covered whether it is in the contract or not. You \nwould have a lot of defensive medicine and a lot of people, because of \nthe threat or the scare of liability, who would say: Let's just pay for \nthe coverage.\n  So health care costs will be rising, and rising dramatically--I \nbelieve, like the administration, much more so than 4 percent, probably \na lot closer to 8 or 10 percent. The net result will be a disaster--a \nspecial disaster on the small businessperson. I was a small \nbusinessperson. I used to have a janitor service. We didn't provide \nhealth care for our employees. It was a business I started in college. \nIf I would have maintained it longer, I probably would have. But I \nwould not--if somebody said, ``Oh, Mr. Janitorial Service, you could be \nliable for anything you have ever gotten or ever will have under a bill \nthat the Congress just passed,'' I would say, ``Hey, I don't have to \nprovide this health care'' and, no, I don't think I would.\n  A lot of people would not be doing it if they knew they could be \nsubject to unlimited punitive damages in State court and unlimited \nnoneconomic damages in State or Federal court. That is in this bill. I \nhave heard some people say that the McCain-Edwards bill has a $5 \nmillion cap on damages. It has a $5 million on punitive damages in \nFederal Court. It doesn't have any cap, any damage limit whatsoever on \nnoneconomic damages, which is pain and suffering. That is where the big \njury awards are. We already have jury awards in the millions of \ndollars. Some want to do class action suits in the billions. This bill \nencourages class action suits.\n  Boy, there are trial lawyers just licking their chops just thinking \nthey are going to have a chance to get after that. Who are they going \nto go after? The big bad HMOs? The people who are going to really get \nhit are the small, self-employed individuals who want to provide health \ncare to employees and they can't afford it. Those big bad HMOs, are \nthey really going to be hit? Whatever they get hit for, they will pass \nit on. They won't pay a dime.\n\n[[Page S6555]]\n\n Maybe their profits will be a little less, but they are going to pass \nit on in the form of higher rates, and employees and employers are both \ngoing to pay for it.\n  The reason I say ``employees'' is employers can't pay for it out of \nnothing, so therefore it comes out of the employee as lost wages, or as \nthe wage increases they might have received, or higher copays.\n  So employees of America, this is not a bill that is going to be \nexpanding your protection; this is going to be cutting your wages. This \nis going to be taking money away from employees' paychecks because they \nwon't get the increases they hoped to get because employers will be \nsaddled with exorbitant increases in health care costs.\n  We can help alleviate that by making some changes in this bill. It is \nvery much my intention to pass a positive Patients' Bill of Rights. \nThis bill we have before us is not that. This bill is a disaster for \nemployers and employees across the country. This bill is a recipe for \nlitigation. This is a trial lawyer's right to bill, not a Patients' \nBill of Rights. It is a trial lawyer's right to bill, and the net \nresult is you are going to have a lot of litigation, a lot less health \ncare, and decisions being made in the courtroom instead of by doctors.\n\n  We don't have to go this route. We can pass something like we passed \nlast year. We can pass something, as Dr. Frist proposed, that has a \nreal appeals process--an internal and external review process that is \nbinding. Under this bill, you don't even have to go through the review \nprocess; you can bypass it. You need not apply. Don't bother. In 181 \ndays, you can sue for all they have. You don't have to mess with the \nappeals and have doctors make the decisions. Let's just go to court \nwhere you can get big awards.\n  This bill would be a mistake. Let's not pass this bill. We are going \nto work over the next number of days to improve this bill. I think the \namendment of the Senator from Arkansas is a small step in the right \ndirection. It will make health care more affordable and accessible for \nself-employed individuals. I congratulate him and compliment him and I \nam happy to cosponsor his effort. I hope our entire Senate will join in \nthis effort to pass this.\n  I have consulted with Members in the House of Representatives and \nthey are going to have provisions that are in the Tax Code to encourage \nindividuals to pay for health care, and the Senate should do likewise. \nSome might say, wait a minute; this is a tax measure. Let's wait for \nthe House. If it has tax measures in it now, let's go ahead and make a \ngood tax measure, not just an increase. Let's do something to help \nself-employed individuals, as my colleague from Arkansas has advocated.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment. It is a \npositive amendment and a step in the right direction to improving a \nbill that, in my opinion, is fatally flawed. We hope to have many \nimprovements by the time this debate is concluded.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The Senator from Arkansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma \nfor his fine statement and, even more, I express my gratitude for the \nleadership he has demonstrated over the last 2 or 3 years on the issue \nof the patients' rights legislation. It was a privilege to serve on the \nconference committee on the Patients' Bill of Rights. I saw the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma work day and night as he chaired that conference \ncommittee. He worked arduously in trying to forge a compromise that was \nacceptable to the various interests and factions to ensure that \nmillions and millions of Americans who do not currently have \nprotections under managed care organizations and insurance plans would \nreceive that. I know many of us regret that we didn't achieve that \nultimate goal. It is not because of any lack of effort on the part of \nthe distinguished Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Madam President, previously in my remarks, I quoted from the \nstatement of the administration policy regarding S. 1052, the Kennedy-\nMcCain legislation, and I ask unanimous consent to have that statement \nof administration policy printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n               S. 1052--Bipartisan Patient Protection Act\n\n       The President strongly supports passage of a patients' bill \n     of rights this year and has been working with members of both \n     parties since the first week of the Administration to forge a \n     compromise. Congress has been divided on this issue for far \n     too long at the expense of patients and their families. The \n     President strongly urges Congress to pass a strong patients' \n     bill of rights this year that provides meaningful protections \n     for patients, not a windfall for trial lawyers or a threat to \n     Americans' ability to obtain and afford quality health care. \n     On February 7, 2001, the President transmitted to Congress \n     his principles for a bipartisan patients' bill of rights and \n     urged Congress to move quickly on this important issue.\n       The President's principles called for passage of a \n     patients' bill of rights that ensures all Americans enjoy \n     strong patient protections, including: access to emergency \n     room and specialty care; direct access to obstetricians, \n     gynecologists, and pediatricians; access to needed \n     prescription drugs and approved clinical trials; access to \n     health plan information; a prohibition of ``gag clauses''; \n     consumer choice provisions; and continuity of care \n     protections. The President also recognizes, however, that \n     many States have passed strong patient protection laws \n     already, some of which have been in force for over a decade. \n     To the extent possible, a Federal patients' bill of rights \n     should give deference to these effective State laws.\n       The President's principles emphasized the importance of \n     providing patients who have been denied medical care with the \n     right to a fair, prompt, and independent medical review, \n     which will ensure that disputes are resolved quickly and \n     inexpensively and that patients receive the quality care they \n     deserve.\n       The President stated that only after this independent \n     review decision is rendered should we resort to the costlier, \n     time-consuming remedy of litigation in Federal courts to \n     ensure that health plans are held liable for wrongful \n     decisions.\n       The President's principles also reminded Congress of the \n     necessity of avoiding unnecessary and frivolous lawsuits, \n     which will only serve to drive up costs and leave more \n     individuals without insurance coverage. S. 1052 will \n     significantly increase health insurance premiums and the \n     number of uninsured. According to the Congressional Budget \n     Office, health insurance premiums under S. 1052 as originally \n     drafted would increase by over 4%. If the effects of \n     litigation risk on the practice of medicine and of the \n     reduced ability of health plans to negotiate lower rates were \n     included, CBO's estimated cost impact could be much higher, \n     by 4-5% or more. This is in addition to the estimated 10-12% \n     premium increases employers are already facing in 2001. \n     Further, leading economists have predicted that employers \n     drop coverage for approximately 500,000 individuals when \n     health care premiums increase by 1%. According to these \n     estimates, S. 1052 could cause at least 4-6 million \n     Americans to lose health coverage provided by their \n     employers.\n       The President is encouraged by efforts in the Senate, like \n     those of Senators Frist, Breaux, and Jeffords, to develop a \n     common sense compromise that forges a middle ground on this \n     issue and meets the President's principles.\n       While the President strongly supports a comprehensive and \n     enforceable patients' bill of rights and has been working \n     with members of both parties to enact legislation this year, \n     he believes that S. 1052 would encourage costly and \n     unnecessary litigation that would seriously jeopardize the \n     ability of many American to afford health care coverage.\n       The President objects to the liability provisions of S. \n     1052. The President will veto the bill unless significant \n     changes are made to address his major concerns. In \n     particular, the serious flaws in S. 1052 include:\n       S. 1052 circumvents the independent medical review process \n     in favor of litigation. The President believes that patients \n     should be given care first--litigation should be the last \n     resort. Patients should exhaust the medical review process \n     first, allowing doctors, not trial lawyers, to make decisions \n     about medical care.\n       S. 1052 jeopardizes health care coverage for workers and \n     their families by failing to avoid costly litigation. S. 1052 \n     overturns more than 25 years of Federal law that provides \n     uniformity and certainty for employers who voluntarily offer \n     health care benefits for millions of Americans across the \n     country. The liability provisions of S. 1052 would, for the \n     first time, expose employers and unions to at least 50 \n     different, inconsistent State-law standards. The result will \n     inevitably be that employers and unions will be forced to pay \n     for different benefits from State to State, even within a \n     particular State, based on varying precedents set in State \n     courts and leading to inconsistent standards of care for \n     patients. Further, S. 1052 imposes no limitations on State \n     court damages, and it is not clear whether existing State-law \n     caps would apply to the broad, new causes of action in State \n     courts that S. 1052 creates.\n       S. 1052 also would allow causes of action in Federal court \n     for violation of any duty under the plan, creating open-ended \n     and unpredictable lawsuits against employers for \n     administrative errors. These new Federal claims do not have \n     any limitations on the amount of\n\n[[Page S6556]]\n\n     noneconomic damages, creating virtually unrestrained damage \n     awards that are limited only by an excessive $5 million cap \n     on punitive damages.\n       Moreover, S. 1052 would subject employers and unions to \n     frequent litigation in State and Federal court under a vague \n     ``direct participation'' standard, which would require \n     employers and unions to defend themselves in court in \n     virtually every case against allegations that they ``directly \n     participated'' in a denial of benefits decision. Because such \n     determinations are inherently fact-specific, any such \n     allegation will force a costly and time-consuming court \n     process and result in varying State interpretations of \n     ``direct participation,'' forcing employers to adhere to \n     different standards in every State.\n       S. 1052 fails to provide a fair and comprehensive remedy to \n     all patients. The President believes the new Federal law \n     should establish a comprehensive set of rights and remedies \n     for patients. S. 1052 instead encourages costly litigation by \n     providing no effective limitations on frivolous class action \n     suits and allows trial lawyers to go on fishing expeditions \n     to seek remedies under other Federal statutes.\n       S. 1052 subjects physicians and all health care \n     professionals to greater liability risk. S. 1052 would expand \n     liability for physicians and all health care professionals in \n     State courts well beyond traditional medical malpractice by \n     permitting new, undefined causes of action in State courts \n     for denials of medical benefits. This expanded litigation \n     against physicians and all health professionals will create \n     an opportunity to circumvent State medical malpractice caps \n     that may not apply to these new causes of action.\n       Extraneous User Fee Provision. The Administration objects \n     to inclusion in S. 1052 of an extraneous revenue-raising \n     provision (section 502), which extends for multiple years \n     Customs charges on transportation, passengers, and \n     merchandise arriving in the country.\n       Pay-As-You-Go Scoring. S. 1052 would affect direct \n     spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go \n     requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. \n     OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of the bill is under \n     development.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. As the Senator from Oklahoma very rightly said, this \namendment provides 100-percent deductibility for the self-employed \nbeginning in January of next year, and accelerating that 100-percent \ndeductibility, which the Senate has been on record in support of, is \nvery germane and relevant to this bill.\n  I think at the heart of this bill is the question of access. At the \nheart of this bill is, are we doing more damage than we are good? In \nour efforts to provide patient protection, are we increasing by \nmillions the number who have no patient protections because they have \nno health insurance? That is, to me, a core fundamental question in \nthis debate. I believe this amendment that I have offered with Senator \nBond is a significant step--though far from all that is needed--in \nimproving access. It is something we should do and indeed we must do.\n  Sometimes, as we deal with the issue of liability, we forget exactly \nwhat kind of impact that liability will have. The President, in his \nstatement of administration policy, really homed in on the impact of a \nwide-open lawsuit provision such as he believes and I believe exists in \nthe Kennedy-McCain bill, what impact it would have on the uninsured. I \nthink he cites very accurate numbers as to the millions of people who \ncould well lose their health insurance were the Kennedy-McCain bill to \npass as it currently exists.\n  One survey found that roughly half of employers reported that they \nwould likely get out of the business of providing health care coverage \nif exposed to increased liability. Some people say these employers \naren't going to do that. How can they do that? This is essential to \noffer that benefit. You have to offer that to employees if you are \ngoing to be competitive.\n  Well, many small businesses in particular and, for that matter, large \ncorporations who are self-insuring today and are providing good health \nbenefits to employees or their associates, when faced with the prospect \nof going to Federal court or State court on a host of actions, costly \nactions, are going to question seriously, understandably, whether they \ncan operate in that kind of environment. Similarly, this study found \nthat 48 percent said that expanded liability would hinder care \nmanagement, and 80 percent said it would increase consumer costs.\n  The point is that even those employers who are able to continue to \noffer health insurance are going to find their costs going up and those \ncosts--they are not going to be able to absorb all of those costs, and \nthey are going to be passed on to employees and consumers. That is \ngoing to have a detrimental impact upon, I believe, the health care \nsystem in this country.\n  Sometimes cartoons can simplify a very complex issue down to \nsomething that is quite understandable to the average American or to \nthe average Senator. Today, in our statewide newspaper in the State of \nArkansas, the Arkansas Democratic Gazette, this cartoon appeared. It is \na Vic Harville cartoon. It sums up the concern a lot of us have about \nthe liability provisions in the Kennedy-McCain bill: ``Who will benefit \nthe most from a Patients' Bill of Rights?'' There is a gleeful, happy \nattorney with a nameplate: Will Cheat 'Em Attorney At Law.\n  There are going to be a lot of smiling attorneys, I am afraid, with \nthe Kennedy-McCain bill, as it is currently framed. I have a number of \nconcerns with the liability impact. The McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill has \nbeen called the Trial Lawyers' Bill Of Opportunities. We all want a \nPatients' Bill of Rights. The President, in the Statement of \nAdministration Policy, outlines specifically the patient protections he \nbelieves are essential that we provide millions of Americans. I think \nwe would have a 100-0 vote on those patient protections.\n  That is not good enough. Instead of finding a consensus bill that \nwill provide patient protections for millions who do not have those \nkinds of protections today, we have a bill that has a liability \nprovision, a right to sue not at the end of the road where there is an \ninsurance company that has abused their clients, but at any point \ncircumventing the internal-external appeal, the ability to go right \ninto court after 180 days and tie up not only the court system, but \nspend literally hundreds of millions of dollars in the defense of those \nsuits, whether they are meritorious or not.\n  This chart expresses some of my concerns with liability. It bypasses \nexternal review and brings lawsuits at any time. It allows forum \nshopping between State courts. So while there is agreement--I certainly \nbelieve a right to sue should be included at some point. When an \nemployee believes the insurance company has not treated them properly \nor has overridden a proper medical decision by that doctor, that \nindividual ought to have a right of appeal. They should have an \ninternal appeal that is accelerated, expedited.\n  If at that point they are not satisfied, they should be able to go \noutside the insurance company, have an expert independent review to \nlook at the issue and make a determination. If at that point the \ninsurance company says, we are going to ignore it, we are still not \ngoing to comply with the decision of the external reviewer, at that \npoint I think it is certainly appropriate there be a remedy.\n  The McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill allows lawsuits in Federal and State \ncourts relating to the same injury; it allows forum shopping; it allows \nfrivolous suits against employers for merely offering health insurance \nto their employees; that is, an employer is willing to take the risk of \nproviding health insurance, is willing to invest the cost, some 60 \npercent, some 75 percent, some paying entirely for those premiums. What \ndo they get for their willingness to provide that benefit? They get the \npossibility of frivolous lawsuits.\n  Frivolous? Yes, because they need not go through the internal-\nexternal appeals process. If they are willing to wait 180 days after \nthey discover the injury, they can go into court and leverage those \nfrivolous suits for some kind of negotiated agreement. Those \nsettlements will benefit trial lawyers. This is a bill of opportunities \nfor trial lawyers. They collect large contingency fees on unlimited \nnoneconomic and punitive damages. There is no limit; the sky is the \nlimit. Whatever a good trial lawyer can convince a jury should be the \ndamages and the sky is the limit on that.\n\n  It abuses the class action lawsuits because there is no limit on \nclass action lawsuits in the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill. All of these \nare great concerns to me.\n  Americans will pay for trial lawyers' opportunities. It is not a \nPatients' Bill of Rights so much as it is a lawyer's right to sue. At \nleast 1.2 million Americans will lose their health insurance. We have \nheard that figure 1.2, 1.3. That figure is based upon very conservative \nestimates by the Congressional Budget\n\n[[Page S6557]]\n\nOffice. Their estimate is that the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill will \nincrease premiums by 4.2 percent.\n  The President in his Statement of Administration Policy said he \nbelieves they are overly conservative. I believe they are overly \nconservative. The impact is going to be far greater.\n  At least 1.2 million Americans will lose their health insurance at a \ntime the number of uninsured has been increasing. The 43 million number \ngoes up, and that is a huge number of Americans who are uninsured.\n  Perhaps that is what some want. Maybe some want to increase the \nuninsured with a separate agenda to come back with radical changes in a \nhealth care system that I believe is the envy of the world. The \nevidence is people from all over the world come here to get the best \nquality health care. Millions of Americans will lose their health \ninsurance.\n  The average American family will pay at least $300 more in annual \npremiums. The Senate, in its wisdom, collectively and on a bipartisan \nbasis, just passed a tax relief bill, only the third time since World \nWar II in the sixties under President Kennedy, the eighties under \nPresident Reagan, and now under President George W. Bush we passed tax \nrelief for the American people. We are going to give a rebate check. \nThis $300 increase in the annual premium will quickly eat that up. It \nwill consume that little bit of tax rebate we were able to give in the \ntax package this year.\n  Americans will pay $200 billion more in extra premium costs over 10 \nyears. Over half of America's employers will increase health plan \ndeductibles and copays. It is not only that we are going to have 1.2 \nmillion or more lose health coverage altogether, but those who are able \nto stay insured are going to find their copays will increase; they are \ngoing to find their premiums will increase; that those are going to be \npassed on; their deductibles are going to be higher; and then the \nresult of this legislation will be thousands of new lawsuits clogging \nour already overcrowded courts.\n  This is often the case. If we have an unlimited, unbridled right to \nsue, the result will be that creative trial lawyers will find a way to \nget a case into court.\n  Our goal should not be to go to court. Our goal should be to ensure \npatients are protected, forgetting quality health care. We do not have \nto have a circumvention of the appeals process, the review process to \nassure that.\n  The gaping flaw in the Kennedy-McCain bill is that it allows \nthousands of new lawsuits to be filed in State court and Federal court \nwithout an exhaustion of the appeals process. Unlimited liability could \nbankrupt small businesses or force them to drop health coverage \naltogether.\n  Those are, in fact, some of my deep concerns about this legislation, \nand those concerns should drive us to amendments such as the one \nSenator Bond and I have proposed. The Hutchinson-Bond amendment \nprovides 100-percent deductibility beginning next year, not in 2003, \nand will save small employers, self-employed individuals millions of \ndollars. There is no justification for us continuing to delay what we \nhave recognized in this body on a bipartisan basis is an issue of \nequity.\n  The Wall Street Journal sometime back in one of their editorials \nwrote:\n\n       In the 18th century, doctors believed they could cure \n     patients by bleeding them with cuts or leeches. Modern \n     equipment is politicians who want to improve American \n     health care by unleashing the trial lawyers.\n\n  I note that not because anybody would be surprised that the Wall \nStreet Journal editorial page would have this, but the analogy is not \nfar off. My concern is we would pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. Ask \nthe American people that broad question, Do you favor a Patients' Bill \nof Rights? and you will get an overwhelming yes. Probably three-\nquarters of Americans would say yes.\n  Who could be against rights? Who could be against patients? But it's \ndifferent when asked, If you knew your employer would have to raise \nyour copay, your premium, your deductible, are you still for that \nPatients' Bill of Rights? if you knew your employer might not be able \nto continue to provide health insurance coverage, are you still for \nthat Patients' Bill of Rights?\n  My concern is we would pass a bill they say ``cures'' the problem of \npatients in health care plans with their rights not being protected, \nand the reality is we have made the malady worse. The problem we have \ncreated in exacerbating the problem of the uninsured is worse than the \nproblem we are trying to address.\n  I believe the biggest hoax perpetrated in the course of the debate \nover the last couple of years on a Patients' Bill of Rights is that a \nbill such as the Kennedy-McCain bill covers all Americans. To those who \nhave argued most States have enacted patient protection laws and we \nshould provide proper deference to those State patient bills of rights, \nthose States and situations are different. We have argued our proper \nresponsibility is to address the ERISA plans, the self-insured plans \nthat States cannot touch. States cannot provide protections for those. \nPeople in those plans are left unprotected unless we do something. The \nresponse on the other side has been, you are leaving millions out, you \nare not protecting them.\n  The great hoax has been to say that the Kennedy-McCain bill covers \nall Americans. It doesn't cover all Americans. It surely does not cover \nthe 43 million Americans who do not have insurance today. They don't \nget a thing out of the Patients' Bill of Rights except less chance they \nwill be able to receive health insurance.\n  I quoted the Wall Street Journal, and one might expect their \nsentiments on this subject. But listeners may be interested to know \nthat last month the Washington Post wrote on this subject:\n\n       Our instinct has been and remains that increasing access to \n     the courts should be a last resort, that Congress should \n     first try in this bill to create a credible and mainly \n     medical appellate system short of the courts for adjudicating \n     the denial of care. To the extent it can be avoided, it seems \n     to us not in the national interest to have the practice of \n     medicine governed by the fear of lawsuits. It will add to the \n     cost of care, though how much is in question. It is not clear \n     to us that it will add comparably to the quality. The higher \n     the costs, the larger the number of uninsured.\n\n  From the Washington Post to the Wall Street Journal, they are right:\n\n       The liability provisions in the Kennedy-McCain bill will \n     result in thousands of new lawsuits, higher costs on \n     premiums, higher costs on copay and deductibles for \n     consumers, and millions more people in the ranks of the \n     uninsured.\n\n  The Washington Post is right, we should have a remedy that is mainly \na medical appellate system, short of the courts, for adjudicating \ndenial of care. It is in the national interest to avoid having the \npractice of medicine governed by the fear of lawsuit.\n  They go on to say it will add to the cost. They are absolutely right.\n  Imagine--under the Kennedy-McCain bill one is allowed after 180 days, \nat the 181st day, to go straight to court. You are not required to \nappeal internally whatever the question is you are contesting--the \ndecision of the insurance company to not provide coverage. Perhaps the \ninsurance company says the contract is clear and that is not covered, \nor perhaps the insurance company does say it is not medically \njustified. As a patient and as an insuree, you object to that. You \nquestion that, but you don't bother to appeal it. And you wait. You \ndon't use the internal appeals process, which most managed care \ncompanies have already established and which by law we would, under the \nPatients' Bill of Rights, establish. They never bother to go through \nthe external appeals court, even though under the proposed bills that \nwould be expedited. You would get quick care, a quick decision on the \nexternal appeals. They don't do that. Instead, they wait. And they \nwait.\n  After 180 days, a very creative, very enterprising lawyer talks to \nthat patient and says: Haven't you just discovered that you were \nwronged? Without any requirement under this legislation to go through \nthe appeals process, that individual, with his creative, enterprising \nlawyer, can go straight to court.\n  One would think if they were wronged, they would have a remedy, even \nafter 6 months, a year, or 10 years, because there is no limit when \nthat individual can file the lawsuit after disregarding the appeals \nprocess. One would think perhaps after that long length of time they \ncould have a remedy.\n  As I have said before, studies indicate medical malpractice claims \ntake an average of 16 months to file. Even after\n\n[[Page S6558]]\n\nthe 6 months of waiting, on the 181st day the lawsuit is processed, you \nhave another long period of time--on average, 16 months--to have the \nlawsuit filed. On average, it requires 25 months to resolve the \nlawsuit. That is another 2 years. And then after there is a decision \nmade of a lawsuit, it requires on average another 5 years to receive \npayment. That is what we are doing in the Kennedy-McCain bill. In the \nopen-ended lawsuit provision, we are in the end going to reward the \nprocess and the lawyers.\n  The tort system returns less than 50 cents on the dollar to the very \npeople it is designed to help and less than 25 cents on the dollar for \nactual economic loss. Even if one figures 50 cents on the dollar, \nmonths, years, you file it, years more to get to court, decisions \nrendered, years more to collect the payment--what, I ask my colleagues, \nwhat does that have to do with quality health care? What does that have \nto do with ensuring that a patient is getting the best possible health \ncare provision under their insurance policy? I suggest it has very \nlittle, if anything. The right to sue should exist. But it should only \nexist after the appeals process has been exhausted.\n  When we talk about this being an opportunity for trial lawyers, it is \nexactly that. It is the trial lawyers who are the big winners.\n  I offer this amendment today to address this access issue. There will \nbe other amendments that will address more clearly the liability \nconcerns I have expressed. Because the liability alone, we know, and \nthe CBO says, it is the second leading component increasing costs in \nthe Kennedy-McCain legislation. This is the big contributor to \nincreased premium costs, the big contributor to loss of insurance by \nhundreds of thousands of Americans.\n  The amendment I have offered providing 100-percent deductibility \nhelps address this access issue and the concern about the uninsured.\n  I reiterate, because I think it is very important as we look at the \namendment and consider how important it is, who are the self-employed? \nWho are the people to whom we are trying to provide relief? We know \nthere are a lot of them. According to the Employee Benefit Research \nInstitute, there are 12.5 million self-employed individuals in this \ncountry and 3.1 million of those self-employed individuals are \nuninsured. That means they don't have a spouse who is employed \nsomewhere with an insurance plan. It means they aren't working part-\ntime. They are simply uninsured. They are unprotected.\n  That is almost one out of four in this pool of self-employed \nindividuals. Nearly 70 percent of these individuals earn less than \n$50,000 annually. I think that is an important point to make because \nmany think of self-employed and equate self-employed with business \npeople, and they are usually. They think of those business people as \nbeing affluent, wealthy individuals. According to the Congressional \nResearch Service, based on the 1998 current population survey, 70 \npercent of these self-employed individuals are hardly high income. They \nmake less than $50,000 a year. So think about those who can't afford \nthe insurance. Think about people who make less than $35,000 a year not \nreceiving equal treatment for what they can deduct on their health care \npremiums and one out of four of them cannot afford to buy to really get \nthe picture.\n  To understand the importance of this amendment, you have to look not \njust at the 3.1 million who are uninsured but you have to look at their \nfamily members. When you count the number of family members with self-\nemployed family heads, we are now talking about 21.6 million Americans \nwho would benefit from the Hutchinson-Bond amendment, including 6.4 \nmillion children. Now, of those 6.4 million children who are going to \nbenefit because you get 100 percent deductibility, currently 1 million \nare uninsured.\n  So I ask my colleagues to think about 1 million children who are \nwithout insurance today whose parents would perhaps be able to purchase \nthat insurance under the 100 percent deductibility provision. So I \nthink it is critically important that be adopted.\n  Madam President, I have one correction to make in my remarks. I \nreferred earlier to a cartoon that appeared in a Statewide newspaper. \nIt was from the Don Rey Media, not the Democratic Gazette. I give a \nplug for the Gazette, but, in fact, the cartoon was in the Don Rey \nMedia, and it did very well portray what faces us today. If you are \npaying $6,000 a year in premiums, and you are able to deduct 60 percent \nof your premiums, that is $3,600, and you will have a savings of $972. \nIf this amendment that is pending before the Senate right now passes, \ninstead of $972, 100 percent deductibility will turn that into $1,620 \nand that will be an additional savings of $648. At least for the self-\nemployed, that will offset the additional costs that the Kennedy-McCain \nbill will have upon premiums. So it is worth supporting from the \nstandpoint that it has been a battle fought for years. It has been \nsomething recognized for a long time; that we have unfairness; we have \na disparity, an inequity in the Tax Code.\n  Senator Bond, to his credit, and Senator Nickles worked and worked to \nclip away at that disparity, and we got 60 percent of the way there. \nThere is no reason, there is no excuse for us not to immediately go to \nthe 100 percent deductibility and in so doing save millions of dollars \nfor those who are out there trying to keep this economy going. I know \nthat there has been broad support for this concept in the past. I \nbelieve there will be broad support as this amendment is debated. I \ntalked to a number of my colleagues on the floor about the importance \nof this amendment.\n  I believe that access is going to be the center of debate as we go \nthrough the Kennedy-McCain bill. If we cannot address the access issue, \nif we cannot address a wide-open lawsuit issue and put some real \nrestraints in what is currently an unbridled prospect for thousands of \nnew lawsuits, then we will have done a disservice and we really have \nbeen disingenuous with the American people. We will have passed a bill \nsaying it is a Patients' Bill of Rights without a real understanding by \nthe American people of what the impact is going to be on their day-to-\nday lives. Nothing illustrates that more than the kind of push polls \nthat have been done in which the questions have been posed in terms of \nraising premiums, raising the cost of health insurance, the possibility \nof losing health insurance and how that affects attitude towards a \nPatients' Bill of Rights.\n  So access to emergency rooms, I will agree on that. The President has \nsupported that. The McCain-Kennedy bill has emergency room access \nprovisions. The Nickles bill last year had emergency room access \nprovisions. The Frist legislation covers that concern.\n  Many of the stories that have been portrayed in this Chamber have \ndealt with the horrors of those who were denied immediate access to an \nemergency room. We have heard examples about tragedies that have \noccurred because of that. These tragedies would be addressed in any one \nof the patients' bill of rights. That is not the core of the debate \nbefore us. Access to pediatricians, access to OB/GYNs--the President \nlisted those commonly agreed upon patient protection provisions.\n  That is not what is at issue. That is not what is at debate in this \nChamber. What is at debate is not access to ERs, access to \npediatricians or OB/GYNs. The debate is access to health insurance.\n\n  I am determined, and I know my colleagues are as well, that we not \nlose focus of what an ill-conceived patients' bill of rights is, which \nis the Kennedy-McCain bill as it is currently constructed, and what it \nwould do to access to health insurance. We are going to keep the focus \nupon not only the 43 million who do not have it now but the millions \nmore who would lose their health insurance were this bill to pass in \nits current form.\n  My colleague from Oklahoma pointed out some of the provisions in this \nKennedy-McCain bill that address issues that come before the Finance \nCommittee. The Senator from South Carolina expressed that, while being \na previous cosponsor of the 100 percent deductibility, he could not \nsupport this amendment because of the jurisdictional issue. Perhaps \nthere are other Senators who share that concern. So I want to remind my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, those who are members of the \nHELP Committee, as I am, and those who are members of the Finance \nCommittee, that there are a number of provisions within the \njurisdiction of the Finance Committee that\n\n[[Page S6559]]\n\nare already in the bill. The provisions were never debated before the \nFinance Committee, but they are in the bill. It is kind of disingenuous \nwhen you have something that is going to benefit taxpayers, going to \nprovide full deductibility for the self-employed, to say we don't want \nthat in the bill when there are already a horde of provisions in the \nbill that come under the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee.\n  I am sure at some point there is going to be an explanation as to why \ncustom user fees is in this Patients' Bill of Rights, why the custom \nuser fees, Medicare payment shifts, and Social Security transfers are \nincluded. We talk a lot about the sanctity of the Social Security trust \nfund. There are some issues regarding Social Security. All of those \ncome under the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee and were never \ndebated by the committee. There were no witnesses, no hearings, no \npeople to come in and explain why they are going to be in this hugely \nimportant bill, but they are there.\n  And so for those who may be concerned that we have a provision that \nwould normally go to the Finance Committee, I say, well, let's take a \nlook at all of these. At least this one is going to increase access, \nnot decrease it; at least this one is going to ensure that more people \nare going to buy more health insurance and those million people who are \ncurrently in households in which the head of the household is self-\nemployed that is not eligible for the 100 percent deductibility is \ngoing to be addressed.\n  Now, the bill reduces revenues. I have alluded to that. And some may \nquestion about having those kinds of provisions in the bill. In fact, \nthe McCain-Kennedy bill reduces the Social Security tax revenues by \nnearly $7 billion over 10 years. So it is going to have a pretty \nsignificant impact upon revenues--$7 billion in Social Security. That \nis the estimated impact of passing this bill. If you pass this bill, \nthat is the impact it will have upon payments into the Social Security \nSystem. It ought to concern us if it is going to have that kind of \nimpact upon employment in this country.\n  So we have a bill that we have to work on. We are going to have a lot \nof amendments in the days to come, and we have a good one to start \nwith, one that will provide that 100 percent deductibility and increase \naccessibility.\n  I see my colleague from the State of Kentucky has come to the floor, \nand I know he has expressed interest in this amendment. He has been a \nlong-time supporter of small business and of providing 100 percent \ndeductibility as quickly as is possible for these who have been treated \nunfairly in our Tax Code. He has expressed interest not only in \nsupporting it but speaking in behalf of the amendment. I yield for the \nSenator from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, first of all, my good friend from \nArkansas has been a champion of full deductibility for health care for \nthe uninsured and the self-employed for a long time. I also supported \nthat in the House of Representatives on the Ways and Means Committee, \nand since I have arrived here in the Senate.\n  Even more important than just the deductibility for the self-\nemployed, I would like to talk generally on the Patients' Bill of \nRights and the two competing bills we have before us today.\n  Rarely is there a piece of legislation that so directly affects the \nAmerican people's health and well-being as the debate we are having \nright now.\n  It's important right at the start to point out that every Senator \nhere agrees about one thing--patients come first.\n  We all have the same goals here--making sure that patients get the \ncare they need without interference from their insurers and without \ndriving up costs.\n  But the competing bills before us take two different approaches.\n  In writing a Patients' Bill of Rights, we're trying to strike a \nbalance, and the Kennedy-McCain bill fails that test.\n  As we debate this health care bill, it's important to keep some \nperspective and to remember how we got to this point because recent \ncongressional health care debates set the stage for the legislation \nbefore us today.\n  Over the past decade, Congress has wrestled with health care \ninsurance legislation a number of times.\n  In the late 1980s, there was the Medicare catastrophic bill that we \npassed and then the next year we repealed it.\n  There was the Clinton health care bill that failed. Then we worked on \nthe Kassebaum portability bill.\n  Now the latest version of the fight comes on the Patients' Bill of \nRights.\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle now say they're \ninterested in ``improving'' the private employer-provided health care \nsystem that we currently enjoy in this country.\n  But I have to admit that I am more than a little bit skeptical about \nthat. Many of my friends who now claim to want to improve our current \nsystem were just a few years ago trying to get rid of it altogether \nwith the Clinton bill.\n  And many of them still openly admit that their ultimate goal is \nsingle-payor, government-run health care--a Washington-mandated, one-\nsize-fits-all health care system.\n  Now many of us have the same fear that the Kennedy-McCain bill is \njust the first step down the regulatory path to socialized medicine.\n  We still remember the nightmare of the Clinton health care bill.\n  Many of us thought that was a trojan horse that was set up on purpose \nto fail in order to help make it easier for many of my Democrat friends \nto reach their final goal--to step in with a government-run, single \npayor health care program.\n  The words surrounding the debate about that bill sounded good, just \nlike some of the rhetoric we hear today about Kennedy-McCain.\n  The Clinton health bill was going to be the best thing since sliced \nbread. It was going to provide all Americans access to health care at \nan affordable cost.\n  But it was a bad bill. It was drafted behind closed doors by a secret \ntask force. There were no hearings. No input from the public, until a \nfederal court ordered it.\n  In fact, the reason that they were hiding it for so long was that it \nwas just another old-fashioned liberal social program in disguise.\n  Now we are hearing the claims that the Kennedy-McCain bill is going \nto do all of these great things for patients--guaranteed treatments, \nclinical trials for cancer patients, access to specialists.\n  But the bill before us today hasn't ever been before a Senate \ncommittee for a hearing, and it's been two years since the Senate last \ndebated it.\n  In fact, the latest version of the Kennedy-McCain bill was only \nintroduced last Thursday night. Now we're being told that we have to \npass it immediately and that the Democrats think it's so good that it \ndoesn't even need to be amended.\n  I think I have heard this song before.\n  Thanks to the good judgment of Congress in 1994, we were able to \ndefeat a national health insurance proposal.\n  But today I am afraid that many of my friends who support socialized \nmedicine are still trying to reach their goal, just by different means.\n  So I think we need to take a long hard look at this bill so that \nevery Senator understands exactly what's in it.\n  From what I have seen so far, it is not very good.\n  There are a number of problems with the bill.\n  First we know Kennedy-McCain is going to raise costs. The neutral \nexperts at the Congressional Budget Office tell us its going to \nincrease costs by 4.2 percent above inflation.\n  Health care experts tell us that for every 1 percent increase in \ncosts, 300,000 Americans will lose their health coverage.\n  That means that if Kennedy-McCain passes, over 1.2 million Americans \nare going to lose their health insurance.\n  I just do no understand why those who support this bill, who usually \nargue that we need to cover more of the uninsured and hold the line on \ncosts, now are pushing so hard for a bill that does just the opposite.\n  Another troubling part of the Kennedy-McCain bill is its reliance on \nlawsuits as a means to promote better health care.\n  It is just common sense: lawsuits don't lead to better medical care. \nGetting the lawyers involved isn't going to drive down costs, or \ndeliver care faster.\n  I can understand in outrageous situations that the threat of a \nlawsuit\n\n[[Page S6560]]\n\nmight be needed as a last report. But in Kennedy-McCain, they are the \nfirst option.\n  In fact, the most troubling part about Kennedy-McCain is that it \ncould in fact lead to lawsuits by employees against employers over \nhealth coverage. That is the last thing we need and could eventually \nlead to the end of our current employer-based health insurance system.\n  I know that sounds drastic, but it is just common sense.\n  If any employee can sue their employer because they are unhappy with \ntheir health coverage, the employer is going to do one of two things: \ndrop the coverage and simply give the employee cash to buy their own \ninsurance--or worse just drop the benefit altogether.\n  Recent news reports tell us what happens to health care when lawsuits \nflourish. For instance, in Mississippi, where there has recently been a \ndramatic increase in forum shopping by plaintiffs' lawyers, 44 insurers \nhave left the state.\n  Recent studies by the General Accounting Office show that the average \nmedical malpractice claim takes 33 months to resolve. Most patients \ncan't wait that long. I don't see how making it easier for them to sue \nis going to help anyone except the lawyers.\n  Usually here in Congress we try to make laws simpler, and to cut down \non lawsuits, not to encourage more. Making it easier to sue might sound \ngood to those who are angry about their health care, but it's only a \nknee-jerk, feel-good reaction that isn't going to help anybody get \nmedical care any faster.\n  Finally, if Kennedy-McCain is so good, why doesn't it apply to \neveryone? Millions of Americans aren't covered by it. Medicare and \nMedicaid recipients, and all of those who get coverage from their \nunions through collective bargaining agreements, they are not covered.\n  While I admit that I don't want Kennedy-McCain to pass, I have to \nadmit that I am surprised that my friends who support the bill, who \ntell us what a good effort it is, don't want it to apply to every \nsingle American.\n  Instead of the Kennedy-McCain bill, I hope my colleagues take a good \nlong, hard look at the Breaux-Frist proposal. The heart of Breaux-Frist \nis a new impartial medical review to make sure that patients get the \ncare they need quickly, without getting bogged down in courts and \nlawsuits. Patients are guaranteed access to independent medical review \nto ensure that doctors, not HMOs, are making medical decisions. Breaux-\nFrist gives States flexibility. While providing new Federal rights. The \nlegislation stays out of the way of States that have already made \nprogress in protecting patients. It creates a floor, not a ceiling, \nwhen it comes to protecting patients' rights.\n  Breaux-Frist also guarantees access to care through comprehensive \npatient protections. It guarantees emergency room coverage under the \nprudent layperson standard, and direct access to OB-GYNs for women and \npediatricians for children. Best of all, Breaux-Frist ensures that \nemployers are not going to be held liable for health decisions. And \nBreaux-Frist covers everyone--all 170 million Americans who get their \ncoverage through private health plans.\n  For health plans that fail to comply with these independent reviews, \npatients will be able, as a last resort, to sue in Federal court. It \nprovides a clear-cut, sensible process that will help patients get care \nand hold HMOs accountable.\n  Most importantly, we know that the President will sign Breaux-Frist \ninto law. He won't sign Kennedy-McCain. If the supporters of Kennedy-\nMcCain really want to pass a bill that becomes law, they will help us \nto amend it and improve it. If they do not, we will just continue to \ntalk in Congress without getting anything done.\n  I would like to conclude by telling my colleagues about what will \nhappen if we end up passing Kennedy-McCain. Seven years ago, in \nKentucky, we passed a version of the Clinton health bill. It promised \nbetter care to patients through increased regulation and lawsuits. But \nguess what happened. Health care in Kentucky went downhill. For \nstarters, all of the private insurers left the State. We used to have \n60. After the Clinton-Lite bill passed, we had two. The number of \nuninsured Kentuckians rose. Costs increased. Medical care became more \nexpensive and harder to get. Ever since then we have been trying to fix \nour health care laws, and we have managed to get back to five different \ninsurers who will now offer coverage in Kentucky.\n  Employer-provided coverage in Kentucky nearly collapsed. Passing \nMcCain-Kennedy could be the first step down this road for the Nation, \nand I can tell my friends it is a path we don't want to take.\n  Republicans want a bill. Democrats want a bill. If we work together, \nI think we can get one. But Kennedy-McCain is not the answer. It has to \nbe changed or nothing else is going to change. And the patients will \nlose.\n  Madam President, I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I see my friend from Arizona is in the Chamber.\n  Does the Senator wish to seek recognition?\n  Mr. McCAIN. For about a minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I understand the amendment that is being \nproposed. It contains provisions, as I understand it, that were dropped \nin conference on the tax bill we passed not long ago. I think the \nSenator from Texas would confirm that. Is that right?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I do not know. I was trying to find out.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It was, I believe, not accepted in conference. Obviously, \nwe would like to do everything we can to encourage employers and \nemployees to be able to obtain health care plans.\n  What I am concerned about is the possibility that this would open up \nother tax provisions that might be added to the bill. Also, there is \nthe blue slip problem that would apply because it is a revenue issue \nthat does not originate in the other body. Again, I think the Senator \nfrom Texas would recognize that is a problem that we face in this \namendment.\n  So I wonder if the proponents of the amendment would agree to a \nunanimous consent request, which I will state now and explain as \nfollows: That the time between now and 5:30 be equally divided between \nSenator Hutchinson and Senator Kennedy, or their designees, for debate \non the pending amendment; that no second-degree amendments be in order \nto the amendment; and that at 5:30 the amendment be agreed to, and that \nthere be no further revenue or blue slip material amendments in order \nto this bill; further, that when S. 1052 is read a third time, it be \nlaid aside and the Senate immediately turn to the consideration of \nCalendar No. 69, H.R. 10; that all after the enacting clause be \nstricken, and the text of S. 1052 be substituted in lieu thereof; the \nbill be read a third time, and the Senate proceed to vote on final \npassage of the bill; that the Senate insist on its amendment, request a \nconference with the House, and the Chair be authorized to appoint \nconferees.\n  What I mean by this unanimous consent request is that in order to \navoid the so-called ``blue slip'' problem, that this amendment would be \nadopted, but when the bill is laid aside for the first time, we would \ntake up a House revenue bill which is pending here in the Senate on the \ncalendar, and add that provision to the bill, thereby avoiding the \nproblem of it being negated.\n  I note the Senator from Oklahoma is in the Chamber as well. I would \nbe glad to discuss this unanimous consent request with my colleagues to \nsee if they would give it some consideration, so we could discuss \ngetting it done.\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator propounding a unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, reserving the right to object, let me \nfirst say that obviously Members can only answer for themselves.\n  I would have no objection to trying to deal with a potential blue \nslip problem through unanimous consent. The House bill will almost \ncertainly contain a provision related to access to\n\n[[Page S6561]]\n\nhealth care, and so the two bills would be conformable in that way. Nor \ndo I have any concern about taking up a House measure which would be a \nfurther guarantee against the blue slip problem. If we put in a quorum \ncall and worked this out or had debate while we worked it out, all that \ncould be worked out.\n  Where I think we might run into problems is that there are two \nproblems in terms of access to health care. One is the self-employed \nwho have to pay both parts of their health care coverage. The other is \nvery low income people who don't get health insurance through their \njobs. You then have a very small--and I know the Senator is aware--you \nhave a very small revenue component in medical savings accounts. I \nwould not want to limit our ability to at least debate the other two \nparts of the problem. But within the constraints of those problems, I \nthink there might be room to debate it. I don't want to preclude our \nability to offer, for example, a medical savings account amendment \nbecause I think that is very important as part of this access.\n  I understand this amendment. I very strongly support it. I want to be \nsure we have a chance, if we fix it for the self-employed, that we fix \nit for very low income people who don't get health insurance through \ntheir jobs. I can assure the Senator that for my part--and I am sure on \nbehalf of every Republican--we are not trying to create a technical \n``gotcha'' problem here. We can work together to fix that problem, if \nthat would make this amendment more acceptable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I believe the bill already has a blue \nslip problem. There is already a tax increase in the bill, section 502, \nthat extends customs user fees from the year 2003 to the year 2011. \nThat is blue slip material. It is already there.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I don't agree. I don't agree. We will be glad to debate \nthat and have a parliamentary decision on it.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am informing my colleague, there are revenue measures \nin the bill right now. I don't think whether there is an additional \namendment or not would have any additional impact on blue slip. I am \nperfectly willing, as the Senator from Texas said, to set up a way of \ntaking up a House-passed bill and substituting the entire text of \nwhatever we pass to avoid that. I am happy to cooperate in doing that \nat some point. I will be happy to work with my friend from Arizona to \ndo that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senators.\n  I guess the Senator from New Hampshire had also a reservation.\n  Mr. GREGG. The point I was concerned about was, there are parts of \nthis unanimous consent with which I could agree, but the two points the \nSenator from Texas and the Senator from Oklahoma have made are equally \nof concern to me. Maybe there is a way to work this out, but in its \npresent form I have a serious reservation about it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I would object. I would like to also ask \nthat our staffs sit down together to see if we can work these problems \nout. I reiterate, we are not trying to create a technical problem here. \nWe are worried about people losing their health insurance. We want to \nbe sure we are doing other things to promote it. If the Senator is \nwilling to work with us, we will try to work out the problem he has \nraised to everybody's satisfaction, and then perhaps later today or \ntomorrow we could do a unanimous consent request on a bipartisan basis \nto which we could agree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Arizona retains the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my friends from Texas as well as \nfrom Oklahoma and New Hampshire. We would like to sit down and see if \nwe can work this out. Whether the Senator from Texas intends there to \nbe a problem or not, there is a problem on passage of this amendment. \nSo I appreciate the intentions of all involved here, but the fact is, \nthere will be a technical problem because of raising revenue. I would \nlike to work that out, and we will sit down and begin conversations \nabout it.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will yield on that point.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. I do believe that problem can be worked out. Actually, the \nlanguage for working it out is in this unanimous consent request. It is \njust that the unanimous consent request goes significantly further than \nthat. That is where I think we have to sit down and see if we can't \nreach some accommodation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I understand. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, may I proceed for 30 seconds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in response to the Senator from Oklahoma, \nwe have been assured, from the Budget Committee, the Finance Committee, \nand the Ways and Means Committee, that there is no blue slip problem. \nAnyone can raise this and challenge those authorities, and maybe they \nwill. At least we want to give assurances to the membership that we did \nanticipate this issue. We have received those assurances from the \nleaders. I believe we received them in a bipartisan way as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have been on this amendment now for 2 \nhours. The debate has been good. We are arriving at a point where we \nmight be able to offer a unanimous consent agreement as to when we \nwould terminate this debate.\n  I say to everyone: We do not intend to arbitrarily cut off debate on \nany amendments. But we should also understand that it is up to the \npeople who oppose the Patients' Bill of Rights to offer the amendments \nthey believe will improve the bill. We have today; that includes the \nevening hours. We have part of the day tomorrow. As had been announced \nby the two leaders some time ago, there will be no activity in the \nSenate in the way of votes on Monday. There could be some debate taking \nplace. We have Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday to finish the bill, if \nwe are going to go to the Fourth of July recess as has been planned. \nThat is to begin on Friday.\n\n  Again, Senator Daschle, the majority leader, has said if we do not \nfinish this Thursday night, we are going to work Friday, Saturday, \nSunday, Monday, Tuesday, take Wednesday off, which is the Fourth of \nJuly, and come back on Thursday and begin the bill again. We are going \nto finish.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. I believe there is a unanimous consent to which this side \nis agreeable which has been circulated from your side, and we are \nwilling to proceed with that at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time on \nthe pending amendment prior to a vote in relation to the amendment at \n5:30 be divided as follows: Senator Kennedy or his designee to control \n30 minutes of debate; Senator Hutchinson or his designee to control the \nremaining time, including the last 15 minutes prior to the vote; that \nat 5:30 the Senate vote in relation to the Hutchinson amendment; that \nupon completion of the vote at 5:30, Senator McCain be recognized to \noffer a sense-of-the-Senate amendment regarding clinical trials; the \namendment be debated this evening; and then when the Senate resumes \nconsideration of the bill tomorrow at 9:30, the time prior to 11 a.m. \nbe divided between Senator McCain and Senator Gregg or their designees; \nand then a vote in relation to the McCain amendment occur at 11 a.m.; \nand then following the disposition of the McCain amendment, Senator \nGregg or his designee be recognized to offer an amendment; that no \nsecond-degree amendments be in order to either the Hutchinson or McCain \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. It is not my intention to object. I haven't seen the \nMcCain\n\n[[Page S6562]]\n\namendment. Would it be possible for us to get a copy of that amendment?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes. While the Senator was asking, we never received the \nHutchinson amendment until it was offered either. As we proceed, what \nwe would like to try to do, for the benefit of the Members, is to at \nleast have the two or three amendments on either side so that the \nMembers are familiar with the material and would have knowledge as to \nwhat those amendments are. I think that might save a good deal of time \nin terms of the explanation of the amendments and the disposition of \nthem. We will make every effort to make those available. And we hope--\nif I may have the Senator's attention--that that would be reciprocal \nand we might have the amendment you also intend to offer tomorrow.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I seek recognition under Senator Kennedy's time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I stand in opposition to the amendment \noffered by Senators Hutchinson and Bond. At the outset, this is an \nissue I have worked on as long as I have been in Congress--extending \nthe tax deductibility of health insurance premiums for self-employed \npeople in this country.\n  What we face in this country today is a terrible situation where \nthose in small business and family farms cannot deduct their health \ninsurance premiums as those who work for major corporations can. At a \ntime when more and more people are losing health insurance, this is \ncertainly a policy change that needs to take place.\n  Yet I rise today in opposition to this amendment. Let me tell you why \nI do. Only a month ago on this floor of the Senate, I offered an \namendment to the tax bill which would have provided the self-employed \nwith a full 100-percent tax deduction. That was a month ago when we \nwere considering a tax bill where we were providing benefits to \nindividuals and families.\n  What happened to my amendment? Well, my amendment was accepted by my \nRepublican colleagues. They put it in the bill in the Senate, and they \nkilled it in the conference. That is right. They said they accepted it \non the floor, and when it went to conference committee on the tax bill, \nthey yanked it out and eliminated it. It is the same provision being \noffered today on the Republican side as part of this bill that was \neliminated by the Republican majority in the conference committee on \nthis tax bill. The tax bill had $1.3 trillion in benefits it could \nprovide over a 10-year period of time, and the Republican majority \ncould not find $2 billion to provide the very tax deduction they are \nasking for today.\n  It raises an important question. If this issue was important enough \nfor us to include it in the tax bill, why did they eliminate it when \nthey went to conference committee? Second, why is it being offered \ntoday?\n\n  The second question, I think, bears some exposition here. That is \nobvious. This is a Patients' Bill of Rights. This is a bill which the \nhealth insurance industry opposes. They oppose it because it will eat \ninto their profits and instead is going to empower families and \nbusinesses and individuals across America, when it comes to their \nhealth insurance, to finally stand up and say that doctors should make \nmedical decisions, not insurance companies.\n  On the Republican side, they are offering killer amendments in an \neffort to scuttle and stop this bill. They know that if they can put a \ntax amendment on this bill, it is over. So they come in and say they \nwant to offer tax deductibility for the self-employed people when it \ncomes to health insurance premiums--the very position they eliminated \nwhen they had a chance to pass it a few weeks ago on the tax bill.\n  It wasn't good enough for the tax bill, but it is the very first \nthing they want to offer when it comes to the Patients' Bill of Rights. \nExcuse me if I question whether or not their strategy reflects their \nsincerity. If they were sincere about helping self-employed people, \nthey would have included it in a $1.3 trillion tax bill and not put it \nin the Patients' Bill of Rights in an effort to kill this important \nlegislation.\n  We have waited 5 years for this bill. We have worked out a bipartisan \ncompromise with Senator John McCain, Senator John Edwards of North \nCarolina and, of course, Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts, who has \nbeen a leader on this issue.\n  The other side, the opponents, are desperate to kill this bill. They \nunderstand that every health professional organization in America that \nhas taken a position has supported the bipartisan legislation we have \non the floor. They are desperate to find a strategy and a tactic to \nstop the bill, nevertheless.\n  The health insurance industry wants the bill to die, and now they \nwant to kill it with kindness--the kindness of a tax break for the \nself-employed. Where was that kindness a month ago when the conference \ncommittee met on the tax bill? It wasn't there. You could not put it in \nthe bill that really counted. You want to put it on this bill to put an \nend to the debate.\n  We are not going to fall for that. Those who have supported this \nprovision throughout our careers are not going to let you kill the \nPatients' Bill of Rights by putting on a provision which you rejected \nin your own tax bill just a few weeks ago. I urge my colleagues to join \nme in continuing to fight for the deductibility of health insurance \npremiums for the self-employed, but don't do it at the expense of this \nimportant legislation that gives individuals and families and \nbusinesses across America the protection they deserve when it comes to \ntheir health insurance.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I came to Washington with the Senator from Illinois. I \ncan't remember a session of Congress where he didn't promote this \nissue. The Senator's fingerprints are all over this legislation. The \nSenator has certainly portrayed what is happening with this bill. They \nare taking the Senator's amendment and putting their name on it and \ntrying to kill this bill. I am anxious to see what the next one is \ngoing to be. It will be someone else's amendment that they have killed \nin the past to try to kill this Patients' Bill of Rights.\n\n  The Senator from Illinois has said it so well. Here is legislation \nthat has been yours for almost 20 years. It was put in a tax bill, and \nnow I read in the paper it is not $1.3 trillion, it is $1.8 trillion--\nand for a speck of that, they eliminated the Senator's provision. I \ndon't know if they planned that, to come back and do it here, or if it \nis something they picked up recently. But I know the Senator from \nIllinois will be forced to vote against his own amendment. I have \nalways joined him in his efforts to pass the legislation. I will join \nthe Senator from Illinois because we cannot fall for, in my words, this \ncheap trick.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time does he have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes 40 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Does the Senator not find this somewhat disingenuous \nthat the administration had made the recommendation on the Durbin \namendment for the business community, for the self-employed, and these \nRepublicans dropped it, put it aside; they didn't make it a priority \nfor their tax break? The administration came up with $60 billion to try \nto help the uncovered with insurance, and they dropped that. And now \ntwo of the principal reasons they give from this side are that they are \nnot taking care of business and they are not taking care of the \nuninsured. I mean, if this was such a big priority on their side, why \ndidn't they fight for it when they had the opportunity? Does that not \nlead one to believe that rather than being serious about getting these \nachievements and providing some relief, they basically want to sink \nthis bill?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Massachusetts is correct. The \nRepublicans and those supporting their positions cannot come to this \nfloor and argue, I think, with a straight face that American families \ndon't need protection when it comes to their own health insurance. They \nare not standing here and arguing that, really, health insurance clerks \nshould make decisions, not doctors.\n\n[[Page S6563]]\n\n  So they have come in with a new strategy. A month ago, this idea of \nproviding the deductibility of health insurance premiums for the self-\nemployed was good enough to adopt on the Senate floor and kill in \nconference on their tax bill. Now they are coming back and saying that \nreally is the highest priority. We have to go back to that old \nargument, to that old position. Well, I think people can see through \nit.\n  You had your chance, you had your tax bill. This was the bill that \nwas supposed to help families across America. We know what happened. \nForty percent of all the benefits in that tax bill went to people \nmaking over $300,000 a year. Instead of finding even $2 billion out of \n$1.8 trillion to help those small businesses and family farmers, no, \nthe highest priority was the wealthiest 1 percent of America. Well, \nthat was your decision. That was your tax bill. I voted against it. I \nwill vote against it again if you come back with it.\n  Instead, let's vote for something and say that after 5 years we are \ngoing to pass a bipartisan bill that for the first time will hold \nhealth insurance companies accountable for their actions like every \nother business in America. I know that is a dagger in the heart of the \nhealth insurance industry. They want to continue to be a special \nprivileged class that never has to answer when they make decisions \nwhich deny basic medical treatment to families and individuals. Those \ndays are numbered.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to reject this amendment for what \nit is. This is an effort to derail an important piece of legislation. \nLet us stick with and support the Patients' Bill of Rights. Let us not \nfall for this ploy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Boy, I have to smile. I am sincere about this, and I \nresent it being portrayed as, I believe, a ``cheap trick.'' It was \ncalled a ploy, an effort to derail. It is none of that. It is a sincere \nconcern about those who are self-employed and who do not get equal \ntreatment. It is a sincere concern that this legislation does not \nempower anybody but trial lawyers, and that the big issue in this whole \ndebate is access.\n\n  I am sincerely trying to address an issue about which I have been \nconcerned, and I know the Senator from Illinois has, but it is no \neffort to derail. If I had been on the conference committee, I assure \nthe Senator from Illinois I would have fought as hard as I could have \nwith every fiber of my being to ensure this very important provision \nwas included in the tax bill. Unfortunately, I was not on the tax \nconference committee, and so my alternative was to come to this Chamber \nand try to do the right thing. I assure the Senator from Illinois that \nis what I am trying to do.\n  I also remind him that every Patients' Bill of Rights that has ever \npassed the House of Representatives has included tax incentives for \nhealth care. Every Patients' Bill of Rights that has ever passed the \nSenate has included tax incentives for health care. The bill the House \nof Representatives is likely to pass within the next few weeks will \nundoubtedly, will with a certainty contain tax access provisions, as it \nshould.\n  If the Senate does not adopt its own tax incentives and access \nprovisions, we will be at a distinct disadvantage as we go into the \nHouse conference on this legislation.\n  If the Senator wants to face the American people and explain that he \nopposed this on the basis of a blue slip problem, please, I am sure, \nthey are going to appreciate that explanation. This is something that \nhas had broad support in the past. It is without question something we \nshould do. We have an opportunity to do it, and we should.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from Maine who has been such an \nadvocate for small business in this country and has fought hard for \nfull deductibility for the self-employed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I commend my friend and colleague from \nArkansas for offering this important amendment. It will allow self-\nemployed Americans to deduct the full amount of their health insurance \npremiums.\n  As we proceed with consideration of legislation to protect patients' \nrights, legislation I believe every Member of this body, in one form or \nanother, wants to see passed, we should also be considering ways to \nexpand access to health insurance coverage for millions more Americans \nby making health insurance more affordable.\n  We know that at a time of almost unprecedented prosperity in this \ncountry, we have 43 million Americans who lack health insurance. Just \nthink of the impact of an economic downturn and escalating increases in \nhealth insurance costs. It will only expand the number of uninsured or \nunderinsured Americans. That is why I support the amendment that has \nbeen offered by the Senator from Arkansas.\n  As President Clinton's own Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection \nand Quality noted in its report: ``Costs matter--health coverage is the \nbest consumer protection.''\n  Simply put, the biggest single obstacle to expanded health care \ncoverage in the United States is costs. While American employers \neverywhere are facing huge hikes in their health insurance premiums, \nthese rising costs are particularly problematic for small businesses, \nand they are most problematic for self-employed individuals who have to \npurchase health insurance on their own without a subsidy from an \nemployer and without the benefit of a group health plan rate.\n  Since most Americans get their health insurance through the \nworkplace, it is a common assumption that people without health \ninsurance are unemployed, but the fact is that most uninsured Americans \nare members of families with at least one full-time worker. Eighty-five \npercent of Americans who do not have health insurance live in a family \nwith a full-time worker. Most of these uninsured workers are self-\nemployed or they work for very small businesses that simply cannot \nafford to provide health insurance as much as they would like.\n  Our amendment will help make health insurance more affordable for \nthese Americans by allowing those who are self-employed to deduct 100 \npercent of the cost of their health insurance premiums. Since some 35 \nmillion Americans are in families headed by self-employed individuals, \nthis will be of enormous help to them. Five million of those 35 million \nare uninsured.\n  Establishing parity in the tax treatment of health insurance costs \nbetween self-employed individuals and those working for large \nbusinesses is also a matter of equity. I have never thought it was fair \nthat a corporation can deduct 100 percent of its share of the health \ninsurance premiums that it pays for its employees, but a person who \nworks for himself or herself can only deduct a portion of that cost.\n  This is a matter of equity, but it would also help to reduce the \nnumber of uninsured but working Americans. Our amendment will help make \nhealth insurance more affordable for the 82,000 people in my home State \nof Maine who are self-employed. They include our lobstermen, fishermen, \nfarmers, hairdressers, electricians, plumbers, and the owners of many \nof the small shops that dot communities throughout our State.\n  We are a State of self-reliant people. We are a State where there is \na large number of self-employed, and they deserve to deduct the cost of \ntheir health insurance premium just as a large corporation can write \noff that cost.\n\n  This is a particularly important amendment when we are looking at a \nbill that by every estimate is going to drive up the cost of health \ninsurance. This is just a modest effort to provide some assistance to \nhelp offset the escalation in health insurance rates that this bill, \nunfortunately, will produce. This is a reasonable amendment. It \ndeserves bipartisan support.\n  Finally, I am a bit puzzled by some of the statements that have been \nmade by those on the other side of the aisle. During consideration of \nthe budget resolution earlier this year, I offered an amendment to make \nsure we set aside funds in the budget resolution to provide for 100-\npercent deductibility for health insurance for the self-employed and \nalso to help our small businesses that are struggling with the cost of \nhealth insurance by giving them a tax credit.\n  That amendment was opposed by my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle. Had it been accepted--it was narrowly defeated by only one \nvote--we\n\n[[Page S6564]]\n\nwould have had a better chance of holding those important provisions in \nthe tax bill when we went to conference, but it was opposed by my \nfriends from the other side of the aisle.\n  I find it ironic to hear today the argument that we should have done \nit earlier, we should have done it on a different bill when, in fact, \nour attempts to do so were defeated during the course of the budget \nresolution.\n  This is an excellent amendment. I am puzzled why there would be any \nopposition to it. Surely we ought to be able to agree that self-\nemployed individuals, those hard-working men and women across America, \nshould be able to deduct the full cost of their health insurance. It is \nthe right policy, it is the fair policy, and it would help expand \naccess to needed health insurance for millions of American families. I \nhope there will be a strong bipartisan vote for this very important \namendment.\n  Again, I commend my friend from Arkansas for his leadership in \nbringing forth this very important amendment on this bill.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMaine for her excellent statement, for her cosponsorship of this \namendment, for her leadership in advocacy for small business in this \ncountry.\n  I now yield to the Senator from New Hampshire for such time as he \nmight need.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I support my colleagues' \namendment wholeheartedly and I ask unanimous consent my name be added \nas an original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I compliment my colleague from Maine for \nthe eloquent statement she made regarding those independent business \npeople who do not have the fallback or the luxury of the assets of the \ngiant corporation. There are thousands in Maine and thousands in our \nneighboring State of New Hampshire. It is hard to see them without the \nability to have the 100-percent deduction. It is a struggle to provide \nthose benefits. They do provide them. In spite of the fact they don't \nhave the deductibility, they still provide insurance. It is a \ntremendous burden.\n  I hope our colleagues will see how important this amendment is.\n  I rise today to make a few general comments about health care in \nAmerica and about this legislation specifically as we move forward in \nthis debate. We have gone full circle on the health care debate. We \nstarted in the early 1990s with an attempt to nationalize all health \ncare in America, which would have been a disaster. We then swung over \nto HMOs, and now we are back somewhere in the middle. This bill is now \nmoving back toward the national trend.\n  We have a vision for America. This debate is about what vision is \naccepted. Is the vision you accept one of government control of health \ncare? One of government control of who your doctor is? One of \ngovernment control of who has access to health care and who does not?\n  Talk to some of our friends to the north in Canada and ask them how \nthat triple or quadruple-tiered system works there.\n  The other vision is what I believe our country stands for. That is a \nvision of America of limited government, an America of individual \nfreedom and choice and personal responsibility. These are the \nprinciples that helped make America the greatest Nation in history. \nWhen we talk about these principles in other areas--whether it be \nregarding business or any area regarding individual responsibility \nwhere government does not take a peek at your private life--one cannot \nisolate health care. We have to say health care is very much a part of \nthe whole concept of America of individual freedom, personal \nresponsibility, and choice.\n\n  Access to affordable, quality health care is an issue, a health issue \nthat we as a government and society should promote and encourage. It is \na shame the Senator from Arkansas has to have an amendment like this. \nIt should be part of the Tax Code to begin with.\n  We achieve this access to affordable health care using the strengths \nof our system, not accenting weaknesses. The strength of our system is \nfree market, quality care, consumer choice. All Members agree we need \nhealth care reform. The question is, What health care reform? The \nquestion is, How do we reach this goal?\n  I ask my colleagues, is increased regulation more government control \nover your life? If it is a problem with the HMOs over what doctor to \nsee or over a health procedure to be used, which is a legitimate \nconcern, how would you like the Federal Government making those \ndecisions? How would you like to deal with the bureaucracy of the \nFederal Government, as constituents have to deal with, calling each day \nasking to please help them get the Social Security that, after the \nGovernment declared them dead 2 months ago, they have not received for \n2 months?\n  Is that who you want to control your access to health care? Is that \nwho you want to go through for a decision on your medical condition, or \nto see a doctor? Do you want the lawyers in America to run the health \ncare system? That is what is happening in this bill. The trial lawyers \nwill run it.\n  There are no comments made about the trial lawyers on this side of \nthe aisle. We know the reason: The American people do not want a \ngovernment-run health care system. We want reforms. We want access to \nour doctors. We want doctors and patients to make the decisions. That \nis what we want. We don't want anybody in between. There should not be \nanybody in between. To have the Federal Government in there is a \nserious error.\n  The question should be, Should patients have recourse if they are \nharmed by a decision made by their HMO? Of course they should. Better \nyet, let's have a procedure set up so there is nobody getting in the \nway to begin with, so that the doctor and the patient make the decision \nabout which medical procedure should be used.\n  I urge both sides to put aside the gamesmanship and partisan rhetoric \nand work toward real patient protection. We all know this is about \npolitics. We know the political argument: Bash the HMOs, bash the \nRepublicans. The Republicans don't want consumers to have choice. Or \nthe other side: The Federal Government will run the health care system.\n  That is not the issue. We all should work together to help people who \nneed access to health care. Consumers don't want drastic increases in \npremiums. I haven't found any yet who want premiums increased. I have \nnot found anybody yet who wants a maze of legal wrangling to achieve \nbenefits they are already owed. Do you want to have to go through ten \nlevels of government bureaucracy to get something owed you? I have not \nfound anybody yet who wants to do that. If they are out there, they \nhave not written to me.\n  The President is concerned about patient protection. He worked on it \nhard as a Governor of Texas and showed a willingness to work in a \nbipartisan way to improve the insurance system. He extended his hand in \nthis way. I hope the other side will take advantage of it. This is an \nextraordinary opportunity to achieve reform. It will make a real \ndifference for the people of this country. This is what this debate \nshould be about. I am afraid it is not what it is about.\n\n  Sure, we can pass a bill right now that bashes the HMO industry, \nhikes premiums, and delays benefits to patients. Let's look at them one \nby one.\n  Bash the HMO: Does that make you feel good? Maybe. Does it help you \nget better benefits, better access to your doctors? I don't think so.\n  Hiked premiums: Anyone want to raise the premiums higher, make it \nmore difficult to receive the health care you are now trying to get? Do \nyou want to delay your benefits to the patients? I don't know anybody \nwho wants that. I don't think anyone wants premium hikes or delays, but \nsuch a bill would be vetoed and the status quo preserved. If we have a \nbill that bashes HMOs and raises premiums, President Bush will veto it, \nas well he should. Why pass it?\n\n  President Bush made it clear he will veto this bill in its current \nform. Why not work here, roll up our sleeves, do what we are paid to do \nby the taxpayers in this country, and work together to get a bill that \nwill be signed by the President. Why wait for him to veto?\n\n[[Page S6565]]\n\n  If my colleagues are dissatisfied with the status quo, do not want it \nto continue, and are concerned about constituents who are patients, \nthey need to understand we need to make improvements in this bill. The \nSenator from Arkansas has made a very good improvement in this bill. We \nshould not even be talking about it. It should be unanimously approved. \nInstead, it is debated hotly and unfairly on the Senate floor.\n  I don't think the current system is perfect. It is the best system in \nthe world, though. For all the criticisms, does anybody want to go to \nPakistan to have heart surgery, or North Korea? It is the best system \nin the world, with all its blemishes. As Winston Churchill used to say \nabout democracy: It is not perfect, but it is the best thing out there. \nRemember that when we get to the bashing of the health care system in \nthe country. We have the best doctors, the best nurses, the best \nhospitals in the world, the best pharmaceutical companies that get \nbashed on the floor day in and day out.\n  They have made tremendous progress in such diseases as cancer and \nAIDS and all kinds of disease that impacts us as a people.\n  We have seen how expensive and inefficient health care programs run \nby the Federal Government can be. I address my colleagues in the spirit \nof bipartisanship. I think some of my colleagues can admit that on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, which I used to chair, I \nreached out on a lot of issues, specifically brownfields and \nEverglades, and we had bipartisan bills, two of them, both big issues \nthat passed overwhelmingly, 99-0 on one, and 85 on the other. It can be \ndone, but it should not be done out here. People on the respective \ncommittees ought to roll up their sleeves and accept reality and quit \ntrying to score political points.\n  You ought to say if President Bush is going to veto this bill, that \nhere are the reasons he is going to veto it. Let's sit down and see if \nwe can address those reasons. If you can't, then fine. We will move \nforward.\n  But stop trying to score political points by trying to paint the \npicture that somehow all of us on this side are somehow opposed to \nhaving consumers get good health care. It is not true. It is a cheap \nshot, frankly, to do it.\n  We shouldn't let the heavy hand of Government further aggravate the \nproblems that plague our private health care system. We should reform \nit. We can increase choices for the employers and the individuals and \nfoster innovation with market-driven ideas and competition.\n  I have tried for a year and a half to get the attention of colleagues \non my side of the aisle on a prescription drug plan that reduces \npremiums and provides more coverage. But I can't get any attention to \nit--I guess because I am not the guy who is supposed to be bringing it \nup. I do not know. But I encourage people to take a look at it because \nit works.\n  If we are talking about reducing premiums, then here is a way to \nreduce premiums on just those prescription drugs. We ought to \ndiscourage frivolous lawsuits while ensuring that patients who are \ntruly harmed have a recourse. That is what we should be doing. If this \nlegislation passes, it will make lawyers wealthy. They are going to do \nreal well.\n  We ought to emphasize what works, get rid of what doesn't, and stop \nbashing what is good in our health care system, as if it is the worst \nin the world rather than the best.\n  We ought to cut down on the health insurance fraud. Barry Mawn, head \nof the FBI in New York, has called health and medical insurance fraud \nAmerica's No. 1 white-collar crime costing billions of dollars.\n  We should eliminate the fraud and put those dollars to the \nconsumers--to the people who really could use some help. How much new \ntechnology could we put into place? How many new medical breakthroughs \ncould we make, if we could take those billions of dollars that we waste \nin fraud and put it into cancer research, or AIDS research, or multiple \nsclerosis, or muscular dystrophy, or any other disease? That would be a \ngood step. We could do that, too, on the floor of the Senate today, if \nwe wanted to do it.\n  We ought to offer a clear and compelling vision of how patient \nempowerment in truly free markets can give Americans a better health a \nsystem.\n  I ask you: Would we have the breakthroughs that we have in some of \nthe miracle drugs we have on the market today if the Federal Government \nhad been responsible for doing it? I ask anyone to answer that \nquestion, other than to say no.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield on that question?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Yes. Of course.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is the Senator aware of the National Institutes of \nHealth's basic research and medical----\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I think the Senator knows I am aware of \nthat.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Research that leads to these drugs and this medical \nequipment funded by American taxpayers?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Yes. I am very much aware of it. In terms \nof licensing medicines and doing the research, you know where it is \nhappening. It is happening in the private sector. We can't shut it \ndown.\n  I want health care for Americans, and my constituents want real \nchoice and control over their own decisions. We should not reform \nsomething or change something in the name of reform that causes the \nFederal Government to get in the way of the doctor providing services \nto the patient.\n\n  My friend from Missouri pointed out earlier that thousands, if not \nmillions, of Americans could lose their insurance under this bill as it \nis currently drafted. Is that really what the intent is--to have \nmillions of Americans lose their insurance? I hope not.\n  Over the next few days we could discuss amendments to this bill that \nwill make those badly needed improvements, such as the Senator from \nArkansas has just done. I urge my colleagues to cross the partisan \ndivide, enact responsible and reasonable health care, stop the attacks \non each other, roll up your sleeves and do something good for the \nAmerican people. We can do it.\n  I think if we do that we would get the thanks of the American people, \nrather than this partisan rhetoric that gets nowhere.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). Who yields time? The \nSenator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, might I inquire as to the time \nremaining on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has 144\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I yield to the Senator from Texas such time as he \nmight require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank our dear colleague from Arkansas. I \nthank him for his leadership on this very important amendment.\n  I hope all of my colleagues, no matter where they stand on this \nimportant issue, will vote for this amendment.\n  I was asked earlier today: Why should this amendment be the first \namendment? This amendment is the first amendment because this is an \namendment that is aimed at helping expand coverage in America so more \nAmericans have access to health care.\n  It is one thing to talk about patients' rights. But what good are \nthese rights if you do not have health insurance? What good are all \nthese rights we are guaranteeing if you do not have access to the \nsystem?\n  This first amendment basically says that for the mom-and-pop little \nbusinesses where people have to buy their own health insurance because \nthey work for themselves--they are self-employed--they ought to get the \nsame tax treatment that General Motors gets.\n  Why is this important in this bill? This is important in this bill \nbecause the Congressional Budget Office estimates that, at an absolute \nminimum, 1.2 million people will lose their health insurance because of \nthe cost of this bill.\n  It seems to me that it is perfectly logical that our first amendment \nought to be trying to do something about that problem to assure people \nhave the most basic freedom, which is freedom to get into the health \ncare market with health insurance. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Texas yield for a \nquestion?\n\n[[Page S6566]]\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am not going to yield. I am going to speak. When I am \nfinished, I might be willing to yield.\n  I wish to begin by thanking our colleague from Arkansas for his \nleadership on this issue.\n  I want to cover a lot of issues today. I would like to begin with the \nissue of finishing the bill. Let me say that I believe we have the \ncapacity in the Senate to reach a compromise.\n  I believe we can write a Patients' Bill of Rights that will not cause \nmillions of people to lose their health insurance. I believe we can \nwrite a Patients' Bill of Rights that will keep the sanctity of \ncontracts. I think we can write a Patients' Bill of Rights that doesn't \ntrample States that already have good, viable, working programs. I \nthink we can write a Patients' Bill of Rights that will do for people \nwho are under employer-sponsored plans what States such as Texas and \nother States have done for people who have their health insurance \npurchased directly through private health insurance.\n  I don't know whether we will do that or not, but I believe we have \nthe capacity to do it. One of the issues that has been raised here is \nthe implicit threat that we are going to have to finish this bill by \ncertain dates or that we are going to call off the Fourth of July, or \nwe are going to call off Christmas, or whatever these threats may be.\n  I would like to say this: I don't have any interest in preventing us \nfrom making decisions on substantive issues. But as people hear what I \nhave to say on this bill, they are going to hear that I feel very \nstrongly about this bill. I believe the future of health care in \nAmerica, the quality of care in America, and the freedom we have to \nchoose our own doctors and our own hospitals--all of those things--are \nthreatened by this bill, if we do it wrong.\n  I am willing to work with the majority leader and with the majority, \nbut we are not going to be stampeded. We may very well be here over the \nFourth of July, and we may be here over the Christmas holidays. But \nbeing here is one thing and being stampeded is another. And that is not \ngoing to happen.\n\n  Let me start sort of at the beginning. Why are we so concerned on \nthis side of the aisle--and I hope some people on the other side of the \naisle--about people losing their health insurance? Part of the reason \nwe are concerned is that national polls show, in overwhelming numbers, \nthat small businesspeople say if they can be sued--and they can be sued \nunder the bill that is before us--they are going to drop their health \ninsurance.\n  We do not have a law that requires your employer to provide health \ninsurance. That is a decision the employer makes based on negotiating \nwith the employee and what the employer believes is in his best \ninterest.\n  The great majority of employers try to provide health insurance \nbecause, they care about their employees. They want to keep good \nemployees. But there is no law that says your employer, large or small, \nhas to provide health insurance. They can cancel it.\n  In national poll after national poll, we know that businesses, in \noverwhelming numbers--especially small businesses--say that if you \nexpand this liability, and if they can be sued, or if the contract can \nbe rewritten, causing costs to explode, they are going to cancel their \ninsurance policies. What that means is, millions of people who have \nhealth insurance today will not have health insurance.\n  Why are we so concerned about it? Let me talk about a little history \nbecause I think it is important for people who are coming in, in the \nmiddle of this debate to understand how we got here. I want to begin \nwith 1989.\n  In 1989, we had 33 million Americans who did not have private health \ninsurance. When President Clinton was elected, he sent to Congress a \nbill, which I have at my desk, the Clinton health care bill. The \nargument of that bill was very simple, and that was that the problem \nAmerica faced, with about 34 million people who did not have private \nhealth insurance was so overwhelming that we had to take extraordinary \naction. And that extraordinary action was contained in this bill which \ncame to the Congress in 1993.\n  What the bill said was: Covering these 34 million-plus people was \nmore important than patients' rights, so that what we ought to do was \nmake every person join an HMO that would be established as a Government \nmonopoly in each part of the country, and it would be run by a panel of \nlocal leaders and local citizens and local health care providers, and \nthat panel would set a policy for that region, and there would be \nnational coordination.\n  In this context, there was not talk of a patients' rights such as we \nare debating today. The bill before us today requires that even an \nemployer who has two employees has to provide an option, what is called \na point-of-service option, to people who may not want to go to an HMO. \nThat is provided in this bill.\n  I want to remind my colleagues that in 1993 President Clinton, and \nthose who supported him, were so concerned about 34 million people not \nhaving health insurance that they gave no point-of-service option. In \nfact, their bill, that was in this Senate Chamber in 1993 and 1994, \nsaid that if a physician in this health care purchasing collective \nprovided medical care that the Federal Government and these local \ncommissions believed was inappropriate, that physician could be fined \n$10,000. And if the physician took a payment from the person receiving \nthe health care, for care they thought they needed and their \ndoctor thought they needed, the physician could be sent to prison for 5 \nyears.\n\n  We talk about liability in this bill. This bill has, for all \npractical purposes, unlimited ability to sue in State and Federal \ncourt. The only limit in the bill--which I do not think the media has \never gotten right in anything written--is a limit on contract disputes \nin Federal courts on punitive damages of $5 million.\n  I am not aware of punitive damages being granted on any kind of \nregular basis in a contract dispute anywhere in any State in the Union. \nThis bill has unlimited liability in the name of patients' rights.\n  I remind my colleagues, and the American people, that in 1993 and in \n1994, many of the same people who are for this bill had severe limits \non the ability to sue, had caps on lawyers' fees, because they were \nworried about 34 million people not having health insurance.\n  We are now 7 years later. What has happened in the ensuing 7 years? \nWhat has happened is that now 42.6 million people do not have private \nhealth insurance. Yet today we have before us a bill that, even by the \nCongressional Budget Office estimates, will drive up the cost of health \ncare by over 4 percent and will cost 1.2 million people private health \ninsurance.\n  So why am I concerned about people not having health insurance? I am \nconcerned really for two reasons. No. 1, the number of people keeps \ngrowing. This bill, if it is adopted, will make the problem far worse. \nNo. 2, if many of the people for this bill 7 years ago were willing to \nargue the Government ought to take over the health care system, and \ndeny health care freedom to everybody because 34 million people did not \nhave health insurance--when 42.6 million do not have it now, and we are \nlooking at at least 44 million or so not having it after this bill \npasses--does anybody doubt that some of these same people are going to \nbe back here next year, or the next year, saying: My God, we have a \ncrisis in the number of people who do not have health insurance?\n  Maybe we ought to get back out the old Clinton health care bill and \nhave the Government take over and run the health care system. I do not \nbelieve that this is an idle concern.\n  I ask my colleagues, and anybody trying to follow this debate, to \nlook at this chart because, to me, this chart is startling and \nfrightening.\n  What this chart does is, it shows the right people have to make \nhealth care decisions. This chart basically takes the seven richest and \nmost developed countries in the world, and it asks the question: What \npercentage of the population get their health care from Government-run \nprograms? And what percentage of the population get their health care \nthrough programs they control and they purchased and they negotiated?\n  These seven developed countries are Canada, Italy, Japan, the United \nKingdom, France, Germany, and the United States. As you can see by \nlooking at this chart, by far the freest country in the world, in terms \nof the right of a free people to choose their own health care, is the \nUnited States of America.\n\n[[Page S6567]]\n\n  Sixty-seven percent of health care in America is controlled by \nprivate citizens; 33 percent of health care in America is controlled by \nGovernment.\n  The point I want to make is the following: What is the second freest \ncountry in the world in terms of people having the ability to choose \ntheir own health care? The next freest developed country in the world \nis Germany, where Government controls 92 percent of the health care \npurchased.\n  So I think, when you look at every other developed country in the \nworld, that one of the things you have to be concerned about is \nAmerica, by far and away, has the freest health care system in the \nworld, where people make decisions for themselves, and the next freest \ncountry in the world has Government running 92 percent of their health \ncare.\n  With the exploding cost of health insurance through the proliferation \nof lawsuits and frivolous litigation and through rising health care \ncosts costing people their health insurance, there is every reason in \nthe world to be concerned about it because we have a lot of freedom to \nlose. And we, quite frankly, are unique among all the developed \ncountries in the world in that we have a private health care system. Of \nall the other developed countries in the world, Canada, Italy, Japan, \nand the United Kingdom have a 100-percent government system. In the \nUnited Kingdom, you can go outside the system and you have to pay for \nhealth care twice. In France, government dominates 99 percent; in \nGermany, 92 percent; in the United States, 67 percent of health care \ndecisions are private.\n  I am worried about this bill and its cost, the litigation and the \ntrampling on States that already have workable programs, because I \ndon't want to live in a country where government controls 92 or 99 or \n100 percent of health care.\n  As I said when we debated the Clinton health care bill 7 years ago, \nwhen my momma is sick, I want her to talk to a doctor and not some \ngovernment bureaucrat. I still want that.\n  Now let me talk about this bill and the problems it has. Let me make \nit clear to begin with that I believe these problems can be fixed if we \nwork in good will. I will pick out several problems with this bill, and \nI want to go through them in detail because I don't want there to be \nany doubt about what I am talking about.\n  What I think we have in this bill is a tremendous amount of what I \ncall ``bait and switch'' provisions. What do I mean by that? I mean \nthat where the bill says one thing in one place, where it appears that \na policy is set, and yet when you look further, you find that in fact \nthat policy is not set and the bill does exactly what it claims it does \nnot do.\n  I will give you three examples. I have blown it up because I want to \nbe sure everybody is just looking at the language of the bill. The \nfirst has to do with something that is very hotly debated in America, \nwhere, as the public listens to both sides of the debate, they get the \nidea that both sides are on their side. I want to start with the issue \nof whether or not you can sue an employer.\n  What is the role of the employer here? The role of the employer has \nto do with buying health insurance. Sometimes the employer buys it. \nSometimes the employer enters into a partnership with the employee and \nthey buy it together. But the question is, Should you be able to sue an \nemployer whose role in the process is buying health insurance?\n  Many of our colleagues here who support the bill that is before us, \nthe McCain-Kennedy-Edwards bill, say it is like Texas. This bill is \nlike Texas. Let me read to you what Texas law says on this issue. Texas \nlaw says:\n\n       This chapter does not create any liability on the part of \n     an employer, an employer group purchasing organization, or a \n     pharmacy licensed by the State Board of Pharmacy that \n     purchases coverage or assumes risk on behalf of its \n     employees.\n\n  In other words, the Texas law, which proponents of this bill say that \nthey think is wonderful and they want at the Federal level, has an \noutright total exemption of employers under the Texas law. Under no \ncircumstance can you sue the employer.\n  Why did Texas do this? Texas did this because they did not want \nemployers, especially small employers, to cancel health insurance. What \ndoes the bill before us do? If you listen to the proponents, it is just \nlike the Texas bill. And if you listen to them, you can't sue \nemployers. Let's just go through the language.\n\n  This is the language on page 144: ``Exclusion of employers and other \nplan sponsors.'' Boy, that sounds good. And then it says: ``Causes of \naction against employers and plan sponsors precluded.'' Great. Great. \nThey have precluded causes of action against employers and plan \nsponsors. Read on.\n\n       Subject to subparagraph (B)--\n\n  That ought to make you suspicious right there--\n\n     paragraph (1)(A) does not authorize a cause of action against \n     an employer or other plan sponsor maintaining the plan (or \n     against an employee of such an employer or sponsor acting \n     within the scope of employment).\n\n  Hallelujah. Just like the Texas plan. There is only one problem. It \ndoes not stop there. It goes on to the next paragraph. You get to this \nparagraph (B), on which I said you had better watch out because there \nis already a caveat. What does paragraph (B) say? Paragraph (B) says:\n\n       Certain causes of action permitted--Notwithstanding \n     subparagraph (A), a cause of action may arise against an \n     employer or other plan sponsor. . . .\n\n  And then it goes on for several pages talking about when you can and \ncan't sue an employer.\n  Compare that with what is done in Texas. In Texas you can't sue the \nemployer. Here we have a classic case of bait and switch. The bait is, \nthey say you can't sue the employer. And then they say, notwithstanding \nthat you can't sue the employer, you can sue the employer. This bill is \nfull of these bait-and-switch provisions.\n  Let me give another example. I want to make it clear this is not just \nan outlier where I just found one little provision of the bill that \nlooks very suspicious. The next one has to do with exhaustion of \nexternal review.\n  What is the question here? The question is, Have you ever seen \nanybody get healed in a courthouse? I have seen people healed in \nhospitals, doctors' offices, clinics. I have even seen people healed in \ntent revivals. But I have never, ever seen anybody healed in a \ncourthouse. I have never seen a lawyer heal anybody. I am sure they \nhave. They may have become a doctor and done it.\n  But what is this issue about? This issue is the following: We have \nset up in both bills--everybody agrees, or they say they agree--that \nyou ought to have an external appeal where you say, No, I think I need \nthis service; and then your doctor looks at it and says yes or no; and \nthen if you don't agree, you get to go before a doctor panel that is \nmade up of doctors who are independent of the HMO, and then they make a \ndecision; and if you are still dissatisfied, then you can go to the \ncourthouse.\n  But everybody claims that they want to have you go through this \nappeals process at the hospital before you go to try to get cured at \nthe courthouse. And we have all kinds of provisions that say, if you \nare really sick, this external review process has to occur, in some \ncases, immediately.\n  Now the proponents of this bill say you have to go through external \nreview. That is what they say. And sure enough, if you look at their \nbill on page 150, it sure looks as if they say it.\n  They say ``Requirement of Exhaustion''--sounds like exhaustion. You \nhave to go through the process. ``In General''--notice right away you \nget the key:\n\n       In General.--Except as provided in this paragraph, a cause \n     of action may not be brought under paragraph (1) in \n     connection with any denial of a claim for benefits of any \n     individual until all administrative processes under sections \n     102 and 103 of the Bipartisan Patient Protection Act of 2001 \n     (if applicable) have been exhausted.\n\n  In other words, they are saying here on page 150 that you have to go \nthrough internal and external review; no ifs, ands, or buts about it. \nRight? Well, no, it is not right. It is right on page 150. But then on \npage 151, they say:\n\n       In General.--The requirements of subparagraph (A)--\n\n  That is this exhaustion paragraph--\n\n     shall not apply in any case . . .\n\n  And then they go on and set up a circumstance whereby you do not have \nto go through external review. Now, I\n\n[[Page S6568]]\n\nraised this a week ago and they changed it, but they still didn't fix \nit.\n  Here is the point. I understand part of what we do here is score \npoints in debating, but how do you defend a bill that, on page 150, \nsays you have to go through external review before you go to the \ncourthouse; and then on page 151 it says the requirements of \nsubparagraph (A) shall not apply, and then it goes into the \ncircumstance whereby you can go to court and make various claims?\n  Now, it doesn't end there. Here is another one. Boy, this is as \nfundamental as you can be in health care. The question is a simple \nquestion. I have a standard option Blue Cross/Blue Shield policy, and \n40 million people have the same policy I have. I could have gotten a \nbetter policy. I could have gotten the upscale Blue Cross/Blue Shield, \nbut I and my family are pretty healthy, and I looked at the cost of the \nBlue Cross/Blue Shield premium policy, and I looked at the standard \noption policy, and I looked at the low option policy, and I decided \nstandard option is what I want. That is what I paid for, and Blue \nCross/Blue Shield gave me a contract. Now, that contract is binding \ntoday.\n  But there is a question here. Is the contract binding in the bill \nthat is before us? If you have listened to our colleagues who are for \nthis bill, they say it is binding. Contracts are binding in court--\nbinding under law. When you sign a contract, the contract is binding. \nSure enough, if you look at their bill on page 35, it sure looks like \ncontracts are binding. It says: ``No Coverage For Excluded Benefits.''\n  In other words, if your contract says we only pay for 60 days in the \nhospital for mental illness, then if you are in the hospital the 61st \nday, you have to pay for it. I have all kinds of provisions like that \nin my Blue Cross/Blue Shield standard option plan.\n  Then under this wonderful headline, you read:\n\n       No Coverage For Excluded Benefits.--Nothing in this \n     subsection shall be construed to permit an independent \n     medical reviewer to require that a group health plan, or \n     health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage, \n     provide coverage for items or services for which benefits are \n     specifically excluded or expressly limited under the plan or \n     coverage in the plain language of the plan document.\n\n  That sounds about as clear as it can be. If your plan says you only \nget 60 days for mental illness in the hospital, or if your plan says we \ndon't cover heart and lung transplants, then this language is as clear \nas the morning sun that they are not covered. But read on. After having \nsaid:\n\n       Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to permit an \n     independent medical reviewer to require that a group health \n     plan, or health insurance issuer offering health insurance \n     coverage, provide coverage for items or services for which \n     benefits are specifically excluded or expressly limited . . .\n\n  It then goes on to say:\n\n     . . . except to the extent that the application or \n     interpretation of the exclusion or limitation involves a \n     determination described in paragraph (2).\n\n  Where is paragraph (2)? Paragraph (2), as it turns out, is 2 pages \nback. In fact, I want to be sure the Presiding Officer, among others, \nhears this. Let me do it one more time. On page 35 of this bill, it \nsays in language as clear as the morning sun: ``No coverage for \nexcluded benefits.'' In other words, your contract excludes more than \n60 days in the hospital for mental illness, or it says it doesn't cover \nheart and lung transplants. It is excluded. It goes down here and says:\n\n       Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to permit an \n     independent medical reviewer to require that a group health \n     plan, or health insurance issuer offering health insurance \n     coverage, provide coverage for items or services for which \n     benefits are specifically excluded or expressly limited under \n     the plan or coverage in plain language of the plan document . \n     . .\n\n  Then it has the big word, ``except''.\n\n     . . . except to the extent that the application or \n     interpretation of the exclusion or limitation involves a \n     determination described in paragraph (2).\n\n  Where is paragraph (2)? As it turns out, paragraph (2) is on page 33. \nParagraph (2), on page 33, has ``Medically Reviewable Decisions.'' So \nyou can't require them to provide services beyond those enumerated in \nthe contract, except where you have got a medically reviewable \ndecision.\n  The second part of paragraph (2) is ``Denials Based On Medical \nNecessity and Appropriateness.'' In other words, what this bill does, \nin the clearest possible way, is a bait and switch. The bait and switch \nis on line 14 of page 35, where it tells you contracts are binding. And \nthen you get to the ``except.'' When you go to look at the exception, \nit is anything that is medically reviewable and anything that the panel \ndecides is medically necessary.\n  Now, why does that matter? Don't we really want people to be in the \nhospital longer than 60 days if they need to be? Or if they need a \nheart or long transplant, don't we want them to have it? Here is the \npoint. When I negotiated my standard option Blue Cross/Blue Shield, I \ngot the policy that I thought best suited me based on my family's needs \nand my ability to pay.\n  Now, if you are going to come back and say that Blue Cross/Blue \nShield has to provide me services even if they are excluded in the \ncontract and if a medical reviewer decides that I need them, what is \nthat going to do to the cost of the standard option Blue Cross/Blue \nShield policy?\n  The cost of health insurance is going to explode in America because \ncontracts do not mean anything, and when contracts do not mean anything \nwe all have to pay higher prices, and some people lose their health \ninsurance. I am not going to lose my health insurance. I am a Senator. \nMy wife is successful and works. I am not going to have to give up my \nhealth insurance. So when my policy goes up $1,000 or $2,000, I am not \ngoing to lose my health insurance. But how many people working in \nAmerica are going to lose their health insurance? What happens to cost \nwhen contracts are not binding, when medical reviewers can say: I know \nyour contract said that you have only 60 days for mental care, but this \npatient needs more. And so they have to provide it. That is wonderful \nfor that patient, but what it means is we all have to pay higher \nprices, and some people lose their health insurance.\n  I do not want to stretch the analogy too far. This is not the Clinton \nhealth care bill that is before us. I personally believe we can work \nthese things out and fix them, but there is one element where this bill \nis like the Kennedy health care bill we debated 7 years ago.\n  The Kennedy health care bill was immensely popular. There were 77 \ncosponsors. It looked about as certain as Christmas was going to come \nor we were going to be off for the Fourth of July recess that the \nClinton health care bill was going to become law. Guess what happened. \nWe debated it about 2 weeks and people discovered what was in it, and \nthey decided they did not want it.\n  This bill is full of provisions that were written by clever lawyers \nthat appear to do things they do not do. We could go a long way toward \nworking out a compromise by simply saying: Do we mean contracts to be \nbinding or not? If we do, take all that language out and say contracts \nare binding. If we mean you ought to be able to sue employers, say you \ncan sue employers. If you do not think you ought to sue them, say you \nshould not be able to sue them, but do not try to have it both ways.\n  I want to talk now about preempting States. I have never been one who \nbelieved States were perfect. People have this habit of thinking \nbecause I am from Texas and Texas was involved in the Civil War on what \nsome people call a States rights issue--there were a lot of other \nissues involved, several of which we were just flat wrong on. There \nwere some elements of States rights, but, look, just because I am from \nTexas and from the South does not mean I believe States are right on \neverything and the Federal Government is wrong on everything. I pick \nand choose based on what I think works best.\n  There is something in this bill that is terribly unworkable and \negotistical. This bill says it does not matter if Arkansas, Nevada, \nNebraska, and Texas have written programs for a Patients' Bill of \nRights, and most States have. It does not matter how well their system \nis working. It does not matter how happy they are with it. In fact, \nproponents of this bill constantly say look how great the program is \nworking in Texas. It is just great. Then they say their bill is the \nsame. I think I have demonstrated it is not the same. Even if it was, \nthey then would say: Wait a minute. We think it is great, but we want \nour program to override it. This\n\n[[Page S6569]]\n\nis my point: Do we really believe we know what is better for Texas than \nthey know for themselves?\n  What I want to do is, if States have adopted their own program and it \nis working well for them, their legislature, and their Governor, look \nat our program and look at theirs and say: Ours is working well; we \nlike our provision to guarantee people, for example, on the right to \nsue employers; we like our provision that says you cannot sue them \ninstead of your provision that says you cannot but you can.\n\n  What I want to do somewhere during this debate is say if the States \nare happy, if they have adopted a plan--it does not have to be exactly \nthe same as the Federal Government as long as it is a comprehensive \nprogram and they are satisfied with it--why can't Texas say to the \nFederal Government, why can't Nebraska say to the Federal Government: \nWe really appreciate you looking out after us, but we have already done \nit ourselves. We want to do our plan. Our plan is different in three of \nthe 10 different areas, but it is a comprehensive plan and we want to \nhave our own plan.\n  Why can't Nebraska do that? Why can't Texas do it? Why does there \nhave to be one size fits all? I do not think there has to be, but if \nyou look at this bill, they claim in this bill that States can operate \ntheir own program, but the only way they can operate their own program \nis for the legislature to go back and adopt this bill as State law. So \nis that their program? I do not think so.\n  This is forcing States to do it our way when, quite frankly, in my \nState--I cannot speak for Nebraska or Arkansas--but in my State, I know \nin my State our plan is better than the bill that is before us. I want \nStates to have the right to opt to do it themselves, to opt out. That \nis very important.\n  There are a lot of other issues in here, and I am afraid there has \nbeen so much focus on liability, so much focus on lawsuits and, boy, \nthere is reason to be concerned about them, that people forget all \nthese other issues.\n  I want to pick out one more. I have spoken a long time, but this is \nan important bill. I want to talk about something that just does not \nlook too bad on the surface, but when you get right down to it, it is \nbad.\n  There is a provision in this bill which has been in every Patients' \nBill of Rights that has been considered in Congress, and that is a \nprovision that is a prudent layperson standard. If I believe I am sick \nand I might die or I might be permanently hurt, I have the right to go \nto the hospital, and they have to treat me and my HMO has to pay for \nit.\n  Needless to say, since these bills started passing in the States, \nwhat do you think has happened with the willingness of hospitals to \nnegotiate in advance with HMOs about paying for emergency care? Do you \nthink they have negotiated more or less?\n  This headline is from an article from the American Medical \nAssociation, Medical News, ``Patients Bypassing Primary Doctors for \nEmergency Care.''\n  The article says:\n\n       With the growth of prudent layperson laws and other \n     pressures, health plans are backing off from strict limits on \n     visits to emergency departments.\n\n  It goes on to explain it is six times as expensive to provide health \ncare in the emergency room as it is in the doctors office, outpatient \nclinic, or hospital, and that we are having an explosion of the use of \nemergency rooms.\n  In this bill, not only do we have the prudent layperson standard \nwhich no one opposes, but we have a brand new provision which has been \npushed by emergency room physicians who have lobbied for this \nprovision, and in a bill that is supposed to be about patients, we have \na great big special interest provision.\n  The provision basically says that if I, as a prudent layperson, go to \nthe emergency room, I have to be treated. These hospitals have stopped \nnegotiating in advance with HMOs because they know they will get paid \nwhatever they charge.\n\n  But this bill goes one step further. It is living proof of how \neverything ultimately gets infected with special interests. In addition \nto treating the patient for the emergency room problem, this bill has a \nprovision that allows the emergency room to give poststabilization \ncare. Then it has a trigger that says, if, within an hour, the HMO does \nnot get back to the emergency room to give the direction as to whether \nthe person having now been treated for the emergency problem should go \nto the doctor's office, go to the hospital, go to outpatient care, or \ngo back into their HMO, then the emergency room poststabilization care \ncan be provided.\n  Why in the world would we want to put poststabilization care into the \nemergency room when costs are skyrocketing and it is six times as \nexpensive in the emergency room as it is anywhere else? Why would such \na provision be in a bill? It is in the bill because emergency room \ndoctors wanted it in the bill.\n  When we debated the Clinton health care bill, one of the big \narguments was they were going to get medical care out of the emergency \nroom. So they got all kinds of restrictions where the health care \npurchasing collectives are going to decide what is really emergency \nroom care. That was then.\n  Now we have a requirement that says an HMO or a health plan has to \npay not just for emergency care but poststabilization care potentially \nin the emergency room. That provision ought to come out. That makes no \nsense. That is not in the public interest.\n  To sum up, we want an opportunity, and we will insist on an \nopportunity to debate every one of these issues. It may be we decide we \nwant to put more health care in the emergency room and drive up health \ninsurance costs and let the chips fall where they may and let millions \nof people lose health insurance. But we are going to vote on it. It may \nbe that we decide we want to be able to force people to provide health \ncare that is specifically excluded, enumerated, in their contract that \nis not covered. But we are going to debate it and we are going to vote \non it. It may be we decide we want to sue employers--I cannot imagine \nwhy we would want to do that, and this bill does it--and we may decide \nwe want to do it, but we are going to vote on it.\n  Everybody who says they think the Texas plan is so great, we will \ngive them a chance to vote on the Texas plan of exempting employers and \ndoing it in a lot of different ways.\n  I believe if we asked the American people if they were for a \nPatient's Bill of Rights, they would say yes. In fact, they have them \nin most States in the Union in an overwhelming number. If we asked, in \nmy State, would they rather stay under the Texas plan or come under the \nnational plan, I think the great majority of our people would say: We \nare doing great; leave us alone.\n  If people knew what was in this bill, I think they would not be for \nit. There was a reason the Founding Fathers established the Senate \nunder the rules they did. Some may remember when the Constitution was \nwritten, Jefferson was in France. He was Minister to France. When he \ncame back, he went to Mount Vernon. The Constitution had been written. \nHe came home from France and went to Mount Vernon and he met with \nWashington. He asked Washington: What is the Senate for?\n  The purpose of the House was clear. But why two bodies? Washington \nused the example of pouring tea into the cup and pouring it into the \nsaucer to cool and pouring it back in the cup and drinking. He said \nthere will be the heat of passion that will catch up the House of \nRepresentatives, and under their structure, elected every 2 years, that \npassion will react to the public passion. But the Senate will be the \nsaucer in which the cold logic of reason will prevail.\n\n  One of the reasons we are not going to be stampeded is that I am \nabsolutely convinced, when examined in the cold light of day, when \npeople look at the logic of this bill, they are going to decide this \nbill needs to be improved. The good news is it can be improved. The \ngood news is we could write a bill for which 90 Members of the Senate \ncould vote. But we are not going to write such a bill until we get \nevery part of it out in the open, until people understand it, until we \nknow these provisions mean exactly what they say. And we are going to \nhave to make fundamental decisions. There will be a lot of heartburn.\n  Some people are going to want to sue employers, but they will want \npeople to think they are exempting employers. We are not going to have \nit both\n\n[[Page S6570]]\n\nways. Members have to decide. There will be some who want to say in \nTexas, Nebraska--we will let you have your own program; on the other \nhand, they want to vote for a bill that makes you go under the \ngovernment program. You cannot do it both ways. We will have a vote. \nMembers have to make that fundamental decision.\n  That is what this debate is about.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for his statement.\n  The Senator is speaking on behalf of the Hutchinson-Bond amendment \nwhich allows deductibility of health insurance premiums for self-\nemployed people. I ask the Senator if the Congressional Record is \ncorrect, the Record of May 23, 2001, in which it announces the Senator \nfrom Texas, Mr. Phil Gramm, is one of the conferees on the tax bill \nthat was recently considered and passed, the conference committee which \nremoved the same provision we are now debating from the bill? In other \nwords, the amendment the Senator has spoken on, you were on the \nconference that removed that protection from the tax bill. For the \nrecord, was the Senator one of those conferees who removed that?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me reclaim my time and say not only, for the record, \nwas I one of the people who put the provision into the bill, I was a \nconferee. I was for the House provision that lowered the marginal rate \nto 33 percent. One might ask why I voted for a bill that lowered it \nonly to 35 percent? I was for numerous provisions that did not get into \nthe final bill. How did that happen? How that happened was we had $1.35 \ntrillion. The House had a bill, $1.6 trillion. I wanted $1.6 trillion. \nThe Senator from Illinois voted against it. As a result, we had to make \ndecisions about how to live within the budget we had.\n  Now, I am for this provision. I can show the Senator on record a \ndozen times I voted for it.\n  The point is, are we for it or are we against it? I will State right \nnow, unless God pauses my hand, I will vote for it. If I am a conferee, \nI will vote to keep it in this bill.\n  I don't know how the Senator will vote on this amendment. How is the \nSenator going to vote?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for asking that question because my \namendment that was offered to the tax bill, adopted in the Senate, and \nthen the conference committee the Senator from Texas sat on, removed my \namendment, the same one being offered today on the bill.\n  When the bill was $1.3 trillion in tax relief, as a member of the \nconference, you couldn't find $2 billion to help the people we are \ntalking about today. Instead, you are offering a Patients' Bill of \nRights.\n  I think that raises an interesting question.\n  Mr. GRAMM. How is the Senator going to vote on this amendment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will vote on the Patients' Bill of Rights. And we know \nthis amendment should not be in it because it is a tax provision.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am a little bit confused listening to the \nSenator. He sound as if he is for the provision. It is kind of bait and \nswitch. He seems to be chiding me in that I was not the dictator of the \nconference and I couldn't do everything exactly as I wanted. Thank God, \nwe are going to have another chance at 5:30 to make this right. I am \ngoing to vote on the right side. I want everybody to know I am for this \namendment. We need this amendment because the bill before us is one \nthat costs, at a minimum, 1.2 million people their health insurance. \nShouldn't we be trying to help more people get health insurance?\n  One final point, and then I will stop.\n  We use this cost figure of 4.2 percent that the bill before us is \ngoing to impose on everybody who owns health insurance. Where does that \nnumber come from? The plain truth is, that number is made up by the \nCongressional Budget Office. Here is what they assumed.\n  They assumed that 60 percent of the cost of health care going up will \nbe borne by the employer; that they will just pay it, absorb it, and \nwill not respond to it. Then 40 percent will be borne by the employees, \nwho will end up getting lower wages. In fact, in this bill receipts to \nSocial Security fall off because wages fall off by $55 billion.\n  The plain truth is the Congressional Budget Office, in adding up the \ncost of this bill, basically assumed that no employer will cancel \nhealth insurance because of this rising cost.\n  When you ask the Congressional Budget Office, When you were doing \nthis estimate, did you happen to see this language where actually \nthings that are excluded in the contract could be covered and the \ninsurance company could be forced to pay for it, did you note that? \nguess what. They didn't see it.\n  When you ask them, On the question of excluding employers, you \nprobably saw the big headline that said they couldn't be sued, but did \nyou read on and see, ``Notwithstanding subparagraph A, a cause of \naction may arise against an employer''? guess what? Nowhere in their \nestimate did they show that they caught the bait and switch.\n  Here is my point. We are talking about a 4.2-percent increase in \ncosts. We are taking a national figure--not from the Congressional \nBudget Office--that 300,000 people per 1 percent are losing their \nhealth insurance. But all of that is assuming that businesses--\nespecially small businesses--don't just cancel their health insurance \nbecause they are worried about being sued.\n  One of the things I am fearful of--and it never does you much good \naround here to say I told you so, and, quite frankly, I don't like to \ndo it--but I am afraid that 3 or 4 years from now millions of people \nwill have lost their health insurance because of this bill if we don't \nfix it.\n  One of the ways to start fixing it is this amendment by the Senator \nfrom Arkansas. If you are for it, if you think self-employed people \nought to be able to buy their insurance with pretax dollars just as \nGeneral Motors does, then you are going to vote for this amendment. If \nyou do not think so, you are going to vote against it. I think so. And \nI am for it.\n\n  I thank the Chair for the Chair's tolerance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  I asked the Senator from Texas if he was on the conference because it \nraises an interesting point. The amendment which has been filed on the \nfloor today would allow individuals to deduct the cost of their health \ninsurance if they are self-employed--small businesses and family \nfarmers--100-percent deductibility. It is something that is not only \nright and fair, but it is something that is already available if you \nwork for a corporation.\n  It is a position I have supported throughout my congressional career \nin the House and in the Senate. It is a provision I feel so strongly \nabout that I offered it as an amendment to the tax bill a month ago at \na time when we had $1.3 trillion to give away in tax breaks. I said, \nFor goodness' sake, let's do something about health insurance for the \nself-employed, for small businesses, and for farmers. It was adopted on \nthe floor of the Senate. It then went into this misty world of a \nconference committee, of which the Senator from Texas was a nominal \nconferee. I don't know if he was at this meeting when it got into the \nroom and was controlled by the Republicans. This same provision was \nremoved from the tax bill.\n  The Senator from Texas said there just wasn't enough money to go \naround. The tax bill gave 40 percent of its benefits to people making \nover $300,000 a year. They are arguing today that they didn't have \nenough money to help a small businessman trying to pay for insurance \nfor himself and his spouse and for his employees. They did not have \nenough money to take care of every family farmer struggling to pay \ntheir health insurance.\n\n  It raises a question of credibility, for you see what happened was \nthis: This amendment before us today has been filed in the Senate. This \nis the amendment which was filed on the tax bill. It is identical. What \ndid the Republican majority do with this amendment on the tax bill? \nThey filed it as well. That was the end of that amendment.\n  Now they come to us today and say this is what health care is really \nall about. A month ago they weren't for it. A month ago, when they were \nin control of the situation with $1.3 trillion, they couldn't find $2 \nbillion to take care of this problem. But today they have religion. \nToday they bring us the amendment. Why this conversion? Why this \nnewfound faith in this issue?\n\n[[Page S6571]]\n\n  Let's get down to the bottom line. What is this debate really about?\n  This Patients' Bill of Rights has been buried in a committee by the \nhealth insurance industry. They do not want it to come to the floor. \nThey don't want it to pass. They do not want to say that doctors and \nnurses and hospitals make medical decisions. The health insurance \nindustry wants to continue to make the decisions. And it was buried in \ncommittee until 2 weeks ago when control of the Senate Chamber changed.\n  When Tom Daschle became majority leader, he announced that the first \nitem on the agenda for the Democrats was to bring this bill out of \ncommittee, put it on the floor, debate it, and vote on it. That wasn't \neven on the Republican agenda. Now it is before us, and they are trying \nto find everything under God's heaven to stop this bill. So they have \ncome up with this.\n  They want to put a tax provision in this bill--a provision which they \ncanned in conference just a month ago. Now they want to revive it and \nstick it on this bill, hoping it will bog down with budgetary \nobjections and bog down in the Finance Committee and in the Ways and \nMeans Committee which has jurisdiction. They want to stop this bill. \nThey cannot stand the thought that these health insurance companies \nmight lose. They are arguing that it really isn't about the rights of \nindividuals under health insurance, it is really about deductibility of \nhealth insurance premiums on our taxes. Well, it isn't.\n  That is an important issue. It is one I have believed in for as long \nas I have been in Congress.\n  This debate is equally if not more important. It is a question about \nwhether or not your doctor can make medical decisions for you and your \nfamily or whether his or her decision will be overridden by an \ninsurance company clerk with a high school education 1,000 miles away.\n  That is the real world, my friends. That is what is happening across \nAmerica. I can give you chapter and verse in Illinois. Every one of my \ncolleagues can join me.\n  The second issue is one that really strikes at the heart of it. The \nRepublicans can't stand the thought and the possibility that health \ninsurance companies will be held accountable for their misconduct. We \nare held accountable. Individuals, families, businesses, and \ncorporations in America can be brought into court if they are guilty of \nwrongdoing. But there is one privileged class in America. There is one \nspecial royalty in America--that business, HMOs and health insurance.\n  When they deny you coverage under your health insurance policy, when \nthey do not let you in the hospital and they are wrong, and you come \naway permanently disabled, or someone in your family dies, they cannot \nbe hauled into court and held accountable.\n  This bipartisan bill which we support would bring them to court and \nhold them accountable, as every other business in America is held \naccountable. And the Republicans can't stand it. So they have come with \nthis amendment to the floor. They want to divert our attention from \nthings they forgot about a month ago. They know better.\n  We ought to defeat this amendment and pass this legislation.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, how much time is left under Senator \nKennedy's designation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote in the \nmorning be scheduled at 10:30 a.m. rather than 11 a.m. pursuant to the \nprevious unanimous consent agreement.\n  Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent--Senator Hutchinson \nhas the last 15 minutes of the debate--that Senator McCain have 7 \nminutes prior to his 15 minutes prior to the 5:30 vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is that time to come from Senator McCain's \ntime or Senator Kennedy's time?\n  Mr. REID. The time controlled by Senator Daschle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I think it is unfortunate if we allow \nthe debate--legitimate debate on legitimate issues--on this bill to \ndegenerate into finger pointing and partisan accusations that one party \nor another does not favor patients' rights, does not care about people, \nthat there is some insidious plot to bury a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  The reality is, over the last 2 years there have been over 20 votes \nin this Senate Chamber on versions of the Patients' Bill of Rights. \nThere has been plenty of debate and scores of votes.\n  So to say that somehow this Patients' Bill of Rights legislation has \nbeen hidden, buried in a committee and not been allowed to have free \nand open debate on it and to be amended and debated in this Senate \nChamber is simply to mislead the American people and to mislead the \nSenate.\n  We have debated this. I have spent a year myself on the conference \ncommittee trying diligently to reach a consensus, at least a \ncompromise, so we could have a Patients' Bill of Rights that would \nserve the American people.\n  I think it is very unfortunate when we start judging motivations and \njudging individuals as to what they want to do. I know the Presiding \nOfficer has his own concerns about portions of the Kennedy-McCain bill. \nThose are legitimate concerns. People may agree or disagree on various \naspects, but to point the finger and say that there is some kind of \npartisan plot to bury a bill or to be the ally of any particular \nindustry--I will speak for one Senator; and I think I speak for a lot \non my side of the aisle--I want a Patients' Bill of Rights. I want a \ngood one. I want one that will provide protections for those who do not \nhave those protections today. I want to have respect for States that \nhave already acted upon it, but I believe we have a responsibility to \nact on the Federal level.\n\n  I hope we have a bill, but I do not want to pass a bill that, in the \nwords of the Senator from Texas, plays a bait-and-switch game, where it \nsays it is doing one thing and then has an exception, where it says \nhere is the rule and then comes back with an exception to the rule that \nconsumes the rule itself. So let's have an honest debate. Let's avoid \njudging one another's motivations. At least I hope that will \ncharacterize more of the remaining debate.\n  My colleagues seem to equate accountability with getting to court, \nthat the only way an insurance company can be held accountable is if \nyou have the right to sue them, and sue them immediately. There are \nthose of us who think--and I am one of them--lawsuits are not \nnecessarily the best way to resolve a dispute. That is why an internal \nappeal is an appropriate step, an external appeal is a right process, \nand that only at the point that those appeals are exhausted should \nthere be a right to go to court to redress a wrong. I think if we have \nthat kind of restrained appeals process, we will minimize the amount of \nlawsuits that are necessary.\n  This is a legitimate debate, but we need not say that anyone is using \ncheap tricks, ploys, or that there is some kind of insidious effort to \nderail the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  One of the critical issues in this bill is how much we are going to \nincrease costs and how many people are going to lose their insurance. \nHow many small businesses are going to say: I can't afford to do it \nanymore? Exactly how many people are going to join the ranks of the \nuninsured? What kind of impact is it going to have? Those are real \nquestions.\n  So there can be no amendment more relevant than the amendment that is \nbefore us; and that is one that, most assuredly, by all who assess its \nimpact, will decrease the number of the uninsured, will take those who \nare currently in the ranks of the self-employed who cannot afford to \nbuy insurance and enable them to do it.\n  This is very relevant. This whole blue slip statement, in my opinion, \nis a red herring. You are either for it or not. You are either for \ngiving 100-percent deductibility or you are not. You say we should have \ndone it in the tax bill. I would have liked us to have done a lot more \nthings in that tax bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. No. I am giving a statement right now. I ask the \nSenator, is this for a UC?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. No, just for a question.\n\n[[Page S6572]]\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I listened to the Senator talk about the increased costs \nand how that would translate----\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I yield on the Senator's time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  You say with the increased costs there is an increasing number of \npeople who will lose their health insurance.\n  Last year there was a 9-percent increase in premiums. I would like to \nask the Senator: Where was the decrease in the number of the uninsured? \nTo the contrary, the figures show there are more people who are \nuninsured. So I have difficulty in accepting that.\n  This year the HMOs have already said the premiums are going up 10 \npercent, even without this. So under that assumption, that would mean 5 \nmillion more people who will be uninsured. There were 4 million last \nyear; 5 million now.\n\n  I do not see where the facts are to support your position.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Reclaiming my time, I say to Senator Kennedy, you are \nnot arguing with me; you are arguing with objective studies that \nindicate that with every 1 percent----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Not CBO.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Every 1-percent increase in insurance premium costs \nequates to about 300,000 people losing their insurance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I could have 15 seconds of my own time, that is not \nwhat CBO or OMB have said. In fact, in specifically studying the costs \nof this, they have indicated, where you are going to have these kinds \nof protections, you might have greater numbers of people covered, \nrather than less.\n  Now, you may be able to find some economist someplace who can cook \nsome numbers, but according to OMB and CBO--which we use around here--\nthey do not support the Senator's statement.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, reclaiming my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. It is the Lewin study that came out with those \nstatistics. I think it has been borne out over time that, in fact, as \npremiums go up, the rates of the uninsured go up. While you may find a \nslight blip of it going down over the past year, if you look back over \nthe course of the last 5 years, the last 10 years, the number of \nuninsured have dramatically increased in this country as premiums have \nincreased.\n  I think it defies logic--I do not believe it is going to sell with \nthe American people--that increased costs are not going to result in \nmore people being in the ranks of the uninsured. That, to me, not only \nis borne out by studies, but is borne out by practical experience. As \ncosts go up, more people are unable to afford insurance. And it is the \nCongressional Budget Office that has said the Kennedy-McCain bill will, \nat the least, increase premiums by an additional 4.2 percent, in \naddition to premium increases that are occurring naturally with medical \ncare inflation.\n  So I will leave that to my colleagues to make their own conclusions \nas to whether higher prices on premiums, higher prices on insurance, \nwill not, in fact, result in more people going into the ranks of the \nuninsured.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Conrad Burns as \na cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Since we entered the agreement, I have had a number of \nrequests on this side. We have 13\\1/2\\ minutes left on this side prior \nto the debate that will begin with your final remarks.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the 13\\1/2\\ minutes, rather than the \n7 minutes, prior to your 15 minutes, be the time that the Democrats \nwill use to close their phase of this debate.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 13 minutes \n13 seconds.\n  Mr. REID. But he was given 1\\1/2\\ minutes. So 15 minutes, minus 1\\1/\n2\\ minutes, is 13\\1/2\\ minutes. But anyway, whatever, we would give \nSenator Kennedy that final time. We would go 2 minutes to Senator \nKennedy, 2 to Senator Durbin, and 2\\1/2\\ minutes, or whatever is \nremaining, for Senator Edwards.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank Senator Hutchinson.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I know on our side we have a number of \nother Senators who want to speak on this amendment. I will be glad to \nyield to them as they come to the floor. I believe Senator Voinovich \nwill be in the Chamber in a few moments.\n  But let me just pick up on a few points that Mr. Gramm, the Senator \nfrom Texas, made during his speech. I think what we need, during the \ncourse of the debate on this bill, is the kind of careful analysis that \nProfessor Gramm brings to this issue. I think as Members of the Senate \nactually read this bill, as the American people hear the contents of \nthe bill and hear the kind of passionate expression and concern for a \nPatients' Bill of Rights in general, it will give way to concern about \nthe impact that the bill itself would have.\n  So the Senator from Texas called it bait and switch. It could also be \ncalled the exceptions swallow the rule.\n  Let me review some of those examples where the exception swallows the \nrule. On page 35 of the bill, paragraph (C), ``No coverage for excluded \nbenefits.'' The point in that very plain statement is that the contract \nis to be sacred. It is to be honored. The contract means what it says. \nThat statement, though, doesn't mean what it says, ``no coverage for \nexcluded benefits.'' If you turn to page 36, at the top of the page, it \nsays, ``except to the extent that the application or interpretation of \nthe exclusion or limitation involves a determination described in \nparagraph (2).'' So this is one of the examples in the area of excluded \nbenefits.\n  Paragraph (2) on page 33 includes anything that is a medically \nreviewable decision. So, in fact, the exception does swallow up the \nrule. Anything that is a medically reviewable decision--in other words, \nwhen you go to the independent review panel, they have virtually carte \nblanche in overturning the very provisions of the contract. If you \ndon't have a binding contract, how in the world can you make \nprojections, how in the world can anybody provide health care plans \nwith any assurance of what costs are going to be?\n  Another example is on page 144 in this rather lengthy Patients' Bill \nof Rights legislation. On line 16, it says: ``Exclusion of employers \nand other plan sponsors. Causes of action against employers and plan \nsponsors precluded.'' That sounds good. That is a concern a lot of us \nwho have questions about this legislation have raised. Are you going to \nbe able to sue your employer? Are employees going to have a means by \nwhich they can sue their employer? What impact is that going to have on \nan employer's willingness and ability to provide health insurance? The \nstatement sounds good: ``Causes of action against employers and plan \nsponsors precluded.''\n  But if you turn over to the next page, you find in section (B) and \n(C), ``Certain causes of action permitted.'' Then it goes on and talks \nabout direct participation, another example of exceptions swallowing \nthe rule. You can't sue your employer, except there are some suits that \nare permitted.\n  Then another example of the exception swallowing the rule is on page \n122. On line 19 of page 122, it says: ``Preemption; State flexibility. \nContinued applicability of State law with respect to health insurance \nissuers.''\n  That sounds good. At least it sounds good to me. I know a lot of \nStates have done very good work in the area of patient protections. So \nthe clear statement is: State law with respect to health insurance \nissuers will be continued and will be applicable. That sounds very good \nuntil you find that the rule is, once again, swallowed up by the \nexception. That was page 122.\n  Turn to page 123. On line 4 it says: ``Except to the extent that such \nstandard or requirement prevents the application of a requirement of \nthis title.''\n  In other words, it is going to be the Federal patient prescriptions \nthat are going to supersede any State laws, and to the extent they are \nnot in compliance with and follow very prescriptively the Federal \nstandard, they then\n\n[[Page S6573]]\n\nwill be null and void. They will be superseded by Federal.\n  ``Application of substantially equivalent State laws''--that is a \nstandard that undermines what the States have already done in this \narea. So we find, once again, that the exception swallows up the rule.\n  The same thing is true on the appeals process. The rule claims all \nappeals must be exhausted. It is very clear the way it states that. \nThose procedures that are put in place on internal/external must be \nhonored. You must exhaust those. But then you find exceptions that \nallow going straight to court for dollars even if the appeal has not \nbeen filed, if the injury first appears after the time has elapsed for \nfiling an appeal. Go straight to court for dollars if immediate \nirreparable harm prior to completion of appeals process, if you allege \nthat, allow the 180 days to run and go straight to court without having \nused the appeals process. You really don't have an exhaustion of \nappeals.\n\n  I find example after example of where there is a bait-and-switch \noccurring. There is a rule that is being swallowed up by the exception \nto the rule.\n  Another point the distinguished Senator from Texas made--a point that \nneeds to be thoroughly debated on the Kennedy-McCain bill--is the area \nof scope. I read that wonderful title where it says State laws will \napply and then, unfortunately, there is the clear exception that really \nswallows up that rule.\n  The Kennedy-McCain bill would allow the Federal Government to \noverturn patient protection laws in every State. The States have done, \nquite frankly, a lot. Here is all of our 50 States, various areas of \npatient protections, emergency medical care. You can see Arkansas has \nthat, Arizona, State after State. Very few States have not acted upon \nemergency medical care. They may do it in a different way than we would \ndo it. Are they less concerned than we are? Are we the only ones who \ncan establish the precise standard for emergency medical care?\n  These patient protections have been enacted by State legislatures all \nover the country. Access to OB/GYNs, once again, you can see \noverwhelmingly the States have already acted. They have already \nprovided patient protections. Continuity of care, gag provisions, \nalmost every State in the Union, with the exception of Mississippi, \nhave acted upon the gag provisions. Formulary exceptions, clinical \ntrials, a number of States have decided they are not going to mandate \nclinical trials. They have legitimate reasons why that should or should \nnot be included in a State action on a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  On the internal appeals, virtually every State in the Nation, all 50 \nof them, now have an internal appeals process that has been mandated in \nState patient protections. Forty-one States have an external appeals \nrequirement. Why should we have the right to go beyond what is clearly \nour responsibility on the ERISA plans, the federally unprotected plans \nright now, but to go beyond that and go back to all of the States that \nhave, through their own legislatures, enacted patient protection laws \nand overrule them? I think that is an error.\n  In the State of Arkansas, the following protection laws would be \nsuperseded by this Patients' Bill of Rights: the emergency room \nprovision, the point-of-service provision, the access to OB/GYNs, \ncontinuity of care, the gag prohibition, drug formulary exceptions, \npatient information, all of those would be preempted by this Federal \nlegislation. That is why the National Association of Insurance \nCommissioners have written us as a Congress expressing their opposition \nto what we are about to do if we enact this McCain-Kennedy bill as \ncurrently drafted.\n  They wrote to us:\n\n       States have faced the challenges and have produced laws \n     that balance the two-part objectives of protecting consumer \n     rights and preserving the availability and affordability of \n     coverage. For the federal government to unilaterally impose \n     its one-size-fits-all standards on the states could be \n     devastating to state insurance markets.\n\n  That is a very legitimate concern they have expressed. And the \nPresident, in his statement from the administration on their position \non this bill, expressed similar concern about not showing proper \ndeference to what States have already done.\n  Under Kennedy-McCain, at least 297 patient protection laws that are \nalready on the books would be potentially erased leaving millions of \npatients unprotected as the States have enacted them. Forty-four ER \nlaws, 20 point-of-service laws, 37 OB/GYN laws, 48 gag clause laws, 26 \ndrug formulary laws, 12 clinical trial laws, 47 prompt payment laws, 30 \nfinancial incentive laws, all of these potentially would be erased by \nthe one sweeping action in the Kennedy-McCain bill.\n  Kennedy-McCain would further force States with minimal or no managed \ncare penetration to adopt Federal standards, or else HCFA would come \ninto those States and take over the regulation of health insurance. \nManaged care penetration in a number of States is minimal. Alaska is 0 \npercent. In Wyoming, my good friend from Wyoming, Senator Enzi, has \nbeen concerned about this kind of blanket takeover, when there is only \n1.2 percent penetration in Wyoming. In Arkansas, it is 11.8 percent. In \nIdaho, it is 6.3 percent.\n  The point is that these States vary. They are widely different in the \nimpact of managed care. For us to have a one-size-fits-all approach, I \nthink, is ill-conceived and is something that we need to reconsider. Of \nthe six States which haven't enacted emergency room legislation, five \nof these have less than 10-percent managed care penetration. So there \nis a reason why they have not acted upon them. I think we should show \nproper respect for the wisdom of some of these State legislatures for \nhaving real reasons for not acting on some of these patient \nprotections.\n  At least 11 States have rejected clinical trial mandates, California \nbeing one of them, with Florida, Indiana, Massachusetts. At least five \nStates have rejected access to specialist mandates. At least eight \nStates have rejected drug formulary exception mandates, including \nFlorida, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Dakota, \nUtah, and West Virginia. Kennedy-McCain would force these States to \nadopt these provisions even if they rejected them in their State \nlegislatures for good reason. I hope my colleagues will think about \nwhat we are doing in this preemption of State laws in this very \nimportant area.\n  The amendment that I have offered is a small step in expanding \naccess. My concern about Kennedy-McCain is that it is going to shrink \naccess to insurance, that we are going to have an awful lot of people, \nfamilies and children, who are not going to be able to access health \ncare insurance because of the impact of this legislation on premium \ncosts. I have offered this amendment that would provide 100-percent \ndeductibility for the self-employed. I think apart from raising \nextraneous issues that are really germane to the value of this \namendment and to what it will do, this amendment has support. Support \nhas been indicated in the past in this body. This is an opportunity for \nus to do it. And to say it should have been in the tax bill--every time \nthe House of Representatives produced a Patients' Bill of Rights--they \npassed one that had access provisions, to expand access, and they are \ngoing to do that again when this passes in a few weeks, or sooner, and \nI hope they will. We can be as certain as you can be that it will have \ntax provisions in it.\n  It is a red herring to say we are not going to pass this--because we \nbelieve it is equitable, it is going to right a wrong--because of a \nblue-slip potential. I think that is going to be hard to explain to \npeople.\n  One of my constituents in Arkansas wrote me and my colleague in \nArkansas. I think this really expresses why this amendment is \nimportant. It says:\n\n       I am a small business owner in Springdale, AR.\n       Our company has always made an effort to provide, at no \n     expense to our employees, full family health insurance \n     coverage.\n\n  Again, they have made the effort to provide it at no expense to \nemployees. So they are paying 100 percent of the health insurance \npremiums for their employees for full family health insurance \ncoverage--and not just for the employee, but the family receives the \nbenefits. That is something we ought to encourage, something that is \ngood. He goes on:\n\n       A couple of months ago, we were forced to begin sharing \n     some of the cost of the health plan with the employees \n     because of 40 percent plus increases.\n\n  Those who would argue that somehow there is no relationship between\n\n[[Page S6574]]\n\nincreased insurance premiums and availability of insurance to people in \nthis country, that somehow increasing premiums is not going to increase \nthe number of uninsured--we have seen a lot of examples on the floor. \nWe have heard stories and anecdotes told. Here is a prime case in my \nState:\n\n     . . . we were forced to begin sharing some of the cost of the \n     health plan with the employees because of 40 percent plus \n     increases. The monthly cost climbed to over $4,000 a month \n     for our relatively young group. I fear passing [Kennedy-\n     McCain] because it will not only cause greater increases, but \n     subject our company to possible legal actions because of our \n     offering health insurance. We could be at the mercy of \n     whoever decides to pay a claim or not--and open the door for \n     the company to be liable.\n       I think this bill has a lot of danger in it.\n\n  I take that concern very seriously. I think this person who took time \nto e-mail us from Springdale, AR, is typical of a lot of small \nbusinesses that are struggling, that have a few employees, that are \ntrying to pay insurance for those employees and are facing a very large \nincrease in premiums. We are going to exacerbate that, I believe, if we \nhave this bill with all of its liability provisions included in it. \nThis is one small thing we can do to make it a little easier for the \nself-employed--give them 100-percent deductibility, and give it to them \nnow, not wait until 2003.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this e-mail printed in the Record.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   Springdale, AZ.\n       Dear Arkansas Senators Lincoln and Hutchinson: I am a small \n     business owner in Springdale, AZ. Our company employs 8 very \n     fine people.\n       Our company has always made an effort to provide, at no \n     expense to our employees, full family health insurance \n     coverage.\n       A couple of months ago we were forced to begin sharing some \n     of the cost of the health plan with the employees because of \n     40% plus increases. The monthly cost climbed to over \n     $4,000.00 a month for our relatively young group. I fear \n     passing the S-238 bill will not only cause greater increases \n     but subject our company to possible legal actions because of \n     our offering health insurance. We could be at the mercy of \n     whoever decides to pay a claim or not--and open the door for \n     the company to be liable.\n       I think this bill has a lot of danger in it. I urge both of \n     our Arkansas Senators to do all in your power to defeat this \n     bill. I urge you to vote against ``cloture'' thus limiting \n     the truth to be brought out on the floor.\n       On behalf of myself, my partner and our employees, thank \n     you in advance for lodging this request.\n                                                    John W. Hayes,\n       P.S. Your voting records are the proof of your loyalty to \n     the people of the Great State of Arkansas.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Then I received this letter from a different kind of \nemployer. This is McKee Foods Corporation, a large company that is not \nheadquartered in Arkansas. It is in Tennessee, I think, but they are a \nlarge employer in Arkansas, in Gentry, AR. I think they employ about \n1,400. It is not an insignificant employer.\n  They write:\n\n       Dear Senator Hutchinson: The Senate will soon consider a \n     proposal that will give Americans the right to use their \n     insurance provider in state and federal court for coverage \n     decisions. As a business owner, this prospect has me worried. \n     McKee Foods has voluntarily sponsored its own health plan for \n     more than 30 years. All of our employees and their families \n     have the option to take part in our group coverage, including \n     the 1,420 employees who work at our Gentry, Ark., \n     manufacturing facility. In 2000, McKee Foods and its \n     employees spent $25 million to provide health care benefits \n     for all 6,100 of our employees and their families. The \n     company directly paid for more than 75 percent of this \n     amount.\n       Over the last two years our group insurance benefit costs \n     are up about 26 percent and our prescription drug benefit \n     cost has nearly doubled. The company has absorbed most of the \n     cost increases, but employee premiums have also risen by 10 \n     percent.\n\n  That is what the employees are paying and we are going to make that \nworse if we open this to unbridled lawsuits.\n     It's important to note that none of the proposals presently \n     under consideration have protections in place to protect the \n     health care purchaser, whether individual or company, from \n     the increased cost of coverage due to insurer liability. A \n     health care bill containing additional costs will simply \n     compound the problem of rising costs.\n       Our health plan, which is governed by ERISA, is self-\n     insured, self-funded, and self-administered. Maintaining an \n     ERISA plan allows McKee Foods to provide uniform health care \n     benefits to our employees in all contiguous 48 states. We've \n     reviewed the various proposals put forth by both the Senate \n     and the House of Representatives and have come to conclusion \n     that McKee Foods can be sued for voluntary providing health \n     care benefits. Each of the major bills under consideration \n     contains language that defines the liability trigger as \n     ``direct participation'' or ``discretionary authority'' over \n     the decision. This standard directly implicates ERISA's \n     fiduciary responsibility duty. For employers who offer a \n     health plan governed by ERISA, liability is real.\n       I believe that legislation containing liability for \n     companies will certainly lead to more uninsured Americans. I \n     also believe that many employers want to offer health care \n     benefits because this type of benefit helps us attract and \n     retain high quality employees. Please remember that the \n     voluntary employer-based health care system in our country \n     provides coverage for more than 172 million Americans.\n       I'm asking you to support a health care bill that sets up a \n     strong system for binding external review instead of \n     lawsuits. Let's get patients the medical treatment they need, \n     when they need it. Reaching a conclusion later in a court \n     only benefits the attorneys.\n\n  Then he asks for opposition to this bill.\n  Are they greedy? Are they an uncaring company; they do not care about \ntheir employees and their welfare? I suggest that 30 years have put the \nlie to any such allegation. This company for 30 years has paid 75 \npercent of the premiums for their employees and their families, and \nthey write not out of a spirit of greed or lost profits. I suspect it \nwill not affect their profit line. What this legislation will affect is \ntheir ability to provide affordable health insurance for their \nemployees.\n  So many times we do the right thing in the wrong way when we pass \nlegislation in the Senate. We have the greatest motivations. Patients' \nBill of Rights--we hear these heartrending stories. They are real and \nthere is a need for legislation, but then trial lawyers get into it, \nthe clever attorneys who can write a rule and write an exception bigger \nthan the rule, and the goal of providing legitimate patients protection \nsuddenly is lost and its impact raises insurance premiums, causing \nemployers to question whether they can even afford to offer that \nbenefit to their employees.\n  I hope as we continue to debate we will address these issues and we \nwill also adopt this amendment which will help provide greater access.\n  I did not realize Senator Voinovich has been patiently waiting. I \ncould not see behind this chart. I extend my apology for going over the \ntime. I thank Senator Voinovich, the distinguished Senator from Ohio, \nfor his strong commitment to better health care in this country, for \npatient protections, and for also ensuring access is there and that it \nis affordable. I appreciate his support of this amendment.\n  I yield such time as he might require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arkansas. He \ndoes have my support for his amendment. It is well taken, and it will \ngo a long way to help provide more health care for the citizens of our \ncountry.\n  The quality of health care in the United States has long been the \nenvy of the world. If I happen to fall ill when I am home in Cleveland, \nI know that I can go to any of the hospitals in the community and \nreceive quality care unparalleled around the globe.\n  However, I also think that more can be done to improve the overall \nstatus of health care in America. In fact, I believe Congress must do \nmore to expand health care coverage for more individuals, keep health \ncare costs down and maintain the rights of each individual patient to \nmake decisions affecting their own health.\n  Five years ago, Congress realized that one arena in which the Federal \nGovernment has an obligation is protection for those Americans covered \nunder self-insured ERISA plans because the Federal Government has the \nsole authority to do so.\n  There are 56 million Americans who are in health care plans that are \nself-insured, which are regulated under Federal law. The Federal \nGovernment, unfortunately, has been slow in creating consumer \nprotection standards for these 56 million Americans, and I agree with \nmy colleagues that patient protections should be established for these \nERISA plans.\n  In 1999 and 2000, this body passed patient protections legislation \nthat filled the hole in ERISA protections. These absolute and \ncomprehensive patient protections, included:\n\n\n[[Page S6575]]\n\n\n       Access to emergency care;\n       A point-of-service option;\n       A continuity of care provision;\n       Access to prescription drugs that are not covered in plan \n     formularies;\n       Access to specialist;\n       A prohibition of gag rules;\n       Access to clinical trials;\n       Provider nondiscrimination;\n       A strong internal and external review process;\n       A genetic nondiscrimination provision; and\n       Provisions that would increase access to health insurance, \n     such as increasing the availability of medical savings \n     accounts, full deduction of health insurance for the self-\n     employed and long term care insurance.\n\n  I am encouraged that the McCain-Kennedy bill, in spirit, has the same \ncore patient protections that the Senate passed in 1999 and again in \n2000. However, while the McCain-Kennedy bill contains these provisions, \nI cannot support the McCain-Kennedy bill as currently written for two \nsignificant reasons.\n  First, the bill represents an inappropriate preemption of state law. \nOhio and the vast majority of other states have already enacted strong \npatient protection laws that provide their citizens with quality health \ncare.\n  My colleagues on the other side of this debate want the public to \nbelieve that all Americans need to be covered under a Federal patient \nprotections bill or else the quality of their health care will come \nunder jeopardy. The fact of the matter is that the majority of \nAmericans are already covered under very good, very comprehensive State \nhealth care laws.\n  The proponents of this legislation believe we need to pass a bill \nthat will wipe clean the hard work the States have done.\n  I could not disagree more.\n  A Federal Patient's Bill of Rights should not preempt the work that \nhas already been done by the States. State regulation of the insurance \nindustry has been very effective for more than 50 years. There are more \nthan 117 million Americans who are covered under fully insured plans, \ngovernmental plans and individual policies, which are all regulated \nunder State law.\n  My colleagues supporting the McCain-Kennedy legislation believe that \nthe Federal mandates in the bill should apply not only to ERISA plans, \nbut also to those 117 million Americans in State-regulated health \nplans. Apparently, they do not think that the states, which have \nalready acted and are already protecting millions of Americans, are \ncompetent enough to do the job. Instead, they think that the Federal \nGovernment will do a much better job.\n  Mr. President, do you know to whom the Federal Government will turn \nto enforce the law? The Health Care Financing Administration.\n  The fact is, HCFA already has its hands full. Administering and \nregulating Medicare, Medicaid and the SCHIP program has already \noverburdened this administration. Think about it. HCFA already has \nunder its purview over 70 million Americans through these Federal \nprograms. Now my colleagues want to place the health care of an \nadditional 170 million Americans on HCFA's shoulders.\n  Under the McCain-Kennedy bill, States will now have to report to HCFA \non the status of the health care plans in their States. It has been \npointed out to me numerous times that the regulations that only govern \nMedicare are three times what the Federal Tax Code is.\n  Imagine the regulatory nightmare that will occur when Congress hands \nover regulation of the private insurance market to the Federal \nGovernment. The simple fact of the matter is that HCFA cannot handle \nthe burden this bill would bestow.\n  However, even if HCFA had the ability to enforce uniform consumer \nprotection standards across the country, it would still not be the \nright decision. Different regions have different problems against which \nthey need to guard.\n  A ``one-size-fits-all'' approach from Washington will not work any \nbetter for health regulation than for other centralized approaches to \nproblems, such as education. All wisdom does not reside in Washington--\nlocal people understand their own local needs, and they elect \nrepresentatives to serve those needs.\n  On the Federal level, if we in Congress want to mandate certain \nhealth care changes with respect to Federal coverage, then it is well \nwithin our ability to do so. And in certain instances, it may be \nnecessary to do so.\n  But why should Congress intrude on the States and mandate sweeping, \nacross-the-board changes on how they regulate the health care industry \nin their States? We should let the States decide what is best for their \ncitizens, but there seems to be a feeling here in this town that the \nStates just will not do the right thing.\n  If you observe what the States have accomplished, you will see that \nthe States have been and will continue to be at the forefront of the \nnation's efforts to improve the quality and efficiency of our health \ncare system.\n  In fact, the States have been on the vanguard of health care \nservices, and because of this, many ERISA plans have followed suit \nvoluntarily.\n  It should be pointed out that the majority of ERISA plans have \nalready taken upon themselves to provide quality patient protections, \ntaking notice from what their States have done. They have mirrored in \ntheir insurance plans what the States have already done. However, by \nseizing and usurping the great works the States have accomplished, the \nFederal Government is once again stating a one-size-fits-all approach.\n  It will not work. The majority of States, including Ohio, have moved \naggressively, certainly more quickly than the Federal Government, to \nreduce health care inflation, expand access for the working poor, \nenhance consumer protections, and bring greater accountability to the \nsystem. In fact, if the States waited for the Federal Government to \nstep up to the plate to provide patient protections, 117 million \nAmericans would not have the patient protections they currently enjoy. \nThe simple truth is, the States have been in front of the Federal \nGovernment in providing sound protections for their citizens.\n  The following facts prove it: 50 States have mandated strong patient \ninformation provisions; 50 States already have internal appeals \nprocesses, and 41 States have included external processes; 48 States \nalready enforce consumer protections regarding gag clauses on doctor-\npatient communications; 47 States have regulations regarding prompt \npayment; 42 States have already enacted a comprehensive Patients' Bill \nof Rights; and 44 States have already enforced consumer protections for \naccess to emergency care services.\n  As a former Governor of Ohio, I have been on the front lines in the \nfight to give working men and women in Ohio real health care choices. \nAs Governor, I signed into law five legislative measures and pushed \nthrough several administrative improvements to protect families who \nrelied on State-regulated plans for their health care coverage. Now I \nam in the Senate to try to give those Ohioans who are covered by the \nFederal ERISA law those same benefits.\n  I believe the legislation the Senate approved in 1999 and 2000 went a \nlong way to ensuring that Ohioans covered under ERISA are given the \nhealth care protections they deserve. The bills passed in this body are \nnearly identical to those protections passed in Ohio for State-\nregulated plans, many of which I fought for as Governor. The bills \npassed by the Senate in 1999 and 2000 extend emergency care coverage \nunder the prudent layperson standard. Ohio enacted that protection in \n1997. The Senate passed bills included a ban on gag clauses. Ohio \nenacted that protection in 1997. The Senate passed bills included \nstrong internal and independent external appeals. Ohio enacted those \nprovisions in 1999. The Senate passed bills allowed a woman to \ndesignate an OB/GYN as her primary care provider. Ohio enacted a \nstanding referral provision in 1997, and then direct access in 1999.\n  The Senate passed bills provide patients the right to accurate, easy-\nto-understand information about their health plan. Ohio's law requires \nthat all beneficiaries have an I.D. card and access to health care \ninformation on a 24-hour, 7-day-a-week basis via a toll-free number. \nThe Senate passed bills ensure that patients may go out of a network if \nthe plan does not have an appropriate provider within its network. That \nis already Ohio law.\n  Additionally, Ohio already has enacted a prompt payment provision and \na prescription drug formulary exception. Ohio has already put into \nplace a\n\n[[Page S6576]]\n\nmandatory 48-hour maternity hospital stay benefit for new mothers. We \nwere the first State to eliminate the drive-through baby, 24-hour \nsituation we had several years ago. Prior to the State's action, in a \nnumber of instances, women were being discharged sometimes within hours \nof giving birth. Now all women in Ohio know that when they give birth, \nthey will have the peace of mind that they and their baby will have \naccess to medical care, if only for observation, for at least 48 hours.\n\n  In Ohio, we also allowed for the creation of insurance pools for \ncompanies who wanted to be able to provide insurance for their \nemployees but could not afford to do it by themselves. Now, Ohio has \none of the most successful examples of an insurance pool in the entire \ncountry--the Council of Smaller Enterprises, COSE. COSE provides health \ninsurance to more than 200,000 people and represents more than 16,000 \nsmall businesses in Ohio. Without the ability to pool together, many of \nthese businesses would not be able to offer their employees health \ninsurance, and therefore, many more Ohioans would be uninsured.\n  The second reason that I cannot support McCain-Kennedy as it is \ncurrently written is because the bill will encourage frivolous \nlawsuits, leading employers to question whether or not providing health \ninsurance is worth the cost. A great deal has been said about the \noptions available to a patient who has somehow been wronged by a \nparticular health care plan.\n  Proponents of the McCain-Kennedy legislation have indicated that the \nonly way patients can ensure that they will be able to obtain relief \nfrom being denied benefits is if they maintain the ability to sue their \nhealth plans.\n  They further contend that if they can sue their health plans, it \nshould follow that they can sue their employers. They base this on the \nbelief that employers maintain a fiduciary responsibility to monitor \nhealth plan quality, making it impossible to completely delegate \nresponsibility for the health benefit plan's decisions.\n  I believe such a provision would open a virtual Pandora's box of \npotential lawsuits and would force any employer who provides health \ninsurance to cover every health claim or risk being sued over those \nthat are not.\n  Proponents of the McCain-Kennedy legislation believe they have carved \nout employers, stating only those employers that ``directly \nparticipate'' in medically reviewable decisions can be held liable.\n  However, for all these claims of employer carve-outs, the fact \nremains, employers can still be sued. Lawsuits can still be brought \nagainst the employer for a number of reasons. For instance, the phrase \n``actual exercise of control'' broadens the avenue for a lawsuit to \ncome against an employer, although the employer had no ``direct \nparticipation'' in a medically reviewable decision. If, during \nnegotiations with a health plan, an employer agrees to the definition \nof a certain contractual phrase used by the plan for a decisionmaking \nprocess, this could be a cause of action for a lawsuit.\n  Additionally, although proponents of McCain-Kennedy believe they have \nproperly excluded employers, the phrase ``conduct constituting \nfailure'' to perform plan terms and conditions provides a clean sheet \nfor any personal injury lawyer to claw at any alleged failure of an \nemployer. This could be as minor as a simple administrative error in \nnotifying individuals about the availability of continued health \ncoverage after they leave employment.\n\n  And as a practical matter, do my colleagues think a personal injury \nlawyer will not attempt to test the defense of the ``no direct \nparticipation'' standard? If I were a savvy personal injury lawyer and \nsaw before my eyes unlimited punitive damages and a new Federal cause \nof action with a cap of $5 million, I certainly would test the defense \nlaid out in the McCain-Kennedy bill. Unfortunately, this is what it has \ncome down to: the ability of personal injury lawyers to dictate health \ncare in America.\n  Whom will this ultimately hurt? It will hurt those individuals and \nfamilies at the margins who are working hard to take responsibility for \nthemselves. I am thinking about the families to whom that employer \nprotection is provided. The fact is, health insurance is a benefit that \nemployers have provided. It is a voluntary benefit they provide because \nthey care about their workers. Approximately two-thirds of insured \nAmericans under 65 receive their health insurance through employer-\nsponsored plans.\n  I point out for senior citizens who are retired, half of their \nMedicare Supplemental for Part B is paid for under the employer plan--\nhalf of it. We want employers to stay in this business. It is important \nto the country.\n  According to a Gallup poll conducted last September, the vast \nmajority of Americans, 70 percent, are satisfied with their health \ninsurance provided by their employer. If the McCain-Kennedy bill passes \nwith its current liability provision, I cannot honestly see employers \ncontinuing this benefit. As a matter of fact, employers have already \ntold me they will drop their health care insurance.\n  These liability provisions, the unlimited punitive damages in state \ncourts on top of the $5 million damages that can be awarded in Federal \ncourt, will hang like a cloud over employers. Even if a lawsuit was \nnever filed, a prudent employer would place in his budget the \npossibility of this occurrence.\n  Therefore, the costs associated with retaining legal counsel, as well \nas the insurance premium paid against the possibility of a large award \nwould be budgeted annually, which of course, would be passed along in \nhigher premiums to the employees.\n  Employers, if they decide to continue providing coverage, will then \nplace on employees a higher participation of the financial burden for \nhealth insurance.\n  And what if one state jury finds an employer liable and grants a \nmulti-million dollar award? Well, I can tell you what will happen. \nEmployer-based insurance will tumble like a house of cards. Employers \nwill see the writing on the wall and say, Good-bye! Although I care a \ngreat deal about each and every one of you, my employees, I cannot \nafford to be subjugated to this kind of liability. Here's my \ncontribution of what I pay for your health insurance: good luck finding \nthe same coverage at a fraction what you had previously paid.\n  The proponents of McCain-Kennedy say that the State of Texas has \nenacted a similar bill that has not caused the collapse of employer \nbased insurance in Texas. What my colleagues are not saying is that \nTexas specifically carved-out all employer liability.\n  The provision in Texas law reads as follows, and I quote, ``This \nchapter does not create any liability on the part of an employer, an \nemployer group purchasing organization, or a pharmacy licensed by the \nState Board of Pharmacy that purchases coverage or assumes risk on \nbehalf of its employees.''\n  That is what any Federal law ought to state.\n  It really is amazing to me that the United States Senate is \ncontemplating opening up employers to lawsuits. Through these actions, \nwe are sending a mixed signal to the American people.\n  Out of one side of our mouth, we say there are too many uninsured \npeople in the United States. And, in fact, I think there are.\n  However, out of the other side of our mouth, we say that the United \nStates Senate may allow legislation to move forward that will increase \nhealth care premiums by at least 4.2 percent. This is on top of the \nhyper health care inflation that the country's employers are currently \nfacing--between 18 to 22 percent increases in the State of Ohio over \nthe past year alone.\n  Indeed, it is estimated that if the McCain-Kennedy bill went into \neffect as is, over 1.4 million Americans will lose their health \ncoverage--nearly 30,000 in my state of Ohio. (Based on CBO numbers).\n  What's more, according to a study conducted by the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, 57 percent of small employers said they would likely drop \nhealth benefits for their employees if the McCain-Kennedy liability \nprovision was the law of the land.\n  In addition, at least 1,000 larger employers across the nation-\nincluding many Fortune 500 companies-have expressed opposition to the \nMcCain-Kennedy liability provision.\n  The implementation of a liability standard would not only have a \ndevastating impact on many families in America, but I don't believe it \nwill have the intended purpose of providing restitution to patients.\n\n[[Page S6577]]\n\n  Most Americans don't realize that 70 percent of all health care \nliability claims filed in our courts are resolved with absolutely no \npayment to the patient. Zero dollars.\n  In cases where a payment is made to a patient who sues, the patient \nreceives, on average, only 43 percent of the damage award. Forty-three \npercent! The other 57 percent goes right into the pockets of the \npersonal injury lawyers and their expert witnesses.\n  In addition, achieving a final resolution to these claims is not a \nspeedy process. The average medical malpractice case takes over 2 \nyears, 25 months, to resolve. In many instances, that is long after the \npatient has suffered permanent damage, or even death.\n  What we need to do is focus our attention on getting patients treated \nquickly and accurately and not concentrating on getting them a pay-out \nthat may never come.\n  I would like to have an opportunity to support a bill that truly \nutilizes the internal and independent external review process. Towards \nthat goal, I believe we should revisit the legislation that the Senate \npassed in 2000.\n  In the Senate-passed bill for which I voted last year, if the group \nhealth plan makes a determination to deny coverage and notifies the \nenrollee and health care professional, the enrollee or the doctor would \nbe able to request an internal review of the coverage decision. That \nreview must be completed within 30 days for a routine determination, or \n72 hours for an expedited determination.\n  If an enrollee is denied after an internal review, he or she can \nrequest an independent, external review. An independent medical expert, \nutilizing valid, relevant scientific and clinical evidence, including \npeer reviewed medical literature, would then make an objective \ndetermination based on the medical exigencies of the case, within 30 \ndays. The decision of the external reviewer would be binding on the \nplan.\n  If the external reviewer rules in favor of the enrollee, the plan \nmust notify the enrollee of their decision to cover the benefit with \nordinary care. If the plan refuses to follow the decision of the expert \nreviewer, the enrollee could then sue in Federal court for unlimited \neconomic damages and capped non-economic damages.\n  If the court ruled for the enrollee, then the court: one, would \nrequire the plan to cover the service; two, assess a $10,000 penalty \nfor failing to comply with the agreed upon time frame; three, \nadditionally assess a penalty of $10,000, payable to the enrollee, for \nfailure to comply with the decision of the medical reviewer; four, \naward attorneys' fees; and five, provide non-economic damages of up to \n$350,000.\n  I think we should offer patients an opportunity to obtain timely \ncoverage of legitimate health services before permanent damage is done \nto them. Unfortunately, the McCain-Kennedy bill offers patients faint \nhope that, well into the future, after the damage is already done, they \nmay recover less than half of a damage award.\n  Our main goal in this debate must be to provide quality health \nconsumer protections while maintaining the ability for America's \nfamilies to obtain their insurance through their employers. We should \nnot enact massive changes to our health care system which will \nirreparably harm the ability of millions of Americans to obtain \naffordable, quality health care.\n  I hope that my colleagues and I can work to pass a real Patients' \nBill of Rights: one that will not impede on the progress the states \nhave made, and one that provides health care to patients, not money to \npersonal injury lawyers.\n  Regrettably, I do not believe that the McCain-Kennedy bill will \naccomplish these goals.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Ohio for his \nwork in the State of Ohio and for his work in the U.S. Senate.\n  I yield to my cosponsor, Mr. Bond, the Senator from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my lead sponsor of this amendment.\n  I say to my good friend from Ohio, and a fellow former Governor, that \nI recognize the work he did as Governor to assure access to the working \nmen and women of Ohio. I think his comments and his views are very \nimportant in this debate. We appreciate the good judgment he brought \nbased on his experience.\n  I want to take just a couple of minutes before we get into the \nclosing to respond to a couple of points that have been made on the \nother side.\n  Some who are proponents of this bill and who are opponents of this \namendment have offered two arguments.\n  First, they say if we--meaning Republicans--somehow wanted employee-\nsupported deductibility for the self-employed, it would have been \nincluded in the final tax package that was passed a month ago.\n  Second, they contend that this issue is unrelated to patients' rights \nand that we are trying to kill the patients' protection bill.\n  Let me deal with those two points.\n  First, regarding the tax bill, it is regrettable and, in my view, \nvery regrettable that the conference committee did not include this \nprovision in the final package. This provision reflected an amendment \nthat I offered and an amendment that the Senator from Illinois, Mr. \nDurbin, offered. We both offered amendments.\n  As I mentioned in my earlier statements on this measure, I had \nprovided over the last 6 or 7 years a continuing string of amendments \nto achieve 100-percent deductibility. Senator Durbin in recent years \nhas joined.\n  When the bill went to the conference committee, there were a lot of \ninterests that had to be accommodated. The Senate had a much lower \nfigure than the House had originally. They had to accommodate as many \ninterests as possible. The House of Representatives had a very \nimportant voice in what the final package included.\n  As a matter of fact, Democrats on the conference had a voice. I \nwasn't at the conference. I have talked to some Members who were there. \nThey tell me that the Democrats did not raise objection to excluding \nthe full deductibility. This was a conference committee of Republicans \nand Democrats from both the Senate and the House.\n  I regret that they did not get the job done. Is that an argument that \nwe should not do it now? Obviously not.\n  When you ask the American people--the men and women, the farm \nfamilies, the families of people who own a restaurant, a mom-and-pop \ngrocery store, or who operate a daycare center--do they really care \nwhether full deductibility is in a tax package or whether it is in the \nPatients' Bill of Rights, I can tell you that overwhelmingly they are \ngoing to say we just need the full deductibility for our health \ninsurance costs. They want to see the job done. They are not much \nimpressed with the argument that it didn't stay in an earlier bill we \npassed. They want us to pass it. We want to see it passed. That is what \nSenator Hutchinson and I are doing. To blame us for the failure of a \nconference to include it I believe is a bit of a stretch.\n  Second, they are saying that this amendment is being used to kill the \npatients' protection bill. If we wanted to kill a bill completely, why \nwould we put something on that is so important to the people in our \nStates and the people in America? I think that is laughable. It would \nbe laughable, if it weren't such a serious, unwarranted charge.\n  Every patient protection bill that has passed either the House or the \nSenate in the last few years has included tax incentives for health \ncare of some kind or another.\n  The House patient protection bill that we expect to see passed in the \nnext 2 or 3 weeks will almost certainly include tax provisions as well. \nAs a matter of fact, I notice that in the statement of administration \npolicy they are objecting to a user fee provision. They call it an \nextraneous user fee provision that is already included in S. 1052, \nextending for multiple years customs charges on transportation, \npassengers, and merchandise. It has a little tax measure in there \nalready. This is a tax reduction or tax deductibility.\n  Contrary to what our colleagues who are supporting the measure and \nopposing this amendment say, if there are no tax provisions in this \nbill when it finally comes out, it will be an absolute first. I will \nbuy somebody a soda if they pass a bill that has no tax provisions in \nit.\n\n[[Page S6578]]\n\n  Including tax provisions in the bill does not hinder its passage. \nFrankly, I think it makes it better because this amendment is not about \nkilling the bill. I want to vote for a bill that helps all Americans \nhave good health care coverage. That means getting rid of the bait-and-\nswitch provisions in this bill. That means taking out the provisions \nthat force employers to drop their plans because of employer liability. \nThat means taking out the provisions that rewrite the contracts that \nHMOs, insurers, write with those they wish to cover.\n  I just want to mention very briefly an article by Mort Kondracke in \ntoday's Roll Call. In it he says:\n\n       A debilitating civil war is under way in the American \n     health care industry and Congress will make it worse by \n     passing the Kennedy-McCain patients' rights bill and inviting \n     trial lawyers to enter the fray.\n       Kennedy-McCain is the medical profession's effort to \n     counterattack its enemy, the insurance industry, using \n     expensive lawsuits as a weapon. But innocent ``civilians,'' \n     i.e. patients, will pay the ultimate price.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Doctors surely should have more say in medical decisions \n     than insurance clerks. . . .\n\n  He says: The Breaux-Frist bill does it.\n  He says:\n\n       Instead of increasing the ranks of the uninsured, Congress \n     and Bush should be helping lower-income workers afford health \n     insurance.\n\n  That is what we are trying to do.\n  He concludes by saying:\n\n       . . . Congress should observe the famous rule: First do no \n     harm. Kennedy-McCain violates that maxim.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Hutchinson-Bond amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank my colleague from Missouri for his excellent \nstatement.\n  I yield such time as we have remaining to the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, may I inquire as to the amount of time \nleft on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-four minutes thirty seconds, of which \nfifteen is reserved for the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I want to start by talking on this \namendment, and then I want to conclude my remarks by speaking on the \nunderlying bill in general.\n  Deductibility for the self-employed is absolutely critical to anybody \nwho has ever been in business on their own. My brother-in-law is a tile \ncontractor in Las Vegas, NV. When he first started his business, he was \nin his late twenties. I remember talking to him about having health \ninsurance.\n  He said: I'm young. I'm healthy. I'm not going to get sick.\n  He said: Besides, I really can't afford it. When I am looking at my \nmonthly expenses, I look around, and it just doesn't pencil out for me.\n  That is the kind of person we want to be covered under health \ninsurance.\n  The way health insurance works is if we spread the risk out, \nespecially amongst the younger, healthier people, it costs all of us \nless money. So what we want to do is have people, like my brother-in-\nlaw, to buy health insurance. If we give the self-employed--which he \nis--full deductibility, it will make financial sense for more of them \nto purchase health insurance.\n  It does not matter what vehicle--whether it is a tax plan or whether \nit is the Patients' Bill of Rights--we use to provide this \ndeductibility. We have been talking about it for years, and we ought to \nfinally make this policy a reality.\n  Let me shift now and talk about the Patients' Bill of Rights. If you \nlisten to the media, it almost sounds like the Democrats and Senator \nMcCain are for a Patients' Bill of Rights and the Republicans are \nagainst one. That is not so. Almost everybody in this Chamber is for a \nPatients' Bill of Rights. As a matter of fact, the two major competing \nbills are 90 percent the same. Another 5 percent of each bill I think \nwe agree, conceptually, on the language; and then on the other 5 \npercent there is true disagreement.\n  Let me go through these divisions just briefly. The 90 percent where \nthere is agreement has to do with things that we have heard about for \nthe last several years that most of the States have already enacted. \nThey have to do with emergency room access, no gag clauses for doctors, \nand allowing OB/GYNs and pediatricians to be considered primary care \ndoctors. There is a whole list of things that both bills address and to \nwhich everybody agrees.\n  The place where we have conceptual agreement--and I want to applaud \nSenator McCain for his willingness to work with us to try to come up \nwith some language that will work for both sides--deals with, how are \nwe actually going to protect employers from getting sued? Everybody I \nhave heard from agrees that the employer should not be sued for this \nvery simple fact: If you allow employers to be sued, they will look at \nthis risk and say that they cannot afford it. Consequently, they will \ngive their employees a voucher, calculating, for example, that it would \ncost $5,000 to $6,000 per employee per year for health coverage, and \nthe employee will go out and buy their own health insurance.\n\n  However, a lot of employees who are young and healthy will say: I'm \nhealthy. I'm young. I would rather have this $6,000 to do something \nelse with.\n  As a result, those people will not have health insurance. And because \nthose people are no longer in the overall insurance pool, everybody \nelse's insurance rates will go up. Consequently, when those insurance \nrates go up, more people become uninsured because they can no longer \nafford coverage.\n  One of the biggest problems we have in this country is the number of \nuninsured. This is the reason why it is so critical that we come \ntogether on this language to protect the employers.\n  As I have learned--I was only in the House of Representatives for 4 \nyears; and I have only been in the Senate for 6 months--the devil truly \nis in the details. When we are looking at the legal language, lawyers \nfrom one side can say the employers are protected, and the lawyers for \nthe employer groups can say absolutely under the McCain-Kennedy bill \nthey are not protected. A good lawyer, I think, can take the language \nin the McCain-Kennedy bill and absolutely get lawsuits against \nemployers.\n  That is why it is important for us, if we agree on the concept--which \nwe seem to do--to come together with tight language that does not allow \nemployers to be sued, especially if they are not involved in actually \ndenying health care that they did not pay for in the first place.\n  The other thing that I think is conceptual language that we agree on \nis that the appeals process is important for us to go through first. \nAll of us agree this whole thing is about getting health care to the \npatient. Do we really want just access to a courtroom? Or do we want \naccess to the emergency room and to the hospital and to health care \nproviders?\n  The appeals process is set up with a short time frame to guarantee \nthat people will get the health care they have paid for in a timely \nfashion. That is really what this whole debate should be about--getting \npeople the health care they deserve.\n  We all know the movie, ``As Good As It Gets,'' where everybody \ncheered when the HMOs--I cannot use the language the way they described \nthe HMOs--were described in not so favorable terms when they denied \nhealth care to the child that had asthma. That is a perfect example of \nwhat we are trying to fix with a Patients' Bill of Rights--greater \naccess to quality health care.\n  The appeals process will help us get children like that the health \ncare they need. That is really a lot of what this debate is supposed to \nbe about.\n  On the 5 percent where we truly have disagreement is where we are \ngoing to have to sit down and compromise. This has to do with whether a \nperson goes to State court or goes to Federal court with their health \ncare liability suit. Neither side is going to get, I think, everything \nthey want in this. We are going to have to come down to some kind of \ncompromise.\n  The second area of major disagreement deals with the liability \nprovisions. Basically, it has to do with whether we are going to cap \npunitive damages and noneconomic damages. Are we going to put some \nreasonable limits on some of the liability provisions so we do not end \nup with these outrageous lawsuits?\n\n[[Page S6579]]\n\n  The two sides are going to have to come together and realize that a \ncompromise is going to be the only way we can get a bill passed through \nthe Senate, passed through the House, and signed into law by the \nPresident. Otherwise, we are just making political hay. Otherwise, all \nthis exercise is about is: Can we use this in the 2002 elections?\n  If that is what we are about, then I don't believe we should be here \nas United States Senators. We should be here to do the right thing for \nthe American people. We were sent here by our individual States to \nstand up and do what is right. If people want to make political hay, \nthen they can do that on a purely individual level. If they truly want \nto get a good Patients' Bill of Rights passed, then we have to sit down \nbehind the scenes where the cameras aren't, where the news media isn't, \nand say: Let's compromise on some of these things that we disagree on \nand come up with language that protects employers, makes sure the \nappeals process is exhausted, and then shake hands on the parts we \nagree to.\n  If we can do those procedures, I truly believe this Senate will pass \na very good Patients' Bill of Rights which will help the type of kid \nthat was in ``As Good As It Gets'' get the kind of health care he or \nshe deserves.\n  I thank the sponsor of the amendment for helping out the self-\nemployed. I think it is an important amendment that I will be voting \nfor and encourage all of the rest of the Senators to do the same. I \nlook forward to working with the authors of the Patients' Bill of \nRights, Senators Edwards, Kennedy, and McCain. Hopefully, we can come \nup with some compromise on the rest of this language.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Nevada for \nhis excellent statement, that spirit of cooperation that will ensure we \nreally can get a good Patients' Bill of Rights passed and enacted into \nlaw this year.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, on the first day of debate on the floor \nof the Senate on the Bipartisan Patient Protection Act, supported by a \nmajority of the Senate, a majority of the House of Representatives, and \nvirtually every health care group in America, what was the response of \nthe President of the United States? A written veto threat on patient \nprotection legislation. In fact, this written veto threat could very \neasily have been written by the big HMOs. It duplicates what we have \nbeen hearing from the big HMOs from the very outset of the fight for \npatients and doctors to give them real and meaningful rights.\n  It reminds me a great deal of what was said to the New York Times by \na consultant for the big HMOs. When brought to his attention that they \nwere spending millions of dollars to fight against patients and against \ndoctors, millions of dollars on lobbyists, broadcast television ads and \npublic relations, this was his response:\n\n       We'll spend whatever it takes.\n\n  The HMOs of America are prepared to do whatever is necessary and to \nspend whatever it takes to make sure that the patients of this country \nand the families of this country never get the protection they deserve.\n  We have a message for the big HMOs of this country. We are prepared \nto fight as long and as hard as is necessary to ensure that finally the \nbig HMOs no longer have their privileged status, that the families and \npatients of America are protected. That is what this debate is about.\n  We welcome the participation of the President. We would love to have \nhis involvement in standing with patients and doctors instead of \nstanding with the big HMOs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, throughout this debate we have heard the \nsame tired old refrain. It is the same refrain we hear whenever we \nconfront a powerful vested interest on behalf of the American people: \nCosts will go through the roof; people will lose their jobs or their \nhealth insurance; gloom and doom will envelop the Nation.\n  We heard it on the minimum wage. We heard it on the family and \nmedical leave bill. We heard it on the Kennedy-Kassebaum insurance \nreform bill. Every time the special interests launched a massive \ndisinformation campaign, and every time they were wrong.\n  Six hundred organizations of doctors, nurses, patients, from the \nAmerican Medical Association to the American Nurses Association to the \nAmerican Cancer Society, support our bill--virtually the entire medical \nand patient community. Do the opponents really expect the American \npeople to believe that doctors, nurses, and patients would support \nlegislation that would cause people to lose their insurance? Do they?\n  We heard an eloquent statement this morning from Senator Zell Miller. \nAll these claims were made in Georgia and all of them proved to be \nfalse. I hope we can move beyond these false charges and get back to \nthe business of protecting patients.\n  On this amendment, I support providing full deductibility for the \nself-employed. This can pass the Senate any time. It has passed the \nSenate before. But on this bill, it is a poison pill. It kills the \nbill. Anyone who votes for this amendment is voting against patient \nprotections. I urge its rejection.\n  During the course of the afternoon, we heard those on the other side \ntalking about the importance of the premium. It was pointed out that \nthe increase over 5 years will be 4.2 percent, a little less than under \nthe bill of the President, which is 2.9, a point difference.\n  Look what the CEO of United Health Group received last year: $54 \nmillion in annual compensation and $357 million in stock options. That \nparticular payment amounts to $4.31 a month. Ours is $1.19 a month. If \nyou want to do something, there are 7 million employees here. This one \nindividual raises the cost of the premium by $4.13. Ours, in order to \nprotect and grant greater patient protections, is $1.19.\n  Let's get serious about these facts. Let's get serious about the \nfigures. Let's not just read the HMO script sheets. Let's debate the \nreal issues and protect American patients.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nArizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, according to an article in Business Week \non February 19, 2001:\n\n       So far, though, Texans have filed only about 15 suits under \n     the new law, and few are predicting a barrage of cases, \n     according to the State Attorney General John Cornyn, a \n     Republican. Similarly, experts say that at most only a couple \n     of suits have been filed in the other six states with such \n     laws. The reason: Appeals procedures settle most cases before \n     they get to the lawsuit stage. Except for Maine, all states \n     with right-to-sue laws require patients to complete an \n     external review before going to court.\n\n  That is exactly what this legislation calls for.\n  We heard from a number of people, not about the pending amendment, \nwhich is unfortunate, but with a lot of very strong allegations.\n  Senator Zell Miller is a former and rather successful Governor of the \nState of Georgia where the law was passed. According to a media report:\n\n       Miller took the Senate floor and quoted from the \n     president's ``principles'' for patients rights, released in \n     February.\n       ``Only employers who retain responsibility for and make \n     final medical decisions should be subject to suit,'' Miller \n     read from the White House letter to Congress which became a \n     favorite quotation during the day.\n       Miller also said that a Georgia patients' protection law \n     passed two years ago should answer any concerns about a flood \n     of lawsuits.\n       ``When the Georgia Legislature debated this law, there were \n     critics, critics who made the same arguments we're hearing in \n     Washington today,'' Miller said.\n       ``In Georgia, they paid for ads saying the law would drive \n     up premiums and cause more people to lose coverage,'' he \n     said. ``The critics paid for ads claiming employers would be \n     held liable for HMO mistakes.\n\n  Sound familiar, Mr. President?\n\n       They paid for ads predicting--\n\n  I love this alliteration--\n\n     a flurry of frivolous lawsuits.\n       Oh, there was hissing and moaning. But you know what? None \n     of those dire predictions has come true.''\n       Miller said that the law is ``working well'' and that no \n     patient has filed a lawsuit yet.\n\n  That comes from the former Governor of the State of Georgia who \nstrongly supports this legislation.\n\n[[Page S6580]]\n\n  Mr. President, I have tried very hard--how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes 5 seconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have tried very hard to negotiate a \nunanimous consent agreement concerning this pending amendment. I think \nit is a good amendment. Yes, it was passed before and it was dropped in \nconference by the Republican leadership as they negotiated the tax bill \nout. That is a fact. But it is still a good amendment and it is still a \ngood thing to have deductibility for people who have to pay for health \ncare insurance. I think it is a good one.\n  So in my negotiations with the opponents of this bill, I asked that \nwe go ahead and accept this, and maybe even two others, as long as it \nstayed under the window of money that is available under this \nlegislation, which is called for in order to pay for the cost of this \nlegislation. Unfortunately, we were unable to get an agreement. I am \nvery disappointed because I think we could have included this. But we \nhad to do it in a constitutional fashion. In other words, I called for \nan agreement that we would accept the amendment, and perhaps even two \nothers, and then we would, under unanimous consent, call up a revenue \nbill that would be pending at the desk from the other body so as to \nsatisfy the blue slip concerns.\n  Look, if this amendment is passed and it goes to the House, the bill \nis immediately killed. That may be the intent of the opponents of our \nlegislation; I don't know. But let the Record be clear that I want this \namendment accepted, and I want us to accept even others that could \nreduce the cost of health care to American citizens. But we have to do \nit in a constitutional fashion because we all know that a revenue-\nraising amendment can only originate in the other body. So I will \nrepeat my unanimous consent request as follows:\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 5:30 today the amendment be agreed to \nand that there be no further revenue or blue slip material amendments \nin order to this bill; further, that when S. 1052 is read a third time, \nit be laid aside and the Senate immediately turn to the consideration \nof Calendar No. 69, H.R. 10; that all after the enacting clause be \nstricken and the text of S. 1052 be substituted in lieu thereof, the \nbill be read the third time, and the Senate proceed to vote on final \npassage of the bill; and that the Senate request a conference with the \nHouse and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object----\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that my time not be used by this \nreservation.\n  Mr. GREGG. Then I will simply object. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Obviously, that is objected to.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 5:30 today the amendment be agreed to \nand that there be no further revenue or blue slip material amendments \nin order to this bill, except for three revenue amendments to be \noffered by each leader or his designee and that each be considered \nunder the regular order with no points of order being waived; further, \nthat when S. 1052 is read the third time, it be laid aside and the \nSenate immediately turn to the consideration of Calendar No. 69, H.R. \n10; that all after the enacting clause be stricken and the text of S. \n1052 be substituted in lieu thereof, the bill be read a third time, and \nthe Senate proceed to vote on final passage of the bill; that the \nSenate request a conference with the House, and the Chair be authorized \nto appoint conferees.\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object, I will take 30 seconds off \nour time to make my reservation.\n  Regarding the unanimous consent request, as he knows, we said we are \nwilling to talk about this. Due to the timing, we are not going to be \nable to resolve it. I would be willing to suggest that we take out the \nfirst part of that unanimous consent request and go with the language \nwhich at least cleans this amendment up relative to blue slip language, \nso that the unanimous consent would instead read as follows: That when \nS. 1052 is read the third time, it be laid aside and the Senate \nimmediately proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 69, H.R. 10, \nand that all after the enacting clause be stricken, and the text of S. \n1052, as amended, be substituted in lieu thereof, and the bill then be \nread the third time, and the Senate proceed to a vote on final passage \nof the bill.\n  The practical effect of that would be that at least as to this \namendment, until we can clear the other issues, we would have avoided \nthe blue slip matter. Would the Senator accept that as an amendment to \nthe request?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, of course not, because we----\n  Mr. GREGG. This is not on my time anymore.\n  Mr. McCAIN. We would not know how many bills--I think three revenue \nbills is reasonable. This is not a revenue bill, Mr. President. This is \nnot a tax bill. This is a Patients' Bill of Rights bill. I think it is \nperfectly reasonable to say that three, as long as they fit under the \nwindow, would be appropriate. I went from one to three.\n  I kept asking the Senator from New Hampshire if we could reach \nagreement on numbers of amendments. No. We have a lot of amendments. \nWell, that is not what the bill is all about. I am willing to agree to \nthree. I think that is reasonable. So, obviously, I cannot agree to \nsomething which is basically open ended.\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object, off my time, I say that we \nare willing to talk about the number and, unfortunately, in the \ntimeframe to get to the vote we were not able to reach a conclusion \nbecause there are a lot of Members who have issues that at least \nmarginally affect this question.\n  I do think if blue slip is an issue, we can correct it right here \nwith the language I have proposed. I can understand that the Senator \nwill not accept that. I cannot accept his amendment in its present \ncontext. So I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator. I hope we can reach agreement. In \nthe meantime, so this doesn't become just a tax bill, I hope we can \nagree on three and they would fit under the window of the revenue that \nis generated according to this legislation, and, by the way, the Frist-\nBreaux proposal has no way of raising the money in their legislation \nfor that. So I hope we can work this out because I think it is a \nworthwhile amendment that would be very helpful to low-income \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all first-degree \namendments be filed by 2 p.m. this Monday.\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object, again, that would be very \ndifficult to do at this time. Obviously, there are a large number of \nMembers who have first-degree amendments. It is fairly late in the \nweek, and some are actually on the move, as I understand it. We would \nhave to object to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The time of the Senator from Arizona has expired.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I yield such time as he might require to the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 13 minutes 28 seconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the unanimous \nconsent I propounded earlier be accepted. I will review it:\n  That when S. 1052 is read a third time, it be laid aside and the \nSenate immediately proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 69, \nH.R. 10, and that all after the enacting clause be stricken and the \ntext of S. 1052, as amended, if amended, be substituted in lieu \nthereof, and the bill then be read the third time, and the Senate \nproceed to a vote on final passage of the bill.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to make it absolutely clear that if \nwe want to, there is no blue slip issue relative to this bill, this \namendment, because there is a bill sitting at the desk that can be \ndealt with now by this unanimous consent, or at the end of the day, or \nwhen we get to the end of the bill.\n  The fact is that the blue slip issue is truly not an issue because we \nhave a vehicle available to us. I ask unanimous consent for that \nrequest to be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Objection.\n\n[[Page S6581]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I will withdraw the objection if the Senator from Arizona \nwishes to speak.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. GREGG. On what time is the Senator speaking?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will not make my reservation long in deference to the \nSenator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. President, I will object. The point is, we need to have a finite \nnumber of amendments that we can accept, and we need to have it under \nthe window of revenue that would be allowed according to the \nlegislation. I hope we can work that out. But we cannot allow this \nsimply to turn into a tax bill. We have already spent time on that. So \nI will object.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, it is clear from this last exchange that \nthe blue slip issue is a red herring to throw a few more colors on the \ntable. The fact is, if we want to address the blue slip issue as a \nSenate, we can clearly do that. This amendment should not be defeated \non the basis of a technicality which is clearly correctable.\n  This is a good amendment. This is an amendment which gets to one of \nthe core issues in this bill, which is the fact the bill, as proposed \nby Senator McCain and Senator Kennedy, is a bill that will create more \nuninsured individuals. I still do not understand how we can call it a \nPatients' Bill of Rights when this bill creates 1.3 million people who \nwill not have insurance. To me it is not giving rights but taking away \ntheir capacity to get health insurance.\n  At least if this type of bill is going to pass, we ought to expand \naccess to health insurance in other ways. What the Senator from \nArkansas has proposed is a very appropriate way to do it. It is \nsomething that passed the Senate a number of times before and should be \npassed at this time.\n  I want to make a couple of points because there were a couple points \nmade as we have come down to the line. There was a representation made \nthat we are representing the special interests. Let me tell my \ncolleagues, those 1.3 million people are going to lose their insurance \nare the people I am representing. The small employer who runs a \nrestaurant or a gas station or a little business starting out is going \nto have to drop health insurance because of this bill. Those are the \npeople I am representing.\n  We can make the representation on our side when you look at the \ndrafting of this bill that it was put together with certain interests, \nsuch as trial lawyers, because it so grossly expands the opportunity \nfor lawsuits, creating new causes of action, creating multiple forum \nchoices, creating no punitive damage caps, creating no noneconomic \ndamage caps, allowing people to escape the external appeals process at \nwill.\n  We have not said that. It is really inappropriate for the other side \nto be making these types of representations.\n  The fact is, as has been represented on the other side that this bill \ncosts 4.2 percent over 5 years--this bill costs 4.2 percent every year \nin added costs, and that point should be made because that is a lot of \nnew money that is going to have to be borne by the employers.\n  Those two points needed to be cleared up. I reserve the remainder of \ntime for the Senator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes forty-one seconds.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from New \nHampshire for his good statement regarding the blue slip issue. He \ncalled it a red herring. It is a red herring. It is clear, if we want \nto adopt this, we can. If we want to enact this, we can. The whole blue \nslip smokescreen is a distraction from the reality.\n  This is something we should do. Most of us know we should do it. It \nis something we can do. It is not an effort to subvert or derail this \nbill. It is an effort to improve it. It is most definitely relevant to \nthis legislation because this legislation will increase the uninsured. \nIt is going to do that. I do not think there is any doubt about that.\n  The CBO says it is going to increase costs and, as a result of that \n4.2 percent increase in cost in premiums, at least on top of the \ninflation that is already occurring in the health care industry, we are \ngoing to see at least 1.3 million more uninsured.\n  Any effort we can make in this legislation to reduce the uninsured is \nmost relevant. This legislation will do that.\n  The National Association of Manufacturers is going to key vote this. \nI do not blame them. This is a key vote. This is an important vote. \nThis is one that deals directly with access to health care.\n  I remind my colleagues as well, every bill the House of \nRepresentatives has passed dealing with a Patients' Bill of Rights has \nhad a tax provision. This is a figleaf that is being held up on a blue \nslip, and I do not believe the American people will buy that.\n  Current law discriminates against the self-employed. Corporations are \nallowed 100-percent deduction. Employees receive 100-percent exclusion \nfor health insurance paid by their employers, but self-employed \nindividuals still are not treated equally.\n  We can, with a very modest expense, very low expense, move this up a \nyear, give them 100-percent deductibility beginning January of next \nyear. We should do so.\n  We heard a lot about the liability concerns in this legislation. They \nare very legitimate concerns. These are not special interests talking:\n  Chicago Tribune:\n\n       Better to put teeth in administrative review than allow \n     malpractice lawyers to tear the entire health insurance \n     system to shreds.\n\n  The Arizona Republic:\n\n       The cost of these reforms is uncertain, but it will be \n     borne by businesses that provide health care coverage perhaps \n     by their employees in the form of higher deductibles or \n     copayments and by employees who may find themselves uninsured \n     if their employer no longer provides coverage as a result of \n     increasing costs.\n\n  The Washington Post:\n\n       The threat of a lawsuit should not be what governs health \n     care in this country. To the extent Congress can avoid or \n     contain that awful possibility, we think it should.\n\n  Those are not special interests. Those are legitimate concerns about \nwhat this bill will do to lawsuits and litigation across the board.\n  Who are the self-employed we want to help? There are 12.5 million \nself-employed, and 3.1 million of them are uninsured. We want to \nminimize the impact on the insured. This is one way we can do it. One \nout of four of those self-employed in this country are uninsured, \nalmost one out of four. This will make insurance closer to a reality \nfor those people. Seventy percent of these individuals earn less than \n$50,000. More than two-thirds of those who are self-employed are not \naffluent, are not rich. They are making less than $50,000 a year.\n\n  Then I want my colleagues to think as they vote on this amendment not \njust about the 3.1 million who are uninsured, who are self-employed, \nbut I want them to think about their children, those who are family \nheads.\n  The Hutchinson-Bond amendment will provide the possibility of \ninsurance not only for 6.4 million children who are going to have their \nsituation made better, but for the 1 million children absolutely \nuninsured right now. That I know is a concern of every Member of this \nbody. This is a means by which we can help that situation. I ask my \ncolleagues to join in an overwhelming vote in support of this \namendment. Do not pretend that a technicality somehow justifies a \n``no'' vote. This is a sincere effort to access more people to \ninsurance.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I yield back any time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Montana, the chairman of the Finance Committee, be recognized for \n2 minutes, and the Senator from New Hampshire be recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I oppose the pending amendment for several \nreasons. One, the bill before us is a Patients' Bill of Rights; it is \nnot a tax bill. We have already passed a tax bill. It was a big one, \n$1.35 trillion, just a\n\n[[Page S6582]]\n\nshort while ago. There could be an opportunity later to examine tax \nissues, but this is not the time to do it nor do I submit this is the \nplace to do it.\n  I oppose this amendment on jurisdictional grounds because the Finance \nCommittee is the committee responsible for tax issues, and we will take \nup similar legislation at a later date, but this is not the time or the \nplace for a tax provision.\n  Also, Senator Grassley, the ranking member of the committee, agrees--\nI have discussed this with him--this is not the time and place to \ninclude this legislation. The place is in the Finance Committee. That \nis the committee of jurisdiction over tax legislation. Senator \nGrassley, as do I, has a strong interest in addressing health care-\nrelated tax cuts, but rather in the context of the Finance Committee. \nHe and I strongly urge the Senate to reject this amendment. This is not \nthe time and place to offer tax amendments.\n  When all time expires, I will make a point of order against the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am going to yield our time to the Senator \nfrom Missouri, but I want to make the point very clear. If my \ncolleagues vote for the point of order against the amendment, they will \nbe voting against people's ability to fully deduct their health \ninsurance.\n  I yield to Senator Bond.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Arkansas, Senator \nHutchinson, for making this the first amendment. My thanks to the \nSenator from New Hampshire for explaining very carefully. We can talk \nabout the procedure we want, but very simply stated, this has been \nagreed to by the Finance Committee before. This is a bill that will \nhave tax-related provisions in it. This is a bill that already does. We \nhave heard from both the Senator from Arizona, one of the principal \nsponsors, and the Senator from New Hampshire, how we assure that this \nbill is not blue-slipped.\n  I urge colleagues to support this amendment regardless of the \nprocedural basis on which it is challenged. The underlying purpose is \nto assure every self-employed businessperson in this Nation and their \nfamilies that they will get full deductibility of health care. We want \nto do something good for patients. This is a first step.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Hutchinson-Bond amendment and \nhelp take a positive step to begin what will be a very important and \nsignificant debate on how we protect patients. Cut through the \nprocedure. The question before my colleagues is: Do you want to see \nself-employed individuals have full deductibility for health care?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I make a constitutional point of order against the \nHutchinson amendment on the grounds that the amendment would affect \nrevenues on a bill that is not a House-originated revenue bill.\n  I urge Senators to vote aye on the point of order.\n  Mr. GREGG. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. If I wish to support allowing people to deduct their \nhealth insurance, do I vote no on this amendment?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, you vote no.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It takes an affirmative vote to sustain the \npoint of order.\n  Is there a sufficient second on the request for the yeas and nays? \nThere is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the precedents and practices of the \nSenate, the Chair has no power or authority to pass on such a point of \norder. The Chair, therefore, under the precedents of the Senate, \nsubmits the question to the Senate. Is the point of order well taken?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Jeffords) and \nthe Senator from Georgia (Mr. Miller) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Alabama (Mr. Sessions) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 194 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--52\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--45\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Jeffords\n     Miller\n     Sessions\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote the yeas are 52, the nays are 45. \nThe point of order is sustained and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I voted to sustain the Constitutional Point \nof Order made against the Hutchinson-Bond amendment to the Patients' \nBill of Rights legislation. While I have in the past supported and \ncontinue to support full deductibility of health insurance for the \nself-employed, I oppose this amendment to this bill for several \nreasons. Firstly, the Constitution states that tax legislation must \noriginate in the House of Representatives. Attaching this amendment to \nthis bill would create parliamentary burdens for the Patients' Bill of \nRights legislation which would be very difficult to overcome. This is \nprecisely the reason that opponents of this bipartisan legislation are \nproposing to attach this amendment at this time and why Senator McCain, \nSenator Kennedy, and Senator Edwards, the authors of the bipartisan \nPatients' Bill of Rights oppose this amendment. Secondly, the full \nphase-in of premium deductibility is already scheduled to occur in \n2003. Congress has already speeded up the phase-in twice since passing \nthe 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Because I \nstrongly support the Patients' Bill of Rights, I do not want to see \nlanguage added to the bill which will interfere with its becoming law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I think, under the previous agreement, \nthere is going to be recognition of the Senator from Arizona. We have a \nvery important amendment now that will be offered by the Senator from \nArizona. We will only have an hour of debate time in the morning. We \nwill come in at 9:30. There will be a half hour on each side to debate \nthis. But this is very important.\n  I hope our colleagues will pay close attention to the Senator and \nthose who address this issue tonight. We look forward to having a good \ndebate and discussion on this measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nArizona is recognized to offer an amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 809\n\n   (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate with respect to the \n opportunity to participate in approved clinical trials and access to \n                            specialty care)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, on behalf of myself, I send an amendment \nto the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 809.\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF SENATE WITH RESPECT TO PARTICIPATION IN \n                   CLINICAL TRIALS AND ACCESS TO SPECIALTY CARE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n\n[[Page S6583]]\n\n       (1) Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer among \n     women, excluding skin cancers.\n       (2) During 2001, 182,800 new cases of female invasive \n     breast cancer will be diagnosed, and 40,800 women will die \n     from the disease.\n       (3) In addition, 1,400 male breast cancer cases are \n     projected to be diagnosed, and 400 men will die from the \n     disease.\n       (4) Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer \n     death among all women and the leading cause of cancer death \n     among women between ages 40 and 55.\n       (5) This year 8,600 children are expected to be diagnosed \n     with cancer.\n       (6) 1,500 children are expected to die from cancer this \n     year.\n       (7) There are approximately 333,000 people diagnosed with \n     multiple sclerosis in the United States and 200 more cases \n     are diagnosed each week.\n       (8) Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorder of the \n     central nervous system affecting 1,000,000 in the United \n     States.\n       (9) An estimated 198,100 men will be diagnosed with \n     prostate cancer this year.\n       (10) 31,500 men will die from prostate cancer this year. It \n     is the second leading cause of cancer in men.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) men and women battling life-threatening, deadly \n     diseases, including advanced breast or ovarian cancer, should \n     have the opportunity to participate in a Federally approved \n     or funded clinical trial recommended by their physician;\n       (2) an individual should have the opportunity to \n     participate in a Federally approved or funded clinical trial \n     recommended by their physician if--\n       (A) that individual--\n       (i) has a life-threatening or serious illness for which no \n     standard treatment is effective;\n       (ii) is eligible to participate in a Federally approved or \n     funded clinical trial according to the trial protocol with \n     respect to treatment of the illness;\n       (B) that individual's participation in the trial offers \n     meaningful potential for significant clinical benefit for the \n     individual; and\n       (C) either--\n       (i) the referring physician is a participating health care \n     professional and has concluded that the individual's \n     participation in the trial would be appropriate, based upon \n     the individual meeting the conditions described in \n     subparagraph (A); or\n       (ii) the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee provides \n     medical and scientific information establishing that the \n     individual's participation in the trial would be appropriate, \n     based upon the individual meeting the conditions described in \n     subparagraph (A);\n       (3) a child with a life-threatening illness, including \n     cancer, should be allowed to participate in a Federally \n     approved or funded clinical trial if that participation meets \n     the requirement of paragraph 2;\n       (4) a child with a rare cancer should be allowed to go to a \n     cancer center capable of providing high quality care for that \n     disease; and\n       (5) a health maintenance organization's decision that an \n     in-network physician without the necessary expertise can \n     provide care for a seriously ill patient, including a woman \n     battling cancer, should be appealable to an independent, \n     impartial body, and that this same right should be available \n     to all Americans in need of access to high quality specialty \n     care.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment is not a complicated one. \nIn fact, it is very simple and straightforward. It simply reiterates \nthe Senate's strong support for providing strong patient protections to \nAmericans who are battling deadly and life-threatening illnesses.\n  The reason I offer this sense-of-the-Senate amendment is that there \nhas been a great deal of discussion about the difference, according to \nthe Congressional Budget Office, between the cost of the so-called \nBreaux-Frist proposal and the pending legislation.\n  At the outset, so there is no misunderstanding, this sense of the \nSenate does not in any way tell the HMOs what they should cover and \nwhat they should not cover. That is not the point. The point is that \nwhen these are covered, there are obviously increased costs, but the \nreasons for covering them are compelling. The reason I just had the \nresolution read is the really compelling statistics: 182,800 women this \nyear will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer; 40,800 women will \ndie from the disease; 1,500 children are expected to die from cancer \nthis year; an estimated 198,100 American men will be diagnosed with \nprostate cancer; 31,500 men will die from prostate cancer this year.\n  What I am trying to say is that we think there are additional costs \nassociated with coverage for a disease that affects literally millions \nof Americans.\n  The CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, scored the Frist-Breaux \nproposal as increasing premiums by 2.9 percent. They scored our \nproposal as being a 4.2-percent increase in premium cost. This is the \nestimated ultimate effect of the Bipartisan Patients' Bill of Rights on \npremiums for employer-sponsored health insurance in percent.\n  I point out that the Congressional Budget Office costs out in \nlawsuits and damages an increase in premiums under the Breaux-Frist \nbill of .4 percent; our bill, .8 percent. So there is a .4 percent \ndifference in their estimate--and we argue with that estimate--in costs \nassociated with the provisions for litigation or remedies, lawsuits and \ndamages, in this bill. I want to emphasize, .4 percent.\n  The overall difference, according to CBO, is 1.3 percent, the \ndifference between 2.9 and 4.2. But the difference associated with \nlawsuits and damages is .4 percent.\n  Where do the other differences, according to CBO, occur? Well, timely \naccess to specialists. They believe it would increase premiums by .1 \npercent and ours .3 percent. On charges for individuals participating \nin approved clinical trials, they say it would increase costs by .5 \npercent and ours by .8 percent. The right to hold health plans \naccountable--that is, the review of health care plans--the Breaux-Frist \nbill increases cost by .8 percent and ours by 1.2 percent, which is a \ndifference of .4 percent--adding up to an overall additional cost in \npremiums, the Breaux-Frist proposal of 2.9 percent, and ours, the \npending legislation, of 4.2 percent.\n  My point is, as we have already seen, the majority of the debate has \nbeen centered around the allegation that there will be an explosion of \nlitigation and lawsuits. That is not according to our view nor that of \nthe former Governor, Senator Zell Miller, who spoke this morning of his \nexperience as Governor of the State of Georgia, nor is it true in the \nCBO estimates.\n  I happen to personally believe that clinical trials are important and \nshould be part of health maintenance organization coverage, but that is \nup to the HMO. I happen to believe that treatment for breast cancer \nshould be part of an HMO's coverage, but I also believe that that is up \nto the health maintenance organization.\n  What I am trying to do here is put the Senate on record of being in \nfavor of trying to address these illnesses which affect so many \nAmericans, and it is our view, as a body, that these causes of death--\nbreast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among all \nwomen and the leading cause of cancer death among women between ages 40 \nand 55--that there are protections that all Americans should receive \nunder HMOs.\n  I stress again, we are not in any way mandating that those should be \ncovered. We are entitled, as a body, to express our opinion and our \nsense. That is why it is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution and not any \nmandate that would be in the form of another amendment.\n  This does not encourage excessive new mandates for health plans. It \nsimply says that if the plan provides certain benefits, such as cancer \ncare, then that plan cannot stop a qualified patient from participating \nin an approved or funded clinical trial.\n  So I hope my colleagues will agree on this amendment.\n  I have a letter from the American Cancer Society in support of \nincreased access to clinical trials, prompt and direct access to \nmedical specialists, and strong, independent, and timely external \ngrievance and appeals procedures.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                      American Cancer Society,\n\n     Washington, DC, June 13, 2001.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the American Cancer \n     Society and its 28 million supporters, I am writing to \n     respectfully request that you allow debate on the Patients' \n     Bill of Rights to move forward and that you support S. 283/S. \n     872, the ``Bipartisan Patient Protection Act of 2001.'' As \n     the largest voluntary health organization dedicated to \n     improving cancer care, the Society has set the enactment of a \n     patients' bill of rights that provides strong, comprehensive \n     protections to all patients in managed care plans as one of \n     its top legislative priorities for this session of Congress.\n       While the Society does not have a position on health plan \n     liability, we have identified several other provisions that \n     are critical to\n\n[[Page S6584]]\n\n     cancer patients. Specifically, we advocate patient protection \n     legislation that provides all insured patients with:\n       Increased access to clinical trials--assuring that cancer \n     patients who need access to the often lift-saving treatments \n     provided in both federally and privately-funded or approved \n     high-quality, peer-reviewed clinical trials have the same \n     coverage for routine patient care costs (e.g., physician \n     visits, blood work, etc.) as patients receiving standard \n     care.\n       Prompt and direct access to medical specialists. Patients \n     facing serious or life threatening illnesses, such as cancer, \n     need continuity of care, the option of designating their \n     specialist as their primary care provider, and the ability to \n     have a standing referral to their specialist for ongoing \n     care.\n       Strong, independent, and timely external grievance and \n     appeals procedures.\n       As of today, the ``Bipartisan Patient Protection Act of \n     2001'' (S. 283/S. 872) is the only bill under consideration \n     by the Senate that fully meets these criteria.\n       We are particularly pleased that S. 283/S. 872 includes a \n     strong clinical trials provision that provides access for \n     cancer patients and others with serious and life threatening \n     diseases to both federally and privately-sponsored high-\n     quality, peer-reviewed trials. Clinical trials are a critical \n     treatment option for current cancer patients and are also \n     essential in our nation's efforts to win the War Against \n     Cancer. Without clinical trials, new or improved treatments \n     would languish in the laboratory, never reaching the patients \n     who need them. Unfortunately, only three percent of cancer \n     patients currently enroll in clinical trials. Part of the \n     problem is that many health insurers refuse coverage for a \n     patient's routine care costs if the patient enrolls in a \n     clinical trial--effectively denying access to possibly life-\n     saving treatment.\n       S. 283/S. 872 would remove this financial barrier by \n     requiring health insurance plans to cover the same routine \n     patient care costs that they would cover if the patient were \n     receiving standard therapy. It is important to note that the \n     legislation would not require the health plans to cover \n     new costs--they would not be required to cover the \n     research-related costs or even the cost of the actual \n     drug.\n       The Society also strongly supports the clinical trials \n     provision because it offers patients access to a broad range \n     of clinical trials--including new drug trials approved by the \n     Food & Drug Administration (FDA)--helping to ensure that no \n     one is left behind as we march forward in our fight against \n     cancer. The recently FDA-approved oral anti-cancer drug \n     Gleevec is a prime example of the important role privately-\n     funded trials play in our War Against Cancer. This \n     revolutionary new drug, developed by the pharmaceutical \n     industry, has offered hope to many patients suffering from \n     chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Just as the Society \n     believes that health insurance plans should cover the same \n     routine patient care costs that they would cover if the \n     patient were receiving standard therapy, we also believe that \n     this requirement should be the same regardless of who is \n     funding the trial. Patients continue to pay premiums for this \n     care and should not be forced to go through burdensome \n     administrative hurdles solely because their best treatment \n     option is being developed by the private instead of the \n     public sector. As a result, the Society feels very strongly \n     that any clinical trials provision adopted by Congress must \n     include the innovative treatments being developed in FDA-\n     approved trials.\n       While we appreciate the efforts of Senators Frist and \n     Breaux to include a clinical trials provision in their \n     alternative bill, S. 889, the provision falls far short of \n     the protections needed by cancer patients. Specifically, the \n     Frist-Breaux proposal would exclude many new drug trials that \n     are approved by the FDA--trials that are essential to \n     providing quality cancer care. S. 889 would also create a \n     negotiated rulemaking procedure to develop a new definition \n     of routine patient care costs instead of relying on the \n     existing Medicare definition already in use. It is important \n     to note that this definition has already been vetted through \n     a federal rulemaking procedure. Further, managed care plans \n     who participate in Medicare + Choice are already following \n     the Medicare definition. Duplicating this effort would be a \n     waste of scarce federal resources and subject patients to a \n     needless waiting game that could be the difference between \n     life and death for some cancer patients.\n       The diagnosis of cancer is devastating--patients must not \n     only confront an array of medical decisions, they must cope \n     with the financial and emotional burdens as well. We strongly \n     believe that cancer patients in managed care plans must be \n     assured of access to clinical trials this year and hope to \n     continue to work with you to achieve our mutual goals.\n       Cancer patients have been waiting for enactment of a \n     strong, comprehensive Patients' Bill of Rights for several \n     years. For many current and future cancer patients, enactment \n     of this legislation is a life-or-death issue. Please do your \n     part and support S. 283/S. 872, the ``Bipartisan Patient \n     Protection Act of 2001.'' If you or your staff have any \n     additional questions, please contact Megan Gordon, Manager of \n     Federal Government Relations (202-661-5716).\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Daniel E. Smith,\n\n                                          National Vice President,\n                           Federal and State Government Relations.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague from Arizona for the sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution. I think it is important to bring this up early in \nthe debate.\n  The Senator from Arizona, in his resolution, spells out the grim \nstatistics about the fatal diseases which Americans and their families \nfight every single day. He notes the fact regarding breast cancer, the \nmost common form of cancer among women, excluding skin cancer, that \nduring the year 2001, 182,800 new cases of female invasive breast \ncancer will be diagnosed and 40,800 women will die from the disease. \nFourteen hundred male breast cancer cases are projected to be \ndiagnosed, 400 to die from the disease. Breast cancer is the second \nleading cause of cancer death among all women. The leading cause, of \ncourse, is lung cancer. This year, 8,600 children are expected to be \ndiagnosed with cancer; 500 will die from that disease. Three hundred \nthirty-three thousand people in our country are diagnosed with multiple \nsclerosis; 200 more cases each week. Parkinson's disease is a \nprogressive disorder of the central nervous system affecting a million \nin the United States, and the numbers are growing. An estimated 198,000 \nmen will be diagnosed with prostate cancer this year; 31,500 will die \nfrom this disease. It is the second leading cause of cancer among men.\n  The reason these statistics are important and the sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution is so important is that Senator McCain, as well as this \nbipartisan legislation, addresses the hope that we have to deal with \nthis scourge of disease and all the pain and sorrow and suffering it \nbrings to so many people.\n  What we are talking about are clinical trials. Clinical trials are an \nattempt by the medical profession to find new therapies and new \napproaches that may be promising and may create breakthroughs for \npeople who have lost hope.\n  HMOs, the health insurance companies, many times deny access to these \nclinical trials.\n  Think about that for a moment: You visit your doctor and he says \nthere is a suspicion that there may be a serious problem. You come back \nfor a final diagnosis and you learn it is, in fact, a very serious \ndisease; in fact, it is so serious that there is no known cure. But \nthere is a clinical trial on the way at a hospital or a university that \nis trying a new approach, something that may have a significant impact \non your disease. You ask how much it costs. Of course, it could be very \nexpensive. Can you pay for it personally? Some people can, but most \ncan't. So you call your health insurance company and say to the health \ninsurance company: I have this bad diagnosis, but I have a chance. \nThere is a clinical trial.\n  Sadly, too many health insurance companies say: No, we are not going \nto cover it. We can't afford it.\n  Clinical trials represent the gold standard of care for cancer \npatients across the United States. Yet only 3 percent of the eligible \nadults are enrolled in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer.\n  The General Accounting Office has found that patient participation in \nclinical trials is often dependent on this approval by the insurance \ncompany. They found that, increasingly, HMOs and health insurance \ncompanies are saying no to these clinical trials.\n  Yesterday, I had a very interesting visit in my office, unplanned, \nwhen a young lady from Chicago came in and asked at the last minute to \nsee me. She was in town to testify at a committee on which I don't \nserve. Her name is Liz Cohen. She was here with her husband Richard. \nLiz is a cancer survivor. She was testifying before a subcommittee \nabout clinical trials and medical research. Liz was diagnosed with \nlymphoma about 6 years ago. Luckily for her, she told me that she was \nwilling to put up a fight with the insurance company to make sure she \ngot into the clinical trial. She said--and I certainly agree with her--\nthat many people are not so fortunate. How could anybody afford the \nthousands of dollars it would cost to go through one of those clinical \ntrials? We talked about one of the new miracle drugs for cancer that \nhas just come on the market. It is known as Gleevac. The pharmaceutical \nindustry developed this revolutionary drug for chronic myelogenous \nleukemia and it has now been approved by the FDA in\n\n[[Page S6585]]\n\na record 2-month period of time. That may have been one of the fastest \napprovals ever.\n  The trials for this groundbreaking new treatment were privately \nfunded, but approved by the FDA. Why is that important in this debate? \nMany people on the Republican side of the aisle tell you there is very \nlittle difference between the Breaux-Frist bill and the one being \noffered on our side, the Kennedy-Edwards-McCain bill.\n  Listen to the situation that faced Liz Cohen, where this breakthrough \ndrug came about as a result of a clinical trial approved by the FDA. \nUnder the McCain-Edwards bill, the one I support, the bipartisan bill, \nthis type of clinical trial approved by the FDA would be covered. The \nFrist bill would not cover the trial for patients with this form of \nleukemia because they don't require coverage for FDA approved trials. \nThey make a distinction which, frankly, from the point of view of a \npatient makes no difference whatsoever. If you are talking about a \nclinical trial and a breakthrough drug, how important is it for you to \nknow whether it is FDA approved or not? If it is approved, why would \nyour health insurance company not cover it?\n  It seems unfair for Congress to limit treatment options based on who \nis funding the clinical trial. That is exactly what the bills do. The \nbill offered on the Republican side by Senator Frist and Senator Breaux \nis a bill that would have denied her the access to that clinical trial. \nOur bill would have given her that access.\n\n  There are other major problems with the Frist bill, not the least of \nwhich is the fact that it imposes a lengthy rulemaking process in terms \nof this whole clinical trial issue. It is estimated that they would not \nbe able to decide the rules relative to these clinical trials before \nfiscal year 2004, maybe as late as 2007. Can you think about that for a \nmoment--that we would wait 5, 6, or 7 years for rulemaking under the \nFrist bill on clinical trials? Would you like to try to explain that in \na doctor's office to someone desperate for a breakthrough so that they \ncan live?\n  That is what is at stake here. The clock is not just running on \nrulemaking; the clock is running on life or death. That is the \ndifference between the bills.\n  The Frist bill also provides the HMO with an opportunity to refuse to \ncover unanticipated patient care costs as a result of a clinical trial. \nSo even if you get access to a clinical trial and pay with your own \nmoney, you have to hope you won't suffer side effects, or you might be \non your own paying for the bills out of your own pocket.\n  Clinical trials are sometimes the only hope that a family has. The \nFrist and Breaux bill, sadly, would extinguish that hope. In an effort \nto protect the insurance company's bottom line, their bill would rob \ncancer patients sometimes of their last chance.\n  I hope when we look at clinical trials, there will be honest \ninformation given on the Senate floor. The Mayo Clinic and the Memorial \nSloan-Kettering Cancer Center have done studies. They have concluded \nthat the cost of a clinical trial is usually comparable to the cost of \nother treatment. But the clinical trials are important because they try \nto push the envelope and find new approaches, new therapies, new drugs, \nthings that could be used for everybody's good benefit later on. They \ngive an example. They went to the Mayo Clinic, to the National Cancer \nInstitute, and found that after one year the cost for a cancer \nchemotherapy trial was $24,645. For those under standard care, it was \n$23,964. The difference is not significant. For a person desperate to \nfind a cure, the difference makes the importance of this debate come \nthrough very clearly.\n  Another study at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center found that \nclinical trial patients spend less time in the hospital, lower costs \nfor radiation therapy, fewer drugs and supplies, and fewer operating \nroom procedures. Overall costs for clinical trial patients were 20 \npercent less than those patients in standard care.\n  Why do the insurance companies say no? It is not a matter of cost. It \nis a question about how far they will go if you leave them alone. The \nreason for this Patients' Bill of Rights is to make sure that families \nacross America have these rights and guarantees and protections.\n  What we are seeking to do with the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Arizona is to put the Senate on record, to stand up for clinical \ntrials, stand up for the bipartisan bill that guarantees access to \nthese important life-or-death clinical trials. I am happy to stand in \nsupport of the Senator's amendment. I hope all of my colleagues, \nregardless of their party affiliation, will understand that the \ndiseases that affect Americans don't know any party label. They affect \neverybody--Republican, Democrat, or Independent. I hope all my \ncolleagues will join in supporting this amendment. I thank the Senator \nfor bringing it to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Illinois for the \neloquent statement. I want to make a brief comment about the last vote.\n  I believe we made a good-faith effort in order to see that we could \ncircumscribe the number of tax amendments that would be on this bill. I \nthought it was a good-faith effort. Obviously, that offer was not \naccepted. I want to continue to work to see if we can work that out.\n  In a larger sense, we had some pretty strong rhetoric on the floor \nafter our first day of debate on this issue. But time after time, I \nhear the statement made by my colleagues on both sides of this \nlegislation that we want a Patients' Bill of Rights. There is \nacknowledgement that we are in agreement on 90 percent of this issue. \nWell, then, let's really get serious about negotiating. Let's sit down \ntogether.\n  I know I speak for the supporters of this legislation when I say \nthere is nothing that we feel is not negotiable. We cannot betray \nprinciple, but it is interesting that we go over the President's \nprinciples and we find that we are not in any disagreement with the \nmessage that was sent over from the White House as far as the \nPresident's principles are concerned. If we are in agreement on the \nprinciples, then it seems to me there should be no reason why we can't \nreason together--whether it be on employer liability, or whether it be \non the external appeals process, or whether it be in other areas that \ndivide us.\n  So I hope that we will take this opportunity after the vote tomorrow \nto contemplate it over the weekend, recognizing that the majority \nleader has stated that we will be on this bill until its conclusion, \nand take the opportunity to engage in serious negotiations because I \ndon't think that we are that far apart on this issue.\n  It is not our desire in any way, shape, or form to incur a veto. I \nwas somewhat disappointed at the President's message today concerning \nthe threat of veto because given the reasons listed, frankly, we \nbelieve that we are in compliance.\n  So I hope that we can, tomorrow, and in the week ahead, have some \nmeaningful negotiations and discussions so that we can reach an outcome \nthat meets the goal that all of us state over and over and over again \non the floor of the Senate, that we want an HMO Patients' Bill of \nRights.\n  I believe we can achieve it, and I hope today's debate--5 hours on an \namendment that has to do with revenue--will not be the practice we \ncontinue here. Otherwise, it will be a long time before we complete \nconsideration of this legislation. I, like 99 of my colleagues, do have \nplans for the Fourth of July. So I hope we can, not only because of the \nvirtues and merits of the issues, but also for less noble reasons, try \nto get this issue resolved.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I too, join my colleagues in commending \nthe Senator from Arizona for bringing this to our attention. It brings \nfocus to two very important protections of this legislation. It is \nappropriate we bring focus to these two protections. Many of the other \nprotections are essential as well, but I think these two are of special \nimportance and concern because the clinical trials part of this \nlegislation is the key, the basis of translating the breakthrough drugs \nto American families. If we do not have the clinical trials, that is \nnot going to happen, and we are in the century of life science.\n  Specialty care is of enormous importance. We may have challenges in \nour health care system, but we have well-trained, highly skilled \nprofessionals.\n\n[[Page S6586]]\n\n Specialization has brought a quality of instruction, comprehension, \nand experience to so many of our medical professionals that their \nknowledge in areas of specialization every single day makes \nextraordinary differences to families. The Senator from Arizona has \nbrought special focus to both of these areas.\n  I want to mention a few points about why I think this amendment is \nneeded and why I support it. I will explain the reason why this \namendment is important.\n  Two of the biggest loopholes in the bill sponsored by our opponents \nare in the sections providing access to clinical trials and specialty \ncare. Under their bill, the patients do not have access to critical \nFDA-approved clinical trials. Access to trials is potentially delayed \nfor years because of a cumbersome administrative process.\n  Their proposal for access to speciality care is not a right because \nit lets the HMO decide whether the child needs specialty care, but the \ndecision is not appealable.\n\n  Do my colleagues understand that? If you have a situation where a \nchild has cancer, as my own son did--we went to our general \npediatrician, and he was able to tell us very quickly about the \nimportance of going to a pediatric oncologist.\n  He visited an oncologist and received recommendations and \nsupervision. There are about 2,000 of these cases each year. He was \nadmitted into a clinical trial in which 22 children at that time had \nactually survived. But that particular clinical trial was breathtaking \nin its success. There are still a number of fatalities, but it changed \nfrom about a 10 or 15 percent chance of survival to only a 10 or 15 \npercent chance of mortality. I have seen the importance of this in a \nvery important way.\n  A ``yes'' vote on this amendment will effectively take this issue off \nthe table and put the Senate on record as saying that women and \nchildren with cancer, and any American with a dreadful disease, should \nhave the opportunity to see a specialist qualified to treat the \ndisease. They should have the opportunity to participate in a \npotentially lifesaving clinical trial.\n  Earlier today, I was talking about the importance of specialty care \nwhen serious and complex illnesses strike. It is critical to get the \nbest specialty care that is needed. Denial of access to needed \nspecialists is also one of the most common abuses in the current \nsystem.\n  According to a survey at the University of California School of \nPublic Health, 35,000 patients every day are denied specialty \nreferrals. One of those patients was little Sarah Pedersen of San \nMateo, CA.\n  Sarah was born with a brain tumor. When she was 3, it became clear \nshe needed aggressive treatment to save her life, including brain \nbiopsies and chemotherapy. Her neurosurgeon knew that Sarah needed to \nbe seen by a doctor specializing in brain tumors in children, and there \nwas no qualified doctor in her family's health plan. When Sarah's \nmother, Brenda, a nurse, asked to go outside the network, her HMO said \nno. The HMO said: We are not giving you second best, we are giving you \nwhat is on the list.\n  After months of fighting with the HMO, it finally agreed to let Sarah \nsee someone qualified to treat her condition. Her chemotherapy began. \nEveryone knows chemotherapy causes severe nausea and vomiting. The HMO \ndenied Sarah's $54 prescription for antinausea medication because it \nwas too expensive. Finally, Sarah's family was able to switch insurance \ncompanies and get proper care for their child.\n  There you have it, two parents facing one of the worst nightmares a \nfamily can have: a child with cancer. Instead of being able to focus on \ndealing with that terrible stress and working to give their child the \ncomfort and assistance they can, they have to spend their energy \nfighting with an insurance company simply to get the child access to an \nappropriate specialist.\n  Sarah was lucky in the sense that the HMO's delays did not kill her, \nbut what a burden for her family to face and what a travesty of common \ndecency. Passage of our legislation will assure that every family with \na child who has cancer can get the specialty care they need without the \ndangerous delays.\n  Women with cancer face special burdens. They must cope with a dreaded \nand often deadly disease. They need prompt specialty care. Often their \nbest hope for a cure or precious extra months or years of life is \nparticipation in a clinical trial, but too often both are lacking.\n  When a woman with advanced breast or cervical cancer reaches a \nqualified specialist, the best--and sometimes the only--therapeutic \nchoice is participation in a clinical trial. But too often, women with \ncancer and their physicians must fight HMOs to take advantage of this \nopportunity. Diane Bergin, a wife and mother of three children, \nsuffered from ovarian cancer. Participation in clinical trials has \nprolonged her life, gave her hope, and offered the prospect of better \ncare for future women suffering from this terrible disease. She was \nallowed to participate in clinical trials--but she had to fight every \nstep of the way--and she knows that other women were not so fortunate. \nHere is what she said, ``No one facing a serious illness should be \ndenied access to care because that treatment is being provided through \na clinical trial. Sometimes, it is the only hope we have. And the \nbenefit to me, whether short or long-term, will surely help those women \nwho come after me seeking a cure, a chance to prolong their life for \njust a little while, just so that they can attend a graduation, or a \nwedding, or the birth of a grandchild.''\n  Traditionally, the insurance companies have paid the routine doctor \nand hospital costs associated with clinical trials.\n  According to the CBO, 90 percent of the cost of such trials is paid \nby the insurance companies. But managed care is reversing that policy, \nwith devastating effects on patients and researchers alike.\n  Diane Bergen was a patient at the Lombardi Cancer Center in \nWashington. Karen Steckley, a nurse, is director of clinical operations \nat the center. She has eight full-time master level nurses on her staff \nwho spend virtually all of their time, not in patient care, but in \narguing with managed care companies. These companies do not want to pay \nfor clinical trials, even when it is clearly the best treatment \navailable for a patient. Often Ms. Steckley's team is able to get \npatients into trials. But sometimes they fail and patients suffer or \ndie needlessly as a result.\n  Our legislation will end this abuse. That is one reason it has been \nendorsed by virtually every organization in the country representing \ncancer patients.\n  We have heard moving testimony on the subject. In one of the many \nforums we held on access to specialists for cancer patients, we heard \nfrom Dr. Mirtha Casimir, a distinguished Texas oncologist. Dr. Casimir \ntalked about the heartbreaking stories of cancer patients whose HMOs \ndelay and deny access to specialty care--often until it is too late. \nWhen Dr. Casimir gets a patient whose cancer has progressed \nsubstantially from the initial diagnosis to the time they are allowed \nto seek needed specialty care, she often flips to the front of the \nchart. Nine times out of ten, the insurer is an HMO. Every centimeter a \ncancer grows can mean the difference between a good chance at life and \nthe likelihood of death. Every centimeter represents potentially \ndevastating and avoidable pain, suffering, and death for a patient and \na family.\n  Dr. Casimir's message was clear: Pass the Patients' Bill of Rights so \nmore cancer patients will not die needlessly. That is exactly what the \nMcCain amendment will accomplish, something which the underlying \namendment on clinical trials fails to do.\n  Congress took action last year in the area of the Medicare and \nMedicare Plus by establishing the protocol for shared costs between the \nindustry and clinical trials. All of that was worked out. The basic \nagreement is completely consistent with the Institute of Medicine's \nrecommendation. It is working and working well. Yet under their \nproposal, they have to go through the whole administrative process once \nagain to try to determine the costs. The best estimates would take 5 to \n6 years. That kind of delay is not acceptable.\n  The opponent's bill also excludes FDA trials which, as we have \nmentioned previously, are a source of enormous importance. So many of \nthese trials involve pharmaceutical companies on the cutting edge of \nbreakthrough drugs, drugs that offer enormous opportunities. A patient \ncannot\n\n[[Page S6587]]\n\neven gain entrance into the clinical trial unless the doctor makes the \ndetermination that there is a reasonable chance of success. Still, \nunder the Frist-Breaux proposal, the clinical trials provision does not \ngive the clear guarantees that are in the McCain amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two letters be printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks, one from the American Cancer Society and \nanother from the Cancer Leadership Council.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit No. 1.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. From the Cancer Leadership Council:\n  On behalf of cancer patient advocates, health care professionals and \nresearch organizations, the undersigned organizations thank you for \nyour vital leadership in introducing a Patients' Bill of Rights that \nprovides comprehensive coverage for routine patient care costs in \nclinical trials. Notably, your legislation covers ALL high quality \nclinical trials, not just those sponsored by government funding \nagencies. As cancer drug development is increasingly undertaken by the \npharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, it is essential that their \ntrials be accessible to cancer patients, and your legislation will \nachieve this result. In addition, your bill provides a workable \ndefinition of ``routine patient care costs'' that will enable \nimplementation to proceed expeditiously.\n  That is what the McCain amendment is all about.\n  The American Cancer Society talks about increased access and about \nassuring that the cancer patients who need access get access to \nclinical trials. Access must be available to trials that involve \nlifesaving treatments provided in both federally and privately funded \ntrials. Approved high-quality peer reviews are an essential component \nof this process. Clinical trials should have the same coverage for \nroutine patient care costs as patients receiving standard care.\n  This is an enormously important protection for the American people. \nWe should embrace it, endorse it, and ensure this kind of patient \nprotection is included in any successful Patients' Bill of Rights \nlegislation.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n\n                                      American Cancer Society,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 13, 2001.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: On behalf of the American Cancer \n     Society and its 28 million supporters, I am writing to \n     respectfully request that you allow debate on the Patients' \n     Bill of Rights to move forward and that you support S. 283/S. \n     872, the ``Bipartisan Patient Protection Act of 2001.'' As \n     the largest voluntary health organization dedicated to \n     improving cancer care, the Society has set the enactment of a \n     patients' bill of rights that provides strong, comprehensive \n     protections to all patients in managed care plans as one of \n     its top legislative priorities for this session of Congress.\n       While the Society does not have a position on health plan \n     liability, we have identified several other provisions that \n     are critical to cancer patients. Specifically, we advocate \n     patient protection legislation that provides all insured \n     patients with:\n       Increased access to clinical trials--assuring that cancer \n     patients who need access to the often life-saving treatments \n     provided in both federally and privately-funded or approved \n     high-quality, peer-reviewed clinical trails have the same \n     coverage for routine patient care costs (e.g., physician \n     visits, blood work, etc.) as patients receiving standard \n     care.\n       Prompt and direct access to medical specialists. Patients \n     facing serious or life threatening illnesses, such as cancer, \n     need continuity of care, the option of designating their \n     specialist as their primary care provider, and the ability to \n     have a standing referral to their specialist for ongoing \n     care.\n       Strong, independent, and timely external grievance and \n     appeals procedures.\n       As of today, the ``Bipartisan Patient Protection Act of \n     2001'' (S. 283/S. 872) is the only bill under consideration \n     by the Senate that fully meets these criteria.\n       We are particularly pleased that S. 283/S. 872 includes a \n     strong clinical trials provision that provides access for \n     cancer patients and others with serious and life threatening \n     diseases to both federally and privately-sponsored high-\n     quality, peer-reviewed trials. Clinical trials are a critical \n     treatment option for current cancer patients and are also \n     essential in our nation's efforts to win the War Against \n     Cancer. Without clinical trials, new or improved treatments \n     would languish in the laboratory, never reaching the patients \n     who need them. Unfortunately, only three percent of cancer \n     patients currently enroll in clinical trials. Part of the \n     problem is that many health insurers refuse coverage for a \n     patient's routine care costs if the patient enrolls in a \n     clinical trial--effectively denying access to possibly life-\n     saving treatment.\n       S. 283/S. 872 would remove this financial barrier by \n     requiring health insurance plans to cover the same routine \n     patients care costs that they would cover if the patient were \n     receiving standard therapy. It is important to note that the \n     legislation would not require the health plans to cover new \n     costs--they would not be required to cover research-related \n     costs or even the cost of the actual drug.\n       The Society also strongly supports the clinical trials \n     provision because it offers patients access to a broad range \n     of clinical trials--including new drug trials approved by the \n     Food and Drug Administration (FDA)--helping to ensure that no \n     one is left behind as we march forward in our fight against \n     cancer. The recently FDA-approved oral anti-cancer drug \n     Gleevec is a prime example of the important role privately-\n     funded trials play in our War Against Cancer. This \n     revolutionary new drug, developed by the pharmaceutical \n     industry, has offered hope to many patients suffering from \n     chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Just as the Society \n     believes that health insurance plans should cover the same \n     routine patient care costs that they would cover if the \n     patient were receiving standard therapy, we also believe that \n     this requirement should be the same regardless of who is \n     funding the trial. Patients continue to pay premiums for this \n     care and should not be forced to go through burdensome \n     administrative hurdles solely because their best treatment \n     option is being developed by the private instead of the \n     public sector. As a result, the Society feels very strongly \n     that any clinical trials provision adopted by Congress must \n     include the innovative treatments being developed in FDA-\n     approved trials.\n       While we appreciate the efforts of Senators Frist and \n     Breaux to include a clinical trials provision in their \n     alternative bill, S. 889, the provision falls far short of \n     the protections needed by cancer patients. Specifically, the \n     Frist-Breaux proposal would exclude many new drug trials that \n     are approved by the FDA--trials that are essential to \n     providing quality cancer care. S. 889 would also create a \n     negotiated rulemaking procedure to develop a new definition \n     of routine patient care instead of relying on the existing \n     Medicare definition already in use. It is important to note \n     that this definition has already been vetted through a \n     federal rulemaking procedure. Further, managed care plans who \n     participate in MedicareChoice are already following the \n     Medicare definition. Duplicating this effort would be a waste \n     of scarce federal resources and subject patients to a \n     needless waiting game that could be the difference between \n     life and death for some cancer patients.\n       The diagnosis of cancer is devastating--patients must not \n     only confront an array of medical decisions, they must cope \n     with the financial and emotional burdens as well. We strongly \n     believe that cancer patients in managed care plans must be \n     assured of access to clinical trials this year and hope to \n     continue to work with you to achieve our mutual goals.\n       Cancer patients have been waiting for enactment of a \n     strong, comprehensive Patients' Bill of Rights for several \n     years. For many current and future cancer patients, enactment \n     of this legislation is a life-or-death issue. Please do your \n     part and support S. 283/S. 872, the ``Bipartisan Patient \n     Protection Act of 2001.'' If you or your staff have any \n     additional questions, please contact Megan Gordon, Manager of \n     Federal Government Relations (202-661-5716).\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Daniel E. Smith,\n\n                                          National Vice President,\n     Federal and State Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Cancer Leadership Council,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 13, 2001.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Senate Russell Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     Senate Russell Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John Edwards,\n     Senate Dirksen Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators McCain, Kennedy and Edwards: On behalf of \n     cancer patient advocates, health care professionals and \n     research organizations, the undersigned organizations thank \n     you for your vital leadership in introducing a Patients' Bill \n     of Rights that provides comprehensive coverage for routine \n     patient care costs in clinical trials. Notably, your \n     legislation covers all high quality clinical trials, not just \n     those sponsored by government funding agencies. As cancer \n     drug development is increasingly undertaken by the \n     pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, it is essential \n     that their trials be accessible to cancer patients, and your \n     legislation will achieve this result. In addition, your bill \n     provides a workable definition of ``routine patient care \n     costs'' that will enable implementation to proceed \n     expeditiously.\n       One of the primary objectives of advocacy by the cancer \n     community over the past decade has been assured coverage of \n     routine patient care costs in clinical trials. Last year, the \n     Medicare program acted pursuant to executive memorandum to \n     extend coverage to all trials conducted under the auspices of \n     either government funding agencies like the National \n     Institutes of Health (NIH) or the regulatory oversight of the \n     Food and Drug\n\n[[Page S6588]]\n\n     Administration (FDA). If such a policy is appropriate for the \n     Medicare program, surely it should be a guaranteed right for \n     patients under private health plans.\n       Recent reports in the scientific and popular press have \n     highlighted the impressive advances in development of cancer \n     drugs that are both more effective and less toxic than \n     traditional treatments. People with cancer should have early \n     access to these investigational drugs, as well as \n     investigational devices, in the context of high quality \n     clinical trials. Without a comprehensive coverage provision, \n     patients will continue to be at the mercy of health plans' \n     inconsistent approach to this issue. For this reason, we \n     strongly support the clinical trials provisions contained in \n     S. 283 and look forward to their eventual enactment.\n                                    The Cancer Leadership Council.\n\n\n                                members\n\n       Alliance for Lung Cancer Advocacy, Support, and Education.\n       American Cancer Society.\n       American Society of Clinical Oncology.\n       American Society for Therapeutic Radiology & Oncology, Inc.\n       Association of American Cancer Institutes.\n       Cancer Care, Inc.\n       Cancer Research Foundation of America.\n       The Children's Cause, Inc.\n       Coalition of National Cancer Cooperative Groups, Inc.\n       Colorectal Cancer Network.\n       Cure for Lymphoma Foundation.\n       Kidney Cancer Association.\n       International Myeloma Foundation.\n       The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.\n       Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation.\n       National Alliance of Breast Cancer Organizations.\n       National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship.\n       National Patient Advocate Foundation.\n       National Prostate Cancer Coalition.\n       North American Brain Tumor Coalition.\n       Ovarian Cancer National Alliance.\n       Pancreatic Cancer Action Network.\n       Susan G.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in response to the amendment of the \nSenator from Arizona on clinical trials. I will spend the next few \nminutes reflecting on what clinical trials are and how many clinical \ntrials are out there, the tremendous benefit and the power of clinical \ntrials to translate basic science, basic knowledge to the patient, to \nthe clinical application to that patient, and then that transfer or \ndiscovery and creation and investment in research at the basic level, \nthat transition through clinical trials in order to have practical \napplication in terms of curing cancer or heart disease or lung disease \nor kidney disease or Parkinson's disease, a neurological disease. It \ncan't be done without the transition through clinical trials.\n  I have participated in a number of clinical trials as a scientist and \nas a surgeon. I have participated in clinical trials as an investigator \nof artificial hearts. I have participated in clinical trials in heart \nvalves that have been inserted to see whether or not those heart valves \nwould work, whether they would last. I have participated in clinical \ntrials in prescription drugs and in immunosuppressive drugs, drugs \ngiven to transplant patients to fight infections and to suppress the \nimmune system so a transplanted heart could survive short term, \nmidterm, and long term.\n  In this role as a physician and as a scientist and as a clinician, \nwhat is called a clinical investigator, I have seen the good things and \nthe great benefits of trials, but I have also seen the inevitable \nfailures. That is why you do an experiment, that is why you do \nexperiments on humans. That is what a clinical trial is. You don't \nreally know whether that basic science or early clinical discovery can \nbe applied practically in a safe and effective way, so you do the \nclinical trial.\n  I say that because it is clear that there is a real lack of \nunderstanding of the rich value, coupled with the potential adverse \neffects that are inherent in this process, of basic science to clinical \nscience to application.\n  Clinical trials are just that. They are trials. They are \ninvestigations. They are experiments.\n  I want to spend a little bit of time talking about that both the good \nand the bad. I also want to give some sort of feel for this for my \ncolleagues, because as I talked to my colleagues and we heard this \namendment was going to come up (We had the chance to look at the \namendment about 20 minutes ago for the first time), my colleagues would \ncome up to me and ask: How many clinical trials are there today? Are we \ntalking about 100 clinical trials? Are we talking about 200 clinical \ntrials, or 300 clinical trials, or 100 clinical trials, or 1,000 \nclinical trials, or 10,000 clinical trials, or 100,000 clinical trials?\n  Right now, as I talk about those numbers, I wonder what my colleagues \nare thinking. Is it 5,000, or is it 10,000? Because clinical trials \ncost something. Everybody listening to me in this Chamber today and \neverybody around the country is going to have to bear the burden of \nthat cost. Again, there is tremendous benefit, but it has an increased \ncost. We should know at least how many trials there are. How else can \nyou know what the cost, or the incremental cost, is going to be? We \nknow that the incremental cost is ultimately going to come from an \nincrease in premiums. How much will the 170 million people out there \nwho get their health care from their employer have to pay?\n  I ask my colleagues, is it 1,000 trials, or is it 5,000, or is it \n10,000? I will come back to that as people are trying to figure out how \nmany trials there are.\n  What is the nature of these trials? There is a pill and a placebo \ngiven to an individual to take for a period of time. That pill could do \nany number of things. It could, hopefully, stop heart disease. \nHopefully, it could slow down a malignant cancer. Hopefully, it could \nreverse what might otherwise be intractable deterioration of the \nkidneys. But you don't know. Otherwise, it wouldn't be a clinical \ntrial. You just do not know how that experiment will turn out. You hear \nthe good things. You hear the positive things. You hear the hope, and \nyou know the innovation will capture the dreams. Members will show \npictures and talk about individuals. It is all there. But ultimately we \nhave to translate that down into policy.\n  It is done one way in the Kennedy-McCain-Edwards bill. It is done \ndifferently in the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill. It has been done \ndifferently in bills that have passed in the Senate and in the last \nCongress. We discussed and debated for hours on the floor different \napproaches, different costs, and, yes, different benefits, because it \nis unlimited; there is no stopping in terms of what the scope could \npotentially be.\n  But this bill is about balance. It should be about balance. It should \nbe about balance--introducing new patient protections, new patient \nrights, but doing it in a way that you don't drive up the cost \nunnecessarily so high that the working poor have to drop their \ninsurance because they cannot afford it.\n  Intuitively and practically speaking, we know that the more you load \nonto a bill in terms of real costs--and all these things in health care \nare expensive today--that the increased costs are passed on to the \nperson paying the premium. At some point, if that person is just \nscraping by, that person is going to say: I just can't afford health \ninsurance anymore. I can't afford to pay for the 25,000 clinical trials \nfor people all across the country because I don't have the money. I \nhave to take care of my children and put food on the table.\n  That is why we have to again and again keep coming back to balance in \nthis particular bill.\n\n  I have been blessed in the last 20 years to be a scientist and an \nactive clinical investigator, and to be someone who is both trained to \nparticipate and watch these thoughts, the creativity, and the \ninnovation come alive.\n  I was blessed in my own clinical practice to be in the field of heart \nand lung transplantation. When I first started doing heart transplants, \nwe thought heart-lung transplants would never be done successfully. \nFive years later, we were doing heart-lung transplants. At that time, \nlung transplants had never been done successfully. Then we were doing \nlung transplants. And we started transplanting little babies at 5 and 6 \ndays of age.\n  Again, a lot of investigational drugs were being used to \nimmunosuppress the patients. In fact, most of the drugs\n\n[[Page S6589]]\n\nwere investigational in clinical trials at the time because it was a \nnew field.\n  There was a 6-day-old child I was able to transplant who had a 100-\npercent mortality and would die, but because of the great innovation \nand the breakthrough in drugs I was able to give that child its heart \nthat I transplanted, that little 6-day-old baby, whose heart was about \nthe size of my thumbnail, would be alive 6 months later, a year later, \nor 5 years later, or 7 years later, or 10 years later, or 12 years \nlater.\n  That is the blessing I have seen. I have seen the clinical trials, \nand I have seen the benefits of clinical trials. There have been \ndramatic advancements.\n  This Senate has contributed tremendously to that process I just \ndescribed--to the innovation, to the advances in science, to the \nclinical applications, and taking basic science and getting it to the \nfield as quickly as possible. How? By supporting basic research.\n  Yes, I am proud that, under Republican leadership, we are doubling \nthe National Institutes of Health funding. We started about 3 years \nago. Connie Mack sat right behind me and said day in and day out that \nwe were going to double NIH funding.\n  As I sat where the President is sitting right now and listened, I \nthought it would be tremendous to be able to double the funding. I was \nnot sure it could be done in this day and time, but indeed we are about \nthree-quarters of the way through the process of doubling basic science \nresearch.\n  The NIH also funds clinical trials and basic science. This body has \ncontributed tremendously to investing in clinical trials and basic \nscience research. We have done a pretty good job in creating and \nfostering an environment of innovation where breakthroughs occur--not \nas I described when I started doing heart transplants. We were doing \nheart-lung transplants. We started doing single lung transplants and \nthen pediatric heart-lung transplants. That was during the period of \nyears that I was able to participate. Now we are seeing clinical \nbreakthroughs because of investment in clinical trials. That is how \nimportant they are.\n  I was thinking about this acceleration and explosion of innovation. \nIt requires those clinical trials as we walk through that process of \nunderstanding disease.\n  The human genome project: 15 years ago we didn't know 3 billion bits \nof information. What we now know we didn't know 12 years ago. Those 3 \nbillion bits of information ultimately are going to be organized in \nsuch a way, through improved understanding of clinical research and \neventually clinical trials, that we will be able to take that new \ninformation and translate it in breakthrough ways for cures--yes, cures \nof diseases that 12 or 15 years ago we would have said were \nimpossible--we would never see that cure.\n  Let me start on some of the issues. The first point I need to make is \nthat clinical trials, by definition, are experiments. We try to \nminimize the adverse reactions. But there are adverse reactions. People \ncan be hurt by those experiments. We minimize that.\n  I want to talk a little bit about the patient protections because \nthat is very important as we go forward. Right now, our patient \nprojections are inadequate. We are holding hearings on a regular basis \nin the Public Health Subcommittee. I will mention several shortly.\n  Mr. President, the point I wish to begin with is this whole point \nthat clinical trials are clinical investigations. They are \nexperimentation on humans. Therefore, you have the positive, which is \nhuge, which I have described, but you do have the adverse reactions. I \nsay that because when we say we are either going to invest in or \nencourage clinical trials, we basically will, I believe, encourage \npeople to participate in clinical trials. I think that is a good thing. \nI think it is a critical thing if we are going to really handle this \nexplosion in knowledge.\n  In addition, as public servants, we in this body need to be prepared \nto make sure that each of those patients or individuals who comes into \nclinical trials comes in with the full trust that their safety is first \nand foremost. Based on hearings Senator Kennedy and I have had in the \nPublic Health Subcommittee, it seems clear that today we are failing \nmiserably in terms of what is called human subject protections in \nclinical trials. I say that because, again, we are on a Patients' Bill \nof Rights and we all want to focus on the patients and helping the \npatients as much as possible.\n  In doing that, we at least need to be aware of the positive and the \nnegative, and the potential of doing harm unless we have a system that \nis sufficiently developed, with sufficient safeguards, to make sure it \ncan handle this increase in the numbers of people participating as we \ngo forward.\n  It was about a year ago, a year and a half ago, that I had the \nopportunity to meet the family of Jesse Gelsinger, who died in a \nclinical trial in 1999. I mention that because the Public Health \nSubcommittee addressed this issue of oversight structures that we have \nin our Government. Whether it is the National Institutes of Health or \nthe FDA, there are certain oversight mechanisms we have built in to \nassure that human subjects are protected. It became clear in those \nhearings that there had been at that time--we have had some \nimprovement, but not nearly enough--a systemic breakdown of oversight. \nThat ranged from the clinical investigators conducting the clinical \ntrials all the way to the institutional review boards. It included the \nFederal agencies that are responsible for ensuring the safety of \npatients.\n  We have made real progress. Individual researchers, research \ninstitutions, and Federal agencies have all come together and have \nworked to address the specific problem that had to do with gene \ntherapy. Again, you heard me just a few minutes ago speaking of my \nexcitement in relation to the 3 billion bits of information in one of \nthe most successful Government investments ever. We probably spent $12, \n$13 billion over a 10-year period for the human genome project. It came \nin under-budget, in a shorter period of time. That is rare for \nGovernment.\n  But as public oversight officials, you see one of the downsides: The \nfact that basic science, as it was, rushed to the clinical arena, \nresulted in death.\n  Again, people do not generally hear that we have to be careful. We \nhave to address the good and the bad and the difficult. There is much \nto be done. I continue to hear stories about problems in our system for \nprotecting human research subjects.\n  Secondly, I want to mention this whole idea of access to clinical \ntrials. I appreciate the amendment the Senator from Arizona has offered \nbecause it does bring attention to the importance of these clinical \ntrials. The language that is used, the findings, the recommendations \nthat are made in the sense-of-the-Senate amendment, I think, are very \npositive in terms of what is set out as fact and what the underlying \nbill tries to do. It is a sense of the Senate that we will be voting on \ntomorrow.\n\n  I mentioned before in my remarks the various bills that are now \nbefore the Senate. Right now we are debating the McCain-Kennedy-Edwards \nbill on clinical trials. This is a provision that is different from the \nprovision that is in my bill, the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill. It is \ndifferent from the amendment that was adopted in this Senate Chamber \nlast year.\n  The bill we debated in this Chamber, and passed with a majority vote, \nrequired private sector, self-insured, employer-sponsored health \nbenefit plans to provide coverage for routine patient costs associated \nwith one type of clinical trial, and that is cancer.\n  We have progressed since that debate a year and a half ago. At that \npoint in time, my question was--and Senator Dodd and I had an exchange \nback and forth--how much do these cancer trials cost? This is cancer. \nCancer is the one that is the most studied of all the clinical trials.\n  We will talk about how many clinical trials there are out there. \nThere are thousands of cancer clinical trials. They have been studied \nand studied because it is pretty easy to study them, for the most part.\n  You have a patient who has cancer. It can be in the early, mid, or \nlate stages of cancer. You have an intervention. You compare two \ninterventions. Sometimes it is just a pill, some type of medicine, \nversus a placebo. You see actually which of those works. And you go \nahead. You have a clinical trial that is double blinded; which is, you \ndo not know which medicine the patient is getting. You have to have \nenough patients and statistically analyze those\n\n[[Page S6590]]\n\npatients in such a way that you determine what the medicine you are \ntesting actually does versus not doing anything. That is what a \nclinical trial is. People say: No. We thought everybody gets the \nexperimental medicine. No, that is not the way it is; otherwise, you \nare not going to know incrementally what the impact is. You have to \ngive one the intervention, the other not the intervention in these \nclinical trials.\n  Most clinical trials are double blinded; maybe 95 percent of them. \nThey should be, because otherwise you inject bias into it, so there is \na 50-percent chance you are not getting the intervention you think you \nmight be getting. Again, that is appropriate. I am not being critical. \nThat is the only way to find out what the incremental difference is as \nyou go forward.\n  For cancer clinical trials, the data is a little bit mixed, but there \nis pretty good evidence that if the cancer clinical trials are \nconducted well, and they are in appropriate centers--centers of \nexcellence that do a lot of cancer studies--you can actually save some \nmoney in terms of having somebody in a protocol versus treating them \noutside of protocol, having them in a clinical trial. There is some \ndata--mixed data--from some very good institutions that demonstrates \nthat, again, for cancer. There is some anecdotal data for noncancer, \nfor some heart disease, but again it is very mixed.\n  Some might say: In my study it costs a lot more to test artificial \nhearts for heart disease and kidney disease. If you start looking more \nin the device arena, there have not been very many studies of how much \nthe costs of those trials are going to be. Somebody might have a \ncardiomyopathy, a big dilated heart, and you might give one set of \npatients drugs to try to reduce the size of that heart. That is pretty \ninexpensive. You do not have to go into the hospital to do that. And \nthe other arm--to compare the two--is you would make an incision down \nthe sternum, and you would open up the manubrium and the sternum, open \nup the paracardial sac, take the heart, put an artificial heart around \nit, close everything up, and the patient would be in the hospital for \nmaybe 2 weeks, maybe 3 weeks. That hospitalization would be very \nexpensive, and you are comparing it to somebody giving pills to someone \non the outside.\n  The question is, What are the routine costs? Because that is what we \nare talking about reimbursing. Then it gets pretty hard because in \nrelation to what are the routine costs, do the routine costs include \nthe hospitalization? You might say, yes, an artificial heart can be \npaid for by the company studying it. The clinical trial could be \nreimbursed by the National Institutes of Health. But what about the \nhospitalization in that arm? Or is it just the testing when you put in \nthe artificial heart, is that the routine cost? Nobody can answer the \nquestion. Why? Because nobody really thought about it because the \nstudies had been for the pills, studying cancers, and hadn't been for \ncardiomyopathy and the human heart, major surgery.\n\n  I use that as sort of the extreme example with the understanding that \nyou have big technology, expensive, hundreds of thousands of dollars \nout here, and you have some inexpensive therapy in the other arm. And \nyou are asking a managed care company or insurance company to pay for \nthe routine cost of both of those and the thousands of other trials \nthat are in the middle.\n  No. 1, you don't know or nobody in this body has been able to tell me \nhow many clinical trials are out there. People will scurry around \ntomorrow. But today, in asking how many of these clinical trials are \nout there, nobody in this body can tell me how much the average \nclinical trial is going to cost. Yet we want to make a commitment that \nwe will cover essentially all clinical trials in the United States of \nAmerica, however many there may be, however much they may cost, and the \nHMOs are going to pay for it, the bad HMOs. Again and again we have \nheard how bad those HMOs are, and therefore, they pay for it.\n  It doesn't work that way. What happens, whatever those costs are, \nwhich nobody can answer--nobody can answer--we will come to what the \nCBO says. The CBO can't give us an accurate answer. We give it maybe to \nthe HMO because rhetorically we can sock it to them. What is the HMO \ngoing to do? Just raise your premiums, employer-sponsored premiums.\n  One hundred seventy million people are getting health insurance \nthrough these insurance plans, and what we are saying in this bill is \nthat if you are going to be in the insurance business, there is a \nFederal law that we are going to pass where all trials, in essence, all \ntrials--we don't know how many or how much they are going to cost--are \ngoing to be paid for. Health insurance premiums go up, and what happens \nto the working poor who are barely scraping by, again, to pay their \nhealth insurance? Everybody, employer after employer, employee after \nemployee, comes in and says: We can barely make these insurance \npremiums, whether it is $200 a month or $300 a month or, for a family, \n$4 to $5,000 a year, or $6,000 a year. We just simply can't tolerate \nincreased costs. We are going to drop that insurance.\n  I say that because the cost issue was brought up on the floor earlier \ntonight, the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords approach versus the Kennedy-McCain-\nEdwards approach. There is a difference in cost and that difference in \ncost is about 60 percent. What is defined in my bill--I will talk a \nlittle bit about that--is about 60 percent, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, of what is in their bill. I didn't believe \nit when I saw it because I know nobody can answer this question, how \nmany trials there are today, because there is no database of all these \ntrials. You certainly can't figure out the cost.\n  So through conversations, talking to people who participate with the \nCongressional Budget Office, basically saying, how do you come up with \nthese numbers, the answer that was received again reinforces the fact \nthat we don't really know what the costs are. We do know that the cost \nunder the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords is only 60 percent of the cost \nestimated using the same sort of guesses as the Kennedy bill.\n  Knowing what I know, having participated in clinical trials from \nartificial hearts--personally, I put the artificial hearts in; I have \ngotten the consent; they are in clinical trials approved by our \nGovernment--to immunosuppressive agents or drugs that I have given to \npatients to keep them alive in clinical trials, gotten the consent to \ndo that. I can tell you we don't know what the costs are. Therefore, \nyes, maybe 60 percent on paper, that is what you hear about. In truth, \nwe don't know.\n\n  We don't know. As we look ahead, not knowing by definition, we are \ngoing to basically say those costs are going to be paid for by people \nthrough their insurance policies. When you get an insurance policy, you \nexpect that insurance policy in part to be for your benefit, and that \nis why I think having access to clinical trials is important because \nclinical trials can be very beneficial to patients. I mentioned the \nadverse effects, but clinical trials can be very beneficial to \nindividual patients. For that patient who gets that artificial heart, \nit becomes very beneficial.\n  I mentioned the bill that passed on the floor of the Senate. Let me \nnote very quickly, because I just talked about the cost of the two \nbills, what is the difference between the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill \nand the Kennedy-McCain-Edwards bill. The Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill, \npart of the Bipartisan Patient Bill of Rights Act, S. 889, is not the \nbill on the floor right now. I wish it was on the floor, but it is not \nright now. It applies to all private plans and insurance issuers \noffering coverage in the group and individual markets. So it applies to \npeople broadly. It expands coverage not to just where we were last \nyear. We have expanded coverage not to just cancer, but it is expanded \nto all diseases. You don't limit it to one disease group.\n  I do that because I think that it is important to reach out and give \nmore equal access to people who have kidney disease or heart disease or \nlung disease or emphysema or neurological disease or some type of \nmental illness. You need to have access broadly.\n  We expand it to clinical trials and we include the clinical trials of \nthe National Institutes of Health, the veterans hospitals I work in, \nand we include the Department of Defense. I will talk a little bit more \nabout others. It is true that we stopped short in our bill of including \nthe FDA. (Although, as I will mention later, previous versions of the \nKennedy bill did not include the FDA.) I will mention a little bit \nabout\n\n[[Page S6591]]\n\nwhy we stopped short of including the FDA, but it is because nobody can \ntell me how many FDA trials there are. FDA looks at the devices, the \nartificial hearts, the valves, the lasers, the expensive technology. \nThat is the device part of it, of the Food and Drug Administration, the \ndevice part of what the FDA examines. Therefore, we cover all of the \nothers, but we do stop short of the FDA. The cost difference between \nthe clinical trials provisions of the Kennedy bill and our bill is \nprincipally just that.\n  Several Members on the other side commented on the fact that in our \nbill we have what is called a negotiated rulemaking process in order to \ndetermine what routine costs are. The other side said: We don't need \nthat. We can just take what Medicare has looked at. Medicare, about a \nyear ago, September--I have to go back and look--did come out with \nguidelines for Medicare for coverage of seniors and for individuals \nwith disabilities, did come out with guidelines and coverage. But in \nreading through that, it doesn't answer to my satisfaction what a \nroutine patient cost truly is.\n  Thus, I think that, since we don't really know and the implications \nare so huge, since people all across the country are going to be paying \nfor this new benefit, that we ought to bring the very smartest people \naround the table. We ought to propose rules based on the discussion of \npeople who are in clinical trials. We ought to get input from other \npeople around the country. All that is part of the negotiated \nrulemaking process that I think is the best way to define routine \nmedical cost.\n  If we are going to say: HMOs, indirectly all the beneficiaries, all \nthe patients out there, all the 170 million people who are getting care \nfrom their insurance company, are going to be paying for it, we need to \nbe able to look them in the eye and say, this is how we define routine \ncost. We have studied it and talked through it. We have applied it not \njust to seniors. We have applied it not just to the Medicare \npopulation, but we have designed a definition that applies to all \nAmericans--to  children, to babies, to adolescents, to adults. That is \nthe negotiated rulemaking process. Earlier, the comment was made that \nit would take 6 years to do that. That is just not true. In fact, in \nthe amendment that passed on the floor last year we set time guidelines \nin there and we said January 10, 2001, was when it was supposed to \nconvene and a final report was going to be issued 6 months later on \nJune 30, 2001. That just shows it can be done in 6 months--to do it \nright and responsibly and define what routine medical costs are.\n\n  Since you are making people pay for it, that makes sense to me. It \ncomes back to the idea of having balance in this bill.\n  I don't think you are going to hear people on our side of the aisle \nor Senator Breaux or Senator Jeffords promise everything to everybody \nbecause it has a cost. It has to cost. We talk about the field of \nliability, why don't you have unlimited lawsuits running through the \nsystem, and allow lawsuits to go to court early on because the court \nsystem is good. The answer is, do you want balance? Yes, you want to be \nable to go to courts, but not first. You want to exhaust internal and \nexternal appeals and have an independent physician make the decision \nbefore you go to court.\n  Why? Because you want to protect the patient, but you don't want to \nsubject the system to the incentives that are going to drive health \ncare costs sky high, make premiums go through the roof, skyrocket, with \nno limit. By definition, liability has no limit to it whatsoever, and \nthe working poor are the first to be punished.\n  So that is our bill, the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill. It basically \ncovers all clinical trials. We go through the list and stop short of \nthe FDA trials. The McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill on the floor has all \nprivate sector plans offering coverage in the individual markets--\nsounds pretty familiar, sounds the same--to provide coverage for \nroutine patient costs associated with all clinical trials. They do NIH, \nwe do NIH--National Institutes of Health--about $20 billion a year. It \nis a tremendous national resource. About 70 percent of that money, so \npeople will understand, is not spent out here in Washington. About 70 \npercent of the grants go to universities and academic health centers \nall across America, and capture again the creativity and the sharp \nminds of academics, clinicians, doctors and nurses.\n  They include Department of Defense clinical trials. Frist-Breaux-\nJeffords includes all the clinical trials for the Department of \nDefense. The Veterans' Administration--I mentioned that one of the \nprivileges I had as a practicing physician was every week I would be \nable to operate on and take care of and treat our veterans. Actually, \neven during my residency and chief residency, every week after I \nfinished my training, cardiothoracic training, every week I had the \nopportunity of spending a day taking care of veterans and administering \ncare to them and participating in the great research programs in \nthoracic surgery that is made possible through this body's investment \nin our veterans affairs.\n  They include clinical trials through the VA. Frist-Breaux-Jeffords \nincludes all clinical trials through the Veterans Affairs. The \ndifference is between FDA, and I will come back to that. The definition \nof routine costs that they use is the routine cost definition developed \nby the Clinton administration for cancer clinical trials. If there is \none thing --the reason I am taking time to do this is because it sounds \nso simple--cancer clinical trials. I have gone through this process, \nthat cancer clinical trials are very different than clinical trials for \nhypertension or high blood pressure or for ischemic cardiomyopathy or \nlaser therapy or removing obstruction from the windpipe itself. These \nclinical trials are different. Therefore, I am a little uncomfortable \ntaking a definition that was worked out for a certain segment of the \npopulation--that is, our seniors--that started and was based on one \ndisease entity--cancer--and applying that broadly to all clinical \ntrials. Why? Because we have to achieve balance and do what is \nresponsible if we are going to make 170 million Americans--and we are \nby definition--pay more once we pass a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n\n  The 170 million people are going to pay more whether it is our bill \nor their bill. They are going to pay a whole lot more under the Kennedy \nbill than under the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill.\n  The fourth point I want to make is, who is paying? I implied it a few \nminutes ago when I said it is easy to say these bad HMOs out there are \ngoing to be paying for these costs. Each of the patient protections we \ngo through--we are starting with clinical trials, and I am glad because \nboth sides feel very positively and the amendment by the Senator from \nArizona is, I believe, very positive because it speaks to the positive \naspect of these clinical trials. But it allows me to show how complex \neach one of these patient protections is and the potential, even though \nCBO gives us a figure there, for that being blown out of the water as \nwe go next year, or 2 years later, or 3 years later.\n  Much of what we have tried to do--Senators Breaux, Jeffords and \nmyself--in crafting our bill is to give patient protection, give the \naccess to clinical trials, but do it in a way that is responsible--\nresponsible to the 170 million people who are going to be paying the \nbill, responsible so that we don't have a million people--which is what \nwill happen under the Kennedy bill--a million people are going to lose \ntheir health insurance or would lose it if that bill were to pass as \nwritten. Thankfully, the President made it very clear today that he, as \nthe leader of the free world, the leader of this country, is not going \nto allow the Kennedy bill to pass. He is not going to allow 1.2 million \npeople to go to the ranks of the uninsured when you can pass an \nalternative bill that gives patient protections that will not drive 1.2 \nmillion people to the ranks of the uninsured and will not involve \nfrivolous lawsuits. This says, yes, it makes sense to go through an \nappeals process and have an external review, an independent physician \nmaking a decision before going over to the trial lawyer.\n  The trial lawyers have an incentive. You know, we keep coming back to \nthe trial lawyers, in part, because it kind of blows away the potential \nfor these runaway lawsuits, and the potential is in their bill, and it \nis a little in ours, but not so much because we tried to restrain it \nand give it balance, recognizing that we have to have balance as we go \nforward.\n\n[[Page S6592]]\n\n  If we are going to ask 170 million people to pay more under passage \nof a Patients' Bill of Rights, we need to be able to tell them why they \nare paying more. I think the argument for clinical trials is so \npositive, they will understand that there is some downside. Some people \ndie because of clinical trials, and there are adverse effects; but the \noverwhelming benefit for clinical trials means we need to make them \nmore available to people, and that is why in the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords \nbill, clinical trials are one of the 12 main basic patient protections \nwe want out there in our bill of rights.\n  The 170 million people are going to be paying for this added benefit, \nso we want to make sure it is good and the human protection is there, \nand that safety is put first and foremost. We are failing in that \ncategory, as I have said--not miserably, but we are failing. I will \ndemonstrate how I can say that with such assurance. In addition, \ntaxpayers, for much of this research, clinical research, are already \npaying. I say that because with the $20 billion that the National \nInstitutes of Health is getting, the NIH will turn around and subsidize \nmany of these clinical trials, in terms of the clinical trials \nthemselves as we go forward. So the 170 million people out there \nworking, who are working with insurance that we want to keep--make sure \nthey keep their insurance--are already investing in these clinical \ntrials by supporting Department of Defense with their taxpayer \ndollars, by supporting the Veterans Affairs with their taxpayers' \ndollars, and by supporting the National Institutes of Health with their \ntaxpayers' dollars.\n\n  Clinical trials are vital, critical, and make all the innovation and \nclinical applications a reality when they start with basic science.\n  Do all the clinical trials work? Some do. I do not know if I can say \nmost do. In other words, are there positive results from clinical \ntrials?\n  The assumption is clinical trials always have a breakthrough drug. \nAgain, what my colleagues do not understand--and I want to state it \nmore publicly instead of sitting in the Cloakroom explaining it--is \nthat a high percentage of clinical trials do not work. That is good \nbecause they have to figure out whether or not the breakthrough drug \nworks. It may have worked in a mouse, and it may have worked in an \nanimal model, or it may have worked in a test tube, but they have to \nsee whether it works in a human being.\n  That is what a clinical trial is: an experiment with a human being. \nNot all of them work after it worked in a test tube or a mouse.\n  It is important that my colleagues understand that. Clinical trials \nare necessary. There is a reason for them: to figure out what does and \ndoes not work. What does not work can be harmful, and it comes back to \nthe fact they have to have adequate consent, what is called informed \nconsent, for those participants who come into clinical trials to make \nsure they understand that in every one of these clinical trials there \nis a risk of harm and there is a potential for gain.\n  Yes, in our bill, and I believe in their bill and in this amendment, \nthere is this concept of talking about clinical trials where there is \npotential for gain. That is a little hard to define. We all write it \ninto the bill, and, obviously, we would not do a clinical trial if we \ndid not think there was some potential for gain, but, again, there is \nsome risk or they would not be doing a clinical trial.\n  A clinical trial is an investigation. A clinical trial is human \nexperimentation. It is all the same. ``Clinical trial'' sounds very \npositive. ``Investigation'' sounds--well, I am not quite sure. ``You \nmean experimenting in humans?'' That is what it is. It just depends on \nwhich words one uses.\n  I want to move to one other point which many of my colleagues, in \ntalking with them, had not thought about. I am thinking about it \nbecause we have a bill with patient protections. In the underlying \nKennedy bill, there are 18 or so patient protections. There are a few \nless in my bill. Prompt payment is in the Kennedy bill as a patient \nprotection. Prompt payment is good for the doctor, for a doctor's bill \nof rights; you have to pay a doctor--I have forgotten; I need to go \nback and look--in x number of days, and that is a patient protection, I \nguess. It is not clear to me.\n  I understand why many of the doctors like their bill because they \nhave prompt payment as a patient protection, which means you should pay \nyour doctor on time. You should pay your doctor on time. I am not sure \nyou need a Federal law passed in what is billed as a Patients' Bill of \nRights. That is in the Kennedy bill as one of the patient protections.\n  This patient protection on clinical trials is one in which I believe \nstrongly. We have given a price to it which is significantly higher in \ntheir bill than my bill, and I have already argued that price to me is \ninaccurate. I will not really know how true that is until 5 years from \nnow, but I do not want to be sitting at my desk 5 years from now \nlooking back to today and saying: You mean to tell me we bought into \nthis fact that we could cover clinical trials when we did not know how \nmany there are and we did not know how much they cost? We made 170 \nmillion taxpayers pay for it, and some of them lost their insurance? \nWhy weren't we smarter than that?\n\n  I want it to be a part of the Record as we walk through the \ncomplexity of what clinical trials are all about. We can make promises, \nand the promises sound good, but is it truly responsible to make these \nhuge promises at huge costs when there is a very real potential that we \nare hurting, not thousands, but millions of people? The answer to me is \nno. I do not want that to happen.\n  My colleagues are going to hear me say again and again this is where \nwe were last year and this is where Senator Kennedy's bill is, and I \nthink we can be in a more balanced position by being in the middle \nrather than either extreme. That is what we tried to achieve, and \nclinical trials are a good example.\n  Why am I so convinced that the underestimate in their bill is real \nand not so much in our bill? It is because we have patient protections. \nWe have internal appeals and external appeals if there is some sort of \ndisagreement on what the HMO or insurance company has decided. In their \nbill, one can opt out; they do not have to go through internal and \nexternal appeals. One can go to the courtroom before exhausting the \nappeals process. Hopefully, we can debate that tomorrow or next week.\n  One can go to the court system, Federal court, State court, or shop \nfrom one State court to another State court. One can pick a State. If \nthe insurance company covers Tennessee, Alabama, and Georgia, you can \ngo down to Alabama. I do not know what their caps are, but I hear about \nthese exorbitant lawsuits. The trial lawyer gets 30, 40 percent, \nwhatever it is. Whatever a patient settles for goes in the trial \nlawyer's pocket, not to the patient. If you settle for $2.5 million, $1 \nmillion goes to the trial lawyer and only $1.5 million goes to the \npatient. I do not understand that. I hope we will come back to that.\n  My point is, we have patient protections, and we cannot look at them \nin isolation from what happens with liability. I just built the case or \njust told my colleagues that not everything goes perfectly all the time \nwhen you have human experimentation, clinical trials, clinical \ninvestigations.\n  By definition not everything is going to work. There is going to be \ndamage. When they are studying Parkinson's disease, there is going to \nbe sometimes a worsening of the disease in the experiment. There \nsometimes is going to be death, not intended death, but in clinical \ntrials people are going to die. I just mentioned one patient, and there \nare hundreds of patients who die in clinical trials.\n  We have a trial lawyer out here, and because we passed this bill, we \ncannot separate what we are doing over here. What we are saying is: \nHMO, you are responsible for paying for these clinical trials now; you \nhave not in the past, and you have a lawyer out here with unlimited \nlawsuits; who are you going to go after? Who has the deepest pocket? Is \nit the doctor who maybe made a mistake, or is it the HMO, the big bad \nHMO that has assets of $\\1/2\\ billion or $400 million?\n  If you are the trial lawyer and you are going to walk away with 40 \npercent, 30 percent, 20 percent or 10 percent--10 percent of $1 billion \nis a lot. Who are you going to go after? Maybe the doctor, but you will \nbe able to go after the HMO.\n\n[[Page S6593]]\n\n  Adverse events, by definition, in clinical trials are going to occur. \nTrial lawyers are part of this overall system. There is no cap. They \nhave an incentive to sue. They are going to get the HMO because we are \nmaking the HMO pay for the trial.\n  Was that even part of the reasoning? Did CBO put all that together in \nterms of saying clinical trials are going to cost this much in their \nbill and in my bill this much?\n  I have talked with a lot of people involved in these estimates, and I \nhave talked with a lot of people in this body, and not one person had \nthought about that.\n  If there is an adverse reaction in a clinical trial, if a person \nparticipated, there is a risk of losing your arm or of dying. All the \nconsents say death, or any serious life-threatening condition. That is \nwhat the Kennedy bill used as their baseline for trials. Ninety-five \npercent say there is risk of death. A large majority say there is a \nrisk of death in the consent form you sign.\n  Is that protection in a court of law? There is no protection in a \ncourt of law. In the hearings Senator Kennedy and I have held on human \nsubjects, protections are inadequate today given the type of research \nwe are doing. They were OK 15 years ago. There are all sorts of \nreasons, including inadequacy of explanation of the clinical trial in \nconsent forms, or conflict of interest in certain cases. There is what \nis called the common rule that is supposed to apply to all Federally \nsponsored or regulated research, but that does not apply equally to \neverybody. These are all very specific issues and technical issues, but \nif we will force 170 million ratepayers to pay for all clinical trials, \nwe need to know the implications. We will probably never talk about it. \nThis is just one little item from the 179-page bill.\n  These estimates of how much clinical trials cost may be approximately \nright. I don't think they are. I know they were not calculated on a \npeer-reviewed study. Maybe a little bit on cancer, but it did not \ninclude the range of diseases that the FDA approves, or safety and \nefficacy regarding the devices out there, all the high technology out \nthere. That is different from Veterans Affairs or the Department of \nDefense, which is mainly breast cancer and breast disease. It is very \ndifferent from the National Institutes of Health.\n  When people say: Why not FDA? Was it arbitrary? No, it is because \nthat is the most balanced. You cover the clinical trials for all \ndiseases out there. Thousands of clinical trials are being covered. We \nwill stop short of FDA because we do not know what we are covering in \nterms of numbers or how much it costs for each trial.\n  It's interesting that the earlier versions of the Kennedy bill did \nnot cover the FDA. I am not sure why or why this was changed. It may be \nthat it makes us feel good to say we are covering everybody, in all \ntrials. It is irresponsible to say we will cover something that will \nincrease liability and that we will introduce the liability equation on \nHMOs as part of the bill without knowing the impact.\n  If there is one death and a trial lawyer goes to that person's \nfamily, or say they lost an arm with an injection of a medicine to \ntreat cancer and the veins shut down and they lost an arm, that is a \ntragedy. That trial was paid for by the big bad insurance company. The \ntrial lawyer says: Let's go after the doctor for malpractice; why not \ngo after the HMO? When you are a trial lawyer, it will be tempting on \ngo after the HMO.\n  Then we hear people say: How can you cap it? If you lose an arm, is \nthat worth $1 million? Is it worth $5 million? Is it worth $10 million? \nIs it worth $100 million? Is it worth $1 billion? There is no answer. \nIt is rhetorical. No amount of money can satisfy the loss of an arm.\n  If you allow that sort of lawsuit, $20 million or $30 million, but \nyou allow it and incentivize a lawyer to have it and you create adverse \nreactions, that is just one little clinical trial. What about the other \n1,000, 5,000, 10,000 clinical trials?\n  I don't want to drive that point home too much that I think we made. \nHowever, it is important for my colleagues to understand and at least \nto think about and recognize the complexity in the bill. We cannot rush \nthrough this bill. I am here and the Presiding Officer is kind enough \nto be here tonight. The majority leader said we will finish this bill \nin 6 or 7 days. This is probably 1 page out of 179 pages.\n\n  On clinical trials, taking the flip side, not covering all clinical \ntrials but stopping just short of covering all clinical trials, why are \nyou doing that? The answer is that clinical trials have such value to \nsociety that I believe we have an obligation to make the clinical \ntrials available, coupled with the obligation to make sure there are \nadequate human subject protections.\n  The GAO, at the request of Senator Jeffords, who is the cosponsor of \nthe Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill, conducted a review of patient access to \nclinical trials sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, for \nwhich I, obviously, have tremendous respect. Senator Jeffords asked the \nGAO the following questions.\n  No. 1, to examine how the health insurers' coverage policy and \npractices affect patient participation in clinical trials.\n  This is before we passed the bill.\n  No. 2, to examine researchers' experience in enrolling patients for \ntrials sponsored by the National Cancer Institute.\n  No. 3, whether NIH has evidence of recent difficulties in enrolling \npatients in clinical trials. Determine if there are enough patients. We \nhave a huge amount of basic science information and, if you cannot get \npatients into the trials, you are not going to be able to have a \nclinical application, you will not get to a practical application. You \nneed sufficient patients in the clinical trials.\n  The GAO report found, even though many policies exclude coverage for \nclinical trials, nearly all insurers interviewed allow for exceptions, \nfollowing case-by-case reviews by the insurer's medical personnel. For \napproved coverage, insurers generally agree to pay the standard \nnonexperimental cost associated with the trial. However, since there is \nlittle agreement on what constitutes ``standard care,'' payments vary \nfrom insurer to insurer.\n  That, says the GAO, agrees with the idea of what is standard care. \nThere is a lot of disagreement. I argue that is why we go to a standard \nrulemaking process.\n  The same report--and that is why I believe clinical trials should be \npart of the Patient's Bill of Rights--concluded that generally health \ninsurance policies exclude coverage of clinical trials, but most do \nallow exceptions to be made after a case-by-case review. Denials \ngenerally are based on the grounds that health insurers consider \nclinical trials to be investigational and experimental care, and, as \nsuch, are excluded from coverage. Again, that is why we need to include \nclinical trials in our Patient's Bill of Rights.\n  Typically, insurers prefer to review requests for clinical trial \ncoverage individually because of the perception that trial costs and \nquality vary greatly. The most common consideration during case-by-case \nreviews was the scientific merit of the trial and the anticipated cost, \nalthough none of the insurers had data on the cost of covering clinical \ntrials--again, it just shows we do not have the data, even insurance \ncompanies that have been putting money into the clinical trials.\n  I will go back.\n  These perceived trials could be somewhat more costly than standard \ntreatment. The GAO report continues.\n\n       There is little agreement on the definition of standard \n     care which causes payment for service to vary widely. \n     Insurers stated that it is often difficult to distinguish \n     expenses that constitute standard care from strictly research \n     related services.\n\n  Again, that is a good reason to have negotiated rulemaking--to \ndetermine what routine care or standard care is.\n  This is from the GAO report.\n\n       The GAO did not find evidence of widespread limitations on \n     patient access to clinical trials. Most health insurers said \n     they allow for coverage of trials in some circumstances. Most \n     cancer centers reported no shortage of payments for trials \n     and the NIH did not document significant trial enrollment \n     problems. Information on the extent to which insurers cover \n     clinical trials is not clear-cut.\n\n  To me, looking at that report--again, Senator Jeffords was chairman \nof the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee--it basically \ncomes to the conclusion that there is not a shortage of patients for \nclinical trials\n\n[[Page S6594]]\n\nnow but that we don't have data as to the costs or participation. The \ninsurance companies don't have it. We don't have a good or adequate \ndefinition of standard or routine care. All that means is that we need \nto know more before promising everything to everybody.\n  Since we don't have the answers, why don't we address the issue in a \nbalanced way and in a step-wise way? Why? Because unknowns could expose \nus to exploding costs of premiums, which would drive people to the \nranks of the uninsured. What I would like to do is go in a deliberate, \nthoughtful, and balanced way.\n  I mentioned earlier the numbers of clinical trials. We don't know how \nmany trials there are.\n  Let me quote Susan Okie who was actually a classmate of mine in \nmedical school and who writes for the Washington Post. On May 16, 2001, \nshe wrote an article for the Post entitled ``U.S. Oversight Urged for \nHuman Research''. It says:\n\n       No figures are available on how many studies on humans are \n     conducted annually in this country.\n\n  Again, I just want to make the point that nobody knows how many \nstudies there are.\n  She continues:\n\n       However, data on biomedical research show explosive growth \n     in the last two decades. Federal spending for health research \n     increased from $6.9 billion to $13.4 billion between 1986 and \n     1995, and industry spending tripled from $6.2 billion to \n     $18.6 billion during the same period. Between 40,000 and \n     50,000 U.S. researchers are thought to participate in \n     conducting clinical studies in humans.\n\n  I went to the FDA. Since the Congressional Budget Office does not \nknow, since none of my colleagues knows, since in the hearings people \ndid not know, I asked, What about the FDA? The FDA does not track the \nnumber of clinical trials being conducted as a part of their protocol. \nYet the extension of the Kennedy bill is going to cover these trials. \nThe FDA doesn't even track the number of clinical trials. They do track \nthe number of investigational new drugs and investigational device \nexemptions.\n  There are roughly 11,800 trials by the Center for Drug Evaluation. \nThere are about 2,800 trials by the Center for Biologic Evaluation and \nResearch. And there are about 1,000 trials by the Center for Devices \nand Radiological Health. That is the FDA.\n  The Kennedy-McCain-Edwards bill says they will pay for the increment \nin the number of trials, but they do not know how much those trials are \ngoing to cost. At least that data has not been present, and it has not \nbeen presented in the hearings. When I have looked for it, I have not \nbeen able to find the incremental cost.\n  If you go back to the Congressional Budget Office, it says that is \nthe difference between the CBO estimate and yours. That is working \nbackwards, because the Congressional Budget Office does not know.\n  In the NIH, for the record, in terms of clinical trials, there are \nabout 4,200 clinical trials, what are called extramural and \nintramural--outside of the institution and inside of the institution.\n  The Department of Defense: I have not been able to determine how many \nclinical trials we are going to cover.\n  The Veterans' Administration: About 162 clinical trials and 729 \nextramural VA-funded clinical trials.\n  The FDA was supposed to create a database of clinical trials last \nyear. It is up and running, but it is not complete, to the best of my \nknowledge. I will try to look into that to see if we can find out how \nmany they have on that particular database.\n  Let me close with one last point that I implied earlier and talked \nabout a little bit earlier. It has to do with protection of human \nsubjects.\n  Our goal should be to protect individuals who voluntarily participate \nin research and clinical trials. This is very important for my \ncolleagues to understand. Right now, there are inadequate safety \nprotections, if we look in the global sense at these thousands of \nclinical trials.\n  I mentioned the death of Jesse Gelsinger in gene therapy in a \nclinical trial in 1999. Following that, the Subcommittee on Public \nHealth held two hearings. We found a systemic breakdown of oversight, \nranging from investigators to institutional review boards in the \nFederal agencies specifically responsible for ensuring the safety of \npatients.\n  Since we came to this conclusion that we are inadequately protecting \nhuman subjects, we must act. As we go into this field of further \nsubsidizing clinical trials, I am very hopeful that on both sides of \nthe aisle we can work together and put forth the appropriate \nprotections.\n  The underlying amendment put forth by Senator McCain is a sense of \nthe Senate that we will be voting on tomorrow morning. From my reading \nof it, it appears to be a very positive amendment that endorses the \nimportance of clinical trials. On the last page it says: A health \nmaintenance organization's decision that an in-network physician \nwithout the necessary expertise can provide care for a seriously ill \npatient, including someone battling cancer, should be appealable to an \nindependent, impartial body, and the right should be available to all \nAmericans in need of access to high-quality specialty care.\n  Again, it goes to the internal and external appeals. That is \nsomething that would be taken care of in the underlying bill--both the \nFrist-Breaux-Jeffords bill as well as the Kennedy-McCain-Edwards bill.\n  As I understand, it, the debate will continue tomorrow morning. I \nbelieve there are 30 minutes for each side, and then we will vote at \nthat point in time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I appreciate your patience and the \npatience of my colleagues for allowing me to address this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/21/senate-section/article/S6594-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6594-S6595]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE NEXT ROUND OF NATO ENLARGEMENT\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate President Bush \nfor his unequivocal support for the next round of enlargement of the \nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization, which he voiced during his recent \ntrip to Europe.\n  Several months ago I made clear my opposition to a so-called ``zero \noption'' of not admitting any new country to membership at next year's \nNATO Summit in Prague. Largely at the administration's urging, the \nalliance last week formally laid the ``zero option'' to rest. At least \none country will be invited to membership in Prague.\n  In addition, in several venues I have declared that no country \noutside of NATO has any veto right over which country or countries the \nalliance will invite to membership.\n  Most particularly this statement applies to the three Baltic states--\nLithuania, Latvia, and Estonia--and Russia's evident opposition to \ntheir joining NATO.\n  It would be totally unacceptable to grant Russia any such veto. Let \nus not forget the history of the last 61 years.\n  In 1940, Moscow rigged bogus ``invitations'' from the three \nindependent Baltic states to be incorporated by the Soviet Union. I am \nproud as an American that this country for more than 50 years never \nrecognized this illegal annexation.\n  Following annexation, and during the ensuing 5 years, the Soviets \nmurdered thousands of Baltic citizens and deported thousands more to \ndeepest Siberia. Guerilla warfare against the occupiers erupted in the \nforests of all three countries, with the last anti-Soviet partisan in \nLithuania not surrendering until the 1960s.\n  Despite their heroic struggle, the Baltic peoples had to endure the \niron repression of Soviet communism for half a century. Now, in the \nwake of the collapse of the Soviet Union, all three Baltic countries \nare full-fledged democracies that are developing their civil societies \nand free-market economies.\n  After Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia suffered the 51 years of Soviet-\ninflicted brutalities, it would be morally grotesque to deny them the \nfundamental right to choose their own system of security that is \naccorded to every other European country. This would be the ultimate \n``double whammy,'' in essence saying, ``since you suffered so much, you \nmay not ensure your safety in the future!''\n  No, Mr. President, we must never repeat, even by inference, the \ninfamous Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939, which carved up northeastern \nEurope between Stalin and Hitler: There must be no more ``red lines'' \nin Europe.\n  Russia, with which I sincerely hope we can develop a harmonious and \nproductive relationship, must understand\n\n[[Page S6595]]\n\nthat NATO enlargement in general, and a Baltic dimension to enlargement \nin particular, pose absolutely no threat whatsoever to Russia. With \nseveral of its high-ranking military officers permanently attached to \nNATO and SHAPE, Russia must know that the old Soviet propaganda was a \ndeliberate lie. NATO is, and always was, a purely defensive alliance.\n  I believe that President Bush and Secretary of State Powell are \ncorrect in saying that it is premature at this time to ``name names'' \nof countries to be invited to NATO membership at the Prague Summit. The \nAlliance has laid out a detailed procedure for qualifying for \nmembership. Most importantly, in the spring of 2002 NATO must make a \nthird evaluation of each country's membership action plan or ``MAP.''\n  But it is no secret that some countries are making significant \nprogress militarily, politically, economically, and socially. Slovenia, \nI believe, is already eminently qualified for NATO membership. Unless \nit lapses into over-confidence during the next year, it should be a \nshoo-in in Prague.\n  Lithuania has apparently done remarkably well in fulfilling its MAP, \nand its neighbors, Latvia and Estonia, are also coming on strong. The \nlegal status and treatment of the Russian minority in all three \ncountries now is in full compliance with international standards. As \nlong as lingering remnants of bigotry in the Baltic states continue to \nbe erased by democratic education and practice, the political \nrequirements for NATO membership should be met.\n  Slovakia, after having lost precious time under the populist \nadministration of Vladimir Meciar, now has a democratic government that \nis also making giant strides toward membership. Its national elections \nin the fall of 2002 will be decisive in proving to NATO that this \nprogress is permanent.\n  The southern Balkans, of course, are strategically the most important \narea for NATO enlargement. Romania and Bulgaria are potentially vital \nmembers for the Alliance. Both countries have overcome various kinds of \nmisrule and are also making progress. Other aspirant countries in the \nsouthern Balkans are more long-term candidates.\n  In 1998, I had the privilege of being floor manager for the \nsuccessful Senate ratification of the legislation admitting Poland, \nHungary, and the Czech Republic to NATO. I look forward to playing the \nsame role in 2003 for the admission of one or more of the current \ncandidate countries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/21/senate-section/article/S6595-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6595-S6597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE GROWING WEB OF SUSPICION OF ASIAN AMERICANS\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity \nto indicate my deep concern about what I perceive to be increasing bias \nin the United States toward Asian Americans and Chinese Americans in \nparticular.\n  In recent years, we have seen those on the far right and the far left \nof the political spectrum raise allegations without proof, distort \nfacts, and make it impossible to refute insinuations. Thus, a web of \nsuspicion is woven about the loyalties of Asian Americans to the United \nStates.\n  This has created an atmosphere of anti-Asian American and anti-\nChinese American sentiment: a House Select Committee report on National \nSecurity (although widely debunked as without foundation); the botched \nWen Ho Lee investigation; the recent incident with Representative David \nWu; the attacks against U.S. Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao; hate \ncrimes against Asian Americans; and the attacks against former \nCalifornia State Treasurer Matt Fong.\n  These examples--and others--have contributed to a troubling and \nnegative stereotyping of Asian-Americans.\n  Evidence of this comes from a recent Yankelovich survey which \nasserts: 68 percent of Americans now have a somewhat negative or very \nnegative attitude toward Chinese Americans; one in three now believe \nthat Chinese Americans are more loyal to China than to the United \nStates; nearly half of all Americans--or 46 percent--now believe that \nChinese-Americans passing secrets to China is a problem; and 34 percent \nbelieve that Chinese Americans now ``have too much influence'' in the \nU.S. high technology sector.\n  Tragically, the unfounded suspicions about the loyalties of Asian \nAmericans has itself created a sense of unease among the Asian American \ncommunity.\n  According to Asian American focus groups conducted for the Committee \nof 100 during January 2001, Asian Americans believe that too many \nAmericans see them as foreigners or as ``permanent aliens.''\n  Increasingly, Chinese-Americans with contacts, family, friendships or \nbusiness connections in China are labeled disloyal to the United States \nsimply because of their ethnic background and heritage.\n  The sentiment seems to be that you can't be both Chinese-American and \na loyal American as well.\n  Now that is not what America is all about.\n  Sadly, our Nation has a long history of discrimination against \nAmericans of Asian and Pacific Island ancestry. Without a doubt, Asian \nAmericans have suffered from unfounded and demagogic accusations of \ndisloyalty.\n  Americans of Asian and Pacific Island descent have been subjected to \ndiscriminatory laws that have prevented their right to become, and be \nseen as, Americans:\n  The Chinese Exclusionary Act of 1882 barred the immigration of \nChinese laborers.\n  In 1907, the ``Gentleman's Agreement'' between the United States and \nJapan limited Japanese immigration to the United States.\n  A 1913 California law erected barriers to prevent Asian Americans \nfrom becoming land-owners.\n  The Immigration Act of 1917 prohibited immigration from nearly the \nentire Asia-Pacific region.\n  The National Origins Act of 1924 banned immigration of persons \nineligible for citizenship.\n  Asian Americans were not able to become citizens of the United States \nfor over 160 years and the Supreme Court consistently upheld laws \nprohibiting citizenship for Asians and Pacific Islanders with the last \nof these laws not repealed until 1952.\n  The Tydings-McDuffie Act of 1934 limited the number of Filipino \nimmigrants to 50 per year.\n  During World War II, we witnessed one the worst acts of \ndiscrimination against any group of Americans, the internment of \n120,000 patriotic and loyal Americans of Japanese ancestry.\n  Despite the fact that their family members were being denied their \nbasic rights as Americans, many young Japanese Americans volunteered to \nfight for their country and they did so with bravery, honor, and valor.\n  The record of the U.S. Army's 100th Battalion and 442nd Infantry \nCombat Group speaks for itself and is without equal: 18,000 individual \ndecorations awarded including 52 Distinguished Service Crosses, 560 \nSilver Stars, and 9,480 Purple Hearts.\n  The record of the 442nd Combat Group made up of Japanese American \nsoldiers, including our esteemed colleague Senator Daniel Inouye is \nunusual: They were the most decorated unit of its size in the Army \nduring World War II, yet only one member until last year received the \nMedal of Honor when Senator Inouye finally received his long overdue \nrecognition.\n  Throughout U.S. history Asian Americans have been subjected to \ndiscriminatory actions, including the prohibition of individuals from \nowning property, voting, testifying in court or attending school with \nother people in the United States.\n  It is long past time to turn the page on this chapter of our Nation's \nhistory.\n  And I am appalled that in recent years some have resorted to negative \nstereotypes to question the integrity of an entire community.\n  Tragically, this rising tide in discrimination has contributed to a \ngrowing number of crimes hate crimes against Asian Americans.\n  According to the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium, \nthere were 486 reported incidents of violence against Asian Americans \nin the latest figures available for 1999, an increase from the 429 \nincidents in 1998.\n  This upward trend is even more troubling because it is contrary to \nthe finding reported by the Department of Justice's 1999 crime \nvictimization report that violent crime rates had fallen by 10 percent \nduring this same period.\n  Who can forget the harrowing photos in August of 1999 of pre-school \nchildren holding hands while fleeing the North Valley Jewish Community \ncenter when a white supremacist walked into their school and opened \nfire?\n\n[[Page S6596]]\n\n  Later that day, the perpetrator shot and killed Joseph Ileto, a \nFilipino-American postal worker. Ileto was a kind hearted and unselfish \nman who was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time and slain \nbecause of his skin color.\n  In May 1999, a Japanese American store owner was shot in Chicago, \nIllinois by a gunmen seeking out ethnic targets.\n  In July 1999, Benjamin Smith, a 21-year-old college student, went on \na three day shooting rampage in Illinois and Indiana, killing one \nKorean American, one African American, and injuring nine others--Jews, \nAsian Americans, and African Americans.\n  These examples are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to hate \ncrimes against Asian Americans.\n  And make no mistake about it, these attacks are in part fueled by the \nanti-Asian sentiment that lingers in our society today.\n  Even with the strides we have made in combating hate crimes thus far, \nAsian American groups report that these crimes are still frequently \nunder-reported and therefore the ``real'' numbers of these incidents is \nunclear.\n  According to the Asian Law Caucus's Interim Executive Director Frank \nTse:\n\n       The invisibility of Asian Pacific Americans has real \n     detrimental effects. If law enforcement does not perceive \n     that we are susceptible to hate crimes, then they are more \n     likely to overlook the red flags at a crime scene. We have \n     seen this firsthand. The result is that perpetrators are not \n     prosecuted, victims do not receive appropriate assistance and \n     the under reporting continues.\n\n  The rising tide of anti-Asian American attitudes that can lead to \nthese sorts of tragic incidents are all too often aided and abetted by \nthose in government and the media who ought to know and act better.\n  Many Chinese-Americans, for example, feel that the Report of the \nHouse Select Committee on U.S. National Security and Military/\nCommercial Concerns with the People's Republic of China promoted an \natmosphere of suspicion about the loyalty of Chinese Americans to their \ncountry.\n  The House Committee report asserted that:\n\n       Threats to national security can come from PRC scientists, \n     students, business people, or bureaucrats, in addition to \n     professional civilian and military intelligence operations.\n       The PRC also tries to identify ethnic Chinese in the United \n     States who have access to sensitive information, and \n     sometimes is able to enlist their cooperation in illegal \n     technology or information transfers.\n       It is estimated that at any given time there are over \n     100,000 PRC nationals who are either attending U.S. \n     universities or have remained in the United States after \n     graduating from a U.S. university. These PRC nationals \n     provide a ready target for PRC intelligence officers and \n     PRC Government controlled organizations, both while they \n     are in the United States and when they return to the PRC.\n       In light of the number of interactions taking place between \n     PRC and U.S. citizens and organizations over the last decade \n     as trade and other forms of cooperation have bloomed, the \n     opportunities for the PRC to attempt to acquire information \n     and technology, including sensitive national security \n     secrets, are immense.\n\n  Although it is true that the Chinese Intelligence sources utilize \nthese techniques, many Chinese-Americans feel that these sorts of \nbroad-brush allegations create an atmosphere where all Asian Americans \nfall under a cloud of suspicion.\n  The report seems to suggest, for example, that because the PRC may \ntry to recruit some ethnically Chinese scientists in the U.S., all \nethnic Chinese are under suspicion.\n  A review of the Report by Stanford University's Center for \nInternational Security and Cooperation concluded that the Report was \ninflammatory, inaccurate, and damaging to U.S.-China Relations.\n  Its principal editor, Dr. Michael May, argued that the Report alleged \nthat ``essentially all Chinese visitors to the United States are \npotential spies. This has cast a cloud of suspicion over both foreign \nand Asian-born U.S. staff members of U.S. companies.''\n  Many Chinese and Asian American groups have written to me to express \ntheir concerns about the impact the insinuations and unfounded \nallegations of the Report have had on Chinese and Asian Americans. In a \nMay 21st letter to the Editor and Chief of the Los Angeles Times, John \nFugh, a retired Chinese-American Major General with 33 years of service \nin the U.S. Army and its former Judge Advocate General, wrote:\n\n       The impact of this inflammatory report has created an \n     environment in which many Chinese and Asian Americans have \n     had their loyalty questioned based on their ethnicity, \n     especially in the defense sector.\n\n  The Asian Law Alliance of San Jose noted that the allegations of the \nReport ``led to a broad-based hysteria that detrimentally impacted \nAsian American scientists working to support U.S. research and \ndevelopment.''\n  The Organization of Chinese Americans argued that the ``report and \nthe false impression it gave the American public had serious \nrepercussions on the careers of Chinese Americans at some government \nagencies and in some instances, private industry.''\n  Now I would like to speak about some people who may well have been \ntargeted because they are Asian Americans.\n  Dr. Wen Ho Lee, an American citizen and nuclear scientist, formerly \nemployed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, was arrested in 1999 on \n59 charges ranging from violating the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to \nmishandling classified data and held in solitary confinement for nine \nmonths before all charges were dropped except for one--downloading \nclassified data onto his personal computer. I have been told that \nothers at the lab also downloaded information but were not charged.\n  Media reports and government information portrayed him as a Chinese \nspy.\n  After reviewing the facts of the case, I am convinced that whatever \nelse may have been involved the case also had serious undertones of \nracial stereotyping that need to be examined closely.\n  This is a man who had been held under the most extraordinary security \nconditions. Dr. Lee, a sixty-year old scientist at the time, was \nprohibited from outside contact, except for his immediate family, and \nshackled at the wrists, waist and ankles on the occasions in which he \nwas allowed to leave his cell.\n  In an impassioned letter about the Wen Ho Lee case, one of my \nconstituents expressed:\n\n       As a Chinese American . . . I ask no more than what is due \n     to every citizen of this country, namely, to be treated with \n     respect and dignity. I resent those who would question the \n     loyalty of Chinese Americans any time a particular Chinese \n     American is suspected of an egregious act. In their haste to \n     decry the alleged espionage by an individual, not only are \n     these public officials and said media guilty of a rush to \n     judgment but of tarring with a broad brush other American \n     citizens who are guilty of nothing else other than having the \n     same ethnicity of the suspect.\n\n  Instances like the Wen Ho Lee case engender a sense of disunity and \ndivision within the community, which undermines the basic tenets on \nwhich this nation was founded.\n  In another instance of how poisoned this atmosphere has become, \nOregon U.S. Representative David Wu was recently nearly denied entry \ninto the Department of Energy building in Washington, DC because guards \nquestioned whether he was an American citizen.\n  After Representative Wu and an aide arrived, a guard refused to \nrecognize his Congressional identification and asked three times \nwhether the two were U.S. citizens.\n  Eventually, the two were allowed entry by a supervisor but this \nincident indicates the web of suspicion surrounding all Asian \nAmericans, and even those that are elected to Congress.\n  Following the incident, Representative Wu wrote U.S. Energy Secretary \nSpencer Abraham:\n\n       I am disturbed that yesterday's incident is the tip of an \n     iceberg, an indicator of a much larger problem at DOE which \n     maybe damaging our national security.\n\n  Representative Wu has asked Secretary Abraham to review employment \npractices and operating procedures to prevent future discrimination \nagainst employees of Asian descent. I join with Representative Wu in \nthis important request.\n  Lastly, in recent months, a distinguished public servant currently \nthe Secretary of Labor, has been harshly\n\n[[Page S6597]]\n\nand unfairly attacked and her loyalty questioned because, as a Chinese-\nAmerican, she has knowledge of China, has met with Chinese business \npeople, citizens, and leaders.\n  This is yet another case in which ethnic background appears to be \nsufficient grounds to question someone's patriotism, someone's business \nactivities, and in this case, even the conduct of Elaine Chao's husband \nas a U.S. Senator.\n  Another troubling incident involves the case of Matt Fong, a former \nTreasurer of the State of California and a former Lieutenant colonel in \nthe U.S. Air Force, who has been nominated as Under Secretary of the \nArmy and has had his loyalty to our nation questioned.\n  As it transpires, Mr. Fong unknowingly accepted some funds which he \nshould not have in order to retire debt from his 1994 campaign for \nCalifornia treasurer from Ted Sioeng, an Indonesian businessman.\n  But when Mr. Fong discovered that some of these funds came from \nSioeng's personal account, he immediately returned the money. There \nwere legitimate questions raised about the Sioeng donation but Matt \nFong did the right thing when he found out: He returned the money.\n  I am sad to say that questionable campaign contributions of this sort \noccur more often than they should, from people of all ethnicities and \nbackgrounds. That is one of the reasons why campaign finance reform is \nso essential.\n  So why in this case are there some who still raise questions about \nMr. Fong's loyalty, suggesting that because of this contribution, which \nsome believe may have originated with the Chinese government, Mr. Fong \nmay represent a security risk?\n  There is no evidence that the funds to Mr. Fong originated with the \nChinese government, or that the contribution represents an effort by \nthe Chinese government to ``buy'' Mr. Fong. But because of Mr. Fong's \nethnicity, just leveling the allegation creates an environment of \nsuspicion which by its nature is difficult to refute.\n  All is insinuation, and I am loath to say that it appears that it can \nonly be for one reason why these questions have been raised: Mr. Fong's \nethnicity.\n  As Karen Narasaki, President and Executive Director of the National \nAsian Pacific American Legal Consortium put it:\n\n       Fong's mother served as California Secretary of State for \n     many years and Fong himself has served his country, both in \n     the Air Force and as California State Treasurer. To question \n     his loyalty to the U.S. is the worst sort of racial \n     profiling.\n\n  I am disappointed that there are many who appear to believe that it \nis still acceptable to attack Asian Americans. This is completely \nunacceptable in America.\n  All Americans should be highly offended by the negative stereotypes \nand media coverage of Asian-Americans who have made profound \ncontributions to our nation.\n  How can we question the loyalty of any American because of his or her \nrace or ethnic background? To put it simply, this is un-American and \nmust be stopped.\n  We all need to work together to raise awareness about the positive \ncontributions all Asian Americans have made to every aspect of life \nhere in the United States, and of the sacrifices they have made in \ndefense of this country.\n  We must redouble our efforts to eliminate racial stereotypes that \nstrike at the heart of American values and shame us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/21/senate-section/article/S6597-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to pay \ntribute to Reverend Leon Sullivan who was not only a great American but \na great citizen of the world. He was called the ``Lion of Zion,'' a \nreference to the Zion Baptist Church where he was a fixture at the \npulpit for 38 years. His accomplishments carried him beyond the city of \nPhiladelphia to nationwide acclaim and then to worldwide leadership. \nFrom founding the Opportunities Industrialization Center, OIC, to \nAmerica's most prestigious corporate boards where he brought \nrecognition for minority employment to initiatives on education and \nhealth care in Africa, Dr. Sullivan was a global leader in successfully \nstriving to improve the quality of life for those in need of \nassistance.\n  I first met Dr. Sullivan in the late 1950s when I was an Assistant \nDistrict Attorney prosecuting cases in a magistrate's court at 19th and \nOxford Streets in the heart of the city's African American community. \nDr. Sullivan reclaimed that shambled police court and made it into \nOIC's first job training school. From that modest start, Dr. Sullivan \nwent on to establish 56 centers nationally and another 46 centers \ninternationally.\n  Standing 6 feet 5 inches, Dr. Sullivan was a powerful orator in the \nZion Baptist Church on Sundays and an even more powerful social \ninnovator the other 6 days of the week. His towering strength gained \nnational recognition when he was asked to serve on the board of \ndirectors of General Motors, Mellon Bank, Boy Scouts of America, and \nthe Southern African Development Fund.\n  With unparalleled accomplishments in the United States, Dr. Sullivan \nthen turned his attention to Africa, where he initiated the Sullivan \nPrinciples. The Sullivan Principles are a code of conduct for \nbusinesses operating in South Africa which is acknowledged to be one of \nthe most effective efforts in combating discrimination in the \nworkplace. On April 12, 2000, I introduced a resolution along with \nSenator Feingold that called on companies large and small in every part \nof the world to support and adhere to the Global Sullivan Principles of \nCorporate Social Responsibility wherever they have operations.\n  Dr. Sullivan also founded the International Foundation for Education \nand Self-Help, IFESH. IFESH was established to train people around the \nworld in various disciplines including farming, teaching, healthcare, \nbanking and economics.\n\n[[Page S6598]]\n\n  As an Assistant District Attorney in Philadelphia in the early 1960s \nand as District Attorney through the mid-1970s, I worked with Dr. \nSullivan on a wide variety of projects to combat juvenile delinquency, \nreform prison abuses and provide for realistic rehabilitation for many \nconvicted in Philadelphia's courts. For two decades in the U.S. Senate, \nI continued to work with Dr. Sullivan. As a member of the Senate \nForeign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee, I worked with the \nSubcommittee to secure a total of $38 million in funding since 1984 to \nsupport the work of Opportunities Industrialization Centers, OIC, \nInternational. Since its founding in 1970, OIC International has \ntrained and provided jobs for thousands of poverty stricken people in \nAfrica, Europe, and Asia. Also, I have worked with the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development to assist Reverend Sullivan build \nOpportunities Towers, which provides affordable housing for seniors and \nretirees in Philadelphia and other major cities.\n  When Dr. Sullivan passed away on Tuesday, April 24, 2001, the United \nStates and the world had lost a great humanitarian, an acclaimed \ntheologian, an extraordinary social activist and a great world \nleader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/21/senate-section/article/S6598-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     DEATH OF JUSTICE STANLEY MOSK\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, on Tuesday, California lost one \nof its greatest jurists, Justice Stanley Mosk.\n  For more than a half century, and for 37 years on the bench of the \nState Supreme Court, Stanley Mosk served California with \nthoughtfulness, with honor, and indeed, with wisdom.\n  He was the longest-serving member in the court's 151-year history, \nissuing a total of 1,688 opinions over his career, including 727 \nmajority rulings, 570 dissents, and 391 concurrences.\n  I knew Stanley Mosk well, and I respected him greatly. He's been a \ngiant on the Supreme Court, and he will be missed deeply.\n  Justice Mosk began his political career as executive secretary to \nGovernor Culbert L. Olson in 1938.\n  Following that, he was appointed to the Los Angeles Superior Court, \nwhere he served for 15 years.\n  And beginning in 1958, Mosk was elected California attorney-general, \nbecoming the first Jewish man or woman to be elected to statewide \noffice in the State.\n  Finally in 1964, weary of politics, Justice Mosk was appointed to the \nsupreme court by Governor Pat Brown.\n  In this career which spanned more than 53 years, Justice Mosk broke \nnew ground in the areas of the environment, the right to sue, and, \nperhaps most notably, in race discrimination, where he protected the \nright of all individuals, regardless of race, to be equally protected \nby the law.\n  As early as 1947, while on the superior court, Mosk issued his first \nruling dealing with race, holding that whites-only restrictions on \nproperty were unenforceable.\n  Then in 1961, when serving as attorney-general, he persuaded the \nProfessional Golfers Association to admit black golfers.\n  Later, on the supreme court, Mosk wrote perhaps his most famous \ndecision of his career on the case of Allan Bakke, a white student who \nchallenged racial quotas in the University of California admissions \nprogram.\n  Writing for the majority, Mosk held that the University's quota-based \nadmissions program, that favored minorities over whites, was \nunconstitutional.\n  In each of these decisions, Mosk favored the right of the individual \nto be treated as an equal, with complete disregard to his or her race. \nIt is a formulation which has stood the test of time.\n  In addition, Mosk wrote hundreds of decisions that have deeply \nimpacted the State. Some of those include: An opinion written in 1980 \nallowing victims of the drug DES to sue all makers of the drug, on the \nbasis of their market share, when the specific manufacturer was unknown \nto the victims; A 1972 decision that extended the restrictions of the \nCalifornia Environmental Quality Act to private developers; and A 1979 \ndecision that held that a disabled parent could not be denied custody \nof a child solely because of a physical handicap.\n  Moreover, many of Mosk's opinions reflected his belief in the \ndoctrine of ``independent state grounds,'' which holds that the Federal \nConstitution provides a minimum standard of individual rights upon \nwhich States can build.\n  Stanley Mosk's life was devoted to the law and to the State of \nCalifornia. His prolific careers illustrated his deep commitment to \nequality, and he leaves a legacy that will last for years to come.\n  He is survived by his wife, Kaygey Kash Mosk, and son Richard M. \nMosk.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/21/senate-section/article/S6598-2", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CONGRATULATIONS TO BOB AND ORLENE THOMAS\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK.

Mr. President, people who fuss about doctors \nshould read this article from the June 18, 2001 issue of Newsweek \nmagazine. I know of no other profession that has banded together as \nwell as the doctors mentioned in order to continue to serve. South \nCarolina is proud of Jack McConnell. For launching this effort and \ninspiring others to do likewise, he deserves the Congressional Gold \nMedal.\n  The article follows:\n\n               ``And What Did You Do for Someone Today?''\n\n                       (By Jack McConnell, M.D.)\n\n       When I was a child, we observed Father's Day by walking to \n     the local Methodist church and listening to my father preach. \n     We didn't have a car--my dad believed he could not ``support \n     Mr. Ford'' on a minister's salary and still see that all of \n     his seven children went to college. While we understood it \n     was a special day--my mother would have something exceptional \n     like a roast or a turkey cooking in the oven--in many ways it \n     was not all that different from any other day. As soon as my \n     brothers and sisters and I got home, we'd all gather around \n     the dining-room table, where we took turns answering our \n     father's daily question: ``And what did you do for someone \n     today?''\n       While that voice and those words always stuck in my mind, \n     they often got pushed aside by more immediate concerns: long \n     hours in medical school, building a career in medical \n     research, getting married, raising children and acquiring the \n     material accouterments every father wants for his family. All \n     the hallmarks of a ``successful'' life, according to today's \n     standards. When these goals were met and that busy time of \n     life was over, retirement followed on Hilton Head Island, \n     S.C.\n       My wife and I built our home in a gated community \n     surrounded by yacht clubs and golf courses. But when I left \n     the compound and its luxurious buffer zone for the other side \n     of the island, I was traveling on unpaved roads lined with \n     leaky bungalows. The ``lifestyle'' of many of the native \n     islanders stood in jarring contrast to my cozy existence. I \n     was stunned by the disparity.\n       By means of a lifelong habit of mine of giving rides to \n     hitchhikers--remember, I grew up without a car--I got to \n     talking to some of these local folks. And I discovered that \n     the vast majority of the maids, gardeners, waitresses and \n     construction workers who make this island work had little or \n     no access to medical care. It seemed outrageous to me. I \n     wondered why someone didn't do something about that. Then \n     my father's words, which had at times receded to a \n     whisper, rang in my head again: ``What did you do for \n     someone today?''\n       Even though my father had died several years before, I \n     guess I still didn't want to disappoint him. So I started \n     working on a solution. The island was full of retired \n     doctors. If I could persuade them to spend a few hours a week \n     volunteering their services, we could\n\n[[Page S6599]]\n\n     provide free primary health care to those so desperately in \n     need of it. Most of the doctors I approached liked the idea, \n     so long as their life savings wouldn't be put at risk by \n     malpractice suits. They also wanted to be relicensed without \n     a long, bureaucratic hassle. It took one year and plenty of \n     persistence, but I was able to persuade the state legislature \n     to create a special license for doctors volunteering in not-\n     for-profit clinics, and got full malpractice coverage for \n     everyone from South Carolina's Joint Underwriting Association \n     for only $5,000 a year.\n       The town donated land, local residents contributed office \n     and medical equipment and some of the potential patients \n     volunteered their weekends stuccoing the building that would \n     become the clinic. We named it Volunteers in Medicine and we \n     opened its doors in 1994, fully staffed by retired \n     physicians, nurses, dentists and chiropractors as well as \n     nearly 150 lay volunteers. That year we had 5,000 patient \n     visits; last year we had 16,000.\n       Somehow word of what we were doing got around. Soon we were \n     fielding phone calls from retired physicians all over the \n     country, asking for help in starting VIM clinics in their \n     communities. We did the best we could--there are now 15 other \n     clinics operating--but we couldn't keep up with the need. Yet \n     last month I think my father's words found their way up \n     north, to McNeil Consumer Healthcare, the maker of Tylenol. A \n     major grant from McNeil will allow us to respond to these \n     requests and help establish other free clinics in communities \n     around the country.\n       According to statistics, there are 150,000 retired doctors \n     and 400,000 retired nurses somewhere out there, many of them \n     itching to practice medicine again. Since I heeded my dad's \n     words, my golf handicap has risen from a 16 to a 26 and my \n     leisure time has evaporated into 60-hour weeks of unpaid \n     work, but my energy level has increased and there is a \n     satisfaction in my life that wasn't there before. In one of \n     those paradoxes of life, I have benefited more from \n     Volunteers in Medicine than my patients have.\n       This Father's Day, of course, my dad is not around. And my \n     children are all grown and out on their own. But now I remind \n     them the best way to celebrate this holiday is by listening \n     and responding to their grandfather's question: ``What did \n     you do for someone today?'' That's my father's most valuable \n     legacy--to me and my children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/21/senate-section/article/S6599-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IN RECOGNITION OF JACOB MELLINGER\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI.

Since then, Mr. Mellinger has \nlived a life full of accomplishment, compassion and service. Upon \ngraduating from the New Jersey Law School in 1927, he went on to build \na successful law practice that lasted for 60 years. During that time, \nhe established himself as an outstanding practitioner of the law and he \nalso earned the right to argue cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. \nHowever, he has also used his success to serve his community.

Mr. President, Vermont is a very small State with \nspecial people. For those of us who live there we have the opportunity \nto get to know many within our State. One who has given his life to the \npeople of his community and parish is Father Philip Branon and I would \nlike my colleagues to have the opportunity to read this recent article \nabout him that was in the Burlington Free Press on April 8, 2001.\n  The article follows:\n\n               Vt. Priest Celebrates 50 Years on the Job\n\n                           (By Sally Pollak)\n\n       South Hero--Philip Branon was a teen-ager when the priest \n     at his local church, St. Patrick in Fairfield, called him \n     into the rectory and suggested he consider the priesthood.\n       ``It must be because I was a pious child,'' the Rev. Branon \n     said, laughing at the thought, ``Or maybe my mother told him \n     to. I don't know.''\n       If it were his mother's idea it was a sound one, the right \n     choice for the sixth of 10 Branon children--a Fairfield \n     farmboy who still associates Sunday Mass with morning chores.\n       Branon, 74, will mark the 50th anniversary of his \n     ordination into the priesthood Wednesday. He has spent more \n     than half that time--30 years--serving the Catholic community \n     of Grand Isle County, celebrating Mass, comforting the dying, \n     baptizing babies. He joins one other Vermont priest, the Rev. \n     George Dupuis of Arlington, who is still active after half a \n     century.\n       If Branon anticipated 50 years of anything, it was nothing \n     more than living.\n       ``I'm just very grateful that I have lived for the 50 \n     years, and that I have good health,'' Branon said. ``I also \n     have the wonderful privilege of being brought up in a good \n     family with a lot of help and warmth from my brothers and \n     sisters.''\n       Branon celebrated his first Mass on April 15, 1951, \n     reciting the service in Latin in St. Patrick Church, his \n     childhood parish. The Rev. William Tennien, the pastor who \n     suggested Branon's priesthood, shepherded Burlington drivers \n     who couldn't get through the muddy Franklin County roads to \n     the event.\n\n\n                             over the years\n\n       Since that first service, Branon has celebrated more than \n     17,000 Masses, an average of seven a week. He will say \n     once again this morning, at St. Joseph Church in Grand \n     Isle, one of three churches in his parish. The service \n     will be followed by a celebration of his priesthood.\n       Alice Toth, a South Hero teacher, plans to attend. She has \n     been a parishioner at St. Rose in South Hero, Branon's home \n     church, for 33 years. Toth appreciates his ``special gift'' \n     for reaching the elderly and ill.\n       ``He's a very caring pastor,'' she said. ``And he's a true \n     Vermonter in the sense that he's really close to nature in \n     his sermon and his message.''\n       Branon's first church was St. Paul in Barton. Then Mass was \n     in Latin and his sermons were delivered in French and \n     English.\n       He had no choice: He was informed by the Bishop that he \n     would not be ordained if he didn't learn French.\n       He picked up sufficient French in conversation with other \n     students at St. John's Seminary in Boston, ``I got along well \n     in Barton,'' he said. ``Even though I didn't always know what \n     I was saying.''\n       Branon became the pastor at the University of Vermont's \n     Newman Center in 1957, and served there for 14 years. He \n     called it ``the best place a priest could be'' when the \n     changes of Vatican II were introduced.\n       At UVM, bringing together his two loves--family and the \n     Church--he asked a wood-worker from the Fairfield hills, \n     Frank Moran, to carve a crucifix from a piece of black cherry \n     that belonged to Branon's father. It remains at the chapel \n     today.\n\n\n                           Good Vermont stock\n\n       Thirty years ago, Branon moved to the Champlain Islands, \n     where he lives in South Hero and serves three island \n     churches. He has chosen to stay because he loves where he \n     lives, has firm roots in the community, and is not far from \n     family and his childhood home.\n       ``His contributions to the islands cannot be \n     overestimated,'' said Max Reader, the retired pastor of the \n     Congregational Church in South Hero.\n       ``He's down to earth.'' Reader said, ``He's quite honest \n     and he's very understanding. He's of good old Vermont stock \n     and he's just got all these good qualities that make him a \n     very, very fine priest.''\n       Branon feels that perhaps his most important contributions \n     are made at funerals. He estimates that he has presided over \n     15 to 20 during each of the last 30 years.\n       ``I'd rather do funerals than weddings anytime,'' he said \n     Thursday morning after Mass. ``At a funeral, it's all honest. \n     It's really and truly a teachable moment, the best chance for \n     a priest to talk to a number of people who don't go to \n     church.''\n       He considers the most important part of his job bringing \n     Communion and comfort to the elderly and ill who can't get to \n     church. Thursday after Mass, Branon--a slow walker and \n     deliberate talker--placed a bible and some bread in his Chevy \n     Corsica and prepared for a dozen Communion house calls.\n       ``It comes down to the purpose of our ministry,'' he said. \n     ``The purpose of the priesthood is to help people go to \n     heaven. When you're dealing with sick people and old people, \n     you're pretty apt to be dealing with people who are close to \n     it.\n       ``Over the years, you find out that sick people know \n     they're sick. You try to help people understand it, help them \n     face death.''\n       The deaths are not only a time for comfort and compassion, \n     but a chance to learn about the families who live on the \n     islands. ``If I had written down two or three lines about \n     every person I buried,'' Branon said, ``I'd have a wonderful \n     history of the islands.''\n\n\n                             Farming family\n\n       The history of the Church and his family are of great \n     importance to Branon. His family has been farming in \n     Fairfield for about 130 years, working a farm that was \n     started by his great-grandmother, Mary O'Neill Branon.\n       She was widowed in the 1860s when her blacksmith husband, \n     Irish immigrant Anthony Branon, was killed by the kick of a \n     horse. Mary Branon took her two children and walked 17 miles \n     from Swanton to Fairfield, driving cattle as she went.\n       Branon and his nine siblings--seven brothers and two \n     sisters--grew up on the nearby\n\n[[Page S6600]]\n\n     farm settled by Mary O'Neill Branon's son, Edward. He fondly \n     recalls the Sunday mornings of his childhood, a satisfying \n     mix of chores, Mass and fox hunting.\n       His mother was devout, but it is his father's definition of \n     sin that has stayed with the priest: ``He said, `I was \n     brought up to figure you can't commit a sin unless you want \n     to,' '' Branon recalled.\n       And it was his father, brother of a priest and a nun, who \n     took the time to fall to his knees and pray before going to \n     the barn to care for a sick horse.\n       These stories of family and faith nourish Branon as he \n     approaches 75, as he makes his rounds to comfort the elderly \n     and ill.\n       He has no plans to retire, no plans to leave South Hero. \n     ``I owe it to God and the people to keep going as long as I'm \n     worth anything,'' he said.\n       In his parish home, alone at night, Branon thinks of his \n     own mortality and finds comfort in these words: ``May the all \n     powerful Lord grant me a happy life and a peaceful death.''\n       Maybe not the exact words of the night prayers, concedes \n     the priest with 50 years' experience. But close enough.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                              Branon File\n\n       Who: The Rev. Phillip J.

A bill to provide for the review of agriculture mergers and \nacquisitions by the Department of Agriculture and to outlaw unfair \npractices in the agriculture industry, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as most of my colleagues know, \nagriculture is a crucial industry for Iowa. The small, independent \nfamily farmer is an important thread which holds together my State's \ncultural, economic and social fabric. In fact, the family farmer is one \nof the best things about Iowa's heritage. My colleagues are well aware \nthat I'm committed to preserving and supporting this valuable member of \nIowa's communities.\n  Agriculture is a risky business. I know that from personal \nexperience, I've lived and worked on a farm all my life. But these \ndays, farmers feel especially vulnerable. ``Merger-mania'' has been \nrunning rampant, with large companies joining forces to create new \nbusiness giants in every sector of the economy, including agriculture.\n  The agriculture sector has witnessed a number of mega-mergers and \nalliances affecting grain and livestock. And the independent producer \nis seeing fewer choices of who to buy from and who to sell to. More and \nmore family farmers and independent producers are feeling the pressure \nand impact of concentration in agriculture. Good men and women who have \nfarmed for years and years are going out of business. Yet, the \nindependent farmer is one of the most efficient businessman in our \nNation's economy. That's why the United States can feed itself and a \ngood portion of the world.\n  I've said before that I am not of the belief that all mergers are in \nand of themselves wrong or unfair to family farmers. But we need to \nmake sure that open and fair access to the marketplace is preserved for \neveryone. We need to make sure that large businesses are not acting in \na predatory or anti-competitive manner. We need to make sure that \nfamily farmers and independent producers can compete on a level playing \nfield. That's how we can keep our economy strong, our agricultural \ncommunity vibrant and competitive, and our consumers happy.\n  Now we've heard that a Delaware Court has ordered Tyson Foods and IBP \nto resume their merger discussions, because Tyson Foods did not have a \ncontractually permissible reason to terminate its merger agreement with \nIBP when it announced in March that it was rescinding the transaction. \nWhile I do not want to take issue with the court's findings, I am \nconcerned about the fact that this merger looks like it will go through \nand, consequently, the meat industry will consolidate even further. \nBeginning last September when Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette/Rawhide \nHoldings Corporation, then Smithfield Foods, and finally Tyson Foods \nstarted a bidding war for IBP, I pushed the Justice Department to \ncarefully scrutinize each possible business combination. In January, I \nwrote the Justice Department urging it to vigorously review the Tyson-\nIBP transaction from all angles, and to consult with the Agriculture \nDepartment to better ascertain the ramifications of such a merger on \nfamily farmers and independent producers. I would have thought that a \ncombination of the Nation's largest poultry producer with the world's \nlargest producer of beef and pork products would result in \nsignificantly reduced market opportunities, as well as increased the \npossibility of anti-competitive business practices. I shared the \nconcerns of many farmers and producers that this transaction would \nadversely impact their ability to obtain fair prices for their \nproducts. I was also concerned that a combined IBP-Tyson presence in \nthe retail market would negatively affect product choice and the prices \nconsumers pay at the meat counter.\n  But the Justice Department determined earlier this year that the \npotential negative impact on competition was insufficient to sustain an \ninjunction against the merger under the antitrust laws. Because the \nJustice Department completed its antitrust review in January, I \nunderstand that there is nothing further for the Department to do in \nterms of an antitrust review if the parties re-engage their merger \ntalks in due course and without changes to the transaction. But I \nremain seriously concerned about the impact this merger will have on \nour farm community and I hope that, if this merger is ultimately \ncompleted, the Justice Department will carefully monitor whether a \nmerged IBP-Tyson will have unintended consequences on competition in \nthe meat economy and, if it does, take appropriate action.\n  Nevertheless, this development re-energizes my gut feeling that we \nneed to somehow change the way ag mergers are reviewed and approved. \nSo, today I'm re-introducing a bill I authored last year, the \n``Agriculture Competition Enhancement Act,'' to help address some of \nthe competition concerns of America's family farmers and independent \nproducers. My bill will refocus the merger review process as it \npertains to agri-business, and will enhance the Department of \nAgriculture's ability to address anti-competitive activity in \nagriculture. I believe that bringing to the table a greater \nunderstanding of ag producers' needs when ag mergers are reviewed is \nthe biggest missing element to making the merger review process as fair \nas possible. Closing this gap is the heart of my proposal.\n  Several provisions in the ``Agriculture Competition Enhancement Act'' \nare based on proposals by the American Farm Bureau, the largest \norganization representing producers of agricultural commodities. \nHowever, I'd like to briefly discuss what I believe to be the most \nimportant components of this bill: the enhancement of the Department of \nAgriculture's role in the Hart-Scott-Rodino review process, the \ncreation of a new ``impact on family farmers and independent \nproducers'' standard of review by the Department of Agriculture for ag \nmergers, and the expansion of the Department of Agriculture's ability \nto take regulatory and enforcement action with respect to anti-\ncompetitive and unfair practices in the agricultural sector.\n\n  Far more than the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission, \nthe Department of Agriculture has extraordinary knowledge and expertise \nin agricultural matters. The Department of Agriculture formulates ag \npolicy for the Nation, and works closely with the farm community about \ntheir various concerns. So, I believe that the Department of \nAgriculture is the office that can best assess the true impact of ag \nmergers and other business transactions on farmers, ranchers and \nindependent producers. That is why my bill seeks to expand and enhance \nthe role that the Department of Agriculture plays in the antitrust \nreview of ag mergers.\n  Currently, when the Justice Department or the Federal Trade \nCommission assesses a proposed merger, the focus of their analysis is \nweighted heavily toward the impact of the transaction on consumers. \nHowever, agriculture is unique. The antitrust laws already recognize \nthis with the ag cooperative exception. But I believe we need to go \nfurther by requiring the Justice Department and Federal Trade \nCommission to specifically take into account the effect ag mergers have \non family\n\n[[Page S6604]]\n\nfarmers and producers. The ``Agriculture Competition Enhancement Act'' \nwould do just that by requiring the Department of Agriculture to \nconduct an assessment of how a proposed ag transaction will affect \nfamily farmers and independent producers and their access to the \nmarket.\n  I realize that presently the Justice Department and Federal Trade \nCommission informally consult with the Department of Agriculture when \nthey consider ag mergers. But I believe that the current process does \nnot sufficiently ensure that the farm community's concerns are being \nadequately addressed. The approach I advocate will ensure that \nproducers' concerns and needs are fully discussed when federal agencies \nexamine proposed ag business mergers. By guaranteeing inclusion and \nopenness for family farmers and independent producers, we can go a long \nway toward alleviating their understandable anxiety about an \nincreasingly concentrated industry.\n  So my bill requires the Department of Agriculture to do a merger \nreview that focuses on the needs of producers by examining whether the \ntransaction would cause substantial harm to farmers' ability to compete \nin the marketplace. This review would be conducted simultaneously with \nthe Justice Department's antitrust review, in order to minimize \ndisruption to the current merger review process. Further, my bill \nencourages the parties and the Department of Agriculture to resolve \nconcerns about the proposed merger during this timeframe. If its \nconcerns are not satisfied, the Department of Agriculture has the \nability to challenge the merger in federal court to either stop the \nmerger, or to impose appropriate conditions or limitations on the \nproposed transaction.\n  Recognizing that the Department of Agriculture needs to have an \nindividual who will perform this new antitrust responsibility, my bill \ncalls for the creation of a Special Counsel for Competition Matters at \nthe Department of Agriculture. My bill also provides for increased \nfunding for competition matters, and authorizes additional specialized \nstaff--including antitrust attorneys and economists--at the Justice \nDepartment and Department of Agriculture, to ensure that these agencies \nhave the appropriate resources to accomplish the goals of this \nlegislation.\n  Furthermore, under my bill, the competition protection authorities of \nthe Department of Agriculture's Packers and Stockyards Division are \nextended to include anti-competitive practices by dealers, processors \nand commission merchants of all ag commodities. This expanded \nauthority, based on provisions in the current Packers and Stockyards \nAct, will give the Department of Agriculture an increased ability to \nlook at unfair, deceptive and predatory business practices by all ag \nbusinesses, not just packers and poultry farmers.\n  As my colleagues from rural States know, ag concentration is one of \nthe most important issues in agriculture today. Other members here in \nCongress have introduced bills or are presently working to craft their \nown legislative proposals to respond to the concerns of America's \nfarmers. I want it to be clearly understood that it is my desire to \nwork with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, as well as the Bush \nAdministration, so that we can make meaningful progress on this issue. \nI know that my proposal has its critics, but I am willing and ready to \nlisten to their concerns and work on constructive changes to my bill. \nBut I truly hope that we can achieve a bipartisan compromise sooner \nrather than later on this issue, so we can calm farmers' fears about \nhigh levels of ag concentration.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1076\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

At any \n     time prior to the close of the hearing the Secretary may \n     amend the complaint; but in case of any amendment adding new \n     charges the hearing shall, on the request of the dealer, \n     processor, commission merchant, or broker, be adjourned for a \n     period not exceeding 15 days.\n       (2) Report and order; penalty.--If, after such hearing, the \n     Secretary finds that the dealer, processor, commission \n     merchant, or broker, has violated or is violating any \n     provisions of this section covered by the charges, the \n     Secretary shall make a report in writing in which the \n     Secretary shall state his findings as to the facts, and \n     shall issue and cause to be served on the dealer, \n     processor, commission merchant, or broker, an order \n     requiring such dealer, processor, commission merchant, or \n     broker, to cease and desist from continuing such \n     violation. The testimony taken at the hearing shall be \n     reduced to writing and filed in the records of the \n     Department of Agriculture. The Secretary may also assess a \n     civil penalty of not more than $10,000 for each such \n     violation. In determining the amount of the civil penalty \n     to be assessed under this section, the Secretary shall \n     consider the gravity of the offense, the size of the \n     business involved, and the effect of the penalty on the \n     person's ability to continue in business. If, after the \n     lapse of the period allowed for appeal or after the\n\n[[Page S6606]]\n\n     affirmance of such penalty, the person against whom the \n     civil penalty is assessed fails to pay such penalty, the \n     Secretary may proceed to recover such penalty by an action \n     in the appropriate district court of the United States.\n       (3) Amendment of report or order.--Until the record in such \n     hearing has been filed in a court of appeals of the United \n     States, as provided in subsection (c), the Secretary at any \n     time, upon such notice and in such manner as the Secretary \n     deems proper, but only after reasonable opportunity to the \n     dealer, processor, commission merchant, or broker, to be \n     heard, may amend or set aside the report or order, in whole \n     or in part.\n       (4) Service of process.--Complaints, orders, and other \n     processes of the Secretary under this section may be served \n     in the same manner as provided in section 5 of the Federal \n     Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45).\n       (c) Conclusiveness of Order; Appeal and Review.--\n       (1) Filing of petition; bond.--An order made under \n     subsection (b) shall be final and conclusive unless within 30 \n     days after service the dealer, processor, commission \n     merchant, or broker, appeals to the court of appeals for the \n     circuit in which he has his principal place of business, by \n     filing with the clerk of such court a written petition \n     praying that the Secretary's order be set aside or modified \n     in the manner stated in the petition, together with a bond in \n     such sum as the court may determine, conditioned that such \n     dealer, processor, commission merchant, or broker, will pay \n     the costs of the proceedings if the court so directs.\n       (2) Filing of record by secretary.--The clerk of the court \n     shall immediately cause a copy of the petition to be \n     delivered to the Secretary, and the Secretary shall thereupon \n     file in the court the record in such proceedings, as provided \n     in section 2112 of title 28, United States Code. If before \n     such record is filed the Secretary amends or sets aside his \n     report or order, in whole or in part, the petitioner may \n     amend the petition within such time as the court may \n     determine, on notice to the Secretary.\n       (3) Temporary injunction.--At any time after such petition \n     is filed, the court, on application of the Secretary, may \n     issue a temporary injunction, restraining, to the extent it \n     deems proper, the dealer, processor, commission merchant, or \n     broker, and his officers, directors, agents, and employees, \n     from violating any of the provisions of the order pending the \n     final determination of the appeal.\n       (4) Evidence.--The evidence so taken or admitted, and filed \n     as aforesaid as a part of the record, shall be considered by \n     the court as the evidence in the case.\n       (5) Action by the court.--The court may affirm, modify, or \n     set aside the order of the Secretary.\n       (6) Additional evidence.--If the court determines that the \n     just and proper disposition of the case requires the taking \n     of additional evidence, the court shall order the hearing to \n     be reopened for the taking of such evidence, in such manner \n     and upon such terms and conditions as the court may deem \n     proper. The Secretary may modify his findings as to the \n     facts, or make new findings, by reason of the additional \n     evidence so taken, and the Secretary shall file such modified \n     or new findings and his recommendations, if any, for the \n     modifications or setting aside of his order, with the return \n     of such additional evidence.\n       (7) Injunction.--If the court of appeals affirms or \n     modifies the order of the Secretary, its decree shall operate \n     as an injunction to restrain the dealer, processor, \n     commission merchant, or broker, and his officers, directors, \n     agents, and employees from violating the provisions of such \n     order or such order as modified.\n       (8) Finality.--The court of appeals shall have \n     jurisdiction, which upon the filing of the record with it \n     shall be exclusive, to review, and to affirm, set aside, or \n     modify, such orders of the Secretary, and the decree of such \n     court shall be final except that it shall be subject to \n     review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon \n     certiorari, as provided in section 1254 of title 28, United \n     States Code, if such writ is duly applied for within 60 days \n     after entry of the decree. The issue of such writ shall not \n     operate as a stay of the decree of the court of appeals, \n     insofar as such decree operates as an injunction unless so \n     ordered by the Supreme Court.\n       (d) Punishment for Violation of Order.--Any dealer, \n     processor, commission merchant, or broker, or any officer, \n     director, agent, or employee of a dealer, processor, \n     commission merchant, or broker, who fails to obey any order \n     of the Secretary issued under the provisions of subsection \n     (b), or such order as modified--\n       (1) after the expiration of the time allowed for filing a \n     petition in the court of appeals to set aside or modify such \n     order, if no such petition has been filed within such time;\n       (2) after the expiration of the time allowed for applying \n     for a writ of certiorari, if such order, or such order as \n     modified, has been sustained by the court of appeals and no \n     such writ has been applied for within such time; or\n       (3) after such order, or such order as modified, has been \n     sustained by the courts as provided in subsection (c);\n\n     shall on conviction be fined not less than $500 nor more than \n     $10,000, or imprisoned for not less than 6 months nor more \n     than 5 years, or both. Each day during which such failure \n     continues shall be deemed a separate offense.\n\n     SEC. 6.

A bill to promote brownfields redevelopment in urban and \nrural areas and spur community revitalization in low-income and \nmoderate-income neighborhoods; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Kennedy, \n        Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Reid, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Corzine, \n        Mr. Sarbanes, and Mr. Dayton):\n  S. 1079. A bill to amend the Public Works and Economic Development \nAct of 1965 to provide assistance to communities for the redevelopment \nof brownfield sites; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am introducing today, along with Senator \nJeffords, as co-chairmen of the Senate Smart Growth Task Force, two \nbills to help communities expedite the economic redevelopment of \nbrownfields. These bills are complementary to S. 350 which we strongly \nsupport. Brownfields are abandoned, idled, or under-used industrial and \ncommercial properties where expansion or redevelopment is complicated \nby real or perceived environmental contamination. More than 450,000 of \nthese sites taint our nation's landscape, inhibiting economic \ndevelopment and posing a threat to human health and the environment. \nUndeveloped, or underdeveloped, brownfields blight communities forcing \ndevelopment onto greenfields. But redeveloped, these sites offer new \nopportunities for businesses, housing and green space. Brownfields \nredevelopment is a fiscally-sound way to bring investment back to \nneglected neighborhoods, cleanup the environment, reuse existing \ninfrastructure that is already paid for, utilize existing markets and \nlabor pools, and relieve development pressure on our urban fringe and \nfarmlands.\n  My home State of Michigan is a national leader in brownfields \nredevelopment. Michigan communities are reclaiming brownfields in urban \ncenters, towns and villages, ensuring that natural areas and \ngreenspaces are less likely to succumb to sprawl when there are \nbrownfield properties available to meet development needs. The City of \nKalamazoo has leveraged $28 million in private investment and created \nover 200 jobs through its brownfields redevelopment program. The city \nhas fully completed development of 4 sites and played a role in the \nredevelopment of 16 properties, creating new opportunities for \ncommercial and industrial development. The City of St. Ignace, a small \ncommunity in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, successfully redeveloped \na former railroad property into a community recreation building and \nconference center. The project, built jointly by the Sault Ste. Marie \nChippewa Indian Tribe and the City of St. Ignace, created jobs and has \nthe potential of stimulating additional year-round tourist activities \nwhere seasonal unemployment rates range between 20-25 percent during \nthe winter months.\n  At the Federal level, we need to support local communities and States \nin their efforts to reclaim brownfields by providing economic \ndevelopment resources to revitalize these sites. The two bills I am \nintroducing today will aid cities like Kalamazoo and St. Ignace in \ntheir efforts to promote social well-being and create economic vitality \nby redeveloping brownfields.\n  The first bill, the Brownfield Site Redevelopment Assistance Act of \n2001, creates a new program within the Department of Commerce's \nEconomic Development Administration, EDA, to provide targeted \nassistance for projects that redevelop brownfield sites. The Act would \nprovide EDA with a dedicated source of funding for brownfields \nredevelopment and increased funding flexibility to help States, local \ncommunities, Indian tribes and nonprofit organizations restore these \nsites to productive use. This bill would provide EDA with the authority \nto facilitate effective economic development planning for reuse; \ndevelop the infrastructure necessary to prepare brownfield sites for \nre-entry into the market; and, provide the capital necessary to support \nnew business development on brownfields. The bill provides $60 million \neach year for FY2002 to FY2006.\n  The second bill, the Brownfields Economic Development Act of 2001, \nwould allow the Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, to \nmake existing Brownfields Economic Development Initiative, BEDI, grants \nmore easily available to units of general local government and \nfederally-recognized Indian tribes by permitting the Department to make \nthese grants independent of economic development loan guarantees. The \nbill also provides funding for small communities, known as \nnonentitlement areas, and federally-recognized Indian tribes.\n  BEDI grants can help communities redevelop brownfields by providing \nlocal governments with a flexible source of funding to pursue \nbrownfields redevelopment through land acquisition, site preparation, \neconomic development and other activities. Currently, BEDI grants are \nrequired to support economic development loan guarantees known as \nSection 108 loan guarantees. To be eligible for these funds, a local \ncommunity or State must pledge Community Development Block Grant, CDBG, \nfunds as partial collateral for the loan guarantee. This requirement is \na significant barrier to many local communities that need assistance to \nrevitalize brownfields, but are unable to pledge these funds. This bill \nwould allow HUD to make BEDI grants independent of economic development \nloan guarantees, providing critical financial assistance to leverage \nprivate sector investment in brownfields.\n\n  Many organizations support these bills, including: (1) the Council \nfor Urban Economic Development, (2) Enterprise Foundation, (3) National \nAssociation of Business Incubators, (4) National Association of \nCounties, (5) National Association of Development Organizations, (6) \nNational Association of Installation Developers, (7) National \nAssociation of Regional Councils, (8) National Association of Towns and \nTownships, (9) National Congress for Community Economic Development, \n(10) National League of Cities, (11) Smart Growth America, and (12) \nUnited States Conference of Mayors. Brownfields affect urban, rural and \nNative American communities. In urban areas, the U.S. Conference of \nMayors, USCM, estimates that brownfields redevelopment could generate \nmore than 550,000 additional jobs and up to $2.4 billion in new tax \nrevenues in over one hundred cities surveyed. The cities surveyed by \nthe USCM reported that lack of funding for redevelopment and liability \nproblems arising from Superfund are the major obstacles to reuse. In \nrural areas it is easy to ``leap frog'' over brownfields to abundant \nopen space. The National Association of Development Organizations, \nNADO, in a report on reclaiming rural America's brownfields found that \nFederal agencies are not reaching rural areas through existing \nbrownfields programs, and rural communities need financial and \ntechnical assistance to include brownfields in economic development \nstrategies. Indian tribes face a legacy of contamination from former \nagricultural, industrial and commercial facilities. The Environmental \nProtection Agency estimates that nationwide there are 1,645 facilities \nlocated on tribal lands and 6,982 facilities located within three miles \nof tribal lands. Nationally, State brownfields programs have \nfacilitated reuse of more than 40,000 sites, but this is less than 10 \npercent of the estimated 450,000 brownfields nationwide. A report of \nthe National Governors Association stated that assessment and cleanup \nof brownfields are only part of the process, equally important is \nphysical development of these sites. These two bills would provide the \nfinancial resources to help communities and states\n\n[[Page S6608]]\n\nrealize new private investment and tax revenues from the redevelopment \nof brownfields, and would assist EDA and HUD to reach rural towns and \nIndian tribes to support their reuse efforts.\n  The two bills that Senator Jeffords and I are introducing will \ncomplement the resources and liability clarifications provided in S. \n350, and together these three bills will provide communities with the \nfinancial assistance needed to leverage private investment in \nbrownfields and accelerate reuse. Providing economic development \nresources through HUD and EDA can stimulate brownfields economic \ndevelopment by leveraging private investment into communities, and can \ngive communities the financial resources and technical assistance they \nneed to turn brownfield environmental liabilities into economic assets.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the two bills and letters of \nsupport be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1078\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1.

Enterprise strongly \n     support these two bills.\n       Enterprise is a national nonprofit organization that raises \n     resources and channels them to grassroots at the local level \n     for affordable housing, economic development and other \n     community revitalization initiatives in distressed urban and \n     rural neighborhoods nationwide. Central to our mission is \n     generating investment in areas suffering from blight, neglect \n     and disinvestment. Brownfields are prime examples of such \n     areas.\n       Enterprise is engaged in several large-scale brownfield \n     redevelopment efforts around the country. Targeted incentives \n     such as your bills provide would enable Enterprise and others \n     in the private sector to convert more brownfields to \n     productive uses.\n       By spurring brownfields redevelopment, your bills direct \n     limited public resources to places that already benefit from \n     existing infrastructure and promote economic investment where \n     it is needed most. The bills epitomize smart growth and \n     comprehensive community development principles.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             F.

Redevelopment of abandoned or underutilized \n     sites can stimulate economic revitalization in the \n     surrounding areas, and preserve green space by providing an \n     alternative to unchecked urban sprawl. Therefore, NACo \n     strongly supports language mandating the development of a \n     comprehensive economic development strategy.\n       We applaud your efforts to provide assistance for \n     redevelopment projects that promote the redevelopment, \n     restoration and economic recovery of brownfield sites. \n     Furthermore, NACo supports the legislative objective of \n     bringing new income and private investment to distressed \n     communities that have not fully participated in the \n     nationwide economic expansion. This legislation is closely \n     aligned with NACo policy objectives, and we offer our support \n     during the legislative process.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this important issue. \n     Please feel free to contact Cassandra Matthews, Associate \n     Legislative Director, at (202) 942-4204 if you need \n     additional information or assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Larry E. Naake,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                    Development Organizations,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 9, 2001.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: On behalf of the National Association \n     of Development Organizations (NADO), I am writing to express \n     our strong support for your efforts to enhance and support \n     the Economic Development Administration's (EDA's) brownfields \n     redevelopment activities.\n       As a national association representing regional planning \n     and development organizations that provide valuable \n     professional and technical assistance to over 1,800 counties \n     and 15,000 small cities and towns, we recognize the value and \n     benefits of returning former commercial and industrial sites \n     to productive use. This includes targeting sites in small \n     metropolitan and rural America, as well as our urban centers.\n       In addition to being encouraged and supportive of \n     congressional efforts to strengthen the Environmental \n     Protection Agency's (EPA's) brownfields portfolio, we also \n     recognize the unique tools and experience that EDA has to \n     offer local communities. While EPA has implemented effective \n     assessment and clean up programs, there is a tremendous need \n     for federal programs focused on redeveloping and transforming \n     the former brownfields sites into productive facilities.\n       Over the past 35 years, EDA has developed a successful \n     track record in partnering with local communities to \n     revitalize, upgrade and expand former commercial sites into \n     industrial facilities that help create quality jobs, expand \n     the local tax base and improve the quality of life in the \n     area. This includes making the necessary investments in \n     infrastructure, as well as providing essential planning and \n     technical assistance.\n       EDA has also proven to be an effective federal partner for \n     EPA, with the two federal agencies leveraging their funding \n     and particular expertise to assist communities. Therefore, we \n     strongly support your efforts to provide EDA with the \n     resources and program tools needed to help small metropolitan \n     and rural communities convert brownfields into economic \n     development opportunities.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Aliceann Wohlbruck,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         Smart Growth America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 4, 2001.\n     Hon. James Jeffords,\n     Co-Chair, Senate Smart Growth Task Force, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Co-Chair, Senate Smart Growth Task Force, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Jeffords and Senator Levin: Smart Growth \n     America would like to thank you for your leadership on the \n     introduction of the Brownfields Economic Development Act of \n     2001 and the Brownfields Site Redevelopment Assistance Act of \n     2001. We strongly support these bills and your efforts to \n     complement the Brownfields Revitalization and Environmental \n     Restoration Act of 2001 by focusing on the physical \n     redevelopment of brownfields.\n       S. 350 provides needed liability relief and funding to \n     inventory, assess and remediate brownfield sites. These two \n     new bills build upon S. 350 by providing communities with \n     additional economic development resources to return \n     brownfields to productive use.\n       Economic development of brownfield sites is an essential \n     element of smart growth--growth that revitalizes \n     neighborhoods, creates and preserves affordable housing, \n     promotes transportation choice, and preserves open space and \n     farmland. And, it makes economic sense. The U.S. Conference \n     of Mayors found that as much as $2.4 billion annually could \n     be generated in new tax revenues by fully tapping into the \n     potential of our nation's brownfields. This economic \n     development could create more than 550,000 new jobs.\n       The Brownfields Economic Development Act and the Brownfield \n     Site Redevelopment Assistance Act improve the ability of the \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the \n     Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration \n     to fund and assist communities in their efforts to develop \n     their brownfields and return them to productive use. We \n     applaud your efforts and look forward to working with you to \n     see the timely passage of these measures.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Don Chen,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           Coalition for Economic Development,\n\n                                                   March 16, 2001.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. James Jeffords,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin and Senator Jeffords: The organizations \n     that comprise the Coalition for Economic Development commend \n     both of you for proposing legislation that will address much-\n     needed redevelopment of brownfields.\n       The establishment within the Economic Development \n     Administration of a revolving loan fund especially devoted to \n     brownfields will quickly increase the amount of money ``on \n     the street'' for redevelopment. EDA has a highly successful \n     track record in operating a revolving loan fund that has put \n     millions of dollars into business development in low-income \n     urban and rural areas and has leveraged millions more.\n       The requirement to develop a comprehensive economic \n     development strategy will guarantee that different \n     constituents within a community are given a voice in \n     redevelopment planning.\n       The changes you propose in the Department of House and \n     Urban Development's Section 108 will encourage greater use of \n     this program since it does not tie up future Community \n     Development Block Grant funding that is equally needed for \n     other purposes.\n       Together, the EDA revolving fund and the HUD grant program \n     will provide local governments, regional councils and non-\n     profits with excellent programs to help redevelop these \n     unutilized and underutilized areas that have become eye-sores \n     that have hindered revitalization in many urban and rural \n     areas. Brownfields redevelopment helps turn those eye-sores \n     into homes, businesses, parks and active commercial \n     districts.\n       Please feel free to contact any members of the coalition. A \n     list of contacts is attached.\n\n\n                              Contact list\n\n       Beverly Nykwest, chair, Director of Policy, National \n     Association of Regional Councils, (202) 457-0710, ext. 20; e-\n     mail: nykwest\n       Paul Kalomiris, Legislative Director, Council for Urban \n     Economic Development, National Association of Installation \n     Developers, (202) 223-4735, e-mail: \n     pkalomiris@urbandevelopment.com.\n\n[[Page S6611]]\n\n       Carol Wayman, Director, Policy Research & Development, \n     National Congress for Community Economic Development, (202) \n     289-9020, ext. 112, cwayman@ncced.org.\n       Cassandra Matthews, Legislative Assistant, National \n     Association of Counties, (202) 942-4204, e-mail: \n     cmatthew@naco.org.\n       Scott Shrum, Legislative Assistant, National League of \n     Cities, (202) 626-3020, e-mail: shrum@nlc.org.\n       Tom Halicki, Executive Director, National Association of \n     Towns and Townships, (202) 624-3553, e-mail: \n     thalicki@sso.org.\n       Eugene Lowe, U.S. Conference of Mayors, (202) 293-7330, e-\n     mail: elowe@usmayors.org.\n       Laura Marshall, Legislative Representative National \n     Association of Development Organizations, (202) 624-8177, e-\n     mail: lmarshall@nado.org.\n       Dinah Atkins, President and CEO, National Business \n     Incubator Association, (740) 593-4331, e-mail: \n     datkins@nbia.org.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, \nSenator Levin, in introducing two legislative initiatives that will \nexpand upon the resources available for brownfields revitalization.\n  The first bill, the Brownfields Site Redevelopment Assistance Act of \n2001, provides the Department of Commerce's Economic Development \nAdministration (EDA) with a dedicated source of funding for \nbrownfields. EDA can currently assist communities with brownfields \nredevelopment when these projects involve infrastructure development or \neconomic adjustment activities, however there is no specific authority \nor funding for brownfields revitalization.\n  The second bill, the Brownfields Economic Development Act of 2001, \naddresses requirements on the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment's, HUD, Brownfields Economic Development Initiative, BEDI, \ngrant program that are hampering small city brownfields revitalization \nefforts. BEDI's required link to Section 108 loan guarantees demands \nthat future Community Development Block Grant, CDBG, allocations be \npledged as collateral. BEDI's required link to Section 108 serves as a \ndeterrent to many small towns in Vermont and throughout the nation, who \ndo not have the resources to commit to brownfields. Our bill would \npermit HUD to make grants available independent of economic development \nloan guarantees. The legislation also provides a 30 percent set aside \nfor small communities and federally-recognized Indian tribes.\n  This legislation would help communities in Vermont reclaim their \nolder underutilized sites. A prime example is an old mill in the heart \nof Ludlow, VT which occupies 30,000 square feet of prime downtown land. \nIt is next to residential properties and again, ripe for redevelopment. \nThere are currently Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, funds for \nassessment to investigate what is in the ground and how much it will \ncost to clean up. But the owner, the bank and the town are reluctant to \nact if the site is contaminated. These bills will assist many small \ntowns such as Ludlow access the clean up funding they need to \nrevitalize contaminated sites.\n  Since the inception of the Senate Smart Growth Task Force in 1999, \nSenator Levin and I as co-chairs, have been working to expand funding \nsources for brownfields. This legislation is just one component of the \noverall effort to restore brownfield sites to productive use in our \ncities and towns. By advancing this legislation, we will address a \ncritical gap in brownfields' funding for site assessment and clean up, \nwhile promoting economic development as well as preservation of \nfarmland and open space.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues--Senator \nJeffords, Senator Levin and others--in co-sponsoring the Brownfields \nSite Redevelopment Assistance Act and the Brownfields Economic \nDevelopment Act.\n  These two Acts are important complements to S. 350, the Brownfields \nRevitalization and Environmental Restoration Act of 2001 that the \nSenate passed unanimously earlier this year. S. 350 encourages the \nremediation of brownfield sites by reducing financial and legal \nbarriers to clean-up. The Brownfields Site Redevelopment Assistance Act \nand the Brownfields Economic Development Act expand the abilities of \nthe Economic Development Administration and the Department of Housing \nand Urban Development to help local communities physically develop and \nrestore brownfield sites to productive use. Taken together, these three \nbills make up a complete brownfields redevelopment package.\n  The two Acts introduced today will provide critical economic and \ntechnical assistance to communities during all stages of the \nbrownfields redevelopment process--from an initial site assessment to \nputting the finishing touches on a new apartment building or city park. \nThese bills have enormous potential to enhance and revitalize \ncommunities and their economies, to turn neglected wastelands into \nproductive developments, and to create more parks and open spaces. This \nin turn will create great opportunities for new jobs and economic \ndevelopment. This is particularly true in my State of Montana where \nwe've been working hard to jump start our economy. Montana's industrial \npast has left the State with its share of brownfield sites--wood \ntreatment facilities, railroad yards, sawmills. Hopefully, this \nlegislation will provide communities with the tools they need to put \nthese sites to productive uses.\n  The Brownfields Site Redevelopment Assistance Act of 2001 will \nprovide the Economic Development Administration with authority and \nfunding for grants to States, local communities, Indian tribes and non-\nprofit organizations for brownfield redevelopment projects. The \nBrownfields Economic Development Act of 2001 will make HUD Brownfields \nEconomic Development Initiative grants available to local governments \nand Indian tribes for community development projects. The bill will \nalso provide a 30 percent set-aside for small communities and tribes, a \nprovision that is very important to a rural State like Montana. The \nNational Association of Development Organizations reports that Federal \nagencies are not reaching rural areas through existing brownfields \nprograms. Rural communities and tribes in Montana and elsewhere need \nfinancial and technical assistance to include brownfields in economic \ndevelopment strategies.\n  Getting brownfield sites cleaned-up makes good sense in Montana and \nthroughout the nation. That, again, is good for the environment, good \nfor communities, good for our economy, and good for the country. I \nwholeheartedly support this legislation, and I hope both bills will \nenjoy swift passage through the Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CLELAND:\n  S. 1080. A bill to amend chapter 84 of title 5, United States Code, \nto provide that employees who retire as registered nurses under the \nFederal Employees Retirement System shall have unused sick leave used \nin the computation of annuities, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President. Statistics from the National League of \nNursing and the American Nurses' Association demonstrate the nursing \nworkforce is shrinking. The Federal health sector, employing \napproximately 45,000 nurses, may be the hardest hit in the near future \nwith an estimated 47 percent of its nursing workforce eligible for \nretirement in the year 2004. Current and anticipated nursing vacancies \nin Federal health care agencies are particularly alarming with the \nincreased nursing care needs of an aging America. The Journal of the \nAmerican Medical Association published a study last year which found \nthe average age of the nursing workforce rose by 4.5 years between 1983 \nand 1998, mostly because fewer younger people are joining the \nprofession.\n  It is imperative that the Federal Health Care System recruit and \nretain nurses in such crucial areas as the Veterans Affairs Health \nAdministration, Department of Defense, Public Health Service, Indian \nHealth Service, and Federal Bureau of Prisons. Nursing shortages will \nresult in major changes in the quality and type of care these agencies \ncan provide to their beneficiaries. There are no quick fixes to \nrecruiting and retaining registered nurses, but Congress must act now \non identified problem areas. One identified measure which would help \nrecruit and retain Federal nurses is to address employee benefits. \nTitle 38 currently excludes nurses employed by the Federal health care \nsystem after 1983 from including unused sick leave in computation of \nretirement. Approximately 68 percent of the Federal nurses are enrolled \nin the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS). My proposal\n\n[[Page S6612]]\n\nwould allow registered nurses under FERS to include unused sick leave \nin the same manner as nurses enrolled in the Civilian Retirement \nSystem, (CRS), for computation of retirement benefits. Under CRS \nregulations, unused sick leave time is added after all of the required \nretirement criteria are met. With my proposal, registered nurses who \nhave accrued the needed increments of sick leave will retain their hard \nearned benefit as part of their retirement package.\n  Nurses played a crucial role in my recovery from injuries incurred in \nVietnam. I can not imagine how much more difficult that recovery would \nhave been without the skill and compassion of nurses. I urge my Senate \ncolleagues to support this measure as we continue to look at strategies \nto prevent the looming Federal nurse shortage.\n  Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                                S. 1080\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. UNUSED SICK LEAVE INCLUDED IN ANNUITY COMPUTATION \n                   OF REGISTERED NURSES.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Federal \n     Registered Nurse Retirement Adjustment Act of 2001''.\n       (b) Annuity Computation.--Section 8415 of title 5, United \n     States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(i) In computing an annuity under this subchapter, the \n     total service of an employee who retires from the position of \n     a registered nurse on an immediate annuity or dies while \n     employed in that position leaving any survivor entitled to an \n     annuity includes the days of unused sick leave to the credit \n     of that employee under a formal leave system, except that \n     such days shall not be counted in determining average pay or \n     annuity eligibility under this subchapter.''.\n       (c) Deposit Not Required.--Section 8422(d) of title 5, \n     United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(1)'' before ``Under such regulations''; \n     and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(2) Deposit may not be required for days of unused sick \n     leave credited under section 8415(i).''.\n       (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall take effect 60 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act and apply to individuals who separate from service on or \n     after that effective date.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TORRICELLI (for himself and Mr. Dayton):\n  S. 1081. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \nbusiness credit for the development of low-to-moderate income housing \nfor home ownership, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill which \nbuilds on the most well received provisions of the highly successful \nLow to Moderate Income Housing Tax Credit bill, LIHTC, of 1986. The \nevidence is clear that the entrepreneurial spirit that has been \nharnessed over the last 15 years in favor of aggressively addressing \nthe Nation's need for rental housing can and should be channeled in \nresponse to the dire need for affordable single family hosing in urban \nAmerica.\n  Although the economic prosperity enjoyed by this country for a decade \nled to a home ownership rate that has reached levels of nearly 70 \npercent, sadly the rate for central cities is 52 percent. One \nunfortunate reality is that having a good job does not guarantee a \nfamily a decent place to live at an affordable rate. According to one \nreport; ``More than 220,000 teachers, police and public safety officers \nacross the country spend more than half their incomes for housing and \nthe problem is, in fact, getting worse.''\n  Housing experts continually tell us that low homeownership in our \nurban communities is a result of the lack of quality homes to purchase \nand not the lack of potential homeowners. Developers have expressed \nthat the high costs associated with building homes in urban areas have \nacted as a disincentive to developing or redeveloping communities. If \nsupply drives demand as it often does in the case of other commodities \nthen the key to revitalizing neighborhoods that were once jewels is the \nentrepreneural spirit to build homes.\n  The use of tax credits to provide a source of capital to dramatically \nincrease the rental housing stock has been a wonderful success. In \nrecent meetings with developers and community development officials in \nmy State of New Jersey, a consistent answer to the question of ``what \ncan we do to spur the development of single family homes'' has been \n``just build on the success of the low income housing tax credit \nprogram''. Using tax incentives for such critical economic development \npurposes, such as overcoming capital market shortages is a proven \nmethod. In that regard, inclusion of certain industry practice \ndevelopment costs in the ``eligible costs'' basis of the property for \ncomputing tax credits and exclusion of the first $10,000 would quite \noften be just enough to keep developers out of the ``red'' in many \nurban communities.\n  In many respects it is only proper that we begin this century \nrecapturing space that once served as home of vibrant neighborhoods and \nbustling businesses since the middle of the 19th century. Certainly, \neffective development of space at the core of our urban centers \nrequires building on the pride of ownership, rehabilitating classic \nstructures that are found in all of our older cities and reclaiming \nland that has served us well.\n  As we move ahead as a nation it is critical that we not leave many of \nour urban communities behind. AHEAD, (Affordable Housing and \nEnvironmental Action through Development), is a sound approach that \ncannot be implemented too soon. I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1081\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nthe expensing of environmental remediation costs; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that is \nintended to build upon a bi-partisan effort that has spanned over a \ndecade culminating with the passage of S. 350. In August of 1997, this \nbody approved a potentially significant brownfield tax incentive. This \ntax incentive referred to as the ``expensing'' provision allowed new \nowners of these contaminated sites to write off clean-up costs from \ntheir taxes in the year they are deducted. Despite this stride forward \nthere have been issues pertaining to the provision that have \nrepresented barriers to re-development efforts.\n  The barriers which have thwarted re-development efforts have been: \n(1) the sunset of the bill contributed to uncertainty associated with \nthe time needed to clean-up, obtain financing and re-develop these \nproperties; (2) the exclusion of petroleum related products and \npesticides from the definition of ``hazardous substances'' which \nrequired that the treatment of these clean up costs as (non-deductable) \ncapital expenditures rather than expenses; and (3) the recapturing as \nordinary income, at the time of sale, qualified environmental \nremediation expenses that have received exemptions.\n  My bill will eliminate the sunset provision. Eliminating the sunset \nfor this expensing provision would be a major stride forward. Obtaining \nsufficient financing for brownfield re-development is generally \ndifficult enough without the specter of a looming sunset.\n  Petroleum products in the form of fuel oil, heating oil or gasoline \nand pesticides are quite often found at these brownfield sites. \nUnfortunately, ``hazardous substance'' as it relates to brownfields \ndoes not include these particular substances. Therefore, the exclusion \nof substances commonly found at brownfields increases the costs of \nbrownfield re-development significantly. This bill will expand the \ndefinition of hazardous items to include petroleum and pesticides.\n  In an effort to give true value to brownfields tax incentives, this \nbill will repeal the recapture provision related to brownfield tax \nincentives, section 193 e. Currently, any qualified environmental \nremediation expenditure which has been deducted is subject to recapture \nas ordinary income when sold or otherwise disposed. Because the tax \nliability for ordinary income is taxed higher, there is no incentive to \nredevelop contaminated sites and then sell the property for beneficial \nuse. The repeal of this exclusion will give developers an opportunity \nto realize their tax incentives if they intend to sell property shortly \nafter redevelopment.\n  The passage of the expensing provisions and the recently passed S. \n350 represent critical steps in enhancing the public/private \npartnership in brownfield re-development but more must be done. An \neffective partnership will utilize tax incentives to help attract \naffordable private investment. Using tax incentives to overcome capital \nshortages, in the marketplace, to achieve greater public benefits, is a \nproven formula for success. This can reverse negative trends and start \nnew constructive trends.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. \n        Inouye):\n  S. 1083. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nexclude clinical social worker services from coverage under the \nMedicare skilled nursing facility prospective payment system; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Clinical \nSocial Work Medicare Equity Act of 2001. I am proud to sponsor this \nlegislation that will ensure that clinical social workers can receive \nMedicare reimbursement for the mental health services they provide in \nskilled nursing facilities. This bill will give clinical social workers \nparity with other mental health providers who are exempted from the \nMedicare Part B Prospective Payment System.\n  Since my first days in Congress, I have been fighting to protect and \nstrengthen the safety net for our Nation's seniors. Making sure that \nseniors have access to quality, affordable mental health care is an \nimportant part of this fight. I know that millions of seniors are not \nreceiving the mental health services they need. For example, depression \neffects nearly 6 million seniors, but only one-tenth ever get treated. \nThis is unacceptable. Protecting seniors' access to clinical social \nworkers can help make sure that our most vulnerable citizens get the \nquality, affordable mental health care they need.\n  Clinical social workers, much like psychologists and psychiatrists, \ntreat and diagnose mental illnesses. In fact, clinical social workers \nare the primary mental health providers for many nursing home \nresidents. But unlike other mental health providers, clinical social \nworkers often cannot bill directly for the important services they \nprovide to their patients. This bill will correct this inequity and \nmake sure clinical social workers are paid for the valuable services \nthey provide.\n  Before the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, clinical social workers \nbilled Medicare Part B directly for mental health services provided in \nnursing facilities to each patient they served. Under the new \nProspective Payment System, services provided by clinical social \nworkers are lumped, or ``bundled,'' along with the services of other \nhealth care providers for the purposes of billing and payments. \nPsychologists and psychiatrists, however, were exempted from this new \nsystem and continue to bill Medicare directly. This bill would exempt \nclinical social workers, like their mental health colleagues, from the \nProspective Payment System, and would make sure that clinical social \nworkers are paid for the services they provide to patients in skilled \nnursing facilities. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits \nImprovement and Protection Act addressed some of these concerns, but \nthis legislation would remove the final barrier to ensuring that \nclinical social workers are treated fairly and equitably for the care \nthey provide.\n  This bill is about more than paperwork and payment procedures. This \nbill is about equal access to Medicare payments for the equal and \nimportant\n\n[[Page S6617]]\n\nwork done by clinical social workers. And it is about making sure our \nNation's most vulnerable citizens have access to quality, affordable \nmental health care. Without clinical social workers, many nursing home \nresidents may never get the counseling they need when faced with \nillness or the loss of a loved one. I think we can do better by our \nNation's seniors, and I'm fighting to make sure we do.\n  The Clinical Social Work Medicare Equity Act of 2001 is strongly \nsupported by the National Association of Social Workers and the \nClinical Social Work Federation. I look forward to the Senate's support \nof this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. DeWine, and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 1084. A bill to prohibit the importation into the United States of \ndiamonds unless the countries exporting the diamonds have in place a \nsystem of controls on rough diamonds, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today, along with \nSenator DeWine and Senator Feingold, to cut off the source of income \nthat is fueling horrendous conflicts in Sierra Leone, Angola, and the \nDemocratic Republic of Congo, the illicit trade in conflict diamonds.\n  The brutal wars in these African Nations may be thousands of miles \naway, but the source of the funds that buy the weapons may be as close \nas your ring finger. Our legislation says, if you can't prove to U.S. \nCustoms agents that your diamonds are legitimate, take your business \nand your diamonds somewhere else.\n  I am pleased that the diamond industry and the human rights community \nare united in their support for this bill. They met many times with our \nstaffs to work out a compromise that everyone is enthusiastically \nsupporting.\n  We can and must do more than look with horror at the pictures of \nchildren with missing hands, arms or legs. We must take a strong stand \nthat says to the world that this nation, which purchases 65 percent of \nthe world's diamonds, will not buy the diamonds that fund rebels and \nterrorists.\n  American consumers who purchase diamonds for some happy milestone in \ntheir lives, like an engagement, wedding, or anniversary, must be \nassured that they are buying a diamond from a legitimate, legal, and \nresponsible source.\n  Setting up a system that would allow American consumers to have \nconfidence that they are buying ``clean'' diamonds would also serve our \nlocal jewelers and diamond retailers.\n  It is hard to imagine today that diamonds could become unfashionable, \nbut if consumers associate diamonds with guerrillas who hack off the \narms of children, instead of the joyous life events that are now \nassociated with the gemstones, the diamond industry in our country \ncould suffer a sharp decline.\n  The jewelers in our local malls and downtown shops do not want to \nsupport rebels and terrorists in Africa any more than consumers do. \nThis legislation aims to protect our local merchants, as well as cut \noff funds to African rebels.\n  I heard from a jeweler in my hometown of Springfield, Illinois, Bruce \nLauer, President of the Illinois Jewelers Association, who wrote:\n\n       The use of diamond profits to fund warfare and atrocities \n     in parts of Africa is abhorrent to all of us. The system \n     created by your bill to bar U.S. imports of conflict stones \n     will allow retail jewelers to be confident that the diamonds \n     and diamond jewelry they sell have no part in the violence \n     and suffering that are prevalent in Sierra Leone, Angola, or \n     other conflict areas.\n       As the owner of Stout & Lauer Jewelers in Springfield, I \n     know first hand the importance of diamonds to my customers. A \n     diamond is a very special purchase symbolizing love, \n     commitment and joy. It should not be tarnished with doubt. . \n     ..We want to be able to assure our customers unequivocally \n     that the diamonds in our stores come from legitimate sources.\n\n  What carnage are these conflicts in Africa causing? The photos of \nmaimed and mutilated men, women, and children in Sierra Leone are the \nmost visible results of the terror tactics by the Revolutionary United \nFront, RUF. This rebel group has also used murder and rape, pressed \nchildren into becoming soldiers, and caused a mass movements of \nrefugees as people flee the terror. The Congressional Research Service \nhas released some conflict-related statistics for the Sierra Leone, \nAngola, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. I would like to repeat \nsome of them for the Record: Out of a population of more than 5 million \npeople, there are approximately 490,000 refugees from Sierra Leone in \nneighboring countries and anywhere from 500,000 to 1.3 million \ninternally displaced people. Estimates of the numbers of people who \nhave died in the conflict range from 20,000 to 50,000. More than 5,000 \nchildren have fought in direct combat roles, with 5,000 more used in \nsupporting roles. There are no figures on how many people lost limbs or \nwere otherwise mutilated, but World Vision reports that there are 2,000 \namputees in just one camp in Freetown.\n  In the long conflicts in Angola and Democratic Republic of Congo, \nDRC, diamonds have been a contributing factor. The United Nations \nrecently issued a report showing that the conflict in the DRC has \nbecome increasingly resource driven, as parties illegally exploit \ndiamonds and other mineral wealth, including tantilite, the mineral now \nin high demands for cell phones and other electronic devices.\n  Last year the United States worked with the international community \nand the diamond industry to stem the flow of conflict diamonds. The \nUnited Nations has taken action to ban the conflict diamond trade and \nrecommended that a ``simple and workable international certification \nscheme for rough diamonds be created.''\n  The United States also participated in May 2000 in the \nTechnical Forum on Diamonds, which became known as the ``Kimberley \nProcess'' after the city in South Africa where the group met, along \nwith representatives from other countries, the diamond industry, and \nnon-governmental organization. The group recommended the establishment \nof an international export regime like the one set up in the bill I \nintroduce today. However, since that time negotiations on setting up \nsuch a system have slowed. I believe that this bill will help spur \naction to complete negotiations and set up a system to track and \ncertify diamond exports.\n\n  The bill that I am introducing today with Senator DeWine and Senator \nFeingold is similar to H.R. 918, introduced by Congressman Tony Hall \nand Congressman Frank Wolf in the House. But our bill also incorporates \nsome changes that represent a compromise that the diamond industry and \nthe human rights community were able to come together to support. The \nbill was also written to be compliant with US obligations in the World \nTrade Organization, WTO.\n  Among other provisions, the bill does the following: The bill \nrequires diamond imports--including rough, polished, and jewelry--to \ncome from a ``clean stream'' and spells out the details of this system \n(which may be superceded by an international agreement if the United \nStates is a party to it). Implementation of any system shall be \nmonitored by US agencies and a presidential advisory commission, which \ninclude human rights advocates and representatives of the diamond \nindustry.\n  Violators will be subject to civil and criminal penalties, including \nconfiscation of contraband. Significant violators' US assets may be \nblocked. Proceeds from penalties and the sale of diamonds seized as \ncontraband shall be used to help war victims, through humanitarian \nrelief and micro-credit development projects.\n  Diamond-sector projects in countries that fail to adopt a system of \ncontrols shall not be eligible for loan guarantees or other assistance \nof the US Export-Import Bank or OPIC.\n  The bill provides waiver authority to the President under limited \ncircumstances, and spells out the process for determining them under \nwhat limited conditions, the President may delay applicability of the \nlaw to a ``cooperating'' country. In issuing such a waiver, the \nPresident must report to Congress on that country's progress toward \nestablishing a system of controls and concluding an international \nagreement. Criteria for determining whether a country is cooperating \nmust be developed with public input.\n  The bill requires no action by the Treasury Secretary or Customs \nService that would contradict the United States' obligations to the \nWorld Trade\n\n[[Page S6618]]\n\nOrganization, as it finds in a dispute proceeding. If another country \nsuccessfully challenges the United States at the WTO, Congress intends \nfor the United States to bring its actions into conformity with its WTO \nobligations.\n  Both the President and the General Accounting Office are to report as \nto the system's effectiveness and on which countries are implementing \nit.\n  The bill encourages the diamond industry to contribute to \nfinancially-strapped African countries that may have difficulty bearing \nthe costs of setting up a system of controls, and authorizes $5 million \nof assistance from the United States to do the same.\n  I ask my colleagues to join with us in cosponsoring the bill we \nintroduce today and take a positive step in ending the bloody violence \nfueled by the sale of conflict diamonds.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE:\n  S. 1085. A bill to provide for the revitalization of Olympic sports \nin the United States; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the foremost responsibility given to \nthe United States Olympic Committee when it was created by Congress is \nto obtain for this country ``the most competent representation possible \nin each event of the Olympic Games.'' However, in too many sports, the \nUSOC is decidedly disadvantaged in achieving that goal. A key reason \nfor the USOC's difficulty is that our colleges and universities are \neliminating many of their teams in those sports each year. Colleges and \nuniversities have been the traditional route to participation in the \nOlympic Games in these non-revenue sports, but many of America's \nprospective participants in the Olympic Games are having opportunities \nblocked as these programs disappear.\n  As a former college wrestler and someone who continues to follow that \nsport closely at the high school and college levels, I have noticed as \nwrestling programs have been discontinued by colleges and universities \nat a high rate in recent years. Too often, this occurs through a \nprocess that leaves student-athletes with few options if they want to \ncontinue wrestling at another institution. As a result of my concerns \nabout wrestling, the sport I know best, I worked with now-Speaker of \nthe House Dennis Hastert to include in the 1998 reauthorization of the \nHigher Education Act a study by the General Accounting Office on \npatterns in the addition and discontinuation of athletic teams at 4-\nyear colleges and universities. The study investigated the forces that \nlead to team additions and discontinuations, as well as the processes \nthrough which discontinuations have occurred. The report from that GAO \nstudy was recently released. It both reaffirms what Speaker Hastert and \nI already knew about the state of college-level wrestling. And it \ndemonstrates that wrestling, where 40 percent of teams have been \ndiscontinued during the past two decades, is not alone. A number of \nmen's and women's sports have experienced a significant net decline in \nthe number of programs during the same period. There has been a 53-\npercent decline in the number of women's gymnastics teams, a 10-percent \nreduction in the number of women's field hockey teams and a 68-percent \ndecline in the number of men's gymnastics programs. Most pertinent is \nthe following fact: 16 of the sports that have lost teams during that \nperiod, which is nearly all the sports that have lost teams, are \nOlympic sports. In light of the Congressional directive contained in \nUSOC's authorizing legislation, a federal response is warranted.\n  Guided by the findings of the recent GAO report, the bill that I \nintroduce today, the Olympic Sports Revitalization Act, seeks to \ncounteract the problems faced by these 16 sports, plus three emerging \nwomen's sports. The first group of 16 sports consists of the following: \nwomen's gymnastics, women's and men's fencing, women's field hockey, \nwomen's and men's archery, women's badminton, men's wrestling, men's \ntennis, men's gymnastics, men's rifle/shooting men's outdoor track, \nmen's swimming, men's skiing, men's ice hockey, and men's water polo. \nAlso covered are the three emerging women's sports: synchronized \nswimming, team handball, and equestrian. The bill would assist in \ndeveloping a competitive American Olympics program that spans the \nspectrum of high- and low-profile sports. Because there is no single, \nshared reason that each of these sports has faced difficulty in recent \nyears, the bill has four sections, each of which seeks to address an \nobstacle to their vitality in the United States.\n  First, the GAO report indicates that in some cases, declining \ninterest in the sports is a key factor in decisions by colleges and \nuniversities to eliminate their programs. We know that those who will \ngo on to become Olympians realize their talent and passion for their \nsport at any early age which means they need to become interested at an \nearly age. Therefore, this bill establishes a grant program to assist \nlocal community-based athletic programs in providing opportunities for \nyoungsters to participate in these sports. The bill authorizes funds \nfor the USOC itself and the national governing bodies in the sports \ncovered by the Act to award grants to community athletic organizations \nto initiate and expand youth sporting opportunities. In particular, it \nencourages a focus on providing such opportunities in communities where \nthe sport has not traditionally been available as an option for young \npersons so that the pool of participants in the sport will expand.\n\n  Of course, relatively few of the young people that will participant \nin these programs will ever become Olympians. But aside from building \ninterest in otherwise declining sports, these programs will provide \nadditional benefits for young men and women. My colleague from Alaska, \nSenator Stevens, for whom the existing Olympic and Amateur Sport Act is \nrightly named, has an ongoing commitment to enhancing the physical \nfitness of Americans. This program offers fitness outlets that can put \nyoung people on a path toward lifelong commitment to exercise and all \nits physical and mental health benefits.\n  As someone who was given the opportunity to develop personally \nthrough the challenge of wrestling, I also know how important \ninvolvement in athletics is at an early age in building character. \nSports help youngsters develop some of the most important skills for \nsuccess in life: the ability to think strategically, the courage to \novercome fears, and the tact of being a good winner and, yes, a good \nloser.\n  I encourage my colleagues to learn more about two existing community \nsports programs that are exactly the type of locally-controlled \nendeavors that this grant program is meant to promote. Peter Westbrook \ngrew up in the projects of Newark, New Jersey. He was lucky enough to \nbe introduced to fencing at an early age and by focusing on that sport, \nhe escaped the desperation of the environment in which he came of age. \nPeter pursued the sport as he became older and he went on to win the \nBronze Medal in Men's Sabre at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles. Seven \nyears later, he began a non-profit program in New York City dedicated \nto helping kids in the five boroughs of New York gain access to the \nbenefits that he has as a youngster in fencing. Over the past decade, \nhundreds of inner-city kids have participated in the program.\n  Like the Peter Westbrook Foundation, the ``Beat the Streets'' program \nbegun in 1999 in inner-city Chicago is a model for the grant program to \nbe established by this legislation. ``Beat the Streets,'' a program \nwith which Speaker Hastert has been involved, focuses on mentoring \nyoungsters who typically would not have access to wrestling training. \nThe youngsters are coached in a number of wrestling techniques, \nconditioning and nutrition. The program also focuses on developing \nsocial and intellectual skills that go beyond the mat. ``Beat the \nStreets'' has grown throughout Chicago and, working in coalition with \nthe YMCA, its advisory board recently began planning the expansion of \nthat program to other cities around the country. I hope that this \nlegislation can plan a role in the expansion of such an outstanding \nprogram.\n  As I mentioned earlier, three women's emerging sports, that is, \nOlympic sports that have not traditionally been an option for women in \nthis country--are also covered by the pertinent sections of this Act. \nThat makes sense because the fact that they are not fully established \nsports means that the USOC faces a particular challenge in developing \nthe most competitive team possible in those sports.\n\n[[Page S6619]]\n\n  The second section of the Olympic Sports Revitalization Act more \ndirect focuses on ensuring participation in the covered sports during \ncollege. It does so by providing funding for scholarships in those \nsports. College and university athletic programs that have discontinued \nthe non-revenue sports covered by this Act also cite budgetary strains \nas a frequent reason for those decisions. While the GAO report cites \nnumerous cased where colleagues and unikversitues have successfully \nmaintained existing sports while adding new sports to meet the \ninterests and needs of women athlete, it is important to realize that \ncolleges and universities do face real financial contraints. This \nportion of the Act would help protect existing non-revenue sports that \nmight otherwise be eliminated. Through this section's provision, the \nUSOC would be authorized to provide 4-year grants of between $25,000 \nand $50,000 annually to college athletic programs to provide \nscholarship to student-athletes participating in the sports covered by \nthe Act. At any one school, a limit of three covered program could be \ngrant recipients at any one time. Schools would be required to maintain \nthe sport to continue to receive the grant money. This Olympic \nRevitalization Scholarship grant program will reinforce the already \nexisting Bart Stupak Olympic Scholarship Program, also in the Higher \nEducation Act, which provides financial assistance to athletes who are \nactually in training for the Olympic Games.\n\n  The bill also seeks to ensure that, as they decide where they will \nattend college, prospective student-athletes will be able accurately to \ngauge the relative health of the sports programs at different schools \nthey may be considering. Present law requires that all 4-year colleges \nand universities with athletic programs report to the Department of \nEducation the number of participants and coaches in all sports, as well \nas further information regarding funding for their teams. This data, \nparticularly when examined over time, gives an excellent picture of the \nhealth of the sport at that college. It also provides insight into the \ncontinued vitality of the program during the period that the \nprospective student-athlete would hope to participate in the sport. The \nproblem is that, while the Department of Education has collected this \nrequired data, it is not readily available to the general public. The \nOlympic Sports Revitalization Act would authorize funds and require \nthat the data over a several year period be posted on the Internet in a \nusable format so that the student-athletes and those involved in their \ncollege decision can have easy access to that information.\n  Finally, one of the most troubling findings in the GAO report is that \nstudent-athletes are, quite often, given no forewarning that their \nsport is being discontinued by the athletic program. They also have no \nmechanism by which to appeal that decision. Generally, such decisions \nby athletic programs go into effect immediately. In addition to defying \nfairness, this reality means that student-athletes often have their \ncollege athletic careers disrupted in a manner that makes it difficult \nto stay on track for post-college amateur competition. The data in the \nGAO report indicates that the stories I have heard about the \ntermination of wrestling programs in my home State of Minnesota and \naround the country are part of a pattern in other similarly situated \nsports. Therefore, the fourth section of the bill requires that \ncolleges and universities provide written justification for a decision \nto discontinue a sport to team members. It also requires that a process \nfor appealing the team's termination be established.\n  We have a responsibility to field ``the most competent \nrepresentation'' possible in the Olympic games. Just as important, we \nshould do all we can to promote the continued vitality of a set of \nsports that have proud traditions I our country and that have provided \nhealth and character-development benefits for thousands of participants \nthrough the years. To quote Pat Zilverberg, a constant guardian of the \nsport of wrestling in my home state, from his letter supporting this \nlegislation: ``The opportunities to develop athletes and, subsequently, \ngood citizens, are at risk.'' This legislation would play a key role in \nrevitalizing these sports and I strongly encourage its adoption.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself and Mr. Torricelli):\n  S. 1086. A bill to amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to \npermanently prohibit the conduct of offshore drilling on the outer \nContinental Shelf in the Mid-Atlantic and North Atlantic planning \nareas; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today, along with Senator Torricelli, I \nam introducing legislation, the Clean Ocean and Safe Tourism, COAST, \nAnti-Drilling Act, to ban oil and gas drilling off the Mid-Atlantic and \nNorthern Atlantic coast.\n  The people of New Jersey, and other residents of States along the \nAtlantic Coast, do not want oil or gas rigs anywhere near their \ntreasured beaches and fishing grounds. Such drilling poses serious \nthreats not to our environment, but to our economy, which depends \nheavily on tourism along our shore.\n  Until recently, there was no reason to suspect that drilling was even \na remote possibility. Since 1982, a statutory moratorium on leasing \nactivities in most Outer Continental Shelf, OCS, areas has been \nincluded annually in Interior Appropriations acts. In addition, \nPresident George H.W. Bush declared a leasing moratorium on many OCS \nareas on June 26, 1990 under section 12 of the OCS Lands Act. On June \n12, 1998, President Clinton used the same authority to issue a \nmemorandum to the Secretary of the Interior that extended the \nmoratorium through 2012 and included additional OCS areas.\n  Given the long-standing consensus against drilling in these areas, I \nwas deeply disturbed to discover that on May 31, 2001, the Minerals \nManagement Service released a request for proposals, RFP, to conduct a \nstudy of the environmental impacts of drilling in the Mid- and North-\nAtlantic. The RFP noted that ``there are areas with some reservoir \npotential, for example off the coast of New Jersey.'' In addition, the \nRFP explained that the study would be conducted ``in anticipation of \nmanaging the exploitation of potential and proven reserves.''\n  I believe that the RFP was not only inappropriate, but probably \nillegal, and I was pleased when it was rescinded yesterday. However, I \nremain concerned about the Administration's policy with respect to \noffshore drilling. Although some Administration officials have \nindicated that they support the existing moratoria on offshore \ndrilling, the President's energy plan and this recent proposed study \ncall the Administration's position into question. I have asked the \nPresident to clarify his position on this issue, and I hope that he \nwill use his authority to endorse the existing moratoria.\n  In my view, however, it is time for Congress to act to resolve this \nquestion once and for all. That is why I am introducing the COAST Anti-\nDrilling Act. This bill would permanently ban drilling for oil, gas and \nother minerals in the Mid- and North-Atlantic.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this important \nlegislation. Doing so would ensure that the people of New Jersey and \nneighboring States that they need not fear the specter of oil rigs off \ntheir beaches.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1086\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Clean Ocean and Safe Tourism \n     Anti-Drilling Act'' or the ``COAST Anti-Drilling Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROHIBITION OF OIL AND GAS LEASING IN CERTAIN AREAS \n                   OF THE OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF.\n\n       Section 8 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 \n     U.S.C. 1337) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(p) Prohibition of Oil and Gas Leasing in Certain Areas \n     of the Outer Continental Shelf.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this section or any other law, the Secretary of \n     the Interior shall not issue a lease for the exploration, \n     development, or production of oil, natural gas, or any other \n     mineral in--\n       ``(1) the Mid-Atlantic planning area; or\n       ``(2) the North Atlantic planning area.''.\n\n[[Page S6620]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/21/senate-section/article/S6603-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6603-S6620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. GRASSLEY.\n  S. 1076. A bill to provide for the review of agriculture mergers and \nacquisitions by the Department of Agriculture and to outlaw unfair \npractices in the agriculture industry, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as most of my colleagues know, \nagriculture is a crucial industry for Iowa. The small, independent \nfamily farmer is an important thread which holds together my State's \ncultural, economic and social fabric. In fact, the family farmer is one \nof the best things about Iowa's heritage. My colleagues are well aware \nthat I'm committed to preserving and supporting this valuable member of \nIowa's communities.\n  Agriculture is a risky business. I know that from personal \nexperience, I've lived and worked on a farm all my life. But these \ndays, farmers feel especially vulnerable. ``Merger-mania'' has been \nrunning rampant, with large companies joining forces to create new \nbusiness giants in every sector of the economy, including agriculture.\n  The agriculture sector has witnessed a number of mega-mergers and \nalliances affecting grain and livestock. And the independent producer \nis seeing fewer choices of who to buy from and who to sell to. More and \nmore family farmers and independent producers are feeling the pressure \nand impact of concentration in agriculture. Good men and women who have \nfarmed for years and years are going out of business. Yet, the \nindependent farmer is one of the most efficient businessman in our \nNation's economy. That's why the United States can feed itself and a \ngood portion of the world.\n  I've said before that I am not of the belief that all mergers are in \nand of themselves wrong or unfair to family farmers. But we need to \nmake sure that open and fair access to the marketplace is preserved for \neveryone. We need to make sure that large businesses are not acting in \na predatory or anti-competitive manner. We need to make sure that \nfamily farmers and independent producers can compete on a level playing \nfield. That's how we can keep our economy strong, our agricultural \ncommunity vibrant and competitive, and our consumers happy.\n  Now we've heard that a Delaware Court has ordered Tyson Foods and IBP \nto resume their merger discussions, because Tyson Foods did not have a \ncontractually permissible reason to terminate its merger agreement with \nIBP when it announced in March that it was rescinding the transaction. \nWhile I do not want to take issue with the court's findings, I am \nconcerned about the fact that this merger looks like it will go through \nand, consequently, the meat industry will consolidate even further. \nBeginning last September when Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette/Rawhide \nHoldings Corporation, then Smithfield Foods, and finally Tyson Foods \nstarted a bidding war for IBP, I pushed the Justice Department to \ncarefully scrutinize each possible business combination. In January, I \nwrote the Justice Department urging it to vigorously review the Tyson-\nIBP transaction from all angles, and to consult with the Agriculture \nDepartment to better ascertain the ramifications of such a merger on \nfamily farmers and independent producers. I would have thought that a \ncombination of the Nation's largest poultry producer with the world's \nlargest producer of beef and pork products would result in \nsignificantly reduced market opportunities, as well as increased the \npossibility of anti-competitive business practices. I shared the \nconcerns of many farmers and producers that this transaction would \nadversely impact their ability to obtain fair prices for their \nproducts. I was also concerned that a combined IBP-Tyson presence in \nthe retail market would negatively affect product choice and the prices \nconsumers pay at the meat counter.\n  But the Justice Department determined earlier this year that the \npotential negative impact on competition was insufficient to sustain an \ninjunction against the merger under the antitrust laws. Because the \nJustice Department completed its antitrust review in January, I \nunderstand that there is nothing further for the Department to do in \nterms of an antitrust review if the parties re-engage their merger \ntalks in due course and without changes to the transaction. But I \nremain seriously concerned about the impact this merger will have on \nour farm community and I hope that, if this merger is ultimately \ncompleted, the Justice Department will carefully monitor whether a \nmerged IBP-Tyson will have unintended consequences on competition in \nthe meat economy and, if it does, take appropriate action.\n  Nevertheless, this development re-energizes my gut feeling that we \nneed to somehow change the way ag mergers are reviewed and approved. \nSo, today I'm re-introducing a bill I authored last year, the \n``Agriculture Competition Enhancement Act,'' to help address some of \nthe competition concerns of America's family farmers and independent \nproducers. My bill will refocus the merger review process as it \npertains to agri-business, and will enhance the Department of \nAgriculture's ability to address anti-competitive activity in \nagriculture. I believe that bringing to the table a greater \nunderstanding of ag producers' needs when ag mergers are reviewed is \nthe biggest missing element to making the merger review process as fair \nas possible. Closing this gap is the heart of my proposal.\n  Several provisions in the ``Agriculture Competition Enhancement Act'' \nare based on proposals by the American Farm Bureau, the largest \norganization representing producers of agricultural commodities. \nHowever, I'd like to briefly discuss what I believe to be the most \nimportant components of this bill: the enhancement of the Department of \nAgriculture's role in the Hart-Scott-Rodino review process, the \ncreation of a new ``impact on family farmers and independent \nproducers'' standard of review by the Department of Agriculture for ag \nmergers, and the expansion of the Department of Agriculture's ability \nto take regulatory and enforcement action with respect to anti-\ncompetitive and unfair practices in the agricultural sector.\n\n  Far more than the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission, \nthe Department of Agriculture has extraordinary knowledge and expertise \nin agricultural matters. The Department of Agriculture formulates ag \npolicy for the Nation, and works closely with the farm community about \ntheir various concerns. So, I believe that the Department of \nAgriculture is the office that can best assess the true impact of ag \nmergers and other business transactions on farmers, ranchers and \nindependent producers. That is why my bill seeks to expand and enhance \nthe role that the Department of Agriculture plays in the antitrust \nreview of ag mergers.\n  Currently, when the Justice Department or the Federal Trade \nCommission assesses a proposed merger, the focus of their analysis is \nweighted heavily toward the impact of the transaction on consumers. \nHowever, agriculture is unique. The antitrust laws already recognize \nthis with the ag cooperative exception. But I believe we need to go \nfurther by requiring the Justice Department and Federal Trade \nCommission to specifically take into account the effect ag mergers have \non family\n\n[[Page S6604]]\n\nfarmers and producers. The ``Agriculture Competition Enhancement Act'' \nwould do just that by requiring the Department of Agriculture to \nconduct an assessment of how a proposed ag transaction will affect \nfamily farmers and independent producers and their access to the \nmarket.\n  I realize that presently the Justice Department and Federal Trade \nCommission informally consult with the Department of Agriculture when \nthey consider ag mergers. But I believe that the current process does \nnot sufficiently ensure that the farm community's concerns are being \nadequately addressed. The approach I advocate will ensure that \nproducers' concerns and needs are fully discussed when federal agencies \nexamine proposed ag business mergers. By guaranteeing inclusion and \nopenness for family farmers and independent producers, we can go a long \nway toward alleviating their understandable anxiety about an \nincreasingly concentrated industry.\n  So my bill requires the Department of Agriculture to do a merger \nreview that focuses on the needs of producers by examining whether the \ntransaction would cause substantial harm to farmers' ability to compete \nin the marketplace. This review would be conducted simultaneously with \nthe Justice Department's antitrust review, in order to minimize \ndisruption to the current merger review process. Further, my bill \nencourages the parties and the Department of Agriculture to resolve \nconcerns about the proposed merger during this timeframe. If its \nconcerns are not satisfied, the Department of Agriculture has the \nability to challenge the merger in federal court to either stop the \nmerger, or to impose appropriate conditions or limitations on the \nproposed transaction.\n  Recognizing that the Department of Agriculture needs to have an \nindividual who will perform this new antitrust responsibility, my bill \ncalls for the creation of a Special Counsel for Competition Matters at \nthe Department of Agriculture. My bill also provides for increased \nfunding for competition matters, and authorizes additional specialized \nstaff--including antitrust attorneys and economists--at the Justice \nDepartment and Department of Agriculture, to ensure that these agencies \nhave the appropriate resources to accomplish the goals of this \nlegislation.\n  Furthermore, under my bill, the competition protection authorities of \nthe Department of Agriculture's Packers and Stockyards Division are \nextended to include anti-competitive practices by dealers, processors \nand commission merchants of all ag commodities. This expanded \nauthority, based on provisions in the current Packers and Stockyards \nAct, will give the Department of Agriculture an increased ability to \nlook at unfair, deceptive and predatory business practices by all ag \nbusinesses, not just packers and poultry farmers.\n  As my colleagues from rural States know, ag concentration is one of \nthe most important issues in agriculture today. Other members here in \nCongress have introduced bills or are presently working to craft their \nown legislative proposals to respond to the concerns of America's \nfarmers. I want it to be clearly understood that it is my desire to \nwork with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, as well as the Bush \nAdministration, so that we can make meaningful progress on this issue. \nI know that my proposal has its critics, but I am willing and ready to \nlisten to their concerns and work on constructive changes to my bill. \nBut I truly hope that we can achieve a bipartisan compromise sooner \nrather than later on this issue, so we can calm farmers' fears about \nhigh levels of ag concentration.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1076\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The Secretary may modify his findings as to the \n     facts, or make new findings, by reason of the additional \n     evidence so taken, and the Secretary shall file such modified \n     or new findings and his recommendations, if any, for the \n     modifications or setting aside of his order, with the return \n     of such additional evidence.\n       (7) Injunction.--If the court of appeals affirms or \n     modifies the order of the Secretary, its decree shall operate \n     as an injunction to restrain the dealer, processor, \n     commission merchant, or broker, and his officers, directors, \n     agents, and employees from violating the provisions of such \n     order or such order as modified.\n       (8) Finality.--The court of appeals shall have \n     jurisdiction, which upon the filing of the record with it \n     shall be exclusive, to review, and to affirm, set aside, or \n     modify, such orders of the Secretary, and the decree of such \n     court shall be final except that it shall be subject to \n     review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon \n     certiorari, as provided in section 1254 of title 28, United \n     States Code, if such writ is duly applied for within 60 days \n     after entry of the decree. The issue of such writ shall not \n     operate as a stay of the decree of the court of appeals, \n     insofar as such decree operates as an injunction unless so \n     ordered by the Supreme Court.\n       (d) Punishment for Violation of Order.--Any dealer, \n     processor, commission merchant, or broker, or any officer, \n     director, agent, or employee of a dealer, processor, \n     commission merchant, or broker, who fails to obey any order \n     of the Secretary issued under the provisions of subsection \n     (b), or such order as modified--\n       (1) after the expiration of the time allowed for filing a \n     petition in the court of appeals to set aside or modify such \n     order, if no such petition has been filed within such time;\n       (2) after the expiration of the time allowed for applying \n     for a writ of certiorari, if such order, or such order as \n     modified, has been sustained by the court of appeals and no \n     such writ has been applied for within such time; or\n       (3) after such order, or such order as modified, has been \n     sustained by the courts as provided in subsection (c);\n\n     shall on conviction be fined not less than $500 nor more than \n     $10,000, or imprisoned for not less than 6 months nor more \n     than 5 years, or both.

A bill to amend the Public Works and Economic Development \nAct of 1965 to provide assistance to communities for the redevelopment \nof brownfield sites; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am introducing today, along with Senator \nJeffords, as co-chairmen of the Senate Smart Growth Task Force, two \nbills to help communities expedite the economic redevelopment of \nbrownfields. These bills are complementary to S. 350 which we strongly \nsupport. Brownfields are abandoned, idled, or under-used industrial and \ncommercial properties where expansion or redevelopment is complicated \nby real or perceived environmental contamination. More than 450,000 of \nthese sites taint our nation's landscape, inhibiting economic \ndevelopment and posing a threat to human health and the environment. \nUndeveloped, or underdeveloped, brownfields blight communities forcing \ndevelopment onto greenfields. But redeveloped, these sites offer new \nopportunities for businesses, housing and green space. Brownfields \nredevelopment is a fiscally-sound way to bring investment back to \nneglected neighborhoods, cleanup the environment, reuse existing \ninfrastructure that is already paid for, utilize existing markets and \nlabor pools, and relieve development pressure on our urban fringe and \nfarmlands.\n  My home State of Michigan is a national leader in brownfields \nredevelopment. Michigan communities are reclaiming brownfields in urban \ncenters, towns and villages, ensuring that natural areas and \ngreenspaces are less likely to succumb to sprawl when there are \nbrownfield properties available to meet development needs. The City of \nKalamazoo has leveraged $28 million in private investment and created \nover 200 jobs through its brownfields redevelopment program. The city \nhas fully completed development of 4 sites and played a role in the \nredevelopment of 16 properties, creating new opportunities for \ncommercial and industrial development. The City of St. Ignace, a small \ncommunity in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, successfully redeveloped \na former railroad property into a community recreation building and \nconference center. The project, built jointly by the Sault Ste. Marie \nChippewa Indian Tribe and the City of St. Ignace, created jobs and has \nthe potential of stimulating additional year-round tourist activities \nwhere seasonal unemployment rates range between 20-25 percent during \nthe winter months.\n  At the Federal level, we need to support local communities and States \nin their efforts to reclaim brownfields by providing economic \ndevelopment resources to revitalize these sites. The two bills I am \nintroducing today will aid cities like Kalamazoo and St. Ignace in \ntheir efforts to promote social well-being and create economic vitality \nby redeveloping brownfields.\n  The first bill, the Brownfield Site Redevelopment Assistance Act of \n2001, creates a new program within the Department of Commerce's \nEconomic Development Administration, EDA, to provide targeted \nassistance for projects that redevelop brownfield sites. The Act would \nprovide EDA with a dedicated source of funding for brownfields \nredevelopment and increased funding flexibility to help States, local \ncommunities, Indian tribes and nonprofit organizations restore these \nsites to productive use. This bill would provide EDA with the authority \nto facilitate effective economic development planning for reuse; \ndevelop the infrastructure necessary to prepare brownfield sites for \nre-entry into the market; and, provide the capital necessary to support \nnew business development on brownfields. The bill provides $60 million \neach year for FY2002 to FY2006.\n  The second bill, the Brownfields Economic Development Act of 2001, \nwould allow the Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, to \nmake existing Brownfields Economic Development Initiative, BEDI, grants \nmore easily available to units of general local government and \nfederally-recognized Indian tribes by permitting the Department to make \nthese grants independent of economic development loan guarantees. The \nbill also provides funding for small communities, known as \nnonentitlement areas, and federally-recognized Indian tribes.\n  BEDI grants can help communities redevelop brownfields by providing \nlocal governments with a flexible source of funding to pursue \nbrownfields redevelopment through land acquisition, site preparation, \neconomic development and other activities. Currently, BEDI grants are \nrequired to support economic development loan guarantees known as \nSection 108 loan guarantees. To be eligible for these funds, a local \ncommunity or State must pledge Community Development Block Grant, CDBG, \nfunds as partial collateral for the loan guarantee. This requirement is \na significant barrier to many local communities that need assistance to \nrevitalize brownfields, but are unable to pledge these funds. This bill \nwould allow HUD to make BEDI grants independent of economic development \nloan guarantees, providing critical financial assistance to leverage \nprivate sector investment in brownfields.\n\n  Many organizations support these bills, including: (1) the Council \nfor Urban Economic Development, (2) Enterprise Foundation, (3) National \nAssociation of Business Incubators, (4) National Association of \nCounties, (5) National Association of Development Organizations, (6) \nNational Association of Installation Developers, (7) National \nAssociation of Regional Councils, (8) National Association of Towns and \nTownships, (9) National Congress for Community Economic Development, \n(10) National League of Cities, (11) Smart Growth America, and (12) \nUnited States Conference of Mayors. Brownfields affect urban, rural and \nNative American communities. In urban areas, the U.S. Conference of \nMayors, USCM, estimates that brownfields redevelopment could generate \nmore than 550,000 additional jobs and up to $2.4 billion in new tax \nrevenues in over one hundred cities surveyed. The cities surveyed by \nthe USCM reported that lack of funding for redevelopment and liability \nproblems arising from Superfund are the major obstacles to reuse. In \nrural areas it is easy to ``leap frog'' over brownfields to abundant \nopen space. The National Association of Development Organizations, \nNADO, in a report on reclaiming rural America's brownfields found that \nFederal agencies are not reaching rural areas through existing \nbrownfields programs, and rural communities need financial and \ntechnical assistance to include brownfields in economic development \nstrategies. Indian tribes face a legacy of contamination from former \nagricultural, industrial and commercial facilities. The Environmental \nProtection Agency estimates that nationwide there are 1,645 facilities \nlocated on tribal lands and 6,982 facilities located within three miles \nof tribal lands. Nationally, State brownfields programs have \nfacilitated reuse of more than 40,000 sites, but this is less than 10 \npercent of the estimated 450,000 brownfields nationwide. A report of \nthe National Governors Association stated that assessment and cleanup \nof brownfields are only part of the process, equally important is \nphysical development of these sites. These two bills would provide the \nfinancial resources to help communities and states\n\n[[Page S6608]]\n\nrealize new private investment and tax revenues from the redevelopment \nof brownfields, and would assist EDA and HUD to reach rural towns and \nIndian tribes to support their reuse efforts.\n  The two bills that Senator Jeffords and I are introducing will \ncomplement the resources and liability clarifications provided in S. \n350, and together these three bills will provide communities with the \nfinancial assistance needed to leverage private investment in \nbrownfields and accelerate reuse. Providing economic development \nresources through HUD and EDA can stimulate brownfields economic \ndevelopment by leveraging private investment into communities, and can \ngive communities the financial resources and technical assistance they \nneed to turn brownfield environmental liabilities into economic assets.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the two bills and letters of \nsupport be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1078\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1.

Carl Levin,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: The Enterprise Foundation commends you \n     for introducing with Senator Jeffords the ``Brownfield Site \n     Redevelopment Assistance Act of 2001'' and the ``Brownfields \n     Economic Development Act of 2001.'' Enterprise strongly \n     support these two bills.\n       Enterprise is a national nonprofit organization that raises \n     resources and channels them to grassroots at the local level \n     for affordable housing, economic development and other \n     community revitalization initiatives in distressed urban and \n     rural neighborhoods nationwide. Central to our mission is \n     generating investment in areas suffering from blight, neglect \n     and disinvestment. Brownfields are prime examples of such \n     areas.\n       Enterprise is engaged in several large-scale brownfield \n     redevelopment efforts around the country. Targeted incentives \n     such as your bills provide would enable Enterprise and others \n     in the private sector to convert more brownfields to \n     productive uses.\n       By spurring brownfields redevelopment, your bills direct \n     limited public resources to places that already benefit from \n     existing infrastructure and promote economic investment where \n     it is needed most. The bills epitomize smart growth and \n     comprehensive community development principles.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             F.

Carl Levin,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. James Jeffords,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin and Senator Jeffords: The National \n     Association of Counties (NACo) commends both of your efforts \n     in offering bipartisan legislation to address the \n     redevelopment of brownfields.\n       NACo advocates for the redevelopment of these sites, in \n     both urban and rural counties, as a component of a county's \n     broader interest in achieving sustainable development on a \n     regional basis. Redevelopment of abandoned or underutilized \n     sites can stimulate economic revitalization in the \n     surrounding areas, and preserve green space by providing an \n     alternative to unchecked urban sprawl. Therefore, NACo \n     strongly supports language mandating the development of a \n     comprehensive economic development strategy.\n       We applaud your efforts to provide assistance for \n     redevelopment projects that promote the redevelopment, \n     restoration and economic recovery of brownfield sites. \n     Furthermore, NACo supports the legislative objective of \n     bringing new income and private investment to distressed \n     communities that have not fully participated in the \n     nationwide economic expansion. This legislation is closely \n     aligned with NACo policy objectives, and we offer our support \n     during the legislative process.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this important issue. \n     Please feel free to contact Cassandra Matthews, Associate \n     Legislative Director, at (202) 942-4204 if you need \n     additional information or assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Larry E.

Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: On behalf of the National Association \n     of Development Organizations (NADO), I am writing to express \n     our strong support for your efforts to enhance and support \n     the Economic Development Administration's (EDA's) brownfields \n     redevelopment activities.\n       As a national association representing regional planning \n     and development organizations that provide valuable \n     professional and technical assistance to over 1,800 counties \n     and 15,000 small cities and towns, we recognize the value and \n     benefits of returning former commercial and industrial sites \n     to productive use. This includes targeting sites in small \n     metropolitan and rural America, as well as our urban centers.\n       In addition to being encouraged and supportive of \n     congressional efforts to strengthen the Environmental \n     Protection Agency's (EPA's) brownfields portfolio, we also \n     recognize the unique tools and experience that EDA has to \n     offer local communities. While EPA has implemented effective \n     assessment and clean up programs, there is a tremendous need \n     for federal programs focused on redeveloping and transforming \n     the former brownfields sites into productive facilities.\n       Over the past 35 years, EDA has developed a successful \n     track record in partnering with local communities to \n     revitalize, upgrade and expand former commercial sites into \n     industrial facilities that help create quality jobs, expand \n     the local tax base and improve the quality of life in the \n     area. This includes making the necessary investments in \n     infrastructure, as well as providing essential planning and \n     technical assistance.\n       EDA has also proven to be an effective federal partner for \n     EPA, with the two federal agencies leveraging their funding \n     and particular expertise to assist communities. Therefore, we \n     strongly support your efforts to provide EDA with the \n     resources and program tools needed to help small metropolitan \n     and rural communities convert brownfields into economic \n     development opportunities.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Aliceann Wohlbruck,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         Smart Growth America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 4, 2001.\n     Hon. James Jeffords,\n     Co-Chair, Senate Smart Growth Task Force, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Co-Chair, Senate Smart Growth Task Force, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Jeffords and Senator Levin: Smart Growth \n     America would like to thank you for your leadership on the \n     introduction of the Brownfields Economic Development Act of \n     2001 and the Brownfields Site Redevelopment Assistance Act of \n     2001. We strongly support these bills and your efforts to \n     complement the Brownfields Revitalization and Environmental \n     Restoration Act of 2001 by focusing on the physical \n     redevelopment of brownfields.\n       S. 350 provides needed liability relief and funding to \n     inventory, assess and remediate brownfield sites. These two \n     new bills build upon S. 350 by providing communities with \n     additional economic development resources to return \n     brownfields to productive use.\n       Economic development of brownfield sites is an essential \n     element of smart growth--growth that revitalizes \n     neighborhoods, creates and preserves affordable housing, \n     promotes transportation choice, and preserves open space and \n     farmland. And, it makes economic sense. The U.S. Conference \n     of Mayors found that as much as $2.4 billion annually could \n     be generated in new tax revenues by fully tapping into the \n     potential of our nation's brownfields. This economic \n     development could create more than 550,000 new jobs.\n       The Brownfields Economic Development Act and the Brownfield \n     Site Redevelopment Assistance Act improve the ability of the \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the \n     Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration \n     to fund and assist communities in their efforts to develop \n     their brownfields and return them to productive use. We \n     applaud your efforts and look forward to working with you to \n     see the timely passage of these measures.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Don Chen,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           Coalition for Economic Development,\n\n                                                   March 16, 2001.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. James Jeffords,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin and Senator Jeffords: The organizations \n     that comprise the Coalition for Economic Development commend \n     both of you for proposing legislation that will address much-\n     needed redevelopment of brownfields.\n       The establishment within the Economic Development \n     Administration of a revolving loan fund especially devoted to \n     brownfields will quickly increase the amount of money ``on \n     the street'' for redevelopment. EDA has a highly successful \n     track record in operating a revolving loan fund that has put \n     millions of dollars into business development in low-income \n     urban and rural areas and has leveraged millions more.\n       The requirement to develop a comprehensive economic \n     development strategy will guarantee that different \n     constituents within a community are given a voice in \n     redevelopment planning.\n       The changes you propose in the Department of House and \n     Urban Development's Section 108 will encourage greater use of \n     this program since it does not tie up future Community \n     Development Block Grant funding that is equally needed for \n     other purposes.\n       Together, the EDA revolving fund and the HUD grant program \n     will provide local governments, regional councils and non-\n     profits with excellent programs to help redevelop these \n     unutilized and underutilized areas that have become eye-sores \n     that have hindered revitalization in many urban and rural \n     areas. Brownfields redevelopment helps turn those eye-sores \n     into homes, businesses, parks and active commercial \n     districts.\n       Please feel free to contact any members of the coalition.

Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, \nSenator Levin, in introducing two legislative initiatives that will \nexpand upon the resources available for brownfields revitalization.\n  The first bill, the Brownfields Site Redevelopment Assistance Act of \n2001, provides the Department of Commerce's Economic Development \nAdministration (EDA) with a dedicated source of funding for \nbrownfields. EDA can currently assist communities with brownfields \nredevelopment when these projects involve infrastructure development or \neconomic adjustment activities, however there is no specific authority \nor funding for brownfields revitalization.\n  The second bill, the Brownfields Economic Development Act of 2001, \naddresses requirements on the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment's, HUD, Brownfields Economic Development Initiative, BEDI, \ngrant program that are hampering small city brownfields revitalization \nefforts. BEDI's required link to Section 108 loan guarantees demands \nthat future Community Development Block Grant, CDBG, allocations be \npledged as collateral. BEDI's required link to Section 108 serves as a \ndeterrent to many small towns in Vermont and throughout the nation, who \ndo not have the resources to commit to brownfields. Our bill would \npermit HUD to make grants available independent of economic development \nloan guarantees. The legislation also provides a 30 percent set aside \nfor small communities and federally-recognized Indian tribes.\n  This legislation would help communities in Vermont reclaim their \nolder underutilized sites. A prime example is an old mill in the heart \nof Ludlow, VT which occupies 30,000 square feet of prime downtown land. \nIt is next to residential properties and again, ripe for redevelopment. \nThere are currently Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, funds for \nassessment to investigate what is in the ground and how much it will \ncost to clean up. But the owner, the bank and the town are reluctant to \nact if the site is contaminated. These bills will assist many small \ntowns such as Ludlow access the clean up funding they need to \nrevitalize contaminated sites.\n  Since the inception of the Senate Smart Growth Task Force in 1999, \nSenator Levin and I as co-chairs, have been working to expand funding \nsources for brownfields. This legislation is just one component of the \noverall effort to restore brownfield sites to productive use in our \ncities and towns. By advancing this legislation, we will address a \ncritical gap in brownfields' funding for site assessment and clean up, \nwhile promoting economic development as well as preservation of \nfarmland and open space.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues--Senator \nJeffords, Senator Levin and others--in co-sponsoring the Brownfields \nSite Redevelopment Assistance Act and the Brownfields Economic \nDevelopment Act.\n  These two Acts are important complements to S. 350, the Brownfields \nRevitalization and Environmental Restoration Act of 2001 that the \nSenate passed unanimously earlier this year. S. 350 encourages the \nremediation of brownfield sites by reducing financial and legal \nbarriers to clean-up. The Brownfields Site Redevelopment Assistance Act \nand the Brownfields Economic Development Act expand the abilities of \nthe Economic Development Administration and the Department of Housing \nand Urban Development to help local communities physically develop and \nrestore brownfield sites to productive use. Taken together, these three \nbills make up a complete brownfields redevelopment package.\n  The two Acts introduced today will provide critical economic and \ntechnical assistance to communities during all stages of the \nbrownfields redevelopment process--from an initial site assessment to \nputting the finishing touches on a new apartment building or city park. \nThese bills have enormous potential to enhance and revitalize \ncommunities and their economies, to turn neglected wastelands into \nproductive developments, and to create more parks and open spaces. This \nin turn will create great opportunities for new jobs and economic \ndevelopment. This is particularly true in my State of Montana where \nwe've been working hard to jump start our economy. Montana's industrial \npast has left the State with its share of brownfield sites--wood \ntreatment facilities, railroad yards, sawmills. Hopefully, this \nlegislation will provide communities with the tools they need to put \nthese sites to productive uses.\n  The Brownfields Site Redevelopment Assistance Act of 2001 will \nprovide the Economic Development Administration with authority and \nfunding for grants to States, local communities, Indian tribes and non-\nprofit organizations for brownfield redevelopment projects. The \nBrownfields Economic Development Act of 2001 will make HUD Brownfields \nEconomic Development Initiative grants available to local governments \nand Indian tribes for community development projects. The bill will \nalso provide a 30 percent set-aside for small communities and tribes, a \nprovision that is very important to a rural State like Montana. The \nNational Association of Development Organizations reports that Federal \nagencies are not reaching rural areas through existing brownfields \nprograms. Rural communities and tribes in Montana and elsewhere need \nfinancial and technical assistance to include brownfields in economic \ndevelopment strategies.\n  Getting brownfield sites cleaned-up makes good sense in Montana and \nthroughout the nation. That, again, is good for the environment, good \nfor communities, good for our economy, and good for the country. I \nwholeheartedly support this legislation, and I hope both bills will \nenjoy swift passage through the Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CLELAND:\n  S. 1080. A bill to amend chapter 84 of title 5, United States Code, \nto provide that employees who retire as registered nurses under the \nFederal Employees Retirement System shall have unused sick leave used \nin the computation of annuities, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President. Statistics from the National League of \nNursing and the American Nurses' Association demonstrate the nursing \nworkforce is shrinking. The Federal health sector, employing \napproximately 45,000 nurses, may be the hardest hit in the near future \nwith an estimated 47 percent of its nursing workforce eligible for \nretirement in the year 2004. Current and anticipated nursing vacancies \nin Federal health care agencies are particularly alarming with the \nincreased nursing care needs of an aging America. The Journal of the \nAmerican Medical Association published a study last year which found \nthe average age of the nursing workforce rose by 4.5 years between 1983 \nand 1998, mostly because fewer younger people are joining the \nprofession.\n  It is imperative that the Federal Health Care System recruit and \nretain nurses in such crucial areas as the Veterans Affairs Health \nAdministration, Department of Defense, Public Health Service, Indian \nHealth Service, and Federal Bureau of Prisons. Nursing shortages will \nresult in major changes in the quality and type of care these agencies \ncan provide to their beneficiaries. There are no quick fixes to \nrecruiting and retaining registered nurses, but Congress must act now \non identified problem areas. One identified measure which would help \nrecruit and retain Federal nurses is to address employee benefits. \nTitle 38 currently excludes nurses employed by the Federal health care \nsystem after 1983 from including unused sick leave in computation of \nretirement. Approximately 68 percent of the Federal nurses are enrolled \nin the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS). My proposal\n\n[[Page S6612]]\n\nwould allow registered nurses under FERS to include unused sick leave \nin the same manner as nurses enrolled in the Civilian Retirement \nSystem, (CRS), for computation of retirement benefits. Under CRS \nregulations, unused sick leave time is added after all of the required \nretirement criteria are met. With my proposal, registered nurses who \nhave accrued the needed increments of sick leave will retain their hard \nearned benefit as part of their retirement package.\n  Nurses played a crucial role in my recovery from injuries incurred in \nVietnam. I can not imagine how much more difficult that recovery would \nhave been without the skill and compassion of nurses. I urge my Senate \ncolleagues to support this measure as we continue to look at strategies \nto prevent the looming Federal nurse shortage.\n  Mr. President.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \nbusiness credit for the development of low-to-moderate income housing \nfor home ownership, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill which \nbuilds on the most well received provisions of the highly successful \nLow to Moderate Income Housing Tax Credit bill, LIHTC, of 1986. The \nevidence is clear that the entrepreneurial spirit that has been \nharnessed over the last 15 years in favor of aggressively addressing \nthe Nation's need for rental housing can and should be channeled in \nresponse to the dire need for affordable single family hosing in urban \nAmerica.\n  Although the economic prosperity enjoyed by this country for a decade \nled to a home ownership rate that has reached levels of nearly 70 \npercent, sadly the rate for central cities is 52 percent. One \nunfortunate reality is that having a good job does not guarantee a \nfamily a decent place to live at an affordable rate. According to one \nreport; ``More than 220,000 teachers, police and public safety officers \nacross the country spend more than half their incomes for housing and \nthe problem is, in fact, getting worse.''\n  Housing experts continually tell us that low homeownership in our \nurban communities is a result of the lack of quality homes to purchase \nand not the lack of potential homeowners. Developers have expressed \nthat the high costs associated with building homes in urban areas have \nacted as a disincentive to developing or redeveloping communities. If \nsupply drives demand as it often does in the case of other commodities \nthen the key to revitalizing neighborhoods that were once jewels is the \nentrepreneural spirit to build homes.\n  The use of tax credits to provide a source of capital to dramatically \nincrease the rental housing stock has been a wonderful success. In \nrecent meetings with developers and community development officials in \nmy State of New Jersey, a consistent answer to the question of ``what \ncan we do to spur the development of single family homes'' has been \n``just build on the success of the low income housing tax credit \nprogram''. Using tax incentives for such critical economic development \npurposes, such as overcoming capital market shortages is a proven \nmethod. In that regard, inclusion of certain industry practice \ndevelopment costs in the ``eligible costs'' basis of the property for \ncomputing tax credits and exclusion of the first $10,000 would quite \noften be just enough to keep developers out of the ``red'' in many \nurban communities.\n  In many respects it is only proper that we begin this century \nrecapturing space that once served as home of vibrant neighborhoods and \nbustling businesses since the middle of the 19th century. Certainly, \neffective development of space at the core of our urban centers \nrequires building on the pride of ownership, rehabilitating classic \nstructures that are found in all of our older cities and reclaiming \nland that has served us well.\n  As we move ahead as a nation it is critical that we not leave many of \nour urban communities behind. AHEAD, (Affordable Housing and \nEnvironmental Action through Development), is a sound approach that \ncannot be implemented too soon. I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1081\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nthe expensing of environmental remediation costs; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that is \nintended to build upon a bi-partisan effort that has spanned over a \ndecade culminating with the passage of S. 350. In August of 1997, this \nbody approved a potentially significant brownfield tax incentive. This \ntax incentive referred to as the ``expensing'' provision allowed new \nowners of these contaminated sites to write off clean-up costs from \ntheir taxes in the year they are deducted. Despite this stride forward \nthere have been issues pertaining to the provision that have \nrepresented barriers to re-development efforts.\n  The barriers which have thwarted re-development efforts have been: \n(1) the sunset of the bill contributed to uncertainty associated with \nthe time needed to clean-up, obtain financing and re-develop these \nproperties; (2) the exclusion of petroleum related products and \npesticides from the definition of ``hazardous substances'' which \nrequired that the treatment of these clean up costs as (non-deductable) \ncapital expenditures rather than expenses; and (3) the recapturing as \nordinary income, at the time of sale, qualified environmental \nremediation expenses that have received exemptions.\n  My bill will eliminate the sunset provision. Eliminating the sunset \nfor this expensing provision would be a major stride forward. Obtaining \nsufficient financing for brownfield re-development is generally \ndifficult enough without the specter of a looming sunset.\n  Petroleum products in the form of fuel oil, heating oil or gasoline \nand pesticides are quite often found at these brownfield sites. \nUnfortunately, ``hazardous substance'' as it relates to brownfields \ndoes not include these particular substances. Therefore, the exclusion \nof substances commonly found at brownfields increases the costs of \nbrownfield re-development significantly. This bill will expand the \ndefinition of hazardous items to include petroleum and pesticides.\n  In an effort to give true value to brownfields tax incentives, this \nbill will repeal the recapture provision related to brownfield tax \nincentives, section 193 e. Currently, any qualified environmental \nremediation expenditure which has been deducted is subject to recapture \nas ordinary income when sold or otherwise disposed. Because the tax \nliability for ordinary income is taxed higher, there is no incentive to \nredevelop contaminated sites and then sell the property for beneficial \nuse. The repeal of this exclusion will give developers an opportunity \nto realize their tax incentives if they intend to sell property shortly \nafter redevelopment.\n  The passage of the expensing provisions and the recently passed S. \n350 represent critical steps in enhancing the public/private \npartnership in brownfield re-development but more must be done. An \neffective partnership will utilize tax incentives to help attract \naffordable private investment. Using tax incentives to overcome capital \nshortages, in the marketplace, to achieve greater public benefits, is a \nproven formula for success. This can reverse negative trends and start \nnew constructive trends.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. \n        Inouye):\n  S. 1083. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nexclude clinical social worker services from coverage under the \nMedicare skilled nursing facility prospective payment system; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Clinical \nSocial Work Medicare Equity Act of 2001. I am proud to sponsor this \nlegislation that will ensure that clinical social workers can receive \nMedicare reimbursement for the mental health services they provide in \nskilled nursing facilities. This bill will give clinical social workers \nparity with other mental health providers who are exempted from the \nMedicare Part B Prospective Payment System.\n  Since my first days in Congress, I have been fighting to protect and \nstrengthen the safety net for our Nation's seniors. Making sure that \nseniors have access to quality, affordable mental health care is an \nimportant part of this fight. I know that millions of seniors are not \nreceiving the mental health services they need. For example, depression \neffects nearly 6 million seniors, but only one-tenth ever get treated. \nThis is unacceptable. Protecting seniors' access to clinical social \nworkers can help make sure that our most vulnerable citizens get the \nquality, affordable mental health care they need.\n  Clinical social workers, much like psychologists and psychiatrists, \ntreat and diagnose mental illnesses. In fact, clinical social workers \nare the primary mental health providers for many nursing home \nresidents. But unlike other mental health providers, clinical social \nworkers often cannot bill directly for the important services they \nprovide to their patients. This bill will correct this inequity and \nmake sure clinical social workers are paid for the valuable services \nthey provide.\n  Before the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, clinical social workers \nbilled Medicare Part B directly for mental health services provided in \nnursing facilities to each patient they served. Under the new \nProspective Payment System, services provided by clinical social \nworkers are lumped, or ``bundled,'' along with the services of other \nhealth care providers for the purposes of billing and payments. \nPsychologists and psychiatrists, however, were exempted from this new \nsystem and continue to bill Medicare directly. This bill would exempt \nclinical social workers, like their mental health colleagues, from the \nProspective Payment System, and would make sure that clinical social \nworkers are paid for the services they provide to patients in skilled \nnursing facilities. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits \nImprovement and Protection Act addressed some of these concerns, but \nthis legislation would remove the final barrier to ensuring that \nclinical social workers are treated fairly and equitably for the care \nthey provide.\n  This bill is about more than paperwork and payment procedures. This \nbill is about equal access to Medicare payments for the equal and \nimportant\n\n[[Page S6617]]\n\nwork done by clinical social workers. And it is about making sure our \nNation's most vulnerable citizens have access to quality, affordable \nmental health care. Without clinical social workers, many nursing home \nresidents may never get the counseling they need when faced with \nillness or the loss of a loved one. I think we can do better by our \nNation's seniors, and I'm fighting to make sure we do.\n  The Clinical Social Work Medicare Equity Act of 2001 is strongly \nsupported by the National Association of Social Workers and the \nClinical Social Work Federation. I look forward to the Senate's support \nof this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. DeWine, and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 1084. A bill to prohibit the importation into the United States of \ndiamonds unless the countries exporting the diamonds have in place a \nsystem of controls on rough diamonds, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today, along with \nSenator DeWine and Senator Feingold, to cut off the source of income \nthat is fueling horrendous conflicts in Sierra Leone, Angola, and the \nDemocratic Republic of Congo, the illicit trade in conflict diamonds.\n  The brutal wars in these African Nations may be thousands of miles \naway, but the source of the funds that buy the weapons may be as close \nas your ring finger. Our legislation says, if you can't prove to U.S. \nCustoms agents that your diamonds are legitimate, take your business \nand your diamonds somewhere else.\n  I am pleased that the diamond industry and the human rights community \nare united in their support for this bill. They met many times with our \nstaffs to work out a compromise that everyone is enthusiastically \nsupporting.\n  We can and must do more than look with horror at the pictures of \nchildren with missing hands, arms or legs. We must take a strong stand \nthat says to the world that this nation, which purchases 65 percent of \nthe world's diamonds, will not buy the diamonds that fund rebels and \nterrorists.\n  American consumers who purchase diamonds for some happy milestone in \ntheir lives, like an engagement, wedding, or anniversary, must be \nassured that they are buying a diamond from a legitimate, legal, and \nresponsible source.\n  Setting up a system that would allow American consumers to have \nconfidence that they are buying ``clean'' diamonds would also serve our \nlocal jewelers and diamond retailers.\n  It is hard to imagine today that diamonds could become unfashionable, \nbut if consumers associate diamonds with guerrillas who hack off the \narms of children, instead of the joyous life events that are now \nassociated with the gemstones, the diamond industry in our country \ncould suffer a sharp decline.\n  The jewelers in our local malls and downtown shops do not want to \nsupport rebels and terrorists in Africa any more than consumers do. \nThis legislation aims to protect our local merchants, as well as cut \noff funds to African rebels.\n  I heard from a jeweler in my hometown of Springfield, Illinois, Bruce \nLauer, President of the Illinois Jewelers Association, who wrote:\n\n       The use of diamond profits to fund warfare and atrocities \n     in parts of Africa is abhorrent to all of us. The system \n     created by your bill to bar U.S. imports of conflict stones \n     will allow retail jewelers to be confident that the diamonds \n     and diamond jewelry they sell have no part in the violence \n     and suffering that are prevalent in Sierra Leone, Angola, or \n     other conflict areas.\n       As the owner of Stout & Lauer Jewelers in Springfield, I \n     know first hand the importance of diamonds to my customers. A \n     diamond is a very special purchase symbolizing love, \n     commitment and joy. It should not be tarnished with doubt. . \n     ..We want to be able to assure our customers unequivocally \n     that the diamonds in our stores come from legitimate sources.\n\n  What carnage are these conflicts in Africa causing? The photos of \nmaimed and mutilated men, women, and children in Sierra Leone are the \nmost visible results of the terror tactics by the Revolutionary United \nFront, RUF. This rebel group has also used murder and rape, pressed \nchildren into becoming soldiers, and caused a mass movements of \nrefugees as people flee the terror. The Congressional Research Service \nhas released some conflict-related statistics for the Sierra Leone, \nAngola, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. I would like to repeat \nsome of them for the Record: Out of a population of more than 5 million \npeople, there are approximately 490,000 refugees from Sierra Leone in \nneighboring countries and anywhere from 500,000 to 1.3 million \ninternally displaced people. Estimates of the numbers of people who \nhave died in the conflict range from 20,000 to 50,000. More than 5,000 \nchildren have fought in direct combat roles, with 5,000 more used in \nsupporting roles. There are no figures on how many people lost limbs or \nwere otherwise mutilated, but World Vision reports that there are 2,000 \namputees in just one camp in Freetown.\n  In the long conflicts in Angola and Democratic Republic of Congo, \nDRC, diamonds have been a contributing factor. The United Nations \nrecently issued a report showing that the conflict in the DRC has \nbecome increasingly resource driven, as parties illegally exploit \ndiamonds and other mineral wealth, including tantilite, the mineral now \nin high demands for cell phones and other electronic devices.\n  Last year the United States worked with the international community \nand the diamond industry to stem the flow of conflict diamonds. The \nUnited Nations has taken action to ban the conflict diamond trade and \nrecommended that a ``simple and workable international certification \nscheme for rough diamonds be created.''\n  The United States also participated in May 2000 in the \nTechnical Forum on Diamonds, which became known as the ``Kimberley \nProcess'' after the city in South Africa where the group met, along \nwith representatives from other countries, the diamond industry, and \nnon-governmental organization. The group recommended the establishment \nof an international export regime like the one set up in the bill I \nintroduce today. However, since that time negotiations on setting up \nsuch a system have slowed. I believe that this bill will help spur \naction to complete negotiations and set up a system to track and \ncertify diamond exports.\n\n  The bill that I am introducing today with Senator DeWine and Senator \nFeingold is similar to H.R. 918, introduced by Congressman Tony Hall \nand Congressman Frank Wolf in the House. But our bill also incorporates \nsome changes that represent a compromise that the diamond industry and \nthe human rights community were able to come together to support. The \nbill was also written to be compliant with US obligations in the World \nTrade Organization, WTO.\n  Among other provisions, the bill does the following: The bill \nrequires diamond imports--including rough, polished, and jewelry--to \ncome from a ``clean stream'' and spells out the details of this system \n(which may be superceded by an international agreement if the United \nStates is a party to it). Implementation of any system shall be \nmonitored by US agencies and a presidential advisory commission, which \ninclude human rights advocates and representatives of the diamond \nindustry.\n  Violators will be subject to civil and criminal penalties, including \nconfiscation of contraband. Significant violators' US assets may be \nblocked. Proceeds from penalties and the sale of diamonds seized as \ncontraband shall be used to help war victims, through humanitarian \nrelief and micro-credit development projects.\n  Diamond-sector projects in countries that fail to adopt a system of \ncontrols shall not be eligible for loan guarantees or other assistance \nof the US Export-Import Bank or OPIC.\n  The bill provides waiver authority to the President under limited \ncircumstances, and spells out the process for determining them under \nwhat limited conditions, the President may delay applicability of the \nlaw to a ``cooperating'' country. In issuing such a waiver, the \nPresident must report to Congress on that country's progress toward \nestablishing a system of controls and concluding an international \nagreement. Criteria for determining whether a country is cooperating \nmust be developed with public input.\n  The bill requires no action by the Treasury Secretary or Customs \nService that would contradict the United States' obligations to the \nWorld Trade\n\n[[Page S6618]]\n\nOrganization, as it finds in a dispute proceeding. If another country \nsuccessfully challenges the United States at the WTO, Congress intends \nfor the United States to bring its actions into conformity with its WTO \nobligations.\n  Both the President and the General Accounting Office are to report as \nto the system's effectiveness and on which countries are implementing \nit.\n  The bill encourages the diamond industry to contribute to \nfinancially-strapped African countries that may have difficulty bearing \nthe costs of setting up a system of controls, and authorizes $5 million \nof assistance from the United States to do the same.\n  I ask my colleagues to join with us in cosponsoring the bill we \nintroduce today and take a positive step in ending the bloody violence \nfueled by the sale of conflict diamonds.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE:\n  S. 1085. A bill to provide for the revitalization of Olympic sports \nin the United States; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the foremost responsibility given to \nthe United States Olympic Committee when it was created by Congress is \nto obtain for this country ``the most competent representation possible \nin each event of the Olympic Games.'' However, in too many sports, the \nUSOC is decidedly disadvantaged in achieving that goal. A key reason \nfor the USOC's difficulty is that our colleges and universities are \neliminating many of their teams in those sports each year. Colleges and \nuniversities have been the traditional route to participation in the \nOlympic Games in these non-revenue sports, but many of America's \nprospective participants in the Olympic Games are having opportunities \nblocked as these programs disappear.\n  As a former college wrestler and someone who continues to follow that \nsport closely at the high school and college levels, I have noticed as \nwrestling programs have been discontinued by colleges and universities \nat a high rate in recent years. Too often, this occurs through a \nprocess that leaves student-athletes with few options if they want to \ncontinue wrestling at another institution. As a result of my concerns \nabout wrestling, the sport I know best, I worked with now-Speaker of \nthe House Dennis Hastert to include in the 1998 reauthorization of the \nHigher Education Act a study by the General Accounting Office on \npatterns in the addition and discontinuation of athletic teams at 4-\nyear colleges and universities. The study investigated the forces that \nlead to team additions and discontinuations, as well as the processes \nthrough which discontinuations have occurred. The report from that GAO \nstudy was recently released. It both reaffirms what Speaker Hastert and \nI already knew about the state of college-level wrestling. And it \ndemonstrates that wrestling, where 40 percent of teams have been \ndiscontinued during the past two decades, is not alone. A number of \nmen's and women's sports have experienced a significant net decline in \nthe number of programs during the same period. There has been a 53-\npercent decline in the number of women's gymnastics teams, a 10-percent \nreduction in the number of women's field hockey teams and a 68-percent \ndecline in the number of men's gymnastics programs. Most pertinent is \nthe following fact: 16 of the sports that have lost teams during that \nperiod, which is nearly all the sports that have lost teams, are \nOlympic sports. In light of the Congressional directive contained in \nUSOC's authorizing legislation, a federal response is warranted.\n  Guided by the findings of the recent GAO report, the bill that I \nintroduce today, the Olympic Sports Revitalization Act, seeks to \ncounteract the problems faced by these 16 sports, plus three emerging \nwomen's sports. The first group of 16 sports consists of the following: \nwomen's gymnastics, women's and men's fencing, women's field hockey, \nwomen's and men's archery, women's badminton, men's wrestling, men's \ntennis, men's gymnastics, men's rifle/shooting men's outdoor track, \nmen's swimming, men's skiing, men's ice hockey, and men's water polo. \nAlso covered are the three emerging women's sports: synchronized \nswimming, team handball, and equestrian. The bill would assist in \ndeveloping a competitive American Olympics program that spans the \nspectrum of high- and low-profile sports. Because there is no single, \nshared reason that each of these sports has faced difficulty in recent \nyears, the bill has four sections, each of which seeks to address an \nobstacle to their vitality in the United States.\n  First, the GAO report indicates that in some cases, declining \ninterest in the sports is a key factor in decisions by colleges and \nuniversities to eliminate their programs. We know that those who will \ngo on to become Olympians realize their talent and passion for their \nsport at any early age which means they need to become interested at an \nearly age. Therefore, this bill establishes a grant program to assist \nlocal community-based athletic programs in providing opportunities for \nyoungsters to participate in these sports. The bill authorizes funds \nfor the USOC itself and the national governing bodies in the sports \ncovered by the Act to award grants to community athletic organizations \nto initiate and expand youth sporting opportunities. In particular, it \nencourages a focus on providing such opportunities in communities where \nthe sport has not traditionally been available as an option for young \npersons so that the pool of participants in the sport will expand.\n\n  Of course, relatively few of the young people that will participant \nin these programs will ever become Olympians. But aside from building \ninterest in otherwise declining sports, these programs will provide \nadditional benefits for young men and women. My colleague from Alaska, \nSenator Stevens, for whom the existing Olympic and Amateur Sport Act is \nrightly named, has an ongoing commitment to enhancing the physical \nfitness of Americans. This program offers fitness outlets that can put \nyoung people on a path toward lifelong commitment to exercise and all \nits physical and mental health benefits.\n  As someone who was given the opportunity to develop personally \nthrough the challenge of wrestling, I also know how important \ninvolvement in athletics is at an early age in building character. \nSports help youngsters develop some of the most important skills for \nsuccess in life: the ability to think strategically, the courage to \novercome fears, and the tact of being a good winner and, yes, a good \nloser.\n  I encourage my colleagues to learn more about two existing community \nsports programs that are exactly the type of locally-controlled \nendeavors that this grant program is meant to promote. Peter Westbrook \ngrew up in the projects of Newark, New Jersey. He was lucky enough to \nbe introduced to fencing at an early age and by focusing on that sport, \nhe escaped the desperation of the environment in which he came of age. \nPeter pursued the sport as he became older and he went on to win the \nBronze Medal in Men's Sabre at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles. Seven \nyears later, he began a non-profit program in New York City dedicated \nto helping kids in the five boroughs of New York gain access to the \nbenefits that he has as a youngster in fencing. Over the past decade, \nhundreds of inner-city kids have participated in the program.\n  Like the Peter Westbrook Foundation, the ``Beat the Streets'' program \nbegun in 1999 in inner-city Chicago is a model for the grant program to \nbe established by this legislation. ``Beat the Streets,'' a program \nwith which Speaker Hastert has been involved, focuses on mentoring \nyoungsters who typically would not have access to wrestling training. \nThe youngsters are coached in a number of wrestling techniques, \nconditioning and nutrition. The program also focuses on developing \nsocial and intellectual skills that go beyond the mat. ``Beat the \nStreets'' has grown throughout Chicago and, working in coalition with \nthe YMCA, its advisory board recently began planning the expansion of \nthat program to other cities around the country. I hope that this \nlegislation can plan a role in the expansion of such an outstanding \nprogram.\n  As I mentioned earlier, three women's emerging sports, that is, \nOlympic sports that have not traditionally been an option for women in \nthis country--are also covered by the pertinent sections of this Act. \nThat makes sense because the fact that they are not fully established \nsports means that the USOC faces a particular challenge in developing \nthe most competitive team possible in those sports.\n\n[[Page S6619]]\n\n  The second section of the Olympic Sports Revitalization Act more \ndirect focuses on ensuring participation in the covered sports during \ncollege. It does so by providing funding for scholarships in those \nsports. College and university athletic programs that have discontinued \nthe non-revenue sports covered by this Act also cite budgetary strains \nas a frequent reason for those decisions. While the GAO report cites \nnumerous cased where colleagues and unikversitues have successfully \nmaintained existing sports while adding new sports to meet the \ninterests and needs of women athlete, it is important to realize that \ncolleges and universities do face real financial contraints. This \nportion of the Act would help protect existing non-revenue sports that \nmight otherwise be eliminated. Through this section's provision, the \nUSOC would be authorized to provide 4-year grants of between $25,000 \nand $50,000 annually to college athletic programs to provide \nscholarship to student-athletes participating in the sports covered by \nthe Act. At any one school, a limit of three covered program could be \ngrant recipients at any one time. Schools would be required to maintain \nthe sport to continue to receive the grant money. This Olympic \nRevitalization Scholarship grant program will reinforce the already \nexisting Bart Stupak Olympic Scholarship Program, also in the Higher \nEducation Act, which provides financial assistance to athletes who are \nactually in training for the Olympic Games.\n\n  The bill also seeks to ensure that, as they decide where they will \nattend college, prospective student-athletes will be able accurately to \ngauge the relative health of the sports programs at different schools \nthey may be considering. Present law requires that all 4-year colleges \nand universities with athletic programs report to the Department of \nEducation the number of participants and coaches in all sports, as well \nas further information regarding funding for their teams. This data, \nparticularly when examined over time, gives an excellent picture of the \nhealth of the sport at that college. It also provides insight into the \ncontinued vitality of the program during the period that the \nprospective student-athlete would hope to participate in the sport. The \nproblem is that, while the Department of Education has collected this \nrequired data, it is not readily available to the general public. The \nOlympic Sports Revitalization Act would authorize funds and require \nthat the data over a several year period be posted on the Internet in a \nusable format so that the student-athletes and those involved in their \ncollege decision can have easy access to that information.\n  Finally, one of the most troubling findings in the GAO report is that \nstudent-athletes are, quite often, given no forewarning that their \nsport is being discontinued by the athletic program. They also have no \nmechanism by which to appeal that decision. Generally, such decisions \nby athletic programs go into effect immediately. In addition to defying \nfairness, this reality means that student-athletes often have their \ncollege athletic careers disrupted in a manner that makes it difficult \nto stay on track for post-college amateur competition. The data in the \nGAO report indicates that the stories I have heard about the \ntermination of wrestling programs in my home State of Minnesota and \naround the country are part of a pattern in other similarly situated \nsports. Therefore, the fourth section of the bill requires that \ncolleges and universities provide written justification for a decision \nto discontinue a sport to team members. It also requires that a process \nfor appealing the team's termination be established.\n  We have a responsibility to field ``the most competent \nrepresentation'' possible in the Olympic games. Just as important, we \nshould do all we can to promote the continued vitality of a set of \nsports that have proud traditions I our country and that have provided \nhealth and character-development benefits for thousands of participants \nthrough the years. To quote Pat Zilverberg, a constant guardian of the \nsport of wrestling in my home state, from his letter supporting this \nlegislation: ``The opportunities to develop athletes and, subsequently, \ngood citizens, are at risk.'' This legislation would play a key role in \nrevitalizing these sports and I strongly encourage its adoption.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself and Mr. Torricelli):\n  S. 1086. A bill to amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to \npermanently prohibit the conduct of offshore drilling on the outer \nContinental Shelf in the Mid-Atlantic and North Atlantic planning \nareas; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today, along with Senator Torricelli, I \nam introducing legislation, the Clean Ocean and Safe Tourism, COAST, \nAnti-Drilling Act, to ban oil and gas drilling off the Mid-Atlantic and \nNorthern Atlantic coast.\n  The people of New Jersey, and other residents of States along the \nAtlantic Coast, do not want oil or gas rigs anywhere near their \ntreasured beaches and fishing grounds. Such drilling poses serious \nthreats not to our environment, but to our economy, which depends \nheavily on tourism along our shore.\n  Until recently, there was no reason to suspect that drilling was even \na remote possibility. Since 1982, a statutory moratorium on leasing \nactivities in most Outer Continental Shelf, OCS, areas has been \nincluded annually in Interior Appropriations acts. In addition, \nPresident George H.W. Bush declared a leasing moratorium on many OCS \nareas on June 26, 1990 under section 12 of the OCS Lands Act. On June \n12, 1998, President Clinton used the same authority to issue a \nmemorandum to the Secretary of the Interior that extended the \nmoratorium through 2012 and included additional OCS areas.\n  Given the long-standing consensus against drilling in these areas, I \nwas deeply disturbed to discover that on May 31, 2001, the Minerals \nManagement Service released a request for proposals, RFP, to conduct a \nstudy of the environmental impacts of drilling in the Mid- and North-\nAtlantic. The RFP noted that ``there are areas with some reservoir \npotential, for example off the coast of New Jersey.'' In addition, the \nRFP explained that the study would be conducted ``in anticipation of \nmanaging the exploitation of potential and proven reserves.''\n  I believe that the RFP was not only inappropriate, but probably \nillegal, and I was pleased when it was rescinded yesterday. However, I \nremain concerned about the Administration's policy with respect to \noffshore drilling. Although some Administration officials have \nindicated that they support the existing moratoria on offshore \ndrilling, the President's energy plan and this recent proposed study \ncall the Administration's position into question. I have asked the \nPresident to clarify his position on this issue, and I hope that he \nwill use his authority to endorse the existing moratoria.\n  In my view, however, it is time for Congress to act to resolve this \nquestion once and for all. That is why I am introducing the COAST Anti-\nDrilling Act. This bill would permanently ban drilling for oil, gas and \nother minerals in the Mid- and North-Atlantic.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this important \nlegislation. Doing so would ensure that the people of New Jersey and \nneighboring States that they need not fear the specter of oil rigs off \ntheir beaches.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1086\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Clean Ocean and Safe Tourism \n     Anti-Drilling Act'' or the ``COAST Anti-Drilling Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROHIBITION OF OIL AND GAS LEASING IN CERTAIN AREAS \n                   OF THE OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF.\n\n       Section 8 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 \n     U.S.C. 1337) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(p) Prohibition of Oil and Gas Leasing in Certain Areas \n     of the Outer Continental Shelf.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this section or any other law, the Secretary of \n     the Interior shall not issue a lease for the exploration, \n     development, or production of oil, natural gas, or any other \n     mineral in--\n       ``(1) the Mid-Atlantic planning area; or\n       ``(2) the North Atlantic planning area.''.\n\n[[Page S6620]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/21/senate-section/article/S6620-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 52--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT \n  REDUCING CRIME IN PUBLIC HOUSING SHOULD BE A PRIORITY, AND THAT THE \n  SUCCESSFUL PUBLIC HOUSING DRUG ELIMINATION PROGRAM SHOULD BE FULLY \n                                 FUNDED\n\n  Mr. CORZINE (for himself, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Reed, Mr. Carper, Mr. \nSchumer, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Bayh, Mr. \nRockefeller, Ms. Collins, Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Cleland, Ms. \nCantwell, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Torricelli, and Mr. Kerry) \nsubmitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 52\n\n       Whereas while various public housing developments suffer \n     from serious crime problems, many have made significant \n     progress in reducing crime through initiatives funded by the \n     Public Housing Drug Elimination Program (PHDEP);\n       Whereas PHDEP was first established in 1988 under former \n     President George Bush and the former Secretary of the \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development, Jack Kemp, and \n     has enjoyed strong bipartisan support since its inception;\n       Whereas PHDEP funds a wide variety of anticrime \n     initiatives, that include--\n       (1) the employment of security personnel and investigators;\n       (2) the reimbursement of local law enforcement agencies for \n     additional security;\n       (3) drug education and prevention, intervention, and \n     treatment programs;\n       (4) voluntary resident patrols; and\n       (5) physical improvements designed to enhance security, \n     including fences and cameras;\n       Whereas PHDEP has successfully enabled housing authorities \n     to work cooperatively with residents, local officials, police \n     departments, community groups, Boys and Girls Clubs, drug \n     counseling centers, and other community-based organizations \n     to develop locally-supported anticrime initiatives;\n       Whereas the Internet web site of the Department of Housing \n     and Urban Development has stated that the program's ``success \n     is rooted in the fact that the people respond better and \n     become more involved in something they have helped to \n     build'';\n       Whereas in addition to providing direct funding for \n     anticrime initiatives, PHDEP has helped housing authorities \n     leverage funding from other sources that might otherwise be \n     unavailable, such as funding from local banks, Rotary and \n     Kiwanis Clubs, and private foundations;\n       Whereas a portion of funding allocated to the PHDEP is also \n     used to reduce crime in privately-owned, publicly assisted \n     housing, and assisted housing on Indian reservations, which \n     also can suffer from serious crime problems;\n       Whereas the Internet web site of the Department of Housing \n     and Urban Development has pointed out that ``in several of \n     the Nation's largest public housing authorities--largest in \n     terms of unit size--the rate of crime has fallen since the \n     mid-1990's, even though the crime rate in the respective \n     surrounding communities increased. And we know that crime \n     levels in many housing authorities are dropping, in both \n     absolute and percentage terms. These are merely the successes \n     that we can measure. There are many more that are simply \n     immeasurable.'';\n       Whereas Congress has recognized the success of the PHDEP by \n     increasing program funding from $8,200,000 in fiscal year \n     1989 to $310,000,000 in fiscal year 2001;\n       Whereas evicting residents who engage in unlawful activity \n     can help reduce crime, but much of the crime in public \n     housing is perpetrated by nonresidents, and evictions must be \n     supplemented by the more comprehensive anticrime approach \n     supported by the PHDEP;\n       Whereas public housing authorities could use operating \n     subsidies to fund some anticrime initiatives under applicable \n     law, but those subsidies are based on a formula that does not \n     account for PHDEP eligible activities and are inadequate to \n     fund most of the anticrime initiatives supported by the \n     program, and PHDEP has the added advantage of requiring \n     public housing authorities to develop and implement anticrime \n     plans with the support and participation of residents and \n     local communities, which has proved critical in ensuring the \n     effectiveness of such plans;\n       Whereas while, as with any program of its size, there have \n     been reports of isolated problems, PHDEP generally has been \n     well run and free of the widespread abuses that have plagued \n     other housing programs in the past, in part because of the \n     broad participation of residents and local communities, and \n     because the program has required housing authorities to \n     provide comprehensive plans before receiving funds, and \n     complete reports on their progress;\n       Whereas during the process leading to his confirmation, the \n     Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, \n     Mel Martinez, stated in a written response to a question \n     posed by Senator Jon S. Corzine that, ``HUD's Public Housing \n     Drug Elimination Program, PHDEP, supports a wide variety of \n     efforts by public and Indian housing authorities to reduce or \n     eliminate drug-related crime in public housing developments. \n     Based on this core purpose, I certainly support the \n     program.'';\n       Whereas PHDEP is critical not only to millions of public \n     and assisted housing residents, most of whom are hard \n     working, law abiding citizens, but also to surrounding \n     communities, residents of which also suffer if neighboring \n     housing developments are plagued with high rates of crime; \n     and\n       Whereas continued funding of PHDEP would demonstrate that \n     the Nation is serious about maintaining its commitment to \n     reducing the problem of crime in public housing: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) reducing crime in public housing should be a priority; \n     and\n       (2) the successful Public Housing Drug Elimination Program \n     should be fully funded.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/21/senate-section/article/S6620-2", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6620-S6621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 53--ENCOURAGING THE DEVELOPMENT OF \n  STRATEGIES TO REDUCE HUNGER AND POVERTY, AND TO PROMOTE FREE MARKET \n      ECONOMIES AND DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS, IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA\n\n  Mr. HAGEL (for himself, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Levin) submitted the \nfollowing concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nForeign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 53\n\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring),\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This concurrent resolution may be cited as the ``Hunger to \n     Harvest: Decade of Support for Sub-Saharan Africa \n     Resolution''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Despite some progress in recent years, sub-Saharan \n     Africa enters the new millennium with many of the world's \n     poorest countries and is the one region of the world where \n     hunger is both pervasive and increasing.\n       (2) Thirty-three of the world's 41 poorest debtor countries \n     are in sub-Saharan Africa and an estimated 291,000,000 \n     people, nearly one-half of sub-Saharan Africa's total \n     population, currently live in extreme poverty on less than $1 \n     a day.\n       (3) One in three people in sub-Saharan Africa is \n     chronically undernourished, double the number of three \n     decades ago. One child out of seven dies before the age of \n     five, and one-half of these deaths are due to malnutrition.\n       (4) Sub-Saharan Africa is the region in the world most \n     affected by infectious disease, accounting for one-half of \n     the deaths worldwide from HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, \n     cholera, and several other diseases.\n       (5) Sub-Saharan Africa is home to 70 percent of adults, and \n     80 percent of children, living with the HIV virus, and 75 \n     percent of the people worldwide who have died of AIDS lived \n     in Africa.\n       (6) The HIV/AIDS pandemic has erased many of the \n     development gains of the past generation in sub-Saharan \n     Africa and now threatens to undermine economic and social \n     progress for the next generation, with life expectancy in \n     parts of sub-Saharan Africa having already decreased by 10-20 \n     years as a result of AIDS.\n       (7) Despite these immense challenges, the number of sub-\n     Saharan African countries that are moving toward open \n     economies and more accountable governments has increased, and \n     these countries are beginning to achieve local solutions to \n     their common problems.\n       (8) To make lasting improvements in the lives of their \n     people, sub-Saharan Africa governments need support as they \n     act to solve conflicts, make critical investments in human \n     capacity and infrastructure, combat corruption, reform their \n     economies, stimulate trade and equitable economic growth, and \n     build democracy.\n       (9) Despite sub-Saharan Africa's enormous development \n     challenges, United States companies hold approximately \n     $12,800,000,000 in investments in sub-Saharan Africa, greater \n     than United States investments in either the Middle East or \n     Eastern Europe, and total United States trade with sub-\n     Saharan Africa currently exceeds that with all of the \n     independent states of the former Soviet Union, including the \n     Russian Federation. This economic relationship could be put \n     at risk unless additional public and private resources are \n     provided to combat poverty and promote equitable economic \n     growth in sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (10) Bread for the World Institute calculates that the goal \n     of reducing world hunger by one-half by 2015 is achievable \n     through an increase of $4,000,000,000 in annual funding from \n     all donors for poverty-focused development. If the United \n     States were to shoulder one-fourth of this aid burden--\n     approximately $1,000,000,000 a year--the cost to each United \n     States citizen would be one penny per day.\n\n[[Page S6621]]\n\n       (11) Failure to effectively address sub-Saharan Africa's \n     development needs could result in greater conflict and \n     increased poverty, heightening the prospect of humanitarian \n     intervention and potentially threatening a wide range of \n     United States interests in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the years 2002 through 2012 should be declared ``A \n     Decade of Support for Sub-Saharan Africa'';\n       (2) not later than 90 days after the date of adoption of \n     this concurrent resolution, the President should submit a \n     report to Congress setting forth a five-year strategy, and a \n     ten-year strategy, to achieve a reversal of current levels of \n     hunger and poverty in sub-Saharan Africa, including a \n     commitment to contribute an appropriate United States share \n     of increased bilateral and multilateral poverty-focused \n     resources for sub-Saharan Africa, with an emphasis on--\n       (A) health, including efforts to prevent, treat, and \n     control HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and other diseases \n     that contribute to malnutrition and hunger, and to promote \n     maternal health and child survival;\n       (B) education, with an emphasis on equal access to learning \n     for girls and women;\n       (C) agriculture, including strengthening subsistence \n     agriculture as well as the ability to compete in global \n     agricultural markets, and investment in infrastructure and \n     rural development;\n       (D) private sector and free market development, to bring \n     sub-Saharan Africa into the global ecomony, enable people to \n     purchase food, and make health and education investments \n     sustainable;\n       (E) democratic institutions and the rule of law, including \n     strengthening civil society and independent judiciaries;\n       (F) micro-finance development; and\n       (G) debt relief that provides incentives for sub-Saharan \n     African countries to invest in poverty-focused development, \n     and to expand democratic participation, free markets, trade, \n     and investment;\n       (3) the President should work with the heads of other donor \n     countries and sub-Saharan African countries, and with United \n     States and sub-Saharan African private and voluntary \n     organizations and other civic organizations, including faith-\n     based organizations, to implement the strategies described in \n     paragraph (2);\n       (4) Congress should undertake a multi-year commitment to \n     provide the resources to implement those strategies; and\n       (5) 120 days after the date of adoption of this concurrent \n     resolution, and every year thereafter, the Administrator of \n     the United States Agency for International Development, in \n     consultation with the heads of other appropriate Federal \n     departments and agencies, should submit to Congress a report \n     on the implementation of those strategies, including the \n     action taken under paragraph (3), describing--\n       (A) the results of the implementation of those strategies \n     as of the date of the report, including the progress made and \n     any setbacks suffered;\n       (B) impediments to, and opportunities for, future progress;\n       (C) proposed changes to those strategies, if any; and\n       (D) the role and extent of cooperation of the governments \n     of sub-Saharan countries and other donors, both public and \n     private, in combating poverty and promoting equitable \n     economic development.\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution that \nexpresses the sense of the Senate that the United States should commit \nitself to fighting hunger and poverty in sub-Saharan Africa, and should \ndemonstrate this commitment through increased financial assistance \nuntil the continent's current hunger trends are reversed.\n  Hunger, poverty and disease are widespread in sub-Saharan Africa. \nApproximately 291 million individuals in the region, nearly half of the \ntotal population, live on less than $1 a day. Thirty-three of the \nworld's 41 heavily indebted poor countries, HIPCs, are in sub-Saharan \nAfrica. The United States and other developed countries can help. We \nmust invest in poverty-focused development, directed towards \ninvestments that have proven to be effective in reducing hunger, in the \nareas of agriculture, health, education, micro-finance, and debt \nrelief. We must support sub-Saharan African countries as they are \nbecoming more democratic and are shaping locally based solutions to \nhunger and poverty with the participation of civil society and \nnongovernmental organizations.\n  The urgency and tragedy of the AIDS pandemic has drawn important \nattention to the continent of sub-Saharan Africa. As we address the \nHIV/AIDS pandemic, we must also address hunger. Hunger and health are \nclosely linked: poor people cannot feed themselves adequately, and the \nresulting malnourishment weakens their bodies' defense against AIDS and \nother infectious diseases. Poor communities cannot build clinics for \nAIDS-related education, diagnosis, or treatment, and even if clinics \nexist, poor and hungry people cannot afford fees for care or medicine. \nTo address HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa, we must also address the \ncontext that promotes this pandemic's spread.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my friend from \nNebraska, Senator Hagel, in submitting this resolution, entitled \n``Hunger to Harvest: A Decade of Support for sub-Saharan Africa.'' The \nResolution speaks for itself, but I want to make a couple of brief \npoints.\n  Sub-Saharan Africa today is a region suffering from immense problems, \nand none more catastrophic than AIDS. Over 25 million people are \ninfected with the AIDS virus, and almost 4 million more people are \ninfected each year. The disease is destroying whole societies in a \nregion that was already the poorest in the world.\n  Another million people, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and mostly \nchildren, die from malaria each year. Many of these deaths could be \nprevented with mosquito bed nets that cost a few dollars a piece.\n  An estimated 2 million people have died from hunger and disease in \nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo during the civil war there, and \nhardly anyone noticed. There is similar suffering in southern Sudan.\n  Hunger and poverty are endemic in sub-Saharan Africa, as are violence \nand corruption. It is beyond tragic that a region with such great \npotential has been so devastated by corrupt leaders who have robbed \ntheir countries' wealth, and fought wars for no other reason than to \namass riches and power, wars that have spanned decades and wreaked \nhavoc on their own people.\n  Yet despite this terrible legacy there are signs of hope. Some \ncountries have emerged from chaos and are beginning to recover. Nigeria \nis an example. Namibia is another. Still others, like the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo, are showing tentative but encouraging signs. It \nis also noteworthy that American companies are increasingly investing \nin sub-Saharan Africa, investments which today total some $12.8 \nbillion.\n  These are positive changes that deserve our support, but United \nStates assistance to sub-Saharan Africa is a mere $2 per person per \nyear. We cannot solve Africa's problems, but Bread for the World \nInstitute calculates that great progress could be made in reducing \nhunger and poverty in Africa with relatively modest increases in \ninternational assistance.\n  This Resolution seeks to focus attention on the urgent needs in sub-\nSaharan Africa. But it goes further, by requesting the Administration \nto develop five and ten year strategies for helping to address those \nneeds, in health, education and agriculture, and for promoting free \nmarket economies, trade and investment, democracy and the rule of law. \nWith clear strategies, specific goals, the resources to implement them, \nand benchmarks for measuring results, we can make a difference. We also \nrequest the Administration to report on progress in implementing these \nstrategies.\n  It is my hope that this resolution will lead to a new U.S. approach \ntoward sub-Saharan Africa. As the world's richest, most powerful Nation \nI believe we can and should do far more to assist the world's poor. But \nthe leaders of the sub-Saharan countries also have a responsibility to \nsupport policies that benefit and provide incentives to their people. \nThose who do, deserve our support.\n  Finally, I want to thank Bread for the World for its help on the \nResolution, and for its life-saving work in sub-Saharan Africa and \naround the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/21/senate-section/article/S6621-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6621-S6622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 807.
