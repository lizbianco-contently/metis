Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now proceed to the consideration of S. 420, which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 420) to amend title 11, United States Code, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today, I am pleased that we are proceeding \nto the consideration of bankruptcy reform legislation. Senator Grassley \nintroduced S. 220 earlier this month, which is precisely the same \nlegislative language that was contained in the conference report passed \nby the Senate in December by a vote of 70 to 28. That language has been \nmarked up and reported out of the Judiciary Committee. It is that \nlanguage we are considering today in S. 420, the ``Bankruptcy Reform \nAct of 2001.''\n  As many of you know, we have been working on the issue of bankruptcy \nreform for a number of years now. By way of background, both Houses \ndemonstrated overwhelming margins in favor of this legislation in \nDecember, but President Clinton pocket-vetoed the legislation and we \nsimply ran out of time in the session to come back and override the \nveto. So earlier this month, rather than introducing something to serve \nas a starting point for negotiations, Senator Grassley introduced \nexactly the language that passed both houses so overwhelmingly in \nDecember. This language was the result of a long process of bipartisan \nnegotiations last year that resulted in agreement on over four hundred \npages of legislative language, on all but two issues. Although we were \nprepared to go directly to the Senate floor and complete this \nunfinished business of the last session, because of complaints by some \nDemocrats on the committee, we held yet another committee hearing on \nthe subject. Even after the hearing, some Democrats on the committee \nraised additional objections, and that is why we marked up the \nlegislation in committee, instead of moving directly to the Senate \nfloor for its quick consideration. We tried our best to accommodate our \ncolleagues on the other side. I think we did, and I believe they \nappreciate it.\n\n[[Page S1794]]\n\n  Although some 27 democratic amendments were circulated for the \ncommittee markup, I am pleased that our Democratic colleagues \nultimately limited their offering of some of the amendments because \nthose of us on the Republican side of the aisle worked very hard to \naccommodate Democratic concerns with respect to substantive amendments. \nWe accepted several amendments and developed compromise provisions on \nseveral others. It is my sincere hope that we can work constructively \non the floor without an unnecessary flood of amendments and without \nundue delay.\n\n  Again, this legislation was agreed to during bipartisan negotiations \nlast year, with the exception of two provisions, one of which--the \nissue of the dischargeability of debts relating to violence--we worked \nin committee to resolve. I am pleased that the bill now includes a \nreasonable compromise developed by Senator Schumer and me that \naddresses the concerns of both sides in a fair manner. Let me take this \nopportunity to thank Senator Schumer for his leadership and hard work \non this issue.\n  I am also pleased to have worked with the Ranking Democratic Member \nof the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, to include for the first \ntime privacy protections in bankruptcy. The amendment protects \npersonally identifiable information given by a consumer to a business \ndebtor by adding new privacy protections to the bankruptcy code and by \ncreating a consumer privacy ombudsman to appear before the bankruptcy \ncourt.\n  Given that the language we are considering is the Senate-passed \nconference report with the only changes being ones sought in committee \nby our Democratic colleagues, I am hopeful that we can all stand by the \ncompromises we reached in good faith last year. I am the first to \nacknowledge that there are things I would like to see changed in the \nbill, but I recognize that we all have cooperated and compromised in \norder to enact this legislation that provides new consumer protections, \nhelps children in need of child support, and makes other necessary \nreforms to a system that is open to abuse.\n  As we move to consideration of this legislation, I am heartened, but \nnot surprised, by the results of the nationwide voter poll conducted \nfor the Credit Union National Association which indicates broad public \nsupport for reforming our bankruptcy system.\n  According to the poll, the vast majority of people believe that \nindividuals who file for bankruptcy should be required to pay back some \nof their debts if they have the means to do so.\n  This is precisely what the bankruptcy reform legislation is designed \nto do. The late Erma Bombeck once asked her husband, ``What do you \nthink I'd do if I won a million dollars?'' ``You'd spend $2 million,'' \nhe said. The reason her anecdote is funny is that it rings so true. \nMany people, even during the best of economic times, do not exercise \nfinancial responsibility.\n  The poll also shows that most people think it should be more \ndifficult for people to file for bankruptcy. This finding indicates to \nme that Americans have had enough. They believe it should be made more \ndifficult for people to file for bankruptcy. Fourteen percent strongly \noppose that provision, 14 percent somewhat oppose, 24 percent somewhat \nfavor it, and 40 percent strongly favor, or 64 to 28. So it is a very \nimportant thing when you think about it.\n  I have to say that, as I have mentioned the poll shows, most people \nthink it should be more difficult for people to file for bankruptcy. \nThis finding indicates to me that Americans have had enough; they are \ntired of paying for high rollers who game the current system and its \nloopholes to get out of paying their fair share.\n  Although this legislation does not make it more difficult for people \nto file for bankruptcy, it does eliminate some of the opportunities for \nabuse that exist under the current system. Our current system allows \nwealthy people to continue to abuse the system at the expense of \neveryone else. People with high incomes can run up massive debts and \nthen use bankruptcy to get out of honoring them.\n  All of us end up paying for the unscrupulous who abuse the system. In \nfact, it has been estimated that every American family pays as much as \n$550 a year in a hidden tax as a result of the actions from these \nabuses. The bankruptcy reform legislation will help eliminate this \nhidden tax by implementing a means test to make wealthy people who can \nrepay their debts actually honor them. I suppose we can call this a tax \ncut for the responsible people in America.\n  There are numerous examples of people who take advantage of loopholes \nat the expense of everyone else. I recently heard from the President of \na credit union in Wisconsin who told me about a young couple who wanted \na ``clean financial slate'' before they got married. What did they do? \nThey ran up their credit card purchases. One of them prepaid on a car \nloan with the credit union to have the other cosigner released. Then, \nalthough they were both employed full time, they filed for bankruptcy \nto wipe out all their debt. The credit union--and its members--had to \neat the $3,000 in credit card debt and another couple of hundred \ndollars on the car.\n  Bankruptcy relief was never meant to allow this kind of abuse. That \nis a minor story compared to the millions of examples that over the \nyears could be cited. Hard-working Americans, including the members of \ncredit unions nationwide, have been victimized by abusers of the \ncurrent bankruptcy system long enough.\n  Bankruptcy abuse also hurts our Nation's small businesses. As Thomas \nDonahue, the president and CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said \nrecently:\n  Without congressional action, losses from bankruptcy abuses will \ncontinue to break the banks, and backs, of the Nation's small \nbusinesses and retailers, which work with slim profit margins and an \neven smaller margin for error.\n  Make no mistake, misrepresentations about this legislation have been \nrunning rampant by those who oppose any meaningful bankruptcy reform. \nPerhaps we can take some comfort in the words of former British Prime \nMinister Harold MacMillan who said:\n\n       I have never found, in a long experience of politics, that \n     criticism is ever inhibited by ignorance.\n\n  Despite the allegations of opponents of reform, the poor are not \naffected by the means test. The legislation provides a ``safe harbor'' \nfor those who fall below the median income, so they are not subjected \nto the means test at all.\n  Another misrepresentation I have heard again and again is that this \nlegislation won't let people file for bankruptcy relief when they need \nit. The fact is, this legislation does not deny anyone access to \nbankruptcy relief; it just requires those who have the means to repay \ndebts based on their income to do so. It is that simple.\n  Opponents of this legislation have also waged the claim that it \nsomehow hurts women and children. This falsehood is a particularly \ndisturbing one for me to hear because I have had a long history of \nadvocating for children and families in Congress. I have worked \ntirelessly, provision by provision, to make this legislation \ndramatically improve the position of children and ex-spouses who are \nentitled to domestic support.\n  It can be difficult to get the word out when misrepresentations \nabound about what bankruptcy reform legislation really does. In fact, \nthe bankruptcy legislation will put a stop to letting deadbeat parents \nuse bankruptcy to avoid paying child support. This bill would mean \nputting an end to paying lawyers ahead of the children who rely on \nchild support. Current bankruptcy law simply is not adequate, and, \nfrankly, I was outraged to learn of the many ways deadbeat parents are \nmanipulating and abusing the current bankruptcy system in order to get \nout of paying for their domestic support obligations. This bill is a \ntremendous improvement for children and families over current law. That \nis why there is such overwhelming support for this legislation from the \nchild support professionals across the country--the very people who go \nafter deadbeats to get children the support they need.\n  I hope those who oppose any reform to our Nation's bankruptcy system \nwill not engage in petty parliamentary tactics and try to encumber it \nwith frivolous amendments. Nevertheless, I am optimistic that this \nmuch-needed bankruptcy reform legislation will be signed into law this \nyear. We have a\n\n[[Page S1795]]\n\nno-nonsense President in the White House who understands the importance \nof personal responsibility. So let's enact this meaningful bankruptcy \nreform. As I said last year, the American people have waited long \nenough for it, and it is time for us to do what really is in the best \ninterest of the people at large. It is time to give this, in effect, \ntax cut to the millions of people out there who are paying, on the \naverage, an extra $550 a year because of those abusing the system.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, bankruptcy is a complex area of the law. It \nhas competing public policy interests between debtors and creditors and \namong competing creditors.\n  The complex and competing interests involved in achieving fair and \nbalanced reforms of our bankruptcy system demand we work in a \nbipartisan manner throughout the legislative process. Actually, that is \nthe lesson we learned from failed attempts of past reform measures, and \nit is all the more relevant with an evenly divided Senate.\n  The Republican leadership in the Senate and of the Judiciary \nCommittee I felt did not want the Judiciary Committee involved in \nshaping bankruptcy reform legislation this year, but over the last \ncouple of weeks the committee was able to hold an informative hearing \nand a markup that began the process of improving the bill.\n  In fact, when we finally started talking about amendments to greatly \nimprove the bill, we spent less than 4 or 5 hours. Eight amendments \nwere adopted by the Judiciary Committee during a couple hours of work \non Tuesday and a couple hours of work on Wednesday, and we improved it.\n  I am pleased to learn of the majority leader's remarks on Wednesday \nwhen he congratulated the committee for its positive action and for \ncompleting its work on an expedited basis last week. The point being: \nJust put us in a room, actually have us all there, and give us a little \ntime. We usually work these things out. We can do the same thing on the \nfloor. If the leadership wants us to complete this bill, we can do it \nexpeditiously.\n  The bill the Senate begins considering today is the bill that \noriginated in the Judiciary Committee, S. 420, with those important \ncommittee amendments already incorporated. The committee held an \ninformative hearing and markup which has improved the bill in several \nkey areas. I commend the Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee \nfor their amendments and for their willingness to expedite committee \naction on this measure. I will give an example.\n  Senator Feinstein pointed out a number of aspects of the bill need \nfurther refinement and our attention with respect to the harshness of \nthe means test and the need for balance with regard to consumer credit \ndisclosures and solicitations. In addition, she coauthored with Senator \nFeingold an amendment that the committee debated and adopted by a 10-8 \nvote to provide balance and fairness to the bill's landlord-tenant \nprovisions. I know the Senator from California will continue her good \nwork so that the bill considered by the Senate is further improved.\n  During the markup, the committee adopted a number of improvements to \nthe bill. We also showed what happens when we work in a bipartisan \nfashion.\n  I commend the chairman and Senator Schumer for reaching agreement on \none of the most contentious issues in the bankruptcy debate in the last \nCongress: the discharge of penalties for violence against family \nplanning clinics.\n  I believe the compromise Senator Hatch and Senator Schumer worked \nout, along with help from my staff, was possible in part because of the \npowerful testimony at our committee hearing on the need to end this \nabusive practice.\n  During our hearing on bankruptcy reform legislation, Maria Vullo, a \ntop-rate attorney, testified about the need to amend the bankruptcy \ncode to stop wasteful litigation and end abusive bankruptcy filings \nthat are used only to avoid the legal consequences of violence, \nvandalism, and harassment to deny access to legal health services. I \nbelieve she impressed all members of the committee. I think she made \nall members of the committee realize we have to move on this issue.\n\n  As a result of the amendment adopted by the committee last week, \nperpetrators of clinic violence will no longer be able to seek shelter \nin the Nation's bankruptcy courts.\n  In addition, the committee adopted a Leahy-Hatch amendment to protect \nthe personal privacy of consumers whose information is held by firms in \nbankruptcy. The amendment of the Senator from Utah and I permits \nbankruptcy courts to honor the privacy policy of business debtors and \ncreates a consumer privacy ombudsman to protect personal privacy in \nbankruptcy proceedings.\n  I appreciate the chairman's effort in joining me on this amendment to \nadd important consumer privacy protections to the bankruptcy code.\n  The irony is, the Leahy-Hatch amendment would not even be needed if \neverybody was doing what they should. The Leahy-Hatch amendment is \nneeded because the customer list and databases of failed firms can now \nbe put up for sale in bankruptcy without any privacy considerations, \nand even in violation of the failed firm's own public privacy policy \nagainst the sale of personal customer information to third parties.\n  Let me explain what happens. You have an online company and they have \na privacy policy that guarantees privacy of your family's information: \nYou can give us all the details about your children, you can give us \nall this information because we promise you we will never sell it to \nanybody else; we will never give it to anybody else.\n  They keep their word, but they go into bankruptcy. The bankruptcy \ncourt looks at the file and says the only thing you have left worth any \nmoney is this list of names of these children, their parents, whomever. \nIt is valuable. The trustee in the bankruptcy says: I have sworn an \noath; I have to uphold the law. I have to sell that list. Suddenly the \nlist you thought was sacrosanct is sold. I will give an example.\n  Toysmart.com. is a failed online toy store. It filed for bankruptcy \nlast year. Its databases and customer lists were put up for sale as \npart of the bankruptcy proceeding. It went on the auction block even \nthough they promised that all the information would never be allowed \nout.\n  The Leahy-Hatch amendment that we adopted in committee adds privacy \nprotections and a consumer privacy ombudsman to the bankruptcy code to \nprevent future cases such as Toysmart.com.\n  We adopted several amendments by Senator Feingold to strengthen \nchapter 12 to help our family farmers with the difficulties they face.\n  I offered another amendment that added a number of temporary \nbankruptcy judgeships to the bill, actually in line with the \nrecommendations of the Judicial Conference of the United States.\n  All in all, the eight amendments the committee adopted to the initial \nproposal began the process of improving the bill during this Congress. \nWe worked expeditiously in the Judiciary Committee to accommodate the \ninterests of the majority leader in having prompt action on this \nmeasure. We did so in spite of the fact that this committee has not \ntaken the organizational actions necessary to adopt a budget and to \ncreate subcommittees.\n  I thank the Members on my side of the aisle who have been willing to \nmake quorums and move forward even though we have yet to organize the \ncommittee.\n  Last Wednesday, the majority leader said on the Senate floor:\n\n       I think the committee needs to be congratulated because the \n     committee worked yesterday, it worked again today, and it \n     completed its work. I do not know how many amendments \n     actually were considered, but they dealt in some way with as \n     many as 30 amendments and I guess voted on a whole lot of \n     them.\n\n  I thank the majority leader for his kind words about the Judiciary \nCommittee's consideration of this bill.\n  The majority leader also stated on the Senate floor last week that he \nhoped ``for a full and free debate--amendments will be offered, \nconsidered, and voted on.''\n  I agree we should have such a full and free debate. It is actually \nthe best way to proceed. The irony is we have a lot of discussion about \nshould the Judiciary Committee mark this bill up or not mark it up? \nShould we meet on this bill or not meet on this bill? We spent more \ntime talking about meeting\n\n[[Page S1796]]\n\non the bill than we actually did when we sat down.\n  When we sat down and followed the normal process, we considered the \namendments, we voted them up or down and sent the bill to the \nfloor. The Senate works best when it can openly and freely work its \nwill on major legislation.\n\n  Senators will return tomorrow. If we start voting on this early, \nbring up amendments, vote on this early tomorrow, go into the early \nevening, do the same on Wednesday, probably into Thursday morning, we \ncan easily finish this bill so long as we don't interrupt it for other \nwork.\n  We made a good start in the Judiciary Committee, but there are some \nissues that have to be held to the floor. We did not address the \nhomestead exemption cap. Certainly that is a huge loophole where \nsomebody could dump a whole lot of money in a few States into \nmultimillion-dollar mansions and then declare bankruptcy and hide it \nfrom creditors.\n  We didn't talk about consumer credit card disclosures. Chairman Hatch \nasked that a number of these amendments be reserved for floor action. I \nagreed so as to help move this out of committee. But now we are ready \nto offer those amendments.\n  I believe we can craft a balanced bankruptcy reform law that corrects \nabuses by debtors and creditors in the current bankruptcy system. For \nexample, we should provide for more disclosure of information so \nconsumers may better manage their debts and avoid bankruptcy \naltogether. They must have a better idea what it means when they sign \nup for a credit card. They ought to have some idea when they are told, \nhere is the minimum payment for the month. They also ought to have \nsomething saying, if you carry the minimum payment, here is what you \nwill owe in the end, which may be many times what was paid for the item \nin the first place.\n  I know Senators Levin, Durbin, Schumer, Dodd, and others share a \ncommitment to include credit industry reforms in a fair and balanced \nbankruptcy bill.\n  Billions of credit card solicitations made to American consumers in \nthe past few years have contributed to the rise in consumer debt and \nbankruptcies, including a 7 or 8 year old receiving a credit card with \na long line of credit, or a dog gets a credit card. Somebody puts their \ndog's name on an answer to a letter, and suddenly the dog is getting a \ncredit card with an approval letter: Dear Mr. Rover Leahy: We are so \nimpressed with your past credit card we are now giving you a $2,000 \ncredit line.\n  When it comes to kids in school who can barely get enough money to go \nto the movies, credit card companies say: Dear Student: With your great \ncredit card, here is $2,000, $3,000.\n  The idea is if you start using it, you get hooked on using that one \ncredit card. On one side we have people trying to hook kids on drugs; \non the other side, we have credit card companies trying to hook them on \ncredit cards. In fact, it is estimated that last year credit card \ncompanies mailed 3.3 billion solicitations. In case you wonder why your \nmail is late, it is because of the credit card solicitations.\n  Many of the most controversial proposals for changing this bill are \nto benefit the credit card industry. A lot of what is driving the \nconsideration of this bill is that the credit card industry is going to \nget some real big gifts. The biggest gift is to give to the credit card \nindustry the taxpayer pays for bankruptcy courts and the authority of \nthe Federal law to help them with the collection practices of these \ncompanies after they have given the credit card to your pet dog or your \nkids in school or your aging parent in a nursing home.\n  Business Week recently reported Dean Witter estimated this bill would \nboost the earnings of credit card companies by 5 percent a year. Want \nto know about a gift? This bill at present would give credit card \ncompanies alone a 5-percent increase. I would like to become the CEO of \none of those credit card companies, hope the bill passes, and I could \nsay: Look, our earnings went up.\n\n  One credit card company, MBNA, would make in profit--not in earnings, \nbut in profit--$75 million a year, according to the Business Week \narticle, if we pass this bill the way it is.\n  They will make a lot of money. If some of their lobbyists are outside \nsinging jingle bells, it is not just the snow that shut down the \nWashington area this morning that encouraged them; it is this bill. In \nfact, it is only fair if the credit card industry is going to get the \nprofits, they ought to be involved in bankruptcy reform. They ought to \nbe asked to show how the changes they seek will benefit consumers. If \nthey are going to make the extra profits, if they are going around \nsaying it will benefit consumers, let me see the lower interest rates. \nLet me see the lower fees.\n  If this bill passes and gets signed into law, let us all ask the \ncredit cards, where are the lower fees? Where are the lower interest \nrates? Who wants to bet we will see them?\n  There is no guarantee the billions in credit industry profits are \ngoing to be passed along to the consumers. I happen to agree with \nPresident Bush. He underlined the importance of examining credit \nindustry practices when discussing the state of America's economy.\n  President Bush said he will ``remind Members of both the Senate and \nthe House that there is a lot of debt at the Federal level, but there \nis a lot of debt at the private level. We've got a lot of people \nstruggling to pay off credit card consumer debt.''\n  I am one Democrat who says President Bush is absolutely right. I \nagree with him. I think we ought to tell the credit card companies if \nyou are going to get a big windfall from the Senate and the House, give \nsomething back to the consumers, and stop trying to hook kids on credit \nand credit cards that they can never pay off in their lifetime. Stop \ntrying to hook them when they are in college, stop trying to hook \nparents who are strapped already with more credit cards without telling \nthem what it will really cost them if they get behind.\n  Another improvement we should make is to address the problem of \nwealthy debtors who use overly broad homestead exemptions to shield \nassets from their creditors. Senator Kohl has been a leader on this \nissue and a champion for closing down the loophole for the rich.\n  In some States, wealthy debtors have million-dollar mansions that are \nprotected from bankruptcy. There has been an abuse of the bankruptcy \nfresh start protection. In the last Congress, the Senate \noverwhelmingly, Republicans and Democrats, voted to close this loophole \nof the bankruptcy code. By a vote of 76-22, the Senate adopted a \nbipartisan amendment offered by Senators Kohl and Sessions to cap \nhomestead exemption at $100,000. But the giveaway bill this year guts \nthat provision. We have to put it back in. We want to make this law \nhave a sense of being balanced.\n  At our hearing in the committee, Brady Williamson, the former chair \nof the National Bankruptcy Reform Commission, testified that ending \nhomestead abuse was a key consensus recommendation of the Bankruptcy \nReform Commission.\n  I think we should remember as we go through this week what purpose \nbankruptcy serves. It is a safety net for many Americans. That is why \nit has been here since the beginning of this country. Those who use \nbankruptcy are usually the most vulnerable of the American middle \nclass. They are older Americans who have lost their jobs or are unable \nto pay their medical debts. They are women attempting to raise their \nfamilies or secure alimony and child support after a divorce. They are \nindividuals struggling to recover from unemployment.\n  As we move forward with reforms that are appropriate to eliminating \nabuses in the system, we need to remember the people that use the \nsystem, both the debtor and the creditor. We need to balance the \ninterests of creditors with those of middle-class Americans who need \nthe opportunity to resolve overwhelming financial burdens.\n  The last two Congresses proved there are many competing interests in \nthe bankruptcy reform debate that make it difficult to enact a balanced \nand bipartisan bill. By working in a bipartisan fashion from the \nbeginning of the amendment process to the end, we can craft reforms and \nensure our bankruptcy laws better serve the intended\n\n[[Page S1797]]\n\ngoals and correct abuses of the bankruptcy system by debtors and \ncreditors. That is why I say let the process work through. Bring up \namendments. Some will be adopted; some will not.\n  Nobody is out here to delay it. We are just trying to make a better \nbill. Let's do something about the homestead exemption. Let's do \nsomething about appropriate disclosure to consumers.\n  Let us make this a better bill and then send something to the \nPresident that he can be proud to sign, knowing it is consistent with \nwhat he said about a lot of people struggling to pay off credit card \ndebt. The President will know that we have done something consistent \nwith what he said just in the last couple of days.\n  I will work with Senator Hatch and my good friend, Senator Grassley \nfrom Iowa, to make more improvements on the Senate floor. Let's reach a \nbipartisan consensus that can be enacted into law. Let's do it in the \nnext couple of days. Let's work on this. Let's start voting early \ntomorrow on it and let's wrap it up. Let's not go off this until we \nfinish. If we do that, we can complete our work.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kennedy). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, for the last hour or so we have been \nprivileged to hear comments from Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy who \ndiscussed the debate of the bankruptcy reform legislation, which took \nplace in the Judiciary Committee over the last several weeks. We now \nhave the opportunity, today and tomorrow, to begin amending the \nbankruptcy reform legislation that was vetoed by President Clinton last \nyear.\n  I wish to express my own appreciation to both Democrats and \nRepublicans on the Judiciary Committee for letting the process work, \nand for moving the process forward.\n  I especially thank Senator Schumer and Senator Hatch for working out \na compromise on those who would use bankruptcy as a way to avoid their \nresponsibilities; or for those who have brought action against family \nplanning clinics, or, frankly, any act of violence, intimidation or \nthreat.\n  I am appreciative of Senator Leahy and Senator Hatch for the work \nthey have done in trying to make sure that consumer privacy protections \nare provided in this legislation.\n  The history of bankruptcy is known by many people. For much of the \nlast century, individuals and businesses have been able to seek \nprotection through bankruptcy in order to put their lives back \ntogether, or their businesses back together. Several chapters that \nexist for bankruptcy are designed to provide a place for consumers to \nfind relief.\n  In the last decade we have witnessed some of the strongest economic \nexpansion in our country's history--the longest economic expansion in \nour Nation's history--yet during the 1990s we have seen an alarming \nincrease in the number of people filing for bankruptcy.\n  Not all of those people who filed for bankruptcy had any other \nrecourse. In fact, the lion's share of the people who filed for \nbankruptcy last year--or the year before that and the year before \nthat--were folks who were up against the wall. They needed a way out \nand for them bankruptcy was that way out.\n\n  There are people who lost their jobs; people whose family suffered \nillnesses; maybe catastrophic illnesses; or marriages that were \ndissolved; or relationships that came to an end. And because of those \nsituations and others like them, those families need the protection of \nbankruptcy.\n  Not everyone who files for bankruptcy needs the protection afforded \nthem in chapter 7. For some who file, chapter 7 is not the appropriate \nvenue, because they have the ability to pay at least a portion of their \ndebt. If an individual can repay some of their debt, they should \ninstead file under chapter 13.\n  The challenge that the committees in the Senate and House faced last \nyear was to try to figure out a fair way to determine who indeed had \nthe ability to pay something of their debts and who did not.\n  Among the other reasons why we need reform--it has been alluded to \nbefore, and I will touch on it briefly--is that under current \nbankruptcy law those who have an obligation to pay child support, or \nthose who have an obligation to make alimony payments, in many cases \nfind those priorities low on their list. And, frankly, they are pretty \nlow on the list of the bankruptcy laws of our land. We need to do \nsomething about that. This legislation would. It would raise the \npriority of child support payments and alimony payments as well.\n  Currently those who have those kinds of obligations to their \nchildren, or to a former spouse, also have to try to use something \ncalled the automatic stay as a way to avoid meeting those obligations \nwhile their bankruptcy case winds its way through court, and sometimes \nthis can be a long period of time. This legislation would end the \nautomatic stay for child support and alimony payments, making sure \nindividuals are responsible for these personal obligations.\n  State and local governments are affected as well. As former Governor \nof Delaware, and former chairman of the National Governors' \nAssociation, one of the reasons why the National Governors' Association \nsupported bankruptcy reform was to make sure individuals who had the \nability to pay some of their State and local taxes were called upon to \ndo that where it was reasonable. This legislation would do that.\n  In the end, when people who have the ability to pay, do not pay and \nwalk away from those debts, the rest of us end up paying the costs of \ntheir bankruptcy. Businesses and creditors have to swallow the debt. \nThen, those of us who borrow money--whether it is for a house, or for a \ncar, or for credit card purchases--in the end we pay more than we \nreally ought to. This is not fair to the majority of us who pay our \nbills.\n  I have only been in the Senate for about 2 months. One of the \ncomments I have heard most frequently is the old adage ``don't let the \nperfect be the enemy of the good.'' My guess is we are going to hear \nthat a lot on the Senate floor this week. I will be the first to say \nit.\n  This bill represents in many respects so much that is needed. The \nchanges don't do everything I would like. I will mention a couple of \nconcerns that I have.\n  I think it was Senator Leahy who spoke a few moments ago about the \ncredit card applications that come to our children.\n  In some cases rather young children, even to our pets. I think he \nreferred to Rover, Rover Leahy. I do not know if his dog actually did \nget a credit card application. I would just say we get a lot of mail in \nour home. I am sure we all do. We probably get more credit card \nsolicitations than we would like. But we simply throw them away if we \nare not interested.\n  If credit card issuers or, frankly, others who are extending credit \nare so foolish as to extend credit to a pet or to a child, who does not \nhave the ability to repay that obligation, that is a poor underwriting \ndecision by the extender of the credit. And they deserve, in the end, \nwhat they will get. It is issued probably to someone who either maybe \nwill not use it, or if they do use it, it is perhaps not with the \nintent of ever paying that obligation.\n  For the real person who is actually extended the credit card under \nthose circumstances, under this bill, if they do not have the ability \nto pay, if, indeed, their income is under a median family income, they \nhave a safe harbor. If they have to declare bankruptcy, they will \ncontinue to have the ability to file under chapter 7 and will not have \nto pay that obligation.\n  Senator Leahy also mentioned the issue of disclosure. We get our \ncredit card statements whenever they come. There is a statement on the \ncredit card that says: If you pay your minimum monthly amount that is \ndue, you can do so and not incur any kind of penalty. The credit card \ndoes not say how long it is going to take you to actually pay off your \ncredit card bill if you only pay the minimum.\n\n[[Page S1798]]\n\n  I wish there was some way to address that in a way that does not put \nthe extender, the creditor, in harm's way with respect to class action \nlawsuits. This is a difficult situation.\n  The bill that is before us this week does provide an example to those \nof us who are consumers and explains that if we only pay the minimum \npayment, it may take an extended period of time to pay our credit card \nbill. It actually uses an example, as I understand it. Creditors, in \nthis case, issuers of a credit card, are to provide on the statement an \nexample that if this is how much you owe, and you pay your minimum \npayment--and this is the interest rate--this is how long it will take \nyou to actually pay down your obligation. They actually offer a 1-800 \nnumber that someone can call to say: ``My debt is $800. That is what my \nstatement says. My minimum payment is $20 a month. How long will it \ntake me to pay it off?'' We can get an answer by calling the 1-800 \nnumber.\n  I wish we had the ability to put a close estimate of what the debt \nwould cost a consumer, and how long it would take to pay off, right on \nthe credit card statement. I am told the reason why the bill out of \ncommittee does not do that is because of concerns about class action \nlawsuits. That is a legitimate concern but, for me, the solution is not \na perfect one.\n  The other issue I wish we could address is the homestead exemption. I \nunderstand Senator Kohl may try to address this issue this week. People \nroll up big debts and then go to a State that has a large homestead \nexemption, and they put a lot of money, a lot of assets therein, for \nexample, a very expensive home--a quarter of a million dollars, half a \nmillion dollars, or million-dollar home--and then walk away from their \nother obligations and use that estate, that homestead to protect their \nassets.\n  I understand Senator Kohl is going to offer an amendment that makes \nthis practice somewhat more difficult to do. I welcome that provision.\n  But most of the people who file for bankruptcy are not folks who seek \nto try to stiff credit card or financial institutions or department \nstores or anyone else. They are people who are left with little other \nchoice. As I said earlier, they have been dealt, in many cases, a \ndifficult or maybe a crippling blow in their lives. More than 90 \npercent of the people who file for bankruptcy actually need the \nprotection of the laws, and fewer than 10 percent actually have the \nability to pay something back.\n  But of those people who do have the ability to pay something back, I \nbelieve--and I suspect almost all of us believe--that they should repay \nat least a portion of their debts. I don't care if it is only 5 percent \nof the people who file who have the ability to pay something back--or 4 \npercent or 3 percent--if they have the ability, they should make that \neffort. We should expect that of them and of ourselves.\n  A major challenge the committee has faced, and the Congress has \nfaced, in trying to craft an appropriate balance--weighing the concerns \nand rights of consumers versus those who extend the credit--is in \nrelation to the tough questions that we have dealt with, such as how do \nyou actually determine the ability to repay? We all come from different \nfamily circumstances in terms of employment, marital status, and \nillness. How do we determine who has the ability to repay? The \ncommittee, to its credit, has provided for a safe harbor, essentially \nto say people whose median family income falls below that of 100 \npercent of the median family income with respect to their State, they \nwould automatically have a safe harbor. They could file for bankruptcy \nin chapter 7, and they basically get a free pass.\n  What is 100 percent of median family income? I think for a family of \nfour in Delaware, it is about $45,000 a year. I think in Maryland, it \nis about $50,000 a year; and in Alabama, it is perhaps $35,000 a year.\n  For those whose family income is between 100 percent of median family \nincome and 150 percent of median family income, they would receive, not \na complete pass, but a rather cursory review to see if they would not \nalso qualify for that safe harbor.\n  So we are talking about, in Maryland, for example, those whose income \nis between $50,000 and $75,000 would be below the 150-percent \nthreshold, and I think would, for the most part, after an expedited \nreview, have the right to file under chapter 7.\n  I think it is appropriate to ask, for one who files for bankruptcy, \nwhat kind of expenses are factored in when determining whether or not a \nperson has the ability to pay? We get beyond these thresholds of 100 \npercent of median family income, 150 percent of median family income. \nIs anything else taken into account? As it turns out, a number of \npayments are. And they are the kind of payments we would expect for \npeople to be able to hold their households together and be able to \nwork.\n  For example, a person who is asking to file under chapter 7, as \nopposed to chapter 13, if their income exceeds those thresholds of 100 \npercent or 150 percent of median family income, they could present \ndocumentation to the bankruptcy court indicating how much their housing \ncosts, their rent or mortgage payments are. If they have car payments, \nthose would be appropriate, as well as would education expenses, \nclothing, and food allowances. Judges are given discretion to address \nspecial needs as well, including medical costs.\n  Let me close by saying Senator Leahy, in his comments, talked about \nhow many credit card solicitations are mailed out every year. I think \nhe indicated the number is over 3 billion. That is a lot of mail. I \nwould just remind everyone, as those credit card solicitations come \ninto our mail boxes, of course, we do not have to take advantage of all \nof them. When I drive down the road in Delaware, and I go by an ice \ncream store or a doughnut shop, as much as I might be tempted to pull \nin and sample their wares, I do not always do that. We have to show \nsome personal discretion regardless of how tempting those treats might \nbe.\n\n  But if financial institutions actually do make money, and if their \nbottom lines are enhanced to some extent by the adoption of this \nlegislation, my guess is, in the end, they all do not keep that money. \nMy guess is, in the end, if you think about the competition--and it is \na dog-eat-dog world these days in the credit card business--if I do not \nlike the interest payment that comes with my credit card, I can find \ndozens of other issuers with a lower rate. If I do not like the monthly \nfee that I am asked to pay, I can find dozens of other issuers with \nlower monthly fees.\n  I would simply suggest the competitive nature of the business, \nincluding the credit card business, is such that for those issuers of \ncredit cards who do not pass along some of those savings to consumers, \nthen their competitors will. If competitors lower their interest rates \nand reduce or eliminate their monthly fees, those of us who are \nconsumers will move off to take advantage of their lower interest rates \nand lower fees.\n  Let me conclude with these comments. I am glad we are at this point \nin the debate. I look forward to the debate over the next several days. \nI am very pleased we are going to have this debate. And those who have \namendments, if they want to offer them, will have the opportunity to do \nso. We will debate them, and vote on them, and then vote on final \npassage.\n  I hope the amendments make the bill even a little better than it is \ntoday. I think it is better today than it was going into the committee \na week or so ago. I am pleased to participate in the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, bankruptcy judges, scholars, \npractitioners, labor unions, consumer advocacy organizations, and civil \nrights groups have uniformly rejected the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2001 \nbecause its harsh and excessive provisions will have a devastating \neffect on working families.\n  Despite their words of warning, two of the most profitable industries \nin America--the credit card industry and the banking industry--have \ninsisted upon a harsh bill that will fatten their bottom line while \nunfairly penalizing vulnerable Americans.\n  While we do need to pass a bill to reduce the fraud and abuse within \nthe bankruptcy system, this bill will not accomplish that goal. This \nbill will hurt women, children, and hard-working American families, \nthose who truly need the bankruptcy system to prevent unintended \nfinancial hardship.\n\n[[Page S1799]]\n\n  This is no time to pass such harsh legislation. For weeks, President \nBush has warned the Nation about the perils of an economic downturn. \nPointing toward layoffs and rising unemployment, decreasing consumer \nconfidence, and minimal economic growth, President Bush is urging \nCongress to act to strengthen the economy. But punitive bankruptcy \nreform legislation does not fall into that category. Now more than \never, we need to ensure that Americans losing their jobs or struggling \nwith medical debt have the second chance for economic security that the \nbankruptcy laws are intended to provide. It makes no sense to pull the \nrug out from under them, just as the economy is weakening.\n  We need to separate the myths from the facts--and focus on the real \nwinners and losers under the proposed legislation. By any fair \nanalysis, this bankruptcy bill is the credit industry's wish list, a \nblatant effort to increase its profits at the expense of working \nfamilies.\n  We know the circumstances and market forces that often push middle \nclass Americans into bankruptcy.\n  Rising unemployment and company layoffs are major parts of the \nproblem. In recent months, the slowing economy has caused a noticeable \njump in the national unemployment rate. It rose to 4.2 percent in \nJanuary, the highest level in 16 months. The slowing economy has also \ntriggered massive layoffs. Within the past weeks, Verizon announced its \nplan to cut approximately 10,000 jobs, and Daimler Chrysler announced \nit would drastically cut its workforce by eliminating 26,000 jobs over \nthe next three years. Xerox plans to eliminate 800 jobs on top of the \n5,200 cut last Fall. Telecommunications giant World Com reported plans \nto lay off up to 15 percent of its workforce, a loss of 11,500 jobs. \nSara Lee plans to lay off 7,000 employees. AOL-Time Warner wants to cut \n2,000 jobs. Lucent Technologies plans to eliminate 10,000 workers. The \nlayoffs go on and on. Overall, companies have announced plans to lay \noff close to 70,000 workers--and the year has just begun.\n  Often, when workers lose their current good jobs, they are unable to \nrecover. In a February 2000 survey conducted by the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics that approximately one-fourth of workers displaced from \nfull-time wage and salary jobs received earnings substantially lower \nthan what they had received before they lost their jobs. It is all too \ncommon for laid-off workers to be forced to accept part-time jobs, \ntemporary jobs, or jobs with fewer or no benefits at all.\n  Divorce is another major cause of bankruptcy. Divorce rates have \nsoared in recent decades, and the financial consequences are \nparticularly devastating for women. Divorced women are four times more \nlikely to file for bankruptcy than married women or single men. In \n1999, 540,000 women who head their own households filed for bankruptcy \nto try to stabilize their lives; 200,000 of them were also creditors \ntrying to collect child support or alimony. The rest were debtors \nstruggling to make ends meet.\n  Another major factor in bankruptcy is the high cost of health care. \nForty-three million Americans have no health insurance, and many more \nare underinsured. Each year, millions of families spend more than 20 \npercent of their income on medical care. Older Americans are hit \nparticularly hard. A 1998 CRS Report states that even though Medicare \nprovides generally good health coverage for older Americans, half of \nthis age group spend 14 percent or more of their after-tax income on \nout-of-pocket health costs, including insurance premiums, co-payments \nand prescription drugs.\n  A report published in Norton's Bankruptcy Adviser says:\n\n       The data reported here serve as a reminder that self-\n     funding medical treatment and loss of income during a bout of \n     illness or recovery from an accident make a substantial \n     number of middle class families vulnerable to financial \n     collapse. For middle class people, there is little government \n     help, so that when private insurance is inadequate, \n     bankruptcy serves by default as a means for dealing with the \n     financial consequences of a serious medical problem.\n\n  These are the desperate individuals and families from whom the credit \ncard industry believes it can squeeze higher profits. The industry \nclaims that these men and women are cheating and abusing the bankruptcy \nsystem, and are irresponsibly using their credit cards to live in a \nluxury they cannot afford.\n  These Americans are not cheats and frauds, but they do constitute the \nvast number of Americans in bankruptcy. Two out of every three \nbankruptcy filers have an employment problem. Two out of every five \nbankruptcy filers have a health care problem. Divorced or separated \npeople are three times more likely than married couples to file for \nbankruptcy. Working men and women in economic free fall often have no \nchoice except bankruptcy. Yet, the credit card industry is determined \nto deny them the safety net they need.\n  There is no doubt that large numbers of Americans will be harmed by \nthis legislation. They do the right thing and play by the rules. They \nwork hard and try to provide for their children. But sometimes, \nunexpected tragedy strikes, and nothing can prepare them for the \nfinancial difficulties they will encounter.\n  The Trapp family of Plantation, FL is one of these families. They are \nnot wealthy cheats trying to escape from their financial \nresponsibilities. They are a middle class family engulfed in debt, \nbecause of circumstances beyond their control.\n  Mr. and Mrs. Trapp worked as letter carriers for 12 years. Both \nworked before and after their three children were born. They had a good \nlife, but an unexpected medical obstacle occurred. Their 4 year old \ndaughter, Annelise, contracted a muscle disease that is similar to a \nvery rare form of Muscular Dystrophy. Her muscles are very weak. She \nneeds a respirator to breathe, and she also needs constant nursing \ncare.\n  The Trapps had good health insurance through the United States Postal \nService. But even with this comprehensive coverage, Annelise's medical \nexpenses left the family with massive debts. Their insurance has paid \nmillions of dollars, but the Trapps' portion of the bills was still \n$124,000. This debt combined with $26,000 owed on a specially \nmanufactured van to accommodate Annelise made it impossible for the \nfamily to meet its financial obligations. They were forced to declare \nbankruptcy.\n  Proponents of the bill argue that the Trapp family would not be \naffected by the means test, because their current income is below the \nState median income. That is not true. Before Mrs. Trapp left her job, \nthe family's annual income was $83,000 a year or $6,900 a month. Under \nthe bill, the Trapp family's previous six months' income would be \naveraged, so that they would have an average monthly income of about \n$6,200--above the State median --even though their actual monthly gross \nincome at the time of filing was $4,800.\n  Based upon the fictitious income assumed by the legislation, the \nTrapp family would be subject to the means test. And the means test \nformula--using the IRS standards--assumes that the Trapps have the \nability to repay more than their actual income would allow.\n  This harsh legislation is an undeserved windfall for one of the most \nprofitable and powerful industries in America. Credit card companies \nare engaged in massive and unseemly nationwide campaigns to hook \nunsuspecting citizens; like the elderly, college students, and the \nworking poor, on credit card debt. In 1999 alone, Americans received 3 \nbillion--3 billion--credit card solicitations. That's more than three \ntimes the 900 million mailings they received in 1992.\n  The average American household is carrying $7,500 worth of debt, 150 \npercent higher than a decade ago. A major cause of the problem is that \nthe cost of credit has gone up, and credit card companies are \nbolstering their profits through heavy penalties and aggressive \ncollection practices. Credit card companies are also targeting \nmarketing campaigns at those who cannot afford to pile up such debts. \nInstead of helping these individuals recover from their debts, the \nindustry is supporting legislation that will only drive them deeper \ninto financial despair.\n  Supporters of the bill argue that it is not a pro-credit card \nindustry bill. But, to deal effectively and comprehensively with the \nproblem of bankruptcy, we have to deal with the problem of debt. We \nmust see that the credit card industry does not abandon fair lending \npolicies to fatten its bottom line, or ask Congress to become the \ncollector for its unpaid credit card bills.\n\n[[Page S1800]]\n\n  The industry and congressional supporters of the bill attempt to \nargue that the bankruptcy bill will help, not hurt, women and children. \nBut that is false and misleading.\n  Proponents of the bill praise the alimony and child support \nprovisions. They say that these provisions will make child support and \nalimony payments the number one priority in bankruptcy. But this \nrhetoric masks the complexity of the bankruptcy system. When taken \nindividually, some of these provisions are positive steps towards \nhelping women and children collect the support to which they are \nentitled. However, they do not address the main problem created by the \nbankruptcy bill.\n  Thirty-one organizations that support women and children have said, \n``Some improvements were made in the domestic support provisions . . . \nHowever, even the revised provisions fail to solve the problems created \nby the rest of the bill, which gives many other creditors greater \nclaims--both during and after bankruptcy--than they have under current \nlaw.'' It is obvious that if this bankruptcy legislation is enacted, \nwomen and children will be the ultimate losers in the process.\n  It is true that the pending legislation moves support payments to \nfirst priority in the bankruptcy code. But the first priority ranking \nonly matters in the limited number of cases in which the debtor \nactually has assets to distribute to a creditor. As 116 professors of \nbankruptcy and commercial law have stated:\n\n       Granting ``first priority'' to alimony and support claims \n     is not the major solution the consumer credit industry \n     claims, because ``priority'' is relevant only for \n     distributions made to creditors in the bankruptcy case \n     itself. Such distributions are made in only a negligible \n     percentage of cases. More than 95 percent of bankruptcy cases \n     make NO distributions to any creditors because there are no \n     assets to distribute. Granting women and children first \n     priority for bankruptcy distributions permits them to stand \n     first in line to collect nothing.\n\n  Beyond the false rhetoric claiming that women and children receive \n``first priority'' lies an ugly truth--in many instances, women and \nchildren will be last in line. Under current law, an ex-wife trying to \ncollect support has special protection. But under the pending bill, \nmore debt is created that cannot be discharged after bankruptcy--credit \ncard debt. This step will certainly create intense competition for the \nformer husband's limited income. Under current law, he can use his \npost-bankruptcy income to meet his basic responsibilities, including \nhis student loans, his tax liability, and his support payments to his \nformer wife and children. But if this bill becomes law, one of his so-\ncalled ``basic'' responsibilities will be a new one--to Visa and \nMastercard. We all know what happens when women and children are forced \nto compete for these scare resources with these sophisticated lenders--\nthey lose!\n  Although many of the new domestic support provisions are helpful, \nthey don't solve the problem created by this bill--and some of those \nprovisions undermine the ability of women to collect support payments. \nUnder the bill, a prerequisite to Chapter 13 approval is the payment of \nsupport claims. The goal is worthwhile, but other provisions in this \nbill will drain debtors of available funds and prevent them from \nmeeting the requirements of a Chapter 13 plan and from making child \nsupport payments. If there is not enough money to cover all \nobligations, including the new obligations created by this bill, more \nChapter 13 plans will fail, making the provision worthless and making \nit less likely that women and children will get the support they \ndeserve.\n\n  This legislation not only unfairly targets middle class and poor \nfamilies--it also leaves flagrant abuses in place. Any credible \nbankruptcy reform bill must include a homestead provision without \nloopholes for the wealthy.\n  The pending bill does include a half-hearted loophole-filled \nhomestead provision. However, it will do very little to eliminate \nfraud. With a little planning--or in some cases, no planning at all--\nwealthy debtors will be able to hide millions of dollars in assets from \ntheir creditors. For example, Allen Smith of Delaware--a State with no \nhomestead exemption--and James Villa of Florida--a State with an \nunlimited homestead exemption--were treated very differently by the \nbankruptcy system. After trying desperately to make ends meet in the \nmidst of financial distress, Allen Smith eventually lost his home. \nHowever, James Villa was able to hide $1.4 million from his creditors \nby purchasing a luxury mansion in Florida which he was able to keep \nafter bankruptcy.\n  Last year, the Senate passed the Sessions-Kohl homestead amendment \nwhich corrected this abuse of the bankruptcy system. But that provision \nis not in this bill. Surely, a bill designed to end fraud and abuse \nshould include a loophole-free homestead provision.\n  For any bankruptcy reform to be effective, the homestead loophole \nmust be closed permanently. It should not be left open just for the \nwealthy. Yet the bill's supporters refuse to fight for such a \nresponsible provision with the same intensity they are fighting for the \ncredit card industry's wish list, and fighting against women, against \nthe sick, against laid-off workers, and against other individuals and \nfamilies who will have no safety net if this unjust bill passes.\n  Proponents of the bill also argue that it will help small businesses. \nThis is another credit card industry myth.\n  This bankruptcy reform bill is not based on any serious business \nneed. In fact, its overhaul of Chapter 11 will hurt, not help, small \nbusinesses. Chapter 11 was enacted to serve the interests of business \ndebtors, creditors, and other constituencies affected by business \nfailures--particularly employees. A principal goal of Chapter 11 is to \nencourage business reorganization in order to preserve jobs. Supporters \nof the bill ride roughshod over this important goal. They create more \nhurdles, additional costs, and a rigid, inflexible structure for small \nbusinesses in bankruptcy. As a result, fewer small business creditors \nwill be paid, and more jobs will be lost.\n  It is a travesty that hard-working American families will be the \nvictims of bankruptcy reform. AFL-CIO President John Sweeney said it \nwell:\n\n       This bill punishes working families who need protection \n     from financial distress--distress all too often the result of \n     the terrible financial burden of catastrophic illness or \n     other personal tragedies. It threatens jobs in financially \n     distressed companies, all while it carefully protects abuses \n     of the bankruptcy system that benefit the rich--abuses like \n     the homestead exemption.\n\n  I agree with John Sweeney and the scores of labor, consumer, \nreligious, and civil rights groups who oppose this bill. It is clear \nthat the bill before us is designed to increase the profits of the \ncredit card industry at the expense of working families. If the bill \nbecomes law, the effects will be devastating, and I urge my colleagues \nto reject it.\n  Mr. President, I want to take a few moments of the Senate's time to \ngo through these charts and illustrate some of the points I mentioned \nin my earlier statement. This chart represents why Americans file for \nbankruptcy.\n  Medical problems, or substantial medical debt, are the reasons for 45 \npercent of bankruptcy filings. Job problems are 68.9 percent, \neffectively 70 percent. Those reasons taken together--job and medical \nproblems--amount to 75 percent of all bankruptcies.\n  This obviously is accelerated. For what reasons? One reason is the \nincreasing softness of the economy at the current time and the \nincreasing number of unemployed, particularly with many mergers leading \nto dramatic changes in income over a relatively short period of time.\n  Another reason is the increasing number of Americans who do not have \nhealth insurance and, correspondingly, the increasing amount being paid \nfor prescription drugs. If one looks behind these figures with \nreference to medical problems, one will find most of them are older \nworkers in their fifties, prior to the time they are eligible for \nMedicare.\n  The total number of Americans who are uninsured is increasing. All of \nthat is related to the increasing number of layoffs. The increasing \nnumber of uninsured and the increasing costs of prescription drugs are \nreflected in this figure.\n  Let's look at the remaining approximately 25 percent. Basically, the \nother 25 percent are women who are single, women involved in divorce. \nIf we look over this chart, we see that in 1981--red representing joint \nbankruptcies, yellow the men, and blue the women--single women were \nthird, behind joint filers\n\n[[Page S1801]]\n\nand less than men. Joint bankruptcies continued. The women passed the \nmen in 1991. In 1999, the women were No. 1. They came from being third, \nvirtually about one-fifth of the total, to now being almost half the \ntotal.\n  Who are these individuals? Who are these women? These are women who \nhave not been able to claim their alimony. A great percentage of these \nare women who are unable to get child support to which they are \nentitled. What happens to them? They end up in bankruptcy.\n  Then we find out how the new provisions in this bill treat them. They \ntreat them much more harshly. I'm not the only one saying it, although \nI have repeated it. Virtually every single group that is an advocate \nfor children, women, or workers agrees, let alone the bankruptcy \nprofessionals involved in this. That is what this bill is about.\n  I have a list of those groups that are strongly opposed to it. The \nvarious women's groups include: National Women's Law Center, National \nPartnership for Women and Families, Children's Defense Fund, American \nAssociation of University Women, Church Women United, Coalition of \nLabor Union Women, National Center for Youth Law, Center for Child Care \nWorkforce, the YMCA, and Children NOW. The labor groups include: The \nAFL-CIO, Communications Workers of America, United Steelworkers of \nAmerica, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, and the list goes on. \nOther key groups include: Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, \nConsumers Union, Consumer Federation of America, Religious Action \nCenter, Alliance of Retired Americans, and National Senior Citizens Law \nCenter.\n  This is just part of the list of groups whose prime responsibility is \nrepresenting vulnerable children. That is the purpose of the Children's \nDefense Fund. The other organizations protect women in our society from \nthe harshness of legislation and from the inequities of the workplace. \nAll of them are universally against this legislation because they find \nit puts a harsh burden on children, women, workers, and on those who \nhave experienced a significant increase in their medical bills. That is \nwhat is happening. This is a profile of those individuals who are going \ninto bankruptcy.\n  Generally at the end of the day around here, we look at pieces of \nlegislation and ask on the one hand, who benefits and on the other, who \npays. It is not a bad way of looking over legislation. If we had more \nof that around here and we looked out for average working families, we \nwould come to some rather different conclusions. We certainly would on \nthis one because virtually the entire bankruptcy bar, those professors \nwho are teaching in law schools in the North, South, East, and West, as \nwell as judges, have come to the same conclusions.\n\n  Members of the Judiciary Committee have reviewed it as a result of \nthe hearings. Advocates of the various groups have been out there time \nand time again. One might find fault with one particular group, but \nvirtually all the groups that represent children and workers are \nopposed to this legislation because of its unfairness.\n  Those who will benefit are the credit card industry and the banks, \nmake no mistake about it. That is enormously interesting to me, as \nsomeone who is the prime sponsor of the minimum wage. We can find time \nfor consideration of the bankruptcy bill; yet we do not have time to \nlook at an increase in the minimum wage for hard-working Americans. We \ncannot find time to schedule that, but we can find time to consider \nlegislation that is going to benefit some of the wealthiest and most \npowerful companies and corporations in America. Make no mistake about \nit, that is what this legislation is about.\n  As this institution and its leadership is about choices, make no \nmistake what the choice is. The choice is to look after the interest of \nthe credit card companies and the banks. That is first. It is early \nMarch, and that is where we are. I hope the American people are aware \nof this legislation and its implications.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/05/senate-section/article/S1801-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1801-S1805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  DEPARTMENT OF LABOR ERGONOMICS RULE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to speak on another issue \naffecting working families that also will be coming up in a very few \nhours. That is the proposal that will be made by, as I understand, our \nRepublican leadership or representatives introducing legislation which, \nafter a 10-hour agreement, will vitiate the existing rules to protect \nAmerican workers from ergonomic injuries.\n  If we asked Americans 10 years ago what ergonomic injuries were, a \ngreat many Americans would not have been able to pronounce the word \n``ergonomic,'' and they really would not have had much of an \nunderstanding as to what the problem was.\n  Interestingly, there was a very courageous and brave woman who did \nunderstand that problem and that challenge and was willing to do \nsomething about it. That was then-President Bush's Labor Secretary, \nElizabeth Dole. This is what the Secretary of Labor said about \nergonomic injuries in 1990, 11 years ago:\n\n       One of the Nation's most debilitating across-the-board \n     worker safety and health illnesses. . . .\n       We must do our utmost to protect workers from these \n     hazards. . . .\n       By reducing repetitive motion injuries, we will increase \n     both the safety and productivity of America's workforce. I \n     have no higher priority than accomplishing just that.\n\n  That was 11 years ago. Over the period of the last 10 years, we have \nhad study after study by the National Academy of Sciences, by the \nInstitutes of Medicine, by a range of different independent groups. \nFinally at the end of last year, there was the promulgation of a rule \nto provide protection.\n\n  For whom are we providing protection? Basically, ergonomic injuries \nare repetitive motion injuries, including carpal tunnel syndrome, \ntendonitis, and back disorders. Ergonomic injuries occur across the \nboard. Among those affected are secretaries who endure carpal tunnel \nsyndrome from the use of computers, factory workers who pick up and \nplace equipment on assembly lines, nurses who suffer back injuries from \nlifting patients, and high-tech workers who sit at keyboards all day \nlong. All across our new economy, these injuries are taking place.\n  Let's look at the numbers of people affected. The source is the \nBureau of Labor Statistics in the year 2000. There are 1.8 million \nergonomic injuries reported yearly, and 600,000 people lose time from \ntheir work yearly. Ergonomic injuries impose annual costs of $50 \nbillion; account for over one-third of all serious job-related \ninjuries; and account for over two-thirds of all job-related illnesses.\n  Why do I bring this up? We were talking a few moments ago about \nbankruptcy, and that is the measure before the Senate. Tomorrow, on a \nprivileged motion, without any other earlier statement, only what we \nhave read in the newspapers and in the last several hours have \nconfirmed, we will face a motion made by the other side under \nparticular procedures. We will permit only 10 hours of debate, and if \nthat motion carries, the rule that was in the works for 10 years will \nbe wiped out within a 10-hour period. The way the language of the law \nis drafted, there will be little recourse to reissue the rule in its \ncurrent form.\n  That is what will be before the Senate tomorrow. We will get off this \nbankruptcy bill with time enough to look after another major issue of \nspecial importance to the Chamber of Commerce and the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers. Of course, the Chamber of Commerce has a \ndirect interest in bankruptcy, because of the credit card industry and \nthe banking industry. The Chamber of Commerce is leading the battle on \nthis bankruptcy bill.\n  The Chamber is looking for a twofer this year. They are looking for \ntwo big wins at the expense of working Americans: one, in the area of \nbankruptcy; two, in undermining existing protections to ensure the \nhealth and safety of workers in the workforce.\n  That is why I take this time. We will find out tomorrow if there will \nbe a motion to debate this issue. We will not be debating the issues of \nbankruptcy. We will be debating this. How many colleagues will know \nthis when they come to their offices tomorrow? It will be interesting \nbecause there has been virtually no notice given to us.\n  If the Administration has concerns about the existing ergonomics \nrule, the rule could be adjusted, could be\n\n[[Page S1802]]\n\nchanged, or could be altered without use of this motion. The \nAdministration has an available administrative process and procedure to \nmake changes in the rule. We could have addressed concerns about the \nrule through hearings and delayed implementation of the rule. But \nopponents of the rule say: No, we think we have the votes to eliminate \nit altogether and put 1.8 million workers at risk. We think we can add \nup the votes and destroy the rule tomorrow afternoon after 10 hours \nof debate.\n\n  Under the law, if opponents of the ergonomics rule have the votes, \nthey can even shorten the debate. Then at the end of the day we will \nfind those 1.8 million workers without any kind of protection. That is \nwhat is happening.\n  I don't know where the speakers are on this issue. Hopefully, we will \nhave a chance to debate this more tomorrow.\n  Women are disproportionately harmed by ergonomic hazards. Women \ncomprise 47 percent of the total workforce and incur 33 percent of the \ntotal injuries in the workforce. But women constitute 64 percent of all \nthose who lose time from work because of repetitive motion injuries, \nand 71 percent of those who lose worker time for carpal tunnel \ninjuries. The ergonomics rule is thus of special benefit for women who \nare out there working, trying to provide for their families. They are \nthe ones primarily injured. They are the ones who lose time. They are \nthe ones who will suffer most if the ergonomics rule is eliminated.\n  If there are problems with the rule, we can amend it, we can change \nit; we can alter it.\n  We are prepared to do that. Let's get the best in terms of the \nprivate sector and the workers, the women's groups, and others, and try \nto fashion something. But oh, no. The other side is saying: let's just \ntear up the rule and throw it out. That is what the proposal will be.\n  We hear a good deal about this new spirit taking place in Washington, \nDC. This is not in evidence in the Senate, where they send two bolts \nright at working families, first through the the bankruptcy bill and \nsecond, by taking this extraordinary step to destroy the ergonomics \nrule. I think this is the first time we have used this provision, \nenacted 5 or 6 years ago, in order to put workers all across this \ncountry--in the new economy and in the older economy as well--at \nserious risk.\n  I will come back to who is in favor of this action. Virtually every \nmedical group and health care group supports the ergonomics rule. But \nnot the Chamber or the National Association of Manufacturers.\n  Let's look at what the Chamber claims as to why the ergonomics rule \nought to be repealed. The Chamber claims the rule is not supported by \nsound science. This is the first myth.\n  We have seen in debate time and time again, more often now than \nbefore, individuals misstate the position of the opposition and then \ndiffer with it. It is an old debating technique. I have had Members who \nhave described my amendments in a way I could not understand and then \nsaid they differed with them. That is a tried and tested technique that \nshould be discounted, but too often it is not. And it is what is at \nwork here.\n  Let's listen to what has been said about the rule. I have the NAM \nstatement, which lists seven reasons we ought to be against the \nergonomics rule. We have the Chamber of Commerce statement. I will \nstate these for the record because it is important they be answered. \nWhether we will have a chance to do that tomorrow or not, we will do \nthe best we can.\n  First, the Chamber says that the bill is not supported by sound \nscience.\n  The recent National Academy of Sciences study proves conclusively \nthat workplace practices cause ergonomic injuries and that ergonomic \nprograms work to prevent and limit these injuries. That study confirms \nthe results of thousands of prior studies.\n  This National Academy of Sciences study was primarily focused on \nlower back and upper extremity musculoskeletal injuries. It stated \nthat:\n\n       The panel concludes that there is a clear relationship \n     between back disorders and physical load; that is, manual \n     material handling, load moment, frequent bending and \n     twisting, heavy physical work, and whole-body vibration. For \n     disorders of the upper extremities, repetition, force, and \n     vibration are particularly important work-related factors.\n\n  It goes on. You can read the conclusions. The Chamber's claim that \nthe rule is not supported by sound science is categorically false and \nmisleading.\n  The National Association of Manufacturers claims the rules set too \nlow a threshold and that one job-related complaint will trigger the \nrule.\n  Right? Wrong. Wrong. They are wrong. This standard sets a threshold \nthat is lower than the ones OSHA has set in other rules, including its \nlockout-tagout standard, asbestos standard, and blood-borne pathogen \nstandard. In these rules, employers must take action if an employee is \nmerely exposed to a risk. These are rules that OSHA has adopted and \nthat are in effect, despite the opposition of the Chamber of Commerce \nand the National Association of Manufacturers.\n  Under the ergonomics rule, even if there are serious ergonomic \nhazards in a workplace, an employer is not required to look for or \ncorrect those hazards until after a worker is injured or has signs or \nsymptoms of an injury. One complaint requires an employer to determine \nthat an injury is work related and that exposure to risk is at \nsignificant levels. It does not trigger the entire program.\n  Once there is an injury, in other words, the employer makes the \njudgment whether it is work related--the employer makes that judgment. \nThen, after that, the employer has to find that the individual has been \nexposed to the risk at significant levels. It is only then that other \nrequirements of the rule are triggered.\n  So the National Association of Manufacturers' claim that the rule \nsets too low a threshold is just not an accurate representation as to \nwhat the rule does.\n  Third, the National Association and the Chamber claim the rule covers \ninjuries that are not caused by workplace practices. But under the \nrule, as I mentioned, the employer decides that an injury is work \nrelated. They are thus completely wrong in that statement as well.\n  They go on. The Chamber claims the rule imposes an impractical, \noverreaching, and one-size-fits-all approach. The reality is the rule \nallows employers to determine how best to deal with ergonomic problems \nin their workforces. The rule doesn't mandate specific solutions. If an \nemployer decides an injury is work related, the employer must then \ndetermine, based on a simple checklist set forth in the rule, whether \nthe employee has suffered sufficiently severe exposure to require \naction. If so, the employer can decide on the solution it wants to \nadopt.\n  The Chamber claims the rule will be extremely costly for business. \nAfter an exhaustive analysis of the issue, the Department of Labor \nestimated the rule will result in a net savings--savings--of $4.5 \nbillion each year in reduced workers compensation costs and increased \nproductivity.\n\n  Numerous business leaders have found the ergonomics programs they \nhave implemented have saved a good deal of money. I am going to come \nback to that in just a moment.\n  Next, the Chamber claims the rule requires higher payments than \nworkers' compensation and overrides State workers' compensation laws.\n  The payments to workers are necessary to encourage them to report \ntheir injuries before they worsen and before other workers are \nneedlessly exposed. This is not a new concept. It has been used for 20 \nyears. It was used in the lead, benzene, cadmium, formaldehyde, and \nethylene chloride standards. The idea is to try to get the workers to \nreport their injuries at an early time, before they become permanently \ninjured and before the costs and the loss of time escalate \ndramatically. So the Chamber clearly misrepresented what the current \nstatus of the law is and what the precedents have been.\n  Again, the NAM alleges OSHA has admitted the rule's grandfather \nclause will not grandfather any employers. OSHA has not ever made this \nstatement. In fact, OSHA predicts many employers will be grandfathered \nin. The NAM's statement is basically flagrantly misleading and wrong.\n  The NAM claims the DOL ignored the will of Congress by issuing the \nrule. The fact is, in funding the National Academy of Sciences study of \nergonomics in 1999, the Congress expressly promised it would not be \nused to delay issuance of the rule. This is\n\n[[Page S1803]]\n\nwhat Bob Livingston and Dave Obey said when they were the Chair and the \nranking member of the House Committee on Appropriations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the full letter \npresented in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Appropriations,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 19, 1998.\n     Hon. Alexis Herman,\n     Secretary of Labor,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Secretary: Congress has chosen not to include \n     language in the Fiscal Year 1999 Labor, Health and Human \n     Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations \n     Act that would prohibit OSHA from using funds to issue or \n     promulgate a proposed or final rule on ergonomics. As you are \n     well aware, the Fiscal Year 1998 Labor, Health and Human \n     Services and Education and Related Agencies Appropriations \n     Act did contain such a prohibition though OSHA was free to \n     continue the work required to develop such a rule.\n       Congress has also chosen to provide $890,000 for the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services to fund a review by \n     the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) of the scientific \n     literature regarding work-related musculoskeletal disorders. \n     We understand that OSHA intends to issue a proposed rule on \n     ergonomics late in the summer of 1999. We are writing to make \n     clear that by funding the NAS study, it is in no way our \n     intent to block or delay issuance by OSHA of a proposed rule \n     on ergonomics.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bob Livingston,\n       Chairman.\n     Dave Obey,\n       Ranking Member.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The letter says: ``We understand OSHA intends to issue a \nproposed rule on ergonomics late this summer. We are writing to make \nclear that by funding the NAS study, it is in no way our intent to \nblock or delay issuance by OSHA of a proposed rule on ergonomics.''\n  So NAM claims that DOL ignored the bipartisan will of Congress are \ncompletely, blatantly, flagrantly wrong, as are so many of the other \nclaims. Here, when Congress asked for the study, they understood there \nwould not be a delay. They wanted the information.\n  Furthermore, the NAM states the NAS study did not address the issue \nof causation and repeatedly called for more study. The Academy, Mr. \nPresident explicitly stated it had done sufficient work to support \nconclusive findings that workplace practices cause ergonomics injuries.\n  The CRA, the procedure which will be in use here, is a unique \nprocedure which is violative of the traditions of this body which \npermit and encourage debate and discussion and then action at the \ntermination of debate. We have the 10-hour limitation on debate, and \nthen an up or down vote that will lead to elimination of the rule, \ninstead of altering or changing it.\n  The NAM claims that use of CRA ``will not bar the Department of Labor \nfrom adopting an ergonomics rule in the future.'' They ought to read \nthe provisions of the CRA, which I believe will exclude the possibility \nfor getting any kind of action in the future.\n  I want to take a moment to show what some businesses have said about \nthis particular proposal over a period of time. Business leaders agree \nthat ergonomics programs work. Peter Meyer of Sequin International \nQuality Center said:\n\n       We have reduced our compensation claims for carpal tunnel \n     syndrome through an effective ergonomics program and our \n     productivity has increased dramatically and our absenteeism \n     has decreased drastically.\n\n  This is from Business Week, which should not be considered to be a \npart of the working families establishment. In December of the year \n2000, Business Week said that for most companies, ``the likely outcome \nwill be dramatically fewer employees with ergonomics problems and long-\nterm cost savings to boot.''\n  We have a number of those different statements by businesses that \nhave gone ahead and created ergonomics programs on their own.\n  American scientists also call the ergonomic rule ``necessary and \nbased on sound science.''\n  These are the various groups--Orthopedic Surgeons, Association of \nOccupational Health Nurses, Occupational Therapy Association, Society \nof Safety Engineers, Chiropractic Association, Public Health \nAssociation--that believe the rule which has been promulgated makes \nsense in protecting American workers. But with one single vote, we are \ngoing to have a situation where that rule is cast aside--no \nalterations, no changes, and no modifications. It is just take it or \nleave it because we have the votes, and there will be no attempt to try \nto work this out, no attempt in terms of the word ``civility'' to try \nto listen to the other side in making some alterations and changes. No. \nIt is just: We have the votes to knock out this provision and undermine \nprotection for Americans--primarily women--in the workforce, and we are \ngoing to do that tomorrow in a 10-hour period. I think the arrogance of \nthat position with regard to protecting workers is absolutely \nunacceptable.\n  This particular proposal has been 10 years in the making, and in 10 \nhours we will effectively have it undone. I would have hoped for some \nopportunity to discuss this. Instead, tomorrow we will have only the 10 \nhours to go through these measures.\n  We hear a great deal also about the volume of the rule itself. It has \nbeen misstated that it is 600 pages. It is closer to eight or nine \npages. Those are the rules.\n  I believe these rules represent the most important rulemaking to \nprotect American workers that we have had in recent times. It is the \nmost important rule that we will have for the next several years. It \nwill make major differences in terms of the health and safety and the \nproductivity of the American workforce. Without this kind of \nprotection, we are putting at significant risk tens of thousands or \nhundreds of thousands of American workers. We are doing that in 1 day \nof votes in the Senate. That is wrong. That is absolutely wrong.\n  We will be denied the opportunity to try to make adjustments or \nchanges if we want to do it. There is a procedure to be able to do it. \nBut absolutely no. Our opponents say: We have the votes, and we are \ngoing to turn our backs on American workers, particularly on women, who \nare looking for some protection.\n  I am hopeful this measure can be defeated. But it is a bad day and a \nsad day for American workers when it is even brought up for debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that my remarks \nfollow immediately those remarks of the Senator from Massachusetts who \nspoke immediately before Senator Grassley so that Senator Sessions' \ncomments will flow on Senator Grassley's remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Alabama. First, I \ncongratulate both the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, and the Senator \nfrom Alabama, Mr. Sessions, for their ultimate effort on the bankruptcy \nbill. They have both done an excellent job, as well as the people on \nthe other side of the aisle who have contributed to a bipartisan bill, \na bill the Senator from Iowa mentioned we passed before.\n  I have been the subcommittee chairman for international trade and \nfinance, and, as such, I got to oversee some of the International \nMonetary Fund bailouts of some of the other countries that got into an \neconomic crisis. When that happened, we forced them to do bankruptcy. \nWe forced them to do what we have been talking about. They did it, and \ntheir economies came back.\n  It is a little embarrassing to revisit those countries and have them \nsay: How come you folks have not taken your own advice?\n  I appreciate all the effort that my colleagues have put into this. It \nis extremely crucial for the United States and for the consumers and \nfor the individuals of this country.\n  The reason I am here, though, is not to deal with bankruptcy. The \nspeech preceding mine was not a speech on bankruptcy. It was a speech \non ergonomics. The Senator I succeeded, Senator Simpson, used to say: \nCharges unanswered are charges believed.\n  I must discuss the ergonomic comments that have been made. This is a \npreview of tomorrow. Tomorrow, we will have a full-blown debate, I \nhope, on ergonomics. It is an extremely crucial issue for every single \nperson in this country. It is very important we do it and we do it \nright. I put the emphasis on doing it ``right.''\n\n[[Page S1804]]\n\n  The reason we are going to have a debate tomorrow is it has been done \nwrong. We will invoke the Congressional Review Act tomorrow, the first \nsignificant use of it since it was passed. I congratulate the two \npeople who were primarily responsible for bringing the Congressional \nReview Act to the Senate, the Senator from Oklahoma, Don Nickles, and \nthe Senator from Nevada, Harry Reid--one a Democrat, one a Republican.\n  It was a bipartisan bill. Why was it a bipartisan bill? Congress has \nthe responsibility for passing laws in this Congress. We have gotten in \nthe habit of delegating our responsibility. It is much easier than \nhashing out details, to put in a little part in the bill that says we \nwant an agency to write the rules.\n  The reason we passed a Congressional Review Act is we gave that \nresponsibility away and we didn't like what the agencies did. I am sure \neach Member who has dealt with an agency and their rules have had \noccasion to say somebody ought to jerk them back to reality. That is \nexactly what those two Senators did--one a Republican, one a Democrat. \nThey deserve congratulations from this body.\n  Now we need to have the courage to use what they and others did. \nAlthough I was not here when it was passed, I suspect some of the \npeople criticizing the Congressional Review Act now were here when it \nwas passed. I suspect some of them voted for it.\n\n  Now we want to use it on a rule they have some interest in, and they \ndon't want to touch it using that act. I think it is very important we \nuse the Congressional Review Act, we congratulate the people who passed \nit, and we need to put it to use on this ill-conceived rule.\n  The ergonomics rule has to be the worst rule ever passed by any \ngovernment agency. It was passed quicker than any other rule by OSHA. \nWe will hear comments that Elizabeth Dole noticed it and mentioned it \n10 years ago. I have found references to businesses who knew about it, \nnoticed it, and did something about it, considerably before Elizabeth \nDole noticed it 10 years ago. I have been proud of some of the \nbusinesses that have made extensive efforts to handle ergonomics in the \nworkplace in spite of not having a rule in place. But regardless of how \nlong ago the issue was first mentioned, OSHA's rule was only proposed \nless than a year before the final rule came out.\n  It is not the intent of business to hurt employees. It is better \nbusiness to protect employees. One of the difficulties with ergonomics, \nan injury does not just happen at work. It happens all sorts of places. \nIt is hard to tell where it happened, when it happened, and how it \nhappened.\n  Putting that aside, we need to have an ergonomics rule. We need to be \ndealing with it in every possible way. But we have to have a rule that \ndoes something, not just costs something. Part of that cost is not \ngoing to just be dollars. The estimated $4 billion to perhaps $100 \nbillion is a pretty wide range of numbers. The biggest cost is going to \nbe in American jobs. This will get down to the workers, the people we \nare not allowing to talk about how to solve the problem, the workers \nclosest to the job, the ones who are doing the lifting or typing or \nhammering or whatever repetitive motion is involved. No, we have our \ngovernment set up so the bureaucrats try to find solutions and special \ncommittees of speakers can be set up to talk about it and mandate one \nsolution for all. But the guy doing the work, who sees it each and \nevery day, who says there is a better way to do this, cannot decide how \nhis job can be done better. And in most circumstances it is not even \nlegal to ask him about it. There is a law that says employers better \nnot talk directly to employees about safety. But workers are suffering. \nWe need to do something about it.\n  Fortunately, many businesses already are. According to OSHA, even \nbefore the rule, in the last 5 years, there was a 22-percent decrease \nin ergonomics injuries? The Bureau of Labor Statistics gives business \nfar more credit for having done something than does OSHA. Perhaps OSHA \nhas an ulterior motive?\n  At any rate, businesses, when they know what to do, generally do it. \nI have to say ``generally.'' I always hear the arguments on the floor, \nnot just dealing with OSHA but dealing with a lot of topics, one side \ntalks about the bad businessmen and the other side talks about the \nfraudulent employees. Neither side is right. Yes, there are bad \nbusinessmen. Yes, there are fraudulent employees. But not very many, \nthank goodness.\n  I would say there are 5 percent of the businesses in this country \nwith businessmen who are ethically challenged. There are about that \nmany employees who are ethically challenged. Out of that 5 percent, \nmany of them just don't care. That's about 3 percent, I think, who \ngenerally don't care. No matter what kind of law is passed, they don't \ncare, so it doesn't matter what you do. That is both sides.\n  Of all those who are ethically challenged, I think only one tenth of \none percent is truly bad, bad to the bone. That might even be high; \nmight be a little low. But even though the rules and laws in this \ncountry affect every single person, they are written as if they are \nonly for the one-tenth of 1 percent who were bad to the bone. That is \npretty much what this rule is designed to do.\n\n  If you want people treated as though they are bad to the bone, both \nemployers and employees, maybe you don't think this rule is so bad. But \nif you don't, I urge you to vote with me to reverse the ergonomics \nrule.\n  We heard criticisms of the rule by people who had written letters. \nSome of those were: The rule is bad; the rule has massive flaws in it. \nSome things were taken out of context. I hope we get into those \ntomorrow. We held hearings in the Labor Subcommittee; the Employment, \nSafety and Training Subcommittee of the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions. We held hearings. This is a book of the hearings.\n  We held two specific hearings on the way it will affect health care \nin this country. We talked about how OSHA needs to resolve the conflict \nbetween the ergonomics rule and the medical rules so you don't have to \nviolate one to achieve the other. We talked about the way the payments \nfor Medicare are locked in at a rate that doesn't recognize the costs \nOSHA recognizes, the costs that facilities providing Medicare will have \nto pay. The rule doesn't mention that. We also talked about workers' \ncomp in our hearings. We had people who weighed in from New York, \nPennsylvania, and New Mexico. We talked about the way the rule \ninfringes on workers comp.\n  In the OSH Act, there is a specific provision prohibiting infringing \non workers comp. Workers comp is a system that has been developed in \nthe States, by the States, over decades. There isn't a single thing in \nplace in the OSHA administration to take care of the kinds of \ncontroversies, the kinds of processes that will have to be dealt with \nto handle workers comp. They get into workers comp.\n  Did they listen to what we had to say at the hearings? Not at all. \nThey didn't listen to what was said by the professionals in the field, \nthe State people in the field, the people on the panels, or the \nSenators asking the questions. You won't find any of it has wound up in \nthe rule they put out. What kind of Government do we have that doesn't \nlisten?\n\n  You heard some groups that are in favor of the ergonomics bill, \nergonomics rule. I am not surprised they are in favor of ergonomics \nprotection, so am I. What we should not be in favor of is this \nparticular ergonomics rule. This rule will bind up what business is \nable to do.\n  As I said, tomorrow we will get into more of the differences, the \nflaws and things about which they did not listen. But there is a big \nproblem with this one that deserves use of the congressional review \nact. Here is what it is. The process was flawed. How they passed it was \natrocious.\n  I am ashamed that any agency of our Government did business the way \nthey did business. What did they do? Just a few things I will mention \ntoday. Listen for full details tomorrow.\n  They paid people to testify on their behalf. They reviewed and \ncorrected their testimony before it was given. They brought them in for \npractices. Then, worst of all, they paid them to rip apart the \ntestimony of the individuals who came on their own to testify. Yes.\n\n[[Page S1805]]\n\n  We cannot allow our Government to pay people to destroy the testimony \nof other citizens in this country who have the right to speak on any \nrule as well.\n  After that happened, and after I mentioned it on the floor, I got to \nmeet with the Assistant Secretary of OSHA and asked him about it. I \nasked him what the process was going to be like. I was a little curious \nas to whether they were going to try to push through this rule.\n  I mentioned they talk about how Liddy Dole mentioned it 10 years ago. \nBut this rule did not get published until a little over a year ago. The \nfirst time it was published that anybody could actually look at a \ndocument and say this is what it says was less than a year before the \ntime it was finalized--less than a year. The average rulemaking time on \nthings much less difficult than ergonomics is 4 years. It takes 4 years \nto get a rule in place.\n  I contend, on a lot of these things, we should get together. We could \nagree on most of it and get things in place in a shorter time than OSHA \ncan react. But the two sides don't talk, and separately they keep \nworking on that one-tenth of 1 percent of the people who are bad to the \nbone.\n  I had this meeting with the Assistant Secretary of OSHA. I mentioned \nsome of the things with which we had some concerns based on the \nhearings. He admitted he was an advocate for the rule the way it was.\n  It seems to me the agency ought to be listening to the comments. I do \nnot see how you can be an advocate and still heed what people have said \nabout what you wrote. I was concerned about that. I brought it up with \nhim. I said: Can you give me any indication that you will make any \nchanges in light of the testimony we have presented? He could not \ncomment on that.\n  But I can tell you, now that I have seen the final rule that is \npublished, he not only didn't listen to me, he didn't listen to the \ncomments that were there. I have to tell you, the final rule that was \npublished was far more difficult than the one on which we had to \ncomment.\n  We cannot have that kind of activity in this country. What if \nagencies wrote a rule and published it, one with which they knew \neverybody would agree, then they took testimony, they took comments, \nthey tabulated it--which was not done in the instance I am talking \nabout, or at least I don't see how it could have been done--and then \nthey published a final rule that was totally different from the one on \nwhich they took testimony?\n\n  That is why we need a CRA, to jerk people back to reality who think \nthey know the way to do it and do not take into consideration the \ncomments of the people of this country.\n  We have a document that is flawed. We have a document that was done \nthe wrong way. We need to redo it.\n  You may also hear that the CRA prohibits reissuing the rule if it is \n``substantially the same.'' That is absolutely correct. Probably \nanother brilliant idea that was put in the bill by the bi-partisan co-\nsponsors. ``Substantially the same'' doesn't mean it cannot be done at \nall. It means that agency that jerked people around before cannot take \nthe same thing, change a word, and put it back out as a rule again, \nwhich would put us in the continuous motion of overriding an agency's \nill will. We would do it if we had to. But that is what the \nCongressional Review Act is designed to avoid. It should not be that \ndifficult. With civility and bipartisanship, we ought to be able to \narrive at a new approach, and not just on this rule.\n  Did you know, on the rules that OSHA has passed, we rarely revise a \nsingle one? Do you think technology has changed in 28 years? Do you \nthink there is any need to change anything that was written 28 years \nago? You had better believe there is, and we need to find a system to \ndo it. I pledge to work toward a system that will allow safety for the \nworkplace to get into place easier, quicker, and more effective than it \nis right now. I am sure business and labor will join in that effort to \nmake sure we get more safety in the workplace.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/05/senate-section/article/S1805-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1805-S1811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    BANKRUPTCY ACT OF 2001--Resumed\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I am the author of this bankruptcy \nbill that is before the Senate. I know I am not the first to speak on \nit today. There have been proponents and opponents of it.\n  Also, let me make very clear that thus far today there have been both \nRepublicans and Democrats speaking in favor of the bill that is before \nus.\n  I am very happy to be here to discuss this legislation. I thought \nlast December, when we got it to the President, might have been the end \nof it and we would have a bankruptcy bill as the law of the land--the \nfirst major bankruptcy legislation to pass this body since 1978 or \n1979.\n  Prior to Senator Kennedy's remarks about the rules that we will be \nworking on, Senator Kennedy gave all of us an opportunity to see a list \nof organizations that oppose this bill. I think it is perfectly correct \nfor Senator Kennedy to express the views of anybody who opposes the \nbill and in support of his opposition to the bill. But there is a flip \nside of all of the membership of all the organizations that Senator \nKennedy said were opposed to this legislation. That flip side is that \nthey all have members that, because some people in this country don't \npay their bills, those who do pay their bills and buy products from \ncompanies that have creditors that have gone into bankruptcy, those \nvery same members could, on average for a family of four, pay $400 more \nfor goods and services that they would purchase because other people go \ninto bankruptcy and don't pay their bills. There is no free lunch.\n  I hope we have as much concern about the well-being of the members of \nthose organizations that do not go into bankruptcy and have to pay more \nbecause they are supporting legislation to maintain the status quo \nwhere it is easy to go into bankruptcy and let somebody pick up the \ncost of your going into bankruptcy.\n  That doesn't preclude that I believe firmly in the principle of a \nfresh start when people go into bankruptcy because of causes that are \nno fault of their own. Obviously, in those instances, there are costs \nto all of us who pick up the bill. But what this legislation is trying \nto change is the fact that there is an attitude out there of using the \nbankruptcy code for financial planning when you have some ability to \nrepay. We are saying to those people who file for bankruptcy who have \nthe ability to repay--and, albeit, they probably are a minority of all \nthe people who file for bankruptcy--that it is immoral for them to use \nthe bankruptcy code for financial planning. To put this $400 cost every \nyear that other people pay for their goods and services who do not go \ninto bankruptcy, we are saying to those people who can repay that they \nare not going to use the bankruptcy code for financial planning, and \nthey are not going to get off scot free.\n  I hope those who look at the long list of organizations that oppose \nthis legislation--by the way, I could put up a chart that would have a \nlong list of organizations supporting this legislation; I am not going \nto do that. But for those who view those that are against it, remember \nthat they have members that are also hurt because there is abuse of the \nbankruptcy code.\n  I am glad we are now proceeding to consideration of this bankruptcy \nbill, S. 420. This bill has been long in the making. As we all know, we \nhave been working on it for two Congresses now. Prior to those two \nCongresses, I worked on legislation establishing a study commission \nmade up of experts in bankruptcy to suggest to us changes in the \nbankruptcy code because we saw a skyrocketing of the number of people \ngoing into bankruptcy, having reached a peak of 1.4 million people; and \nthat happening during a time of good economy as well.\n  Besides passing this legislation in the two Congresses, we have given \nthis bill very adequate study by holding numerous hearings in the \nJudiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts which \nI chaired prior to this Congress. We have the published transcripts of \nthese hearings. They are available to the public and any Senator who is \ninterested in looking at how thoroughly the committee has been \nconsidering this legislation.\n\n  The need for bankruptcy reform has been debated on this floor at \nlength. In\n\n[[Page S1806]]\n\nfact, this bill should have been enacted last year but was pocket \nvetoed at the last minute by President Clinton.\n  The bill we consider today with a new number, S. 420, and a new \ntitle, the ``Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2001,'' is practically identical \nto last year's bankruptcy reform conference report that passed out of \nthe Senate by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 70-28. The only \nexception is we have made a few changes in this new draft to \naccommodate members of the Democrat Party.\n  There was strong bipartisan support in the last Congress. That strong \nbipartisan support continues to this very day. So it is high time that \nwe get the job done and get this bill to the President; this President \nwill sign it.\n  I want to give some background on the development of this bankruptcy \nlegislation. In the 106th Congress, Senator Torricelli and I worked \nvery closely together on bankruptcy reform. Senator Torricelli, a \nDemocrat, and I addressed many concerns and negotiated many \ncompromises. We were able to pass out of the Senate the Grassley-\nTorricelli bill by a vote of 83-14. The Senate then approved the \nbankruptcy conference report by the vote I mentioned earlier, but I \nwant to emphasize how bipartisan it was--70-28; 53 Republican Senators, \n17 Democratic Senators voted for the conference report.\n  But then, as I indicated, President Clinton pocket vetoed this bill. \nCongress had adjourned, so it did not have an opportunity to override \nthat veto last December. So here we are again trying to pass bankruptcy \nreform.\n  My Democratic colleagues--Senators Torricelli, Biden, Johnson, and \nCarper--have joined Senators Hatch, Sessions, and me on this bill, S. \n420, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2001. We hope to get additional \ncosponsors from both sides of the aisle. As you can see, there is \nstrong bipartisan support for this bankruptcy bill, just as there has \nbeen a long history of bipartisan support for bankruptcy reform ever \nsince I have been in the Senate.\n  I note for the record that I believe we have really bent over \nbackwards to try to accommodate Senators' concerns with the bill's \nprocess in this Congress. I do not think it is any surprise to anyone \nthat my position is that the bankruptcy bill is unfinished business \nfrom the last Congress. I think the large majority of us in the Senate \nbelieve that is the case, that it is unfinished business.\n  The bill, being pocket vetoed, had to start over again this year. And \nhere we are. Of course, it was really too bad we could not get the job \ndone last year, considering the pocket veto.\n  So at the beginning of this Congress, I reintroduced the bipartisan \nconference report with no changes--no changes--exactly the same bill. \nThe reason I did this was not necessarily because the conference report \nwas exactly the way I would have written the legislation, but because I \nfelt compromise is necessary. And that conference report, with the \nbipartisan support that it had, was negotiated as best it could be. We \nhad reached many carefully crafted compromises. And that bipartisan \nproduct ought to be our starting point this time.\n  So I introduced that as S. 220, the same bipartisan bankruptcy \nconference report language of last year that 70 Members of this body \nsupported. I had that bill held at the desk so we could proceed \nexpeditiously on this matter. I did not think, with all the work that \nhad been done on it over the last 4 years--with only a Presidential \nveto, a pocket veto at that, standing in the way of it being the law of \nthe land--that there was much point in going through the process of \nhearings and committee action before we worked on it here. This was one \nway we could expedite the process; save all the busy Senators some \ntime, and move on with something that had such broad bipartisan \nsupport.\n  But always in a body of 100, where consensus is what it takes most of \nthe time to get anything done, we had Senators with concerns about this \nprocess. So the Judiciary Committee, of which I am a member, \naccommodated those concerns by not only, once again, holding a hearing \non bankruptcy reform and the bill, but also by holding a markup of the \nlanguage in S. 220.\n  So the Judiciary Committee accepted several amendments that were not \nin the conference report of last time. And that marked-up version of \nthe bankruptcy bill was reported out of committee and reintroduced with \na new number. So we went from S. 220--the exact bill that President \nClinton pocket vetoed--to now S. 420. That is what we have before us.\n  So I hope this clarification on history and on the procedural process \nof this bill will show that, one, the bill is a bipartisan effort; two, \nthat we have been working on bankruptcy reform for a very long time and \nhave gone over all the fine points of this bill in great detail; and, \nthree, that we have bent over backwards to allow a fair process to move \nthis bill forward at this time.\n  Let me now discuss the merits of bankruptcy reform and why this bill \nis necessary to solve the problems we have before us of a historically \nhigh number of bankruptcies--1.4 million bankruptcies in 1 year--maybe \nlast year just a little bit less than that but now maybe coming back \nup. It is a problem with which we should deal.\n  There have been a large number of bankruptcies in good times. And \nremember, the last 20 years--covering the Reagan administration, the \nBush administration, the Clinton administration, and now the Bush \nadministration--have been the best economic years ever in the history \nof America. Yet during this period of time we had 1.4 million \nbankruptcies in 1 year, compared to 300,000 bankruptcies back in the \nearly 1980s. Something is wrong, and this gives us an opportunity to \ncorrect what is wrong.\n  To emphasize, when the Senate last considered this bill just 3 or 4 \nmonths ago, we heard a lot about the declining numbers of bankruptcies \nfrom that top of 1.4 million that I talked about because the opponents \nof this compromise bill were pointing to this temporary downward spike \nin the number of bankruptcies to say that there was no need for any \nbankruptcy legislation.\n  I refer my colleagues to a Wall Street Journal article dated December \n1, 2000, which predicted that consumer bankruptcies will rise by 15 \npercent this year. According to the article, one expert referred to the \npredicted upswing in bankruptcies as ``the verge of another flood.''\n  Opponents to the bill act as if there is nothing to worry about. But \nthe fact is, we have a bankruptcy crisis on our hands. Things are more \nthan likely going to get worse. We need to pass this bill, and we need \nto pass it right now.\n\n  The Bankruptcy Reform Act before us will help the American people and \nthe economy. With the economy slowing down and a declining stock \nmarket, Americans are anxious about their economic future. If we hit a \nrecession without fixing the bankruptcy system, we could face a \nsituation where bankruptcies spiral out of control even beyond what \nthey were in the good times of 1998, 1997, and 1996.\n  The time to act is now, before any recession is in full swing--not to \nsend a signal to those people who legitimately, for the past 100 years, \nhad a reason to have a fresh start. We do not want to stop those people \nin debt from going to bankruptcy court because of situations beyond \ntheir control. No, it is not to stop that. But before we get into this \nrecession and too many people want to further use the bankruptcy code \nas part of their financial planning, we want to stop those who can \nrepay some of their debt or all of their debt, that they know they are \nnot going to get off scot-free.\n  I will address how this bill will change the way bankruptcy is being \ntreated in the United States. Simply put, bankruptcy is a court \nproceeding where people get their debts wiped away. Every debt is wiped \naway through bankruptcy. When this happens, for every debt that is \nwiped away, someone loses money. That is not Washington nonsense. That \nis good old American common sense.\n  Of course, when someone who extends credit has their obligation wiped \naway in bankruptcy, they are forced to make a decision. Should this \nloss simply be swallowed as the cost of doing business and absorbed by \nthe owner or do you raise prices for other customers to make up for \nyour losses? Either way there is no free lunch; somebody pays.\n  Presently, when an individual files for bankruptcy under chapter 7, a \ncourt proceeding takes place and their debts are simply erased. Every \ntime a debt is\n\n[[Page S1807]]\n\nwiped away through bankruptcy, someone loses money. When someone loses \nmoney in this way, he or she has to decide to either assume the loss as \na cost of business or raise prices for other customers to make up for \nthat loss. When bankruptcy losses are infrequent, then maybe lenders \njust swallow the loss, but when they are frequent, lenders need to \nraise prices to other consumers to offset their losses.\n  If there are a million businesses out there that have to so deal, I \nwould have to say there are a million answers as to how each one of \nthose businesses might see a debtor getting their losses wiped away.\n  These higher prices obviously eventually translate into higher \ninterest rates for future borrowers. We had an outstanding economist by \nthe name of Larry Summers--also the last Secretary of the Treasury--\ntestify before our Senate Finance Committee that bankruptcies tend to \ndrive up interest rates. With the possibility of the economy slowing \nright now, we need to at this time fix a bankruptcy system that \ninflates interest rates and threatens to make the slowdown even worse. \nBankruptcy reform will help our economy through lower interest rates.\n  The result of the bankruptcy crisis is that hard-working, law-abiding \nAmericans have to pay higher prices for goods and services. S. 420 \nmakes it harder for individuals who can repay their debts to file for \nbankruptcy under chapter 7 where those debts are wiped away. This would \nlessen the upward pressure on interest rates and higher prices. It is \nonly fair to require people who can repay their debts to pull their own \nweight. Under current bankruptcy laws, one can get full debt \ncancellation in chapter 7 with no questions asked. The Bankruptcy \nReform Act before us asks the fundamental question of whether repayment \nis possible by an individual. If it is, then he or she will be \nchanneled into chapter 13 of the bankruptcy code which requires people \nto repay a portion of their debt as a precondition for limited debt \ncancellation.\n\n  The bill does this by providing a means test to steer filers who can \nrepay a portion of their debts away from chapter 7 bankruptcy. The test \nemploys a legal presumption that chapter 7 proceedings should be \ndismissed or converted into chapter 13 whenever the filer earns more \nthan the State medium income and can repay at least $6,000 of his or \nher unsecured debt over 5 years.\n  In calculating a debtor's income, living expenses are deducted as \npermitted under IRS standards for the State and locality where that \ndebtor lives. Legitimate expenses--such as food, shelter, clothing, \nmedical, transportation, attorney's fees, and charitable \ncontributions--are taken into account in this analysis as provided for \nunder these IRS guidelines. Moreover, a debtor may rebut the \npresumption by demonstrating some sort of special circumstances.\n  Responding to the point that is always brought up against this bill--\nwe have already heard it this afternoon--that somehow, regarding high \nmedical expenses, you never get adequate consideration of that by the \njudge if you go into bankruptcy, I don't know what it takes to satisfy \npeople on the other side whom I believe are using this medical expense \nissue just as an excuse because they don't want any bankruptcy reform. \nIf writing off 100 percent of all medical expenses is not enough, would \nyou be satisfied if we wrote a law that allowed you to write off 101 \npercent or 102 percent? When I say medical expenses under the IRS \nguidelines can be written off in making a determination of the ability \nto repay or go into chapter 13 and then repay part of your debt, I mean \nthat they can be written off.\n  The means test takes into account a debtor's income and expenses and \nthen, even beyond that, allows the debtor to show special circumstances \nwhich would justify adjustments to this IRS benchmark means test. In \nthis way, then, the bankruptcy reform bill preserves the fresh start I \nhave talked about for people who have been overwhelmed by medical debt \nor sudden unforeseen emergencies.\n  As stated by the General Accounting Office--not by Senator Grassley \nbut by the General Accounting Office--the bill allows for full 100 \npercent deductibility of medical expenses before examining repayment \nability. This bill preserves fair access to bankruptcy for people who \ntruly are in need.\n  So that I am crystal clear, people who do not have the ability to \nrepay their debt can still use the bankruptcy system as they would have \nbefore. This bill specifically provides that people of limited income \ncan still file under chapter 7. There is a specific safe harbor built \nin for these individuals so their debt can be wiped away as is done \nright now--the fresh start.\n  I repeat: There is a safe harbor for these poor people, but the free \nride is over for those who have high incomes and who game the system \nand who don't want to repay their debt but can repay their debt; they \nare no longer going to get off scot free.\n  That brings me to the moral issue involved with bankruptcy reform. \nSomehow, I know that in 21st century America you aren't supposed to be \njudgmental about people. Let me say to you I think it is a sad \ncommentary that I can get into trouble for being judgmental about \npeople, but if I were to do the same thing, commit the same act, I \nwould probably get away with it. That is a sad commentary.\n  There is this issue of personal responsibility. It has been one of \nthe main themes of this bankruptcy reform bill. Since 1993, the numbers \nof Americans who have declared bankruptcy have increased over 100 \npercent. That is how you eventually get to that high number 2 years ago \nof one and four-tenths. While nobody knows all the reasons underlying \nbankruptcy crises, the data shows that bankruptcies increased \ndramatically during the same timeframe when unemployment was low and \nreal wages were at an all-time high.\n  I believe the bankruptcy crisis is a moral crisis. People have to \nstop looking at bankruptcy as a convenient financial planning tool \nwhile other honest Americans have to foot the bill. It is clear to me \nthat our last bankruptcy system must bear some of the blame for this \ncrisis. A system where people aren't even asked to pay off their debts, \nobviously, contributes to the fraying of the moral fiber of our Nation \nand to the lack of personal responsibility. Why should people pay their \nbills when we have a system allowing them to walk away with no \nquestions asked? Why should people honor their obligations when they \ncan take the easy way out through bankruptcy?\n  I think the system needs to be reformed because it is fundamentally \nunfair. The Bankruptcy Reform Act before us will then promote personal \nresponsibility among borrowers and create a deterrence for those hoping \nto cheat the system, to game the system, to use it for financial \nplanning, to get off scot free.\n  The bill does more than just provide for a flexible means test. It \ngives judges discretion to consider the individual circumstances of \neach debtor to determine whether they truly belong in chapter 7 and \nthen get the fresh start that we all agree they are entitled to if they \nare in this situation because of something beyond their control. But it \nalso contains tough consumer protections that people on the other side \nof the aisle, correctly so, have brought to our attention that we ought \nto be doing something about.\n  We are going to have procedures in this bill to prevent companies \nfrom using threats to coerce debtors into paying debts which could be \nwiped away once they are in bankruptcy. That is not fair play, when we \nhave activity such as that occurring.\n  The bill requires the Justice Department to concentrate law \nenforcement resources on enforcing consumer protection laws against \nabusive debt collection practices. It contains significant new \ndisclosures for consumers, mandating that credit card companies provide \nkey information about how much they owe and how long it will take to \npay off their credit card debt by only making a minimum payment--just \ngetting on a treadmill and never getting off.\n  Consumers will be able to get this information through a toll-free \nnumber, where they can get information about how long it will take to \npay off their own credit card balances if they make only the minimum \npayments because we want to help people get off of that treadmill as \nwell. We want to do it by educating consumers and improving the \nconsumers' understanding of their financial situation.\n\n  Also, credit card companies that offer credit cards over the Internet \nwill\n\n[[Page S1808]]\n\nbe required, for the first time, to fully comply with the Truth in \nLending Act. So claims that this bill is unbalanced for the creditor \nand against the debtor are wrong. There are enhanced consumer \nprotection and information and education provisions to give the debtor \nmore information--hopefully, to avoid bankruptcy in the first place.\n  Our bill makes changes that will help particularly vulnerable \nsegments of our society. We have heard people against this bill--and, \nagain, I think just because they don't want any change in the \nbankruptcy laws whatsoever, and maybe some of them even think we ought \nto make it easier to go into bankruptcy--bring up this issue about \nchild support. It is one of their great contributions to the evolution \nof this legislation, that child support now is the No. 1 priority.\n  Again, as I said, in the case of these groups of people who are \nagainst the bill in the case of medical expenses, if 100-percent \ndeductibility and consideration of 100 percent of the medical expenses \nisn't enough, should it be 101 percent or 102 percent? Again, if child \nsupport is the No. 1 priority, what more can I do for you? There isn't \na number smaller than 1 for a priority when it comes to using the \nassets that are in bankruptcy to see that children are No. 1 in \nconsideration. They ought to be No. 1 in consideration. So they have \nthe highest priority.\n  I wish to make clear that the bankruptcy bill makes a significant \nimprovement for child support claimants as well. This bankruptcy bill \ndoes not hurt them, as opponents try to claim. In fact, the \norganizations that specialize in tracking down deadbeat dads all \nbelieve this bill will be a tremendous help in collecting child \nsupport. The people on the front lines say that the bankruptcy bill is \ngood for collecting child support. For example, the bill provides that \nparents and State child support enforcement collection agencies are \ngiven notice when a debtor who owes child support for alimony files for \nbankruptcy in the first instance--I should say, not in the first \ninstance of bankruptcy but when they file for bankruptcy, this \ninformation is going to be made known to them right away because \nbankruptcy trustees are required to notify child support creditors of \ntheir right to use child support enforcement agencies to collect \noutstanding amounts due.\n  In addition, the bill requires creditors to provide the last known \naddress of debtors owing support obligations upon the request of the \ncustodial parent. Concerns being expressed by opponents to this bill \nthen, in regard to this child support issue just do not hold water.\n  The Bankruptcy Reform Act before us also makes great strides in \ncracking down on the very wealthy individuals who abuse the bankruptcy \nsystem. If you listen to our critics, you might get the impression that \nthe homestead exemption is one giant loophole, that we don't deal with \nit in this bill at all, and that somehow we are protecting the rich. \nHere again, we had the nonpartisan General Accounting Office look at \nthe question of how frequently the homestead exemption is abused by \nwealthy people in bankruptcy. The GAO found that less than 1 percent of \nthe bankruptcy filings in the States where there are unlimited \nhomestead exemptions involving homesteads of over $100,000--and the \nnumber of States that fall into that category can be counted on the one \nhand. But in those States 99 percent of the bankruptcy filings are not \nabusive, according to the General Accounting Office. So there is no big \nloophole there. In fact, the provision in the bill with respect to \nhomestead is a significant improvement over current law because there \nis presently no Federal cap on homestead exemptions in the current law.\n  Our bill changes that by requiring a person be a resident of a State \nfor 2 years before claiming the homestead exemption.\n  Furthermore, there is a 7-year look-back provision which will allow \nour bankruptcy judges to review the debtor's activities for the past 7 \nyears to determine whether the debtor was trying to shield assets \nthrough this homestead exemption.\n  This, quite frankly, is one of these very tough issues with which we \nhave to deal. On this, I did not have to deal with Democratic Senators \nwho think it ought to be tougher, but I had to deal with those within \nmy own Republican caucus.\n  There was a lot of work that had to be done on this. It is a delicate \ncompromise between those who believe the homestead exemption should be \ncapped through Federal law and others who are uncomfortable with the \nuniform Federal cap because 150 years ago, their State constitution \nwriters wrote a different provision.\n  I hope my colleagues will not believe it when others say the \nprovisions of this bill that tighten up this exemption, regardless of \nthe State constitutions, is a gaping loophole because it is not. The \nhomestead provision in the bankruptcy bill substantially cuts down on \nabuses.\n  I wish to talk about another thing this bankruptcy bill does that is \nso important in the rural areas of America, particularly as it deals \nwith the family farmer. Some may not know that the farmers across the \ncountry currently have no protection at all against foreclosures and \nforced auctions, and that is because chapter 12 of the bankruptcy code, \nwhich I wrote about 15 years ago, sunsetted last June. We thought \nPresident Clinton signing this in December would take care of that \nproblem. Chapter 12 has expired leaving farmers without this last-ditch \nsafety net.\n  The answer is that chapter 12 ceased to exist because opponents of \nbankruptcy reform stalled movement on this legislation last year so \nthat it would be timely for President Clinton to pocket veto it after \nwe adjourned in December instead of while we were still here, when we \nobviously had the votes to override it.\n  Last year's bill would have permanently restored chapter 12 for \nfamily farmers, but President Clinton did not think that was an \nimportant enough matter. This matter is too important to family farmers \nfor us to be fooling around and not making chapter 12 permanent. It is \nthe only chapter of the bankruptcy code that is not permanent law, but \nour bankruptcy bill goes further than just making it permanent.\n  The bill enhances these protections and makes more farmers eligible \nfor chapter 12. The bill lets farmers in bankruptcy avoid capital gains \ntaxes. This is important because it will free up resources to be \ninvested in a farming operation that is trying to turn around rather \nthan going down the big black hole of the Federal Treasury.\n  Farmers need this chapter 12 safety net, and we in Congress should be \nstanding up for our family farmers. We can do our duty and make sure \nthe family farms are not gobbled up by giant corporate farms, which \nhappens when bankruptcies occur. We can give farmers across America a \nfighting chance. I hope the Senate does not give in to people who are \nopposed to this bill and want to fight bankruptcy reform just because \nthey do not want any bill whatsoever and let them hurt the family \nfarmer by stalling this legislation. It is time we do this for the \nfamily farmer.\n  In addition, patients in hospitals and nursing homes get protection \nunder this bill. They deserve it and need it. In the last Congress, the \nSenate adopted these protections unanimously as an amendment I offered. \nLet me provide an example of what could happen--and it has happened. \nThis came out in a hearing I held on nursing home bankruptcies.\n\n  I learned of a situation in California a couple, 3 years ago where \nbankruptcy trustees just showed up at a nursing home on a Friday \nevening and evicted the residents. The bankruptcy trustees did not \nprovide any notice whatsoever that this was going to happen. There was \nabsolutely no chance for the nursing home residents to be relocated. \nThe bankruptcy trustees literally put these elderly people out into the \nstreets and changed the locks on the doors so they could not get back \ninto the nursing home.\n  This bankruptcy bill will prevent this from ever happening again. For \nthe first time, we will be giving these deserving folks these \nprotections. We set up an ombudsman to look out for their interests.\n  Getting back to some basics, the truth is, bankruptcies hurt people. \nIt is not fair to permit people who can repay to skip out on their \ndebts. Yes, we do preserve and must preserve fair access to the \nbankruptcy courts for those who truly need a fresh start. The \nbankruptcy reform bill that we will pass\n\n[[Page S1809]]\n\ndoes just that, but let those people who can over time pay their debts \nlive up to their responsibilities. Let's restore a proper balance in \nthe bankruptcy system. This bill does that. Enacting bankruptcy reform \nwill help stimulate the economy by lessening pressure on prices because \npeople who can pay their debts do not. Also, interest rates go up, as \nSecretary Summers has told us.\n  Passing meaningful bankruptcy reform also can help our economy and \nsimultaneously contribute to rebuilding our Nation's moral foundation \nby emphasizing, once again, personal responsibility.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill which has a new number, S. \n420, but not much changed from the bill that was at the desk, S. 220. \nThis is a product of much negotiation and compromise. It is fair, it is \nbalanced, and it is long overdue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to make \nsome remarks on the bankruptcy bill that will be pending this week. I \nalso express my admiration for the work of Senator Enzi in the health \nsubcommittee on labor issues that he chairs and his intensive work and \nconcern to make sure we handle repetitive motion injuries in the right \nkind of way.\n  In my personal view, it would be unwise for us to dump a regulatory \nburden on American business, one that has been estimated to cost as \nmuch as $90 billion, at a time when the economy is in a slowdown and we \nare not really sure about the science that would justify that and all \nexperts tell us the regulations are incredibly difficult to write. In \nfact, they are not able to write them. I think we are right to heed \nSenator Enzi's advice.\n  Mr. President, one of the objections to the bankruptcy bill was \nexpressed in a letter that has been circulated from 91 law professors \nwho wrote to show their opposition to the bankruptcy bill. We are \ncontinually seeing our professors sign off on letters that appear to \nhave some substance, but when you examine them, they are not sound. \nThis is a very unsound letter.\n  Since it has been referred to by Senator Kennedy in the past, and I \nthink maybe earlier today--although I don't think he relied on it in \ndepth here today--we ought to talk about those charges. In their \nletter, these professors claim to be representing the interests of \nchildren and women in divorce. They claim to be concerned about poor \npeople who are bankrupt and they want to help them. So do I.\n  So let's listen to what they say their complaints are. I would like \nto talk about them. It is in many ways quite stunning how inaccurate \ntheir opinions are.\n  The letter from the professors says women and children will have to \ncompete with powerful creditors to collect their claims after \nbankruptcy.\n  The fact is this bill subjects assets, such as homestead, household \neffects, and tools of the trade--these are assets that cannot be seized \nand sold in bankruptcy. These are assets that the person who filed \nbankruptcy can keep--their homestead and household effects and so \nforth. But for the purposes of children and women and past-due alimony, \nthis law will give them greater power than ever before, and they can \nseize those. They can be seized for child support and alimony. That is \nclearly a superior position under this bill than before.\n  Wives and mothers will not have to compete with anyone before, \nduring, or after bankruptcy for these key assets.\n  In addition, Philip Strauss of the San Francisco Department of Child \nSupport Services--this is one of the agencies around the country that \nwas formed to help women and children collect their child support and \nalimony from deadbeat parents, or those who refuse to pay--wrote to us \nand made a firm statement on this matter. He said competition between \nthese creditors and child support claimants just doesn't happen.\n  As he said:\n\n       No support collection professional that I know believes \n     this concern to be serious. If support--\n\n  He means child support and alimony--\n\n     and credit card creditors were playing on a level playing \n     field, banks with superior resources might have an advantage. \n     However, nonbankruptcy law--\n\n  This is the nonbankruptcy collection law that favors alimony and \nchild support--\n\n     has so tilted the field in favor of support creditors--\n\n  That is child support creditors--\n\n     that competition with financial institutions for the \n     collection of post-discharge debt presents no problems for \n     support creditors.\n\n  Senator Biden said it was laughable at our hearing recently to \nsuggest that this bill does anything but enhance the position of women \nand children who may be claimants in bankruptcy.\n  The letter from the professors says:\n\n       Credit card claims increasingly will be excepted from \n     discharge and remain legal obligations after bankruptcy.\n\n  The fact is this: Credit card debt that is incurred as a result of \nfraud is already nondischargeable under current law. This bill simply \nmakes it slightly easier for creditors when a debtor has obtained the \nmoney from the creditor by fraud to win their case; only slightly more. \nThey will still have to prove that the borrower--the debtor--defrauded \nthem. And debtors who defraud creditors should not be able to discharge \ntheir debt in bankruptcy.\n  If somebody loans me money and I obtain that loan through fraud, why \nshould I be able to go into bankruptcy court and never pay that person \nback the money I defrauded him out of?\n  That is the current law. That is historic law. This bill makes little \nor no change in it. It tightens it up slightly. If you have been \ndefrauded, you will be able to collect your money.\n  The letter further says:\n\n     . . . large retailers will have an easier time obtaining \n     reaffirmations of debt that legally could be discharged.\n\n  The fact is that in order to obtain a reaffirmation under this bill, \nretailers will have to make sure that new and comprehensive disclosures \nare given. They will be required to disclose material terms of debt \nobligation before the creditor and debtor can reaffirm any discharged \ndebt. Judicial review is required in certain cases. Thus, it will be \nmuch more difficult--not easier--for retailers to reaffirm or get a \nreaffirmation of a debt that is being discharged in bankruptcy.\n  I know this. I was asked to negotiate this very question on behalf of \nSenator Grassley and Chairman Hatch. I met with the White House and \nSenator Reed from the other side. We worked hard and came up with \nlanguage that is not excessively burdensome on the court but really \nprovides substantial new procedural protections from anyone who would \nthink about reaffirming a debt.\n  The reason people reaffirm the debt is they may have a washing \nmachine, and they have paid on it for a while. They would rather \nreaffirm and keep that machine than have it taken away. Sometimes they \ndo it on automobiles and things of that nature. It is a perfectly \nvoluntary thing.\n  Frankly, I thought the issue was greatly overblown. But we worked \nthis out. We increased the control under the new bankruptcy bill that \nis before us today compared to what it was before. A vote to reject \nthis bill is a vote to continue the less restrictive reaffirmation \npractices that prevail in the absence of this bill.\n  Again, it makes you wonder what these professors are writing about.\n  The letter says:\n\n       Giving ``first priority'' to domestic support obligations \n     does not address the problem . . . and that ``95 percent of \n     bankruptcy cases make no distributions to any creditors \n     because there are no assets to distribute. Granting women and \n     children a first priority . . . permits them to stand first \n     in line to collect nothing.\n  The fact is, the bill's means test will come into play only if the \nperson filing bankruptcy makes more than the median income for the \nstate in which he files. Only then will he be required to pay back some \nof his debt, and under that scenario his situation will be different \nfrom current law.\n  This bill's means test will place above-median income deadbeat dads \ninto chapter 13--a 5-year repayment plan that will require them for 5 \nyears under court-ordered direction to pay their money into court, and \nthe first fruits of that money go to child support and alimony. That is \na powerful incentive and guarantee that women and children will receive \nthe support obligations due them.\n\n[[Page S1810]]\n\n  The bill also will stop how chapter 13 is used today by deadbeat dads \nto delay or defeat their payment of child support--sometimes for as \nlong as 5 years. This bill will strengthen the ability of women and \nchildren to receive their child support.\n  The letter goes on with another charge. It says: Under current law, \nchild support and alimony share a protected post-bankruptcy position \nwith only two other current collectors of debt--taxes and student \nloans. The bill would allow credit card debt and other consumer credit \nto share that position thereby elbowing aside women trying to collect \non their own behalf.\n  The fact is, the bill only slightly expands what consumer debt is \nnondischargeable. The credit card has to be used for more than $250 \nworth of luxuries, and the debt has to be fraudulent to be \nnondischargeable. Even if you had a fraudulent debt of less than $250, \nit would be dischargeable.\n  Moreover, only alimony and child support claimants will be able to \nlevy on the deadbeat dads' exempt assets, as I mentioned before, such \nas homestead and household furniture. Thus, mothers will not have to \ncompete with the IRS, the student loan companies, credit card \ncompanies, or anyone else to attach exempt assets after bankruptcy.\n  Further, as Philip Strauss, a child support professional, said--he \nhas 24 years of experience in collecting assets for women and \nchildren--\n\n       No support collection professional that I know believes \n     this concern to be serious.\n\n  I agree with Senator Biden. It is laughable. Really. State attorneys \ngeneral will be helping women collect child support and alimony.\n  Further, this bill will provide more assets for distribution to women \nand children before, during, and after bankruptcy.\n  Before bankruptcy, debtors will have to attend a credit counseling \nsession that will help put fathers on a budget, keep them out of \nbankruptcy, and keep them paying this alimony and child support in the \nfirst place.\n  I offered an amendment to this bill that says before a person runs \ndown to some bankruptcy lawyer whose primary motivation will be to get \nhis fee and file bankruptcy with the least possible cost and time on \nhis part in the case, they should at least talk with a credit \ncounseling agency. Many of them can show debtors how to establish a \nbudget, how to prioritize their debt payment. They can call creditors \nand ask: Would you hold off for 2 months? Then we will start paying \nnext month. Otherwise, my client would have to file bankruptcy. They \nare working marvelously well throughout the country to avoid \nbankruptcy, to teach families and deadbeat dads or others how to manage \nmoney more effectively, and actually preserve families because experts \nsay fights over credit are the No. 1 cause of divorce in this country. \nThat is a good provision in this bill that would not be enacted into \nlaw if this bill is not passed.\n\n  I go on to note that during bankruptcy, deadbeat dads will be \nrequired to pay all past due alimony and child support and to undergo \ncourt supervision for up to 5 years under chapter 13 as they pay their \nfirst priority alimony and child support claims.\n  After bankruptcy, it is more likely that a father who has undergone \ncredit counseling, has been subject to 5 years of court-ordered \nsupervision of his finances where alimony and child support were the \nNo. 1 priority, and knows he cannot shield his exempt assets from \nalimony and child support claims, will be up to date on all his post-\nbankruptcy payments, including alimony and child support.\n  The letter further charges:\n\n       [A] single mother with dependent children who is hopelessly \n     insolvent and whose income is far below the national median \n     income would have her bankruptcy case dismissed if she does \n     not present copies of income tax returns for the past three \n     years--even if those returns are in the possession of her ex-\n     husband.\n\n  The fact is, although a prior version of the bill did require 3 \nyears' tax returns to be submitted to the bankruptcy court--and there \nwas good reason for that because people do not always tell the truth \nabout their income, and 3 years of returns gives you some indication of \nwhat their true worth and financial ability is--but while it was in the \nprevious bill, the conference report version, the present bill today \nthat came out of committee only requires that 1 year's return be \nsubmitted. This bill only requires the current year's return be \nsubmitted, and even that obligation can be satisfied by a transcript of \nyour return obtained from the IRS. These transcripts are free and \npromptly provided by the IRS.\n  Further, the bill relieves the obligation of filing even the current \ntax return if the debtor--the destitute mother, in this case--can show \nthat she cannot file the return due to circumstances beyond her \ncontrol. I think that more than answers that charge.\n  The letter further says:\n\n       A single mother who hoped to work through a Chapter 13 \n     payment plan would be forced to pay every penny of the entire \n     debt owed on almost worthless items of collateral, such as \n     used furniture or children's clothes, even if it meant that \n     successful completion of a repayment plan was possible.\n\n  The fact is, a single mother would only be placed in a chapter 13 \nrepayment plan if, one, she was above the median income, and that is \nadjusted for family size--and for a family of four, the median income \nin my home state of Alabama is $47,000 a year--two, her income after \ndeducting medical payments, private school tuition, and medical \nexpenses exceeded the lesser of $10,000 or 25 percent of nonpriority \nunsecured debts--but at least $6,000; and special circumstances did not \nmake completion of the payment plan impossible.\n  So there is an out for the judge. If he finds there are special \ncircumstances that provide a hardship for a family, he can avoid this \nplan. Even then, if she did not want to pay for the worthless items of \ncollateral, her plan needs only provide for their return to the \ncreditor. Why should she have to keep a piece of furniture if she does \nnot want to pay that debt on it, and it has been mortgaged?\n\n  The letter says:\n\n       The homestead provision in [this bill] will allow wealthy \n     debtors to hide assets from their creditors.\n       The fact is, the current law presents two problems: One, \n     debtors stuffing their cash into homesteads immediately \n     before declaring bankruptcy, sometimes moving to another \n     State that has a more favorable homestead law, to defeat the \n     creditors; and, two, another problem is, wealthy people \n     exempting their long-held homestead from the bankruptcy \n     estate.\n\n  The Senate bill that preceded the conference report last year would \nhave solved both of these problems with a $100,000 hard cap on all \nhomestead exemptions. I supported that. Senator Kohl and I were the \nprime advocates of that amendment. I debated it on the floor, and we \nwon that vote on the floor. The companion House bill that was passed by \nthe House of Representatives would have solved neither one of those two \nproblems. We solved both of them in our bill in the Senate.\n  So what about the bill that has come out of committee and is the bill \nbefore us today? The bill today solves the more egregious problem by \nproviding, one, that all new equity added to a home within 2 years \nprior to filing bankruptcy in excess of $100,000 will be subject to the \ncreditors and cannot be protected; and, two, if you move into a new \nState 2 years before filing bankruptcy, your homestead exemption is set \nby the law of the State you left.\n  So you cannot carry on the kind of effort that has been done in \nAlabama where a person leaves my hometown of Mobile and drives 50 miles \nto Pensacola, Florida, where they have no homestead exemption, puts all \ntheir money in a million-dollar house, files bankruptcy, and they do \nnot have to pay their creditors because all their money is in the home. \nYou would have to plan that at least 2 years in advance under this law. \nSo there is no doubt, as Senator Grassley has stated so clearly, that \nthis law will be substantially more effective in cracking down on \nhomestead abuse than current law.\n  We had problems. We had a number of people from Florida, from Texas, \nfrom Kansas, and some other States out West, whose State constitutions \nprovided unlimited homestead protection for farmers and others. They \ndid not want to give that up. They fought us tooth and nail, and it \ncompromised the ability of this bill to even be passed. But by reaching \na compromise on this language in the bill, it solved one of the two \nproblems, the most egregious problem really, and we made progress over \ncurrent law. We ought to pass this bill. To kill this bill would leave \neven the weaker current law in effect.\n\n[[Page S1811]]\n\n  The letter further says:\n\n       Well-counseled debtors will have no problem timing their \n     bankruptcies or tying up court in litigation to skirt the \n     intent of [this bill's two-year look-back] provision.\n\n  The fact is, it will be very difficult for a debtor to plan 2 years \nahead to place large amounts of cash into a homestead. Such planning, \nhowever, could establish a record of the debtor's intent to hinder or \ndelay his creditors. If you can show they maneuvered over a 2-year \nperiod to establish a new homestead in a different State, or put extra \nmoney in there, then you have a remedy under this bill. If so, our \nlegislation contains a 7-year look-back provision to bring any amount \nadded to a homestead to defraud, hinder, or delay creditors back into \nthe bankruptcy estate, used to pay off debtors of the estate.\n  So in conclusion, Mr. President, I reject the assertions in the \nOctober 30 letter by the anti-reform professors. This bankruptcy bill \nwill place women and children in a better position than ever before. \nThat is a major reason why an overwhelming bi-partisan majority of the \nHouse and the Senate supported this bill last year. And that is why we \nshould pass it again this year, and the President should sign it.\n  I know there is a lot of talk about this bill being harsh and somehow \nunfair to poor people. But all debtors--all poor people filing \nbankruptcy--if the claimants are for child support or alimony, will be \nmuch advantaged.\n  The alimony and child support people will have much greater power \nunder this bill to collect their money than under current law. Second, \nanybody making below median income for their State will not be affected \nby the means test and will not be converted to Chapter 7. And I do not \nknow how many that is, but I would be willing to guess that at least 80 \npercent of the individual bankruptcy filings in this country are by \npeople who make below median income. It is only a few at which we are \nlooking. The same people who are concerned about those abusing the \nhomestead law to defraud their creditors ought to also be concerned \nabout doctors and other rich people who have run up a bunch of debts, \nbankrupt against them, and then the next year make $100,000 to $150,000 \na year. By doing that, these people have effectively gotten out of \ntheir legitimate debts that could easily have been repaid by them. Make \nno mistake, that is the truth. You can go into bankruptcy court today, \nfile under chapter 7 and if your income is $250,000 a year, wipe away \nthe debt that you owe and, effectively, never pay your creditors. That \nis not right. It's an abuse. If you can pay part of your debts, you \nought to.\n\n  We have come up with a bright line rule. If you make above median \nincome for your State and you can pay the lesser of 25 percent or \n$10,000 of your debts over 5 years, you are required to pay at least a \nportion of those debts you can pay; in other words, you must file in \nChapter 13. The judge will decide how much you pay and will set up a \nrepayment schedule. In short, people should try to repay the debts that \nthey owe. We don't need to create a bankruptcy system that is running \nout of control where lawyers are advertising night and day on the TV \nand in the free shopping guides in the grocery stores about how you can \nwipe out your debts and you don't have to pay what you owe.\n  When somebody fails to pay what they owe, whether it is to a \nhospital, whether it is to a doctor, whether it is to a bank, whether \nit is to a credit card company, what happens? It drives up the cost of \nthose people's business. They have to raise the charges on the honest \npeople who pay them.\n  There is no free lunch in this country. That is basic economics. \nThere is no free lunch. If you don't pay your debt, then somebody else \nis going to pick up the burden.\n  We need to have a law that enhances our capacity to ensure people \ndon't abuse bankruptcy; that if you are capable of repaying a portion \nof your debts, you do. That is fundamental and what most Americans do.\n  When I think about those families sitting around their kitchen tables \nright now worrying about their budgets, trying to decide whether or not \nthey can afford to take vacation, and who ultimately decide that they \ncan't because they have bills to pay - those are the people we ought to \nhonor. Those are the people who demonstrate the kind of character and \ndiscipline that ought to be affirmed. We ought not to affirm people who \nmake above the median income in America and who can easily pay back \npart of their debts, but who decide not to do so.\n  I don't believe you can assert one fact in this bill that is not fair \nand just. We have fought over this bill for 4 years. It has passed this \nbody at least three times by overwhelming numbers. Unfortunately, it is \nnot yet the law. I plan to listen carefully to the complaints about \nthis bill that will surely be made on this floor, but frankly I don't \nbelieve that anybody's complaints will hold water.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, first of all, I haven't had a chance to \nreview Senator Collins' legislation, but I will tell you that anything \nand everything that we can do that really nurtures and encourages small \nbusiness we should do. The small businesspeople are a lot like family \nfarmers. Everybody loves them in the abstract, but when it comes to \naccess to capital and to the opportunities for them to grow, I think we \ncan do much better.\n  I will tell you that in Minnesota--and I am sure it is the case in \nMaine--people are always more comfortable when the actual capital \ndecisions are made by people who live in the community. They own the \nbusinesses there. I would put my emphasis on education and \nentrepreneurship at the community level. I thank my colleague for her \nwork.\n  I am going to be quite brief because I have a feeling that over the \nnext couple of weeks I won't be brief at all. This is going to be quite \na week for working families, working people, in Minnesota and around \nthe country. We start out tomorrow with a bang. We are going to have a \nresolution on the floor of the Senate that would summarily and \npermanently overturn OSHA standards that were designed to protect \nworkers from serious and debilitating ergonomic injuries. We are \ntalking about repetitive stress injuries and about 1.8 million workers \nwho suffer from these disorders, 600,000 injuries so severe that people \nare forced to take off from work.\n  The terms of these injuries, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, \ntendonitis, and back injuries, sound familiar. I will give you one \nexample, although there are many, and then I will make my larger point.\n  Kita Ortiz, a sewing machine operator in New York City, was 52 when \nher whole life came crashing down on her. She ended up with cramps in \nher hands so severe that she woke up with them frozen like claws. She \nhad to soak her hands in hot water just to be able to move her fingers. \nThis went on for 5 years. Terrified of losing her job, she suffered \nthrough agony beyond anything that any Senator can imagine. Finally, \nshe had to give up her job. It took 2 years to get her first workers \ncomp check. She lost her and her family's health insurance, and she \ntries to get by now on $120 a week on workers comp payments.\n  I will tell you something. This resolution is all about overturning \nour accountability as legislators, as Senators, to working people in \nthis country, our accountability for their safety. I would bet that of \nthe 1.6 million, 1.8 million workers who suffer from these injuries, \nwell over 50 percent are women. I will just tell you that I believe \npart of the reason that Kita Ortiz is not so prominent in this effort \nis because to many people these workers and these injuries are just out \nof site, out of mind. But this is the most serious health and safety \nproblem in the workplace.\n  We had OSHA spend 10 years to promulgate this rule and now we have \nthis rush to judgment, where we are going to have 10 hours of debate, \nno amendments permissible--10 hours of debate to overturn a rule that \nwas 10 years in the making based upon the heartfelt\n\n[[Page S1812]]\n\ntestimony of men and women who have gone through this living hell of \nrepetitive stress injury.\n  Why the rush to judgment? Some Senators can be very generous with the \nsuffering of others. It is so interesting to me that we are going to \npass a resolution that is going to not just say to OSHA there are \nproblems, fix them, but basically its scorched earth approach on the \nfloor of the Senate--10 hours, limited debate, no amendments, and \nbasically OSHA's hands are tied for the future. We have to come back \nand go through a process all over again.\n\n  By the way, time is not neutral for a whole lot of people who suffer \nthese injuries. I don't think most of them are our sons and daughters, \nto be blunt about it. This is a class thing. I don't know whether \nothers want to say it on the floor, but it should be said. I will say \nit a lot over tomorrow. These aren't really our sons and daughters. \nThese aren't our brothers and sisters, our husbands and wives. For most \nof us, I don't think these are people we know very well. These are \nworking class people. It is interesting to me that we are so willing to \nhave standards for schools, but we don't want to have standards for \nworkplace safety.\n  It is going to be interesting to see how colleagues vote on this. I \nthink this Federal testing that President Bush is talking about is \nprobably the largest intrusion of the Federal Government on State and \nlocal school districts we have seen for a long time, which basically \nsays, hey, for any of you who receive any title I money, you will do \nannual testing from third grade on--I think all the way to eighth \ngrade. You do it. That is what we are telling them. We are not clear \nexactly whether or not or how this gets funded.\n  We are certainly not going to give the schools and teachers and the \nchildren the tools to be able to do well, but we are going to pound our \nchests and talk about how low-income children, and children in inner-\ncity schools, and in schools that don't have good lab facilities and \ndon't have the technology, and children who didn't come to kindergarten \nready to learn, and kids who come to school hungry, and kids who live \nin a family that moves two, three times a year because of the lack of \naffordable housing, and we are set up for failure. We are willing to \njam those tests down the throats of States and school districts, big \nFederal intrusion in education. So we are going to have the standards \nfor schools, but we are not going to have the standards for workplace \nsafety.\n  Tomorrow we are going to abolish standards for workplace safety. At \nleast that is the effort. I hope it is not successful. This is quite a \nweek for working families. We start out going after the ergonomics \nrule, which is so important to people who have gone through such a \nliving hell with such pain from repetitive stress injury. It is a \nhorrible injury. And you have some parts of the business community \nbroadly defined--not all, thank goodness--coming in and saying we \ncannot afford it. It is terrible. How generous again some people are \nwith other people's suffering. If it was you or if it was your loved \none who was struggling, who was basically disabled for life, who was in \nunbelievable pain, you would want to see some kind of standard put into \neffect. That is what this debate is going to be about.\n\n  This is a class issue. That is what this is about, make no bones \nabout it, and the question is, Where do working people fit into the \ndeliberations of the Senate? We will see.\n  Then we go from there to the bankruptcy bill. I ask unanimous consent \nto print in the Record a letter from a variety of women's and \nchildren's organizations--American Association of University Women, \nChildren's Defense Fund, Center for Law and Social Policy, National \nCenter for Youth Law, National Organization of Women Legal Defense and \nEducation Fund, National Women's Law Center, YWCA of the United \nStates--that are in opposition to the bankruptcy bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    march 2, 2000.\n     Re Women and children's groups oppose S. 420, Bankruptcy \n         Reform Act\n\n       Dear Senator: The undersigned organizations write to urge \n     you to stand with America's women, children, and working \n     families and oppose S. 420, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of \n     2001.\n       If it becomes law, this bill will inflict greater pain on \n     the hundreds of thousands of economically vulnerable women \n     and families who are affected by the bankruptcy system each \n     year. Over 150,000 women owed child support or alimony by men \n     who file for bankruptcy become bankruptcy creditors. An even \n     larger number of women owed child support or alimony--over \n     200,000--will be forced into bankruptcy themselves. Indeed, \n     women are the largest and fastest growing group in \n     bankruptcy.\n       S. 420 puts both women and children owned support who are \n     bankruptcy creditors and those who must file for bankruptcy \n     at greater risk. By increasing the rights of many other \n     creditors, including credit card companies, finance \n     companies, auto lenders and others, the bill would set up a \n     competition for scarce resources between parents and children \n     owed child support and these commercial creditors both during \n     and after bankruptcy. And single parents facing financial \n     crises--often caused by divorce, nonpayment of support, loss \n     of a job, uninsured medical expenses, or domestic violence--\n     would find it harder to regain their economic stability \n     through the bankruptcy process. The bill would make it harder \n     for these parents to meet the filing requirements; harder, if \n     they got there, to save their homes, cars, and essential \n     household items; and harder to meet their children's needs \n     after bankruptcy because many more debts would survive.\n       Contrary to the claims of some, the domestic support \n     provisions included in the bill would not solve these \n     problems. The provisions only relate to the collection of \n     support during bankruptcy from a bankruptcy filer: they do \n     nothing to alleviate the additional hardships the bill would \n     create for the hundreds of thousands of women forced into \n     bankruptcy themselves. And even for women who are owed \n     support by men who file for bankruptcy, the domestic support \n     provisions fail to ensure that, in this intensified \n     competition for the debtor's limited resources before and \n     after bankruptcy, parents and children owed support will \n     prevail over the sophisticated collection departments of \n     these powerful interests.\n       We urge you to support amendments to ameliorate the bill's \n     harsh effects on women and their families, insist on \n     bankruptcy reform that is truly fair and balanced, and vote \n     against S. 420.\n           Very truly yours,\n       American Association of University Women.\n       Children NOW.\n       Children's Defense Fund.\n       Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP).\n       Feminist Majority Foundation.\n       National Association of Commissions for Women (NACW).\n       National Center for Youth Law.\n       National Organization for Women.\n       National Partnership for Women & Families.\n       National Youth Law Center.\n       National Women's Conference.\n       National Women's Law Center.\n       NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund.\n       OWL.\n       The Women Activist Fund, Inc..\n       Wider Opportunities for Women.\n       Women Employed.\n       Women Work!\n       Women's Law Center of Maryland, Inc.\n       YWCA of the U.S.A.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Sessions, was \nsaying: What this bill says is if these men owe child support to their \nformer wives, they are going to have to pay; therefore, the whole bill \nis a good bill for women and children.\n  All these organizations are opposed to it, and they are opposed to it \nfor good reason. First of all, what my colleague and friend from \nAlabama did not tell us was, yes, these men are going to have to pay \nchild support to women. It also says he is going to have to pay the \ncredit card companies and other people who are all making claim on what \nlittle he has left.\n  That is not the main reason these major women's and children's \norganizations, civil rights organizations, consumer organizations, and \nlabor organizations are opposed to this bill. The main reason is that \nit is going to be very difficult now for women and for other families \nwho find themselves in difficult economic circumstances, through no \nfault of their own--50 percent of the bankruptcy cases in this country \nare because of a major medical bill. It is going to make it impossible \nfor them to file for chapter 7 and rebuild their lives. That is what is \nso harsh about this piece of legislation.\n  I will not go into the details today because there is going to be a \nlot of opportunity for debate. I will make two very quick points.\n  One is, the first effort in the 107th Congress--and I hope people get \na good look at this--is a resolution to overturn a rule 10 years in the \nmaking, a rule that is important to protecting people at the workplace.\n  Then the first major piece of legislation we get in the 107th \nCongress is an\n\n[[Page S1813]]\n\nunjust and unbalanced bankruptcy bill which is great for the big banks \nand the credit card companies and says nothing about their predatory \nlending practices. It requires no balance and no accountability on \ntheir part and says nothing about the way in which they continually \npush their credit cards on our children.\n  This legislation basically tears up the major safety net for middle-\nclass--not just low-income--families to protect families from being put \ntotally under and in economic bondage for the rest of their lives. That \nis what this bill does by setting up an onerous means test that will \nmake it impossible for families to rebuild their lives.\n  I think my colleagues want to bring this up because they want to \npoint to the differences between President George W. Bush and President \nClinton because President Clinton vetoed this bill. I hope we can stop \nthis bill, and, believe me, I will have many amendments and we will \nhave much debate.\n  If, in fact, my colleagues want to point out the difference, I am \nglad to do so. I have been plenty critical of President Clinton in the \nlast several weeks--there has been much to be critical of--but I want \nto point out to President Clinton: It is an honor to defend you on your \nveto of this bill.\n  President Clinton stood up for consumers. He stood up for low- and \nmoderate-income families without a lot of clout in America; he stood up \nfor working people; he stood up for civil rights; he stood up for \ncommunities of color. He basically stood up for them and ignored all of \nthe lobbying, the political and economic clout of this financial \nservices industry.\n  I will have a lot to say in this debate about their contributions and \ntheir role. He did the right thing. I am pleased to talk about the \ndifferences.\n\n  This bill comes to the floor negotiated by a relatively small number \nof Members. Until this year, this bankruptcy bill has never been on the \nfloor of the Senate in an amendable fashion. I need to make that point \ntonight because we are going to go on this bill probably Wednesday \nafternoon.\n  The third point I want to make is, until the hearing was held by the \nJudiciary Committee on February 8, there had been no hearings on this \nlegislation. In fact, the Senate has not conducted its own hearing on \nbankruptcy since 1998.\n  Here is my point: The first time in amendable form, harsh and \nunbalanced, unjust, and the financial services industry trying to jam \nthis through.\n  I see no reason why we should not have extended debate on the Senate \nfloor. Believe me, coming on the heels of this effort to undo 10 years \nof work on an ergonomics standard to protect people in the workplace, \nI, as a Senator from Minnesota, will be more than ready to have \namendments and have debate.\n  One of the amendments on which I look forward to a vote will \nbasically say: Before you say to people it is going to be impossible \nfor you to file for chapter 7 and rebuild your lives, before you \nbasically put people economically under for the rest of their lives \nwith this very harsh and one-sided piece of legislation, at least in \nthe case where people have had to file for bankruptcy because of a \nmajor medical bill, do not present them with this harsh means test. At \nleast give people who went under because of a medical bill the \nopportunity to file chapter 7 the way they could before.\n  We will have a vote on that and a vote on many other amendments as \nwell. That debate will start I suppose Wednesday afternoon.\n  What a week--it is not just this week; the debate will go on to next \nweek. We have 2 weeks coming up that I think represent what the \nmajority party is about, and I am sorry to say, because I like the \nPresiding Officer so much and it is not a personal argument, it is an \ninstitutional argument. I really believe this President and the \nmajority party are going to do a great job representing the wealthy in \nAmerica, a great job representing the financial services industry, a \ngreat job representing the insurance industry, a great job representing \nthe oil companies, a great job representing the well-heeled, the well-\nfinanced, and the economically powerful.\n  The question most ordinary citizens in the country are asking is: Who \nwill represent us? My hope is that the Democratic Party will do so.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/05/senate-section/article/S1813-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, one of our dear staffers is present who has \ngiven a great deal of effort to the Judiciary Committee, and I want to \npay her my respects for a few moments.\n  Today is Jeanne Lopatto's last day working in the Senate. She has \nworked on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and for me in particular, for \nthe last 18 years and is currently press secretary for the full \nJudiciary Committee. It is with mixed emotions that I rise to thank her \nfor all the good work she has performed in the past. I give her my best \nwishes for her future.\n  Gigi is a Capitol Hill success story. She began her career with me as \nan entry-level assistant, and she has moved up to spearhead the \nJudiciary Committee press operation, which is a big job and a very \nimportant one. As a result of her hard work and dedication, Gigi has \nearned the respect, admiration, and trust of all of us who have worked \nwith her. Thus, it is with a certain degree of both sadness and pride \nthat I am bidding her farewell.\n  Gigi will be joining our dear friend and former colleague, Spencer \nAbraham, at the Department of Energy as his spokesperson. In other \nwords, she is going to be speaking for a Cabinet-level official. I \nthink that is a great thing. Our loss--mine in particular--will be \nunquestionably Secretary Abraham's gain. I know she will have her hands \nfull over there, but she is up to the challenge. If I might be so bold, \nI want to say that I share the pride of Gigi's great success with her \nwonderful family.\n  Gigi will be greatly missed here in the Senate, and certainly by me. \nI think she is going to be missed by the reporters and the press \nofficials who have relied on her on a daily basis. Senate staff on both \nsides of the aisle are going to miss her, her friends and colleagues on \nthe committee and on my personal staff, and, of course, most of all, I \nam going to miss her. So let me just say that I am very grateful to \nGigi for the service she has given to the Senate and to our country at \nlarge and for working with us on the Judiciary Committee, as an \nessential part of the committee, as somebody who always acted with \nintegrity, decency, honesty, love, and affection for all of us on the \ncommittee, regardless how cantankerous that committee is from time to \ntime. She has had a steady hand on the tiller during a lot of really \nacrimonious debate at times, and she has really done this job as well \nas it could have been done. We love her, and we are going to miss her. \nWe also wish her well as she proceeds on to even greater and better \nthings, as she views it and as I view it.\n  So, Gigi, we are going to miss you. We all love you and appreciate \nyou and want you to be successful in your next job, which I know you \nwill be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I join the Senator from Utah. We will now \nknow anytime the Democrats are told they are not doing their job it \nwill be coming straight from the Senator from Utah.\n  Senator Abraham is very fortunate to have her there. Senator Abraham \nis a good friend to all of us here, and she has been a good friend to \nall of us here. He is fortunate. I will do my best to fill in and help \nthe chairman on some of these issues, especially as I know we can \nfinish this bill in 2, 2\\1/2\\ days, so long as the leadership does not \ninterrupt us for anything else.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/05/senate-section/article/S1814-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S1814]]\n                     ENERGY FROM A BROWN DWARF STAR\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate scientists \nworking with the Very Large Array, VLA, astronomical radio observatory \nnear Socorro, New Mexico on detecting energy from a brown dwarf star. \nFor over twenty years, the VLA has provided significant scientific \nknowledge to astronomers.\n  Working on a student project, scientists, graduate, and undergraduate \nstudents discovered the first sustained radio emission from a brown \ndwarf star, an object similar to a small star without enough mass to \nsustain nuclear fusion of hydrogen. Discovered only 5 years ago, brown \ndwarf stars were considered unable to emit persistent radio emissions. \nThis finding helps astronomers study the link between large, gaseous \nplanets and small stars.\n  I am proud to support the VLA and the contributions being made to our \nunderstanding of the cosmos. I also applaud the work and efforts of the \nscientists and students involved in making this noteworthy discovery.\n  I ask that the February 21, 2001, New York Times article entitled, \n``Surprise in the Heavens as Energy Is Detected in a Brown Dwarf'' be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n             [From The New York Times Wed., Feb. 21, 2001]\n\n     Surprise in the Heavens as Energy Is Detected in a Brown Dwarf\n\n                            (By James Glanz)\n\n       A dim, fading object wandering alone through space, \n     something between a large planet and a tiny star, turns out \n     to be roiled by storms several times more powerful than the \n     most energetic flares on the Sun, a team of radio astronomers \n     has found.\n       The existence of such powerful, stormy radio emissions in \n     this kind of celestial object, a brown dwarf, is highly \n     unexpected and could shed light on the dividing line between \n     stars and planets.\n       The research had been considered so unpromising that the \n     discovery was made not as part of any large-scale \n     astronomical search but an accidental find in a student \n     project at the Very Large Array a set of raido-telescopes at \n     the National Radio Astronomy Observatory near Socorro, NM.\n       The students happened to have the array trained on the \n     brown dwarf when it flared. Two senior radio astronomers, Dr. \n     Dale A. Frail of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory and \n     Dr. Shrinivas Kulkarni of the California Institute of \n     Technology, then became involved in follow-up observations, \n     which were led by Edo Berger, a graduate student at Caltech.\n       The follow-up observations showed that the object's \n     magnetic fields were extremely weak, another surprise, since \n     flares are normally powered by the energy in magnetic fields.\n       A paper on the study has been accepted at the journal \n     Nature and was posted Monday and a Web site at the Los Alamos \n     National Laboratory where most astronomers place their new \n     work.\n       The existence of brown dwarfs, which are cool, dim and \n     difficult to observe, was confirmed only five years ago by a \n     team led by Dr. Kulkarni. Thought to have masses less than 8 \n     percent that of the Sun, their cores never become hot enough \n     to ignite the fusion process that allows ordinary stars to \n     shine for billions of years.\n       Instead, brown dwarfs gradually cool and fade after they \n     form. Because brown dwarfs have an identity somewhere between \n     that of large, gaseous planets like Jupiter and that of the \n     smallest ordinary stars, astronomers said the new discovery \n     should illuminate the structure of a crucial link between the \n     two better-known classes of astronomical objects.\n       Dr. Adam Burrows, an astrophysicist at the University of \n     Arizona, said energetic particles and waves in the magnetic \n     fields around Jupiter split out radio emissions that could be \n     detected on Earth. But Dr. Burrows said that at the distance \n     of the brown dwarf, more than a dozen light-years into deep \n     space, those emissions could never be picked up.\n       ``That they do see emission from a sister object at such a \n     distance is quite amazing,'' he said.\n       Ordinary stars with relatively low masses do show energetic \n     flaring, Dr. Burrows said, but their magnetic fields are \n     also much stronger. Flares on the Sun often occur when \n     magnetic fields ``reconnect,'' or suddenly snap like \n     rubber bands after they break and then splice together in \n     new configurations. So a weak magnetic field would not be \n     expected to create strong flaring.\n       Another astrophysicist, Dr. Jeffrey Linsky of the \n     University of Colorado, said those apparent mysteries might \n     carry a message about the difference between true stars and \n     brown dwarfs. The cooler cores of brown dwarfs, like a pot of \n     soup on a low flame, might create less turbulence inside the \n     dwarfs, Dr. Linsky said. That relative quiescence might \n     generate weaker magnetic fields--but possibly with \n     conformations, or geometries, that make them more likely to \n     reconnect.\n       If that is the case, Dr. Linsky said, then perhaps ``the \n     geometry is very different in such a way that it produces a \n     few very large flares.''\n       Dr. Lars Bildsten, an astrophysicist at the Institute for \n     Theoretical Physics at the University of California at Santa \n     Barbara, cautioned that because brown dwarfs were so \n     different from the Sun, it was hard to know what to expect \n     from them. The radio observations were at least consistent \n     with sketchy observations in other bands of the spectrum, Dr. \n     Bildsten said.\n       Other scientists said they were at a loss to explain the \n     puzzling findings, whose authors include Mr. Berger, Dr. \n     Kulkarni and Dr. Frail as well as about a dozen graduate and \n     undergraduate students from places like Oberlin College in \n     Ohio, Agnes Scott College in Decatur, Ga., and New Mexico \n     State University in Las Cruces.\n       ``This is a pretty amazing result,'' said Dr. Jill Knapp, a \n     Princeton astronomer. ``There seem to be some quite \n     unexpected things going on with these very cool, low-mass \n     objects.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/05/senate-section/article/S1814-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1814-S1816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THE AIRLINE CUSTOMER SERVICE IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for the \nAirline Customer Service Improvement Act. I commend Senator McCain for \ncontinuing to press this crucial consumer issue before the Senate in a \nbipartisan manner. I also applaud the efforts of Senator Wyden. Both \nhave been leading advocates for air travelers. I am confident that we \ncan work together to pass a pro-consumer bill into law.\n  I am sure that each and every one of us in this body has experienced \nhis or her fair share of frustration with air travel as have millions \nof Americans. Whether it's late flights, long lines, or lost luggage, \nwe've all gotten the short end of the stick at one point or another.\n  When it comes to air travel, we are all consumers. And this bill \nassures the protection of consumer interests. The Airline Customer \nService Improvement Act would, among other things, ensure that \npassengers have the information that they need to make informed choices \nin their air travel plans.\n  I think we were all encouraged in 1999 when the airlines came out \nwith their own plan to improve customer service. While many of the \nairlines made improvements and responded to suggestions from the \nDepartment of Transportation's Inspector General, much more remains to \nbe done.\n  It is time air travelers' interests once again receive our attention. \nAccording to the Department of Transportation, consumer complaints \nabout air travel went up by 14 percent from 1999 to 2000. This, coupled \nwith a 25 percent increase from 1998 to 1999, adds up to an increase of \nalmost 40 percent in two years. These complaints run the gamut: \nunstable ticket pricing; oversold flights; lost luggage; and flight \ndelays, changes, and cancellations. In addition, in 2000 one in four \nflights was delayed, canceled, or diverted, affecting about 163 million \npassengers. Obviously, the airlines are not solely responsible as \nweather and mechanical breakdowns are part of the business, and of \ncourse we need to ensure that we maintain and improve airport \ninfrastructure. But this bill addresses some problems that the airlines \ncan fix.\n  Perhaps of more importance, this bill does so without forcing \nairlines to compile information that they don't already keep. The bill \nsimply allows air travelers the right to that basic information and the \nability to make informed decisions.\n  I am fortunate enough to be a customer of the premier airline when it \ncomes to customer satisfaction and to represent most of its employees. \nFor years, Midwest Express Airlines has been showered with some of the \nhighest airline customer satisfaction ratings in the country. For those \nof my colleagues who have not yet experienced a flight on Midwest \nExpress, I, and I am sure I speak for the senior Senator from \nWisconsin, encourage you to do so.\n  How does Midwest Express continue to maintain these superlative \nratings? The answer is simple, it already incorporates some of the \nprovisions spelled out in this bill. Midwest Express already tries to \nnotify its travelers if it anticipates a flight delay, flight change, \nor flight cancellation. The airline already attempts to make \ninformation on oversold flights available to\n\n[[Page S1815]]\n\nits customers. Midwest Express already makes efforts to allow its \ncustomers access to frequent flyer program information. People fly the \nairline because the airline cares about its customers.\n  These are some of the reasons the airline has been awarded the \nConsumer Reports Travel Letter Best Airline Award every year from 1992 \nto 2000; Zagat Airline Survey's #1 Domestic Airline award in 1994 and \n1996; Travel & Leisure's World's Best Awards for Best Domestic Airline \nin 1997, 1998, and 2000; Conde Nast Traveler's Business Travel Awards \nfor Best U.S. Airline in 1998 through 2000; and Conde Nast Traveler \nReader's Choice Awards from 1995 through 2000; among many awards.\n  Other airlines should see this bill as a challenge to meet the lofty \nstandards set by airlines like Midwest Express.\n  Air travel is on the rise, but so are air travel complaints. As we \nenter the summer travel season, we should do what we can to ensure that \nthe flying public is treated fairly. This bill will give our \nconstituents access to the information they need to make wise choices \nin air travel and help them to avoid frustration, inconvenience, and \nsometimes costly delays. Airlines truly concerned about their customers \nshould already be making these efforts. I urge my colleagues to join in \nthis effort.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as we acknowledge the passing of an \nentire decade since the victory of coalition forces in Desert Storm, we \nmust simultaneously admit that this military victory has not translated \ninto achievement of desired objectives.\n  Recent events and intelligence assessments have once again focused \nattention on Iraq. Saddam Hussein has rebuilt any weapons production \ncapabilities that were damaged or destroyed in the Desert Fox \noperations in late 1998. Despite military defeat, despite thwarted \nattempts by the U.N. Special Commission, and despite a decade of \nsanctions, Iraq under Saddam Hussein's leadership remains a threat.\n  Two weeks ago strikes at command and control centers outside of the \nno-fly zones reminded the American public that our pilots have been \npatrolling Iraqi skies for ten years. Although we haven't yet lost any \npilots or planes in this ongoing operation, a decade of this routine \nand the wear and tear on the aircraft without any end in sight has \ncaused many people to question the prudence of this policy and \napproach.\n  The reason for this attack underscored again the constant risk to \nBritish and U.S. pilots in this mission. This article entitled ``Highly \nDangerous'' highlights that risk.\n  New Mexicans or New Mexico-based wings have been heavily involved in \nthis mission. Cannon's 27th Fighter Wing and the 150th Fighter Wing, \nthe ``Tacos'' of the New Mexico Air National Guard fly these patrols.\n  As Iraqi air defenses get upgraded and Iraqi pilots continue to \nviolate the no-fly restrictions, we must do everything possible to \nprotect the U.S. personnel involved in these missions.\n  I am grateful that Secretary Powell took it upon himself to tour the \nMiddle East and began formulating new policies for the Bush \nAdministration on Iraq. The baton passed from the Clinton \nAdministration on Iraq offered no exit strategy.\n  I guess as long as no one got killed, the previous Administration was \ncomfortable wearing out our pilots and our military aircraft under the \npretense that their policy was working.\n  It wasn't and it's not. We need a comprehensive rethink. If our \npilots are over there, it should be more than to patrol airspace while \nSaddam rebuilds his weapons production capacity and starves his people \non the ground.\n  I look forward to an enlightened and effective policy on Iraq. And I \nthink daily about the safety of the pilots who continue to perform \ntheir duty.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Albuquerque Journal \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Albuquerque Journal, Feb. 25, 2001]\n\n Highly Dangerous--New Mexico-Based Fighter Pilots Patrol Iraq No-Fly \n           Zones Knowing They Could Be Shot Down at Any Time\n\n                          (By John J. Lumpkin)\n\n       Cannon Air Force Base--The pilots call it ``going to the \n     desert.''\n       Life is often dull. The work is repetitive. Yet danger \n     always is in the air.\n       Most of the pilots with Cannon's 27th Fighter Wing have \n     gone at least once, and some repeatedly. They, and their F-16 \n     fighters, are prime tools in the United States' decade-long, \n     low-intensity war against the machinations of Iraqi President \n     Saddam Hussein.\n       The three F-16 combat squadrons at Cannon are part of the \n     rotation for Operations Northern and Southern Watch, which \n     patrol the no-fly zones over northern and southern Iraq. The \n     squadrons take their turns with other fighter units from a \n     U.S. and British coalition to enforce the zones, over which \n     Iraq has been prohibited from flying military aircraft since \n     the Gulf War.\n       They are called up for 90 to 120 days. Pilots, restricted \n     to an air base, say the uneventful stays are punctuated by \n     several long, usually uneventful patrols over Iraq.\n       But the routine gets exciting from time to time when Iraq \n     tests its limits.\n       ``The intensity is still there,'' said Lt. Col. Bob \n     ``Wilbur'' Wright, commander of the 523rd Fighter Squadron, \n     the ``Crusaders,'' who returned from a tour with Southern \n     Watch late last summer. ``You're always flying with the \n     chance of getting shot down. At any moment we could lose an \n     aircraft.''\n       U.S. and British aircraft struck an Iraqi air defense \n     system near Baghdad on Feb. 16 in a move the Pentagon \n     described as self-protection. The strikes were made to reduce \n     the chances of losing aircraft to surface-to-air missiles or \n     gunfire.\n       Iraq began regularly challenging the no-fly zones in \n     December 1998, after the four-day ``Desert Fox'' Allied \n     bombing campaign.\n       Cannon's 522nd Fighter Squadron, the ``Fireballs,'' took \n     part in the bombing. Cannon's third combat squadron, the \n     ``Hounds'' of the 524th, also have taken frequent turns in \n     the desert.\n\n\n                          Planes and missiles\n\n       Since Desert Fox, Iraq has fired missiles or anti-aircraft \n     guns at coalition planes about 700 times. Not a single one \n     has been shot down.\n       Iraqi aircraft also have violated the no-fly zones more \n     than 150 times. When Iraqi air-craft cross out of the no-fly \n     zone, coalition air-craft chase them back.\n       Wright and a wingman were part of one of those encounters \n     during his summer deployment, when an Iraqi fighter crossed \n     the border into the southern no-fly zone. Wright and his \n     wingman locked their radars on the plane, which fled.\n       ``I think they test the water periodically,'' said Wright, \n     who has been to the region five times in the last decade--\n     three times over the north, twice over the south.\n       His plane, an F-16C Fighting Falcon, is a nimble, single-\n     seat fighter that can both dog-fight and bomb targets.\n       When Iraq fires at U.S. or British planes, the aircraft \n     usually return fire or bomb other elements of Iraq's air \n     defense system. Usually those targets are within the no-fly \n     zones.\n       The strikes happen almost weekly and usually rate little \n     news coverage. But Iraq has said the attacks have killed 300 \n     people and injured more than 800, including civilians.\n       The Washington Post reported in October that the United \n     States scaled back the aggressiveness of its patrols after \n     intelligence analysts misidentified a sheep-watering tank as \n     a surface-to-air missile launcher on satellite photos. U.S. \n     aircraft bombed and strafed the site, and Iraq said 19 \n     people, shepherds and villagers, were killed.\n       Wright said intelligence officials, air staff and pilots \n     make great efforts to avoid hitting civilians.\n       ``What we go after and what we hit are militarily \n     significant targets,'' he said. ``I have a conscience, too. I \n     want to be sure of what we're hitting.''\n\n\n                           Support for rebels\n\n       With United Nations' approval, the two no-fly zones were \n     born after the 1991 Gulf War in an attempt to limit Saddam's \n     use of his air power against uprisings in the northern and \n     southern reaches of his country. Iraq isn't allowed to fly \n     aircraft in those regions.\n       Southern Watch flies out of air bases in Kuwait and Saudi \n     Arabia, and planes patrol a region south of the 33rd \n     parallel.\n       It was intended to support an uprising of Shiite Muslim \n     rebels in the south. Saddam crushed that rebellion in the \n     early 1990s.\n       Norther Watch flies out of Incirlik, an airbase in Turkey. \n     Planes patrol a comparatively small part of Iraq north of the \n     36th parallel. The operation began in 1997.\n       Several F-16 fighters and a few hundred airmen of the 150th \n     Fighter Wing--the ``Tacos'' of the Air National Guard from \n     Kirtland Air Force Base--now fly patrols with Northern Watch.\n       Northern Watch was intended to support uprisings by the \n     Kurdish minority.\n       Recent reports indicate some Kurdish towns are thriving. \n     But the Kurds still face attacks from Turkey, which fears \n     internal Kurdish dissent and uses U.S.-made jets to bomb \n     Kurdish territory in Iraq.\n       The no-fly zones have grown less popular over the years \n     among other nations, even those that were part of the \n     coalition that opposed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. China says \n     the no-fly zones violate the territorial integrity of Iraq. \n     Russia now says they don't have U.N. backing. France, once a \n     partner in the coalition, stopped flying aircraft over the \n     zones in 1998, declaring them ``pointless and deadly.''\n       Wright, for one, is a believer.\n       ``We keep the area somewhat stable,'' he said. ``We've \n     prevented Saddam Hussein from further injuring his own \n     people.''\n\n[[Page S1816]]\n\n                            Better defenses\n\n       Despite their inability to hit anything, Iraqi gunners and \n     missile operators are getting better.\n       ``There's some indications they have learned from their \n     experience,'' Wright said. ``They've seen us for 10 years \n     now.''\n       Pentagon spokesmen said that the Feb. 16 strikes were in \n     response to the increased ``frequency and sophistication of \n     their (air defense) operations.''\n       U.S. officials also have confirmed that China is supplying \n     Iraq with a fiber-optic communications system that would \n     integrate the operations of the country's air defenses.\n       Capt. Steve ``Roid'' Astor has been to the desert twice \n     with F-16 units. He said the greatest danger is that pilots \n     lose their focus on the long, uneventful patrols.\n       ``Let's not get complacent,'' he said. ``It can be \n     deadly.''\n       To hear the pilots tell it, life on an air base in these \n     faraway lands is fairly dull. Threats of terrorism keep them \n     restricted to the bases, especially for the Southern Watch \n     pilots in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.\n       Cannon pilot Capt. Shannon ``Pinball'' Prasek flew nine \n     combat missions with Southern Watch from February to April \n     1998. She protected airborne radars should they be attacked \n     by Iraqi aircraft.\n       ``It was pretty quiet. It was a religious holiday (for the \n     Iraqis),'' she said. She describes with some humor the polite \n     bewilderment of Kuwaiti fighter pilots at seeing a woman \n     combat pilot at their joint airbase.\n       One of Wright's ``Crusaders,'' 1st Lt. Trena Emerson is \n     waiting for her first rotation overseas. She is eager to fly \n     her first missions in a combat area, although she said she \n     hasn't heard much about the region from her more seasoned \n     colleagues, and her impressions are limited: ``Everyone comes \n     back in shape and tan,'' she joked.\n\n\n                            Saddam's bounty\n\n       The Cannon pilots regard the conflict as one against \n     Saddam, rather than the Iraqi people or even the country's \n     armed forces.\n       When they fly over Iraq, the pilots have a price on their \n     head. The Iraqi president has reportedly offered a reward to \n     anyone who shoots down an aircraft.\n       Wright expects to return to the desert late this year. \n     ``I'll miss another Christmas. . . . It does have an effect \n     on the family.''\n       But he praises the ``esprit de corps'' in his squadron, \n     brought on, in part, by the remoteness of Cannon Air Force \n     Base. ``This is almost like an overseas assignment.''\n       Wright is a pilot of some renown in the Air Force. He was \n     the first U.S. pilot since the Korean War to get three kills \n     in a single mission when he shot down three Bosnian Serb \n     Jastreb fighter-bombers violating a no-fly zone on Feb. 28, \n     1994, over Bosnia. This mission also marked NATO's first \n     military strikes in its history, and Wright earned the \n     Distinguished Flying Cross for his role.\n       Wright was also Capt. Scott O'Grady's wing-leader in June \n     1995 over Bosnia when O'Grady was shot down by a Bosnian Serb \n     surface-to-air missile. O'Grady was rescued five days later.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/05/senate-section/article/S1816-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n           COMMEMORATING MARIA MARGARITA ``MARGARET'' TAFOYA\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to join the \ncommunity of Santa Clara Pueblo, New Mexico in mourning the loss of \nMaria Margarita ``Margaret'' Tafoya. New Mexico is comprised of \nimaginative people of many cultures who express their cultural values \nartistically and creatively. The people of New Mexico will miss the \nguidance of the ``matriarch of Santa Clara potters.''\n  Respected and renowned throughout the pottery community, Margaret \ninspired others to take up pottery. She crafted many pots and other \nforms in the tradition of Santa Clara polished blackware and redware. \nHer art is the fine workmanship of highly skilled hands.\n  For her quality work, Margaret received numerous awards. The National \nAcademy of Western Art at the Cowboy Hall of Fame and Western Heritage \nCenter in Oklahoma City awarded her the Lifetime Contribution Award. \nShe was the only American Indian to receive this award. In 1984, the \nNational Endowment for the Arts awarded her the National Heritage \nFellowship Award. In addition, her works have been displayed on the \nMall in Washington, D.C. at the Folklife Festival sponsored by the \nSmithsonian Institute. However, Margaret did not work for recognition, \nshe worked to improve the quality of life for her family and children.\n  Her loss leaves a void for her family and the art community. Mr. \nPresident, I share the grief of the community of Santa Clara Pueblo and \nmy heartfelt condolences go out to her family.\n  I ask that an article in today's New York Times be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The article follows.\n\nMargaret Tafoya, Pueblo Potter Whose Work Found a Global Audience, Dies \n                                 at 96\n\n                          (By Douglas Martin)\n\n       Margaret Tafoya, whose nimble, ingenious hands turned the \n     chocolate-colored clay of her New Mexico pueblo into black-\n     on-black and red-on-red pottery of such profound and graceful \n     beauty that it acquired a global reputation, died on Feb. 25 \n     at her home in Santa Clara Pueblo near Santa Fe. She was 96.\n       Her name in Tewa, the language of seven Southwestern \n     pueblos, six in New Mexico and one in Arizona, was Corn \n     blossom. She was the matriarch of Santa Clara Pueblo potters, \n     who are more numerous and produce more pottery than those of \n     any other pueblo.\n       Her work, know for exceptionally large vessels, is \n     exhibited in public and private collections around the world. \n     She was named folk artist of the year by the National \n     Endowment for the Arts in 1984.\n       The art form she practiced has long been dominated by \n     women, and Corn Blossom was the last of a group of women who \n     attained fame through their mastery of it. Gone are Blue Corn \n     and Maria Martinez of the San Ildefonso Pueblo, Christina \n     Naranjo of Santa Clara and Grace Chapella, a Hopi.\n       Today Indian arts command astronomic prices and space on \n     museum shelves in faraway cities, but fewer and fewer Pueblo \n     Indians can speak or ever understand Tewa. Mrs. Tafoya, \n     though, was rooted in the old ways.\n       She spurned inventions like the potters' wheel. She kept \n     chickens, milked her own cows, churned her own butter and \n     rejected natural gas heat in favor of the traditional beehive \n     fireplace.\n       After a brief fling with an Apache, she married a young man \n     from the home pueblo, a distant relative with the same last \n     name.\n       According to the Web site of the National Museum of \n     American History (www.americanhistory.si.edu), Santa Clarans \n     use the same word for clay and for people: nung.\n       Mrs. Tafoya always prayed to Mother Clay before working. \n     ``You can't go to Mother Clay without the cornmeal and ask \n     her permission to touch her,'' the museum Web site quotes \n     Mrs. Tafoya as saying. ``Talk to Mother Clay.''\n       Though she was one of the last to make pots with handles \n     and criticized others for adding semiprecious gems to \n     pottery, she also liked to experiment.\n       She used different colors of slips, or thinned clays \n     applied to the outside of her vessels, and her later forms \n     were thinner, lighter and more graceful. Her shiny finishes \n     became ever more polished. She even adapted Greek and Roman \n     forms to classic Santa Clara shapes.\n       Mrs. Tafoya clearly loved her art, but it was also how she \n     supported her 10 children who survived their first year; 2 \n     others did not. As she said, ``I have dressed my children \n     with clay.''\n       Maria Margarita Tafoya was born in her pueblo on Aug. 13, \n     1904. Her mother, Sara Fina Gutierrez Tafoya, or Autumn Leaf, \n     was ``undoubtedly the outstanding Tewa potter of her time,'' \n     Mary Ellen and Laurence Blair wrote in ``Margaret Tafoya: A \n     Tewa Potter's Heritage and Legacy'' (Schiffer, 1986).\n       Her father, Geronimo, or White Flower, was mainly concerned \n     with raising food for the family, but he was also the main \n     marketer of his wife's pottery.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nensure that the Secretary of Health and Human Services provides \nappropriate guidance to physicians, providers of services, and \nambulance providers that are attempting to properly submit claims under \nthe medicare program to ensure that the Secretary does not target \ninadvertent billing errors; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, right now, all across America, Medicare \nbeneficiaries are seeking medical care from a flawed health care \nsystem. Reduced benefit packages, ever escalating costs, and limited \naccess in rural areas are just a few of the problems our system faces \non a daily basis. For these reasons, Congress must continue to move \ntowards the modernization of Medicare. But as we address the needs of \nbeneficiaries, we must not turn our back upon the very providers that \nseniors rely upon for their care.\n  Who are providers? They are the physicians, the hospitals, the \nnursing homes, and others who deliver quality care to our needy \nMedicare population. They are the backbone of our complex health care \nnetwork. When our nation's seniors need care, it is the provider who \nheals, not the health insurer, and certainly not the federal \ngovernment.\n  But more, and more often, seniors are being told by providers that \nthey don't accept Medicare. This is becoming even more common in rural \nareas, where the number of physicians is limited and access to quality \ncare is extremely restricted. Quite simply, beneficiaries are being \ntold that their insurance is simply not wanted. Why? Well it's not as \nsimple as low reimbursement rates. In fact it's much more complex.\n  The infrastructure that manages the Medicare program, the Health Care \nFinancing Administration, HCFA, and its network of contractors, have \nbuilt up a system designed to block care and micro-manage independent \npractices. Providers simply cannot afford to keep up with the seemingly \nendless number of complex, redundant, and unnecessary regulations. And \nif providers do participate? Well, a simple administrative error in \nsubmitting a claim could subject them to heavy-handed audits and the \nfinancial devastation of their practice. Should we force providers to \nchoose between protecting their practice and caring for seniors?\n  I believe the answer is no. For this reason, I am introducing the \n``Medicare Education and Regulatory Fairness Act of 2001.'' Co-\nsponsored by Senators Kerry, Kyl, Helms, Reid, Lincoln, Hagel, and Bob \nSmith, this legislation will restore fairness to the Medicare system. \nIt will allow providers to practice medicine without fearing the \nthreats, intimidation, and aggressive tactics of a faceless \nbureaucratic machine.\n  Most importantly, this bill will reform the flawed appeals process \nwithin HCFA. Currently, a provider who allegedly has received an \noverpayment is forced to choose between three options: admit the \noverpayment, submit additional information to mitigate the charge, or \nappeal the decision. However, providers who choose to submit\n\n[[Page S1819]]\n\nadditional evidence must subject their entire practice to review and \nwaive their appeal rights. That's right--to submit additional evidence \nyou must waive your right to an appeal!\n  And what is the result of this maddening system that runs contrary to \nour nation's history of fair and just administrative decisions? Often, \nproviders are intimidated into accepting the arbitrary decision of an \nauditor employed by a HCFA contractor. Sometimes, they are even forced \nto pull out of the Medicare program. In the end, our senior population \nsuffers.\n  I was particularly heartened to see that our new President agrees \nwith the spirit of this bill. In his recent budget, the administration \nstated that the ``current system is too complex, too centralized, and \nbecoming more so each year. Burdensome regulations and other central \ndirectives force providers to take time away from patients to comply \nwith excessive and complex paperwork.'' I completely agree.\n  Under my bill, providers will be allowed to retain their appeal \nrights should they choose to first submit additional evidence to \nmitigate the charge. Many providers receive an overpayment as the \nresult of a simple administrative mistake. For cases not involving \nfraud, a provider will be able to return that overpayment within twelve \nmonths without fear of prosecution. This is a common sense approach, \nand will not lead to any additional costs to the Medicare system.\n  To bring additional fairness to the system, my bill will prohibit the \nretroactive application of regulations, and allow providers to \nchallenge the constitutionality of HCFA regulations. Further, it will \nprohibit the crippling recovery of overpayments during an appeal, and \nbar the unfair method of withholding valid future payments to recover \npast overpayments. These common sense measures maintain the financial \nviability of medical practices during the resolution of payment \ncontroversies, and restore fundamental fairness to the dispute \nresolution procedures existing within HCFA.\n  Like many of our nation's problems, the key to improvement is found \nin education. For this reason, I have included language that stipulates \nthat at least 10 percent of the Medicare Integrity Program funds, and \ntwo percent of carrier funds, must be devoted to provider education \nprograms. Providers cannot be expected to comply with the endless \nnumber of Medicare regulations if they are not shown how to submit \nclean claims. We must ensure that providers are given the information \nneeded to eliminate future billing errors, and improve the \nresponsiveness of HCFA.\n  It is with the goal of protecting our Medicare population, and the \nproviders who tend care, that leads me to introduce the ``Medicare \nEducation and Regulatory Fairness Act of 2001.'' This bill will ensure \nthat providers are treated with the respect that they deserve, and that \nMedicare beneficiaries aren't told that their health insurance isn't \nwanted. We owe it to our nation's seniors. I urge immediate action on \nthis worthy bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 452\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Policy development regarding E Documentation Guidelines.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Congress should focus more resources on and work with \n     physicians and health care providers to combat fraud in the \n     medicare program.\n       (2) The overwhelming majority of physicians and other \n     providers in the United States are law-abiding citizens who \n     provide important services and care to patients each day.\n       (3) Physicians and other providers of services that \n     participate in the medicare program often have trouble wading \n     through a confusing and sometimes even contradictory maze of \n     medicare regulations. Keeping track of the morass of medicare \n     regulations detracts from the time that physicians have to \n     treat patients.\n       (4) Due to the overly complex nature of medicare \n     regulations and the risk of being the subject of an \n     aggressive government investigation, many physicians are \n     leaving the medicare program, limiting the number of medicare \n     patients they see, or refusing to accept new medicare \n     patients at all. If this trend continues, health care for the \n     millions of patients nationwide who depend on medicare will \n     be seriously compromised. Congress has an obligation to \n     prevent this from happening.\n       (5) Regulatory fairness for physicians and providers as \n     well as increased access to education about medicare \n     regulations are necessary to preserve the integrity of our \n     health care system and provide for the health of our \n     population.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill for the relief of Denes and Gyorgyi Fulop; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer today, \nlegislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Denes and \nGyorgyi Fulop, Hungarian nationals who have lived in California for \nmore than 18 years. The Fulops are the parents of six United States \ncitizen children. Today, they face deportation.\n  The Fulop's story is a compelling one; one I believe merits Congress' \nconsideration for humanitarian relief. In May of last year, the Fulops \nsuffered the loss of their eldest child, Robert ``Bobby'' Fulop, an \naccomplished 15-year-old teenager who died suddenly of a heart \naneurism. Bobby was considered the shining star in his family. He was \nvery bright and very helpful to his parents.\n  That same year the Fulop's six-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, was \ndiagnosed with moderate pulmonary stenosis, a potentially life-\nthreatening heart condition. Not long ago, she underwent heart surgery. \nI am pleased to report that she is doing much better.\n  Compounding this unfortunate series of events is the fact that, \ntoday, the Fulops face deportation. They face deportation, in part, \nbecause in 1995 they went back to Hungary and stayed for more than 90 \ndays. Under the pre-1996 immigration laws, their stay in Hungary would \nnot have been a factor in their deportation and they would have \nqualified for adjustment to lawful permanent resident status.\n  Indeed, in 1996, Mr. and Mrs. Fulop applied to the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, INS, for permanent resident status. The INS did \nnot interview them until 1998. By the time the INS had processed their \napplication, the new 1996 immigration laws had taken effect, which \nbarred from relief long-term resident aliens who traveled outside the \nU.S. for more than 90 days.\n  One cannot help but conclude that had the INS acted on their \napplication for relief from deportation in a more timely manner, the \nFulops would have qualified for suspension of deportation under the \npre-1996 laws, given that they are long-term residents of the U.S. with \nU.S. citizen children.\n  This is a tragic situation. The rules of the game were changed in the \nmiddle of the Fulop's application for permanent residence, and because \nthe INS failed to process their application in a timely fashion they \nare now facing deportation. The Fulop's children, who are United States \ncitizens, were not included in the deportation order. But because they \nare minors they would likely have to follow their parents to Hungary. \nGrowing up in the American school system, the Fulop children are not \nable to read or write the Hungarian language, and I believe that \nforcing them to leave the only country they have known would pose an \nextreme hardship for them.\n  It is my hope that Congress sees fit to provide an opportunity for \nthis family to remain together in the United States.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 453\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR DENES AND GYORGYI \n                   FULOP.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of \n     section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, Denes and \n     Gyorgyi Fulop shall be eligible for issuance of immigrant \n     visas or for adjustment of status to that of aliens lawfully \n     admitted for permanent residence upon filing an application \n     for issuance of immigrant visas under section 204 of such Act \n     or for adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident.\n       (b) Adjustment of Status.--If Denes Fulop or Gyorgyi Fulop \n     enters the United States before the filing deadline specified \n     in subsection (c), the alien shall be considered to have \n     entered and remained lawfully and shall, if otherwise \n     eligible, be eligible for adjustment of status under section \n     245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act as of the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Deadline for Application and Payment of Fees.--\n     Subsections (a) and (b) shall apply only if the application \n     for issuance of immigrant visas or the application for \n     adjustment of status are filed with appropriate fees within 2 \n     years after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon the granting \n     of immigrant visas or permanent residence to Denes and \n     Gyorgyi Fulop, the Secretary of State shall instruct the \n     proper officer to reduce by the appropriate number, during \n     the current or next following fiscal year, the total number \n     of immigrant visas that are made available to natives of the \n     country of the aliens' birth under section 203(a) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act or, if applicable, the total \n     number of immigrant visas that are made available to natives \n     of the country of the aliens' birth under section 202(e) of \n     such Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 454. A bill to provide permanent funding for the Bureau of Land \nManagement Payment in Lieu of Taxes Program and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today, the \nPILT and Refuge Revenue Sharing Permanent Funding Act, deals with an \nissue that I believe must be addressed in this Congress. The bill is a \nmeasure to make permanent funding for two important programs managed by \nthe Department of the Interior: the Payment in Lieu of Taxes Program, \nor PILT, in the Bureau of Land Management and the Refuge Revenue \nSharing Program in the Fish and Wildlife Service. Those programs \nprovide support to local governments in areas in which these two \nagencies hold land. Under the authorizations for these programs, the \nfunds are to be provided as an offset to the local property tax base \nlost by virtue of the Federal ownership of these lands.\n  Federal ownership of lands in the American West, in states like New \nMexico, does not come without its share of burdens for local \ngovernments. If there is a fire or other emergency, they must help \nrespond. If there is increased traffic to and from the site, they must \nmaintain the public roads that provide the necessary access to the \npublic. In enacting the original authorizing legislation, Congress \ndecided that, as a matter of policy, it was appropriate for the Federal \ngovernment\n\n[[Page S1824]]\n\nto bear a fair share in paying for these costs, in lieu of the taxes \nthat would be levied on any private landowner in these localities.\n  But in setting up these programs, Congress decided to make them \nsubject to annual appropriations, either partially, in the case of \nRefuge Revenue Sharing, or completely, in the case of PILT. In \nretrospect, this was a mistake. The annual appropriations process has \nnever come even close to providing the funds agreed upon by the \nunderlying authorizing law. Moreover, the amount made available has \nchanged significantly from one year to the next, frustrating the \nability of localities to plan effectively for the use of these funds. \nMany of the burdens they face as a result of Federal land ownership \nrequire expenditures and commitments that are long-term. If you want to \nhave a reasonable system of county roads, you need to have a consistent \nmulti-year plan. If you want adequate fire protection, you can't be \nhiring a dozen new firefighters in one year and firing them the next, \nas appropriation levels gyrate up and down.\n  The Federal government needs to be a better neighbor and a more \nreliable partner to local governments in the rural West. Since the \nsystem of meeting our obligations to these localities through the \nannual appropriations process has not worked, I am proposing that we \nstart treating our payments in lieu of taxes in the same way that we \naccount for incoming tax revenues to the Federal government--on the \nmandatory side of the Federal ledger. By making the funding for these \ncrucial programs full and permanent, we will be keeping the commitments \nto rural communities throughout the West made in the original PILT and \nRefuge Revenue Sharing authorizing legislation. It's a matter of simple \njustice to rural communities. I hope that enacting legislation along \nthe lines of what I am proposing today will receive high priority in \nthe next Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 454\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``PILT and Refuge Revenue \n     Sharing Permanent Funding Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PERMANENT FUNDING FOR PILT AND REFUGE REVENUE \n                   SHARING.\n\n       (a) Payments in Lieu of Taxes.--Section 6906 of title 31, \n     United States Code, is amended to read as follows:\n       ``There is authorized to be appropriated such sums as may \n     be necessary to the Secretary of the Interior to carry out \n     this chapter. Beginning in fiscal year 2002 and each year \n     thereafter, amounts authorized under this chapter shall be \n     made available to the Secretary of the Interior, out of any \n     other funds in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated and \n     without further appropriation, for obligation or expenditure \n     in accordance with this chapter.''.\n       (b) Refuge Revenue Sharing.--Section 401(d) of the Act of \n     June 15, 1935, as amended (16 U.S.C. 715s(d)) (relating to \n     refuge revenue sharing), is amended by adding at the end \n     thereof:\n       ``Beginning in fiscal year 2002 and each year thereafter, \n     such amount shall be made available to the Secretary, out of \n     any other funds in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated \n     and without further appropriation, for obligation or \n     expenditure in accordance with this section.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Allard, \n        Mr. Chafee, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. \n        Hutchinson):\n  S. 455. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase \nand modify the exclusion relating to qualified small business stock and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the concerns and needs of small \nbusinesses have always been a priority for me. When I talk to small \nbusiness owners throughout the State of Maine, I hear over and over \nagain that they have two major problems: One is the high cost of health \ninsurance. I will be introducing legislation shortly to try to help \nsmall businesses cope with that issue. The second issue is the need for \nmore capital to finance their enterprises.\n  Today, I rise to introduce the Encouraging Investment in Small \nBusiness Act, a bill intended to stimulate private investment in the \nentrepreneurs who drive our economy. I am pleased to be joined today by \nmy good friends and staunch supporters of small business, Senators \nCleland, Breaux, Landrieu, Allard, Chafee, Lieberman, Hutchinson, and \nHatch.\n  The bill we introduce today will encourage long-term investment in \nsmall and emerging businesses by providing incentives to individuals \nwho risk investment in such firms. According to the Small Business \nAdministration, small firms account for three-quarters of our Nation's \nemployment growth and almost all of our net new jobs. At the same time, \nsmall businesses face unique financing challenges. Simply put, \nentrepreneurs need access to more capital to start and to expand their \nbusinesses. As the SBA noted last year, ``Adequate financing for \nrapidly growing firms will be America's greatest economic policy \nchallenge of the new century.''\n  Just a few months ago, it would have been difficult for us to imagine \nthat a capital gap could exist in an economy that had experienced such \nan unprecedented run of prosperity. Venture capital investments in \nemerging firms reached a record $103 billion last year, up 74 percent \nfrom the year before. Yet, there are signs that the rush of funds is \nsubsiding. Venture capital investment activity decreased by 31 percent \nin the fourth quarter of last year, and much of the funds that have \nbeen raised remains uninvested.\n  More important, venture capital funds tend to gravitate towards \ncertain types of businesses and geographic regions, and tend to be \ninvested in increasingly larger amounts, leaving many small business \nentrepreneurs frozen out of the capital markets. Internet-related \ncompanies attracted 76 percent of the venture capital invested in the \nfirst three quarters of 2000. And more than two-thirds of all the \nventure capital invested in the United States in 1999 went to just five \nStates. Moreover, the average amount of venture capital invested in \nsmall businesses increased from $6.6 million in 1998 to $13.3 million \nin 1999, prompting the SBA to conclude that the needs of many small \nbusinesses for equity financing remain unmet.\n  The data paint a troubling picture. It is, unfortunately, a familiar \none. Take the example of Vladimir Koulchin, a Russian by birth but a \nMainer in heart and spirit. Vladimir holds a doctorate in biochemistry \nand has 25 years of research experience in the field. Six years ago, \nMr. Koulchin moved to Portland, ME, to work for a biotechnology firm \nwhere he became vice president for research and development. This past \nfall, with no funding other than his own, he founded Chemogen with the \ngoal of developing products to diagnose, treat, and prevent \ntuberculosis and other dangerous infectious diseases in humans and \nanimals. Mr. Koulchin told me how difficult it has been to find the \nseed and early stage capital he needs to get his promising business off \nthe ground. He spoke of the relative lack of seed capital in small \nmarkets and the welcome assistance that strong Federal tax incentives \ncould provide.\n  Vladimir's experiences are all-too-common. A recent report by the \nNational Commission on Entrepreneurship presented findings of 18 focus \ngroups with more than 250 entrepreneurs across the country. According \nto the report, the focus groups were ``nearly unanimous in identifying \ndifficulties in obtaining seed capital investments.''\n  And although the capital gap is pervasive, it disproportionately \nharms women- and minority-owned businesses. The Milken Institute, an \nindependent economic think tank, concluded in a research report issued \nlast year that, ``While minority businesses are growing faster than \nmajority firms in number and revenue, they remain severely constrained \nby a lack of access to capital.'' Moreover, women receive only 12 \npercent of all credit provided to small businesses in the U.S. despite \nowning nearly 40 percent of the businesses.\n  If we want to remain the world's most entrepreneurial country, where \nsmall businesses generate the ideas and create the jobs that fuel our \neconomy, we must continue to create an environment that nurtures and \nsupports entrepreneurs.\n  The legislation we are introducing helps to create a supportive \nenvironment, not by establishing an expensive,\n\n[[Page S1825]]\n\nnew Federal program, or adding a complicated new section to our Tax \nCode, but rather by simplifying and improving a provision that is \nalready there. The provision, known as section 1202, was added to the \nInternal Revenue Code in 1993 with strong bipartisan support.\n  Section 1202 allows investors to exclude from taxable income 50 \npercent of the gain from the sale of qualified small business stock \nwhen the stock is held for at least 5 years. Now, that concept is a \nsound one, but unfortunately, section 1202 prescribes a complicated set \nof requirements, and its attractiveness has been diminished due to the \nfact that when capital gains rates were lowered in 1997, the section \n1202 rate remained the same. In addition, the increasing application of \nthe alternative minimum tax has reduced its value. Indeed, early data \non the use of section 1202 suggests that the alternative minimum tax \nhas sharply limited its effectiveness.\n  Our bill restores section 1202 to its original role as a potent \nengine of small business capital formation. Our legislation simplifies \nsection 1202, enhances its incentives, and eliminates the threat that \ngains on small business stock will be subject to the alternative \nminimum tax. In short, our bill makes a number of commonsense changes \ndesigned to encourage investment in small business.\n  The Encouraging Investment in Small Business Act is supported by the \nNational Federation of Independent Business, the National Women's \nBusiness Council, the National Commission On Entrepreneurship, the \nBiotechnology Industry Organization, and the Biotechnology Association \nOf Maine.\n  Our legislation would implement changes recommended by a recent \nSecurities and Exchange Commission forum on small business capital \nformation. In sum, our legislation would accommodate the capital-\nraising needs of small business, the foundation of our economy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section \nsummary of the Encouraging Investment in Small Business Act be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Encouraging Investment in Small Business Act\n\n                       Section-by-Section Summary\n\n\n                            I. Introduction\n\n       The Encouraging Investment in Small Business Act is \n     intended to stimulate private investment in the entrepreneurs \n     who drive our economy. The Act will encourage long-term \n     investment in small and emerging businesses by providing \n     incentives to investors who risk investment in such firms. \n     According to the Small Business Administration, small firms \n     account for three-quarters of our nation's employment growth \n     and almost all of our net new jobs. Small businesses employ \n     52 percent of all private workers, provide 51 percent of our \n     private sector output, and are responsible for a \n     disproportionate share of innovations. Moreover, small \n     businesses are avenues of opportunity for women and \n     minorities, young and elderly workers, and those formerly on \n     public assistance. Yet entrepreneurs need access to more \n     capital to start and expand their businesses.\n       In 1993, Section 1202 was added to the Internal Revenue \n     Code in order to encourage investment in small businesses. In \n     brief, Section 1202 permits non-corporate taxpayers to \n     exclude from gross income 50% of the gain from the sale or \n     exchange of qualified small business (``QSB'') stock held for \n     more than five years. The concept is a sound one. However, in \n     practice, Section 1202 has proven to be cumbersome to use and \n     less advantageous than originally intended. As an article in \n     the December 1998 edition of the Tax Adviser noted, ``Sec. \n     1202 places numerous and complex requirements on both the QSB \n     and the shareholder,'' and that the provision ``is no longer \n     the deal it seemed to be.''\n       The Encouraging Investment in Small Business Act would \n     amend Section 1202 to eliminate unnecessary complexity and to \n     make it a more robust engine of capital formation for small \n     businesses. As it now stands, the engine needs work. Given \n     (1) reductions in capital gains rates subsequent to Section \n     1202's enactment and (2) the fact that more taxpayers are now \n     subject to the Alternative Minimum tax, Section 1202 is no \n     longer a viable option in many circumstances it was \n     originally intended to address. Moreover, Section 1202's \n     impact will continue to be diluted by a scheduled decrease in \n     long-term capital gains rates applicable to stock purchased \n     after 2000 and the probability that still more taxpayers will \n     be subject to the AMT. To understand the changes the Act \n     would make, it is first necessary to understand how 1202 \n     currently works.\n       As noted, Section 1202 imposes numerous restrictions on a \n     business that seeks to qualify under its provisions. To be a \n     QSB, a business must be a domestic C corporation with \n     aggregate gross assets of no greater than $50 million at any \n     time prior to or immediately after issuing stock. Certain \n     types of businesses are excluded from QSB status, including \n     banking, insurance, investing, consulting, law, accounting, \n     financial services, and farming concerns as well as hotels \n     and restaurants. Any trade or business that relies on the \n     reputation or skill of one or more of its employees as its \n     principal asset also cannot be a QSB.\n       QSB's must also satisfy an ``active business'' requirement. \n     This means that, during substantially all of the time the \n     taxpayer holds the stock, at least 80 percent of the QSB's \n     gross assets must be used by the corporation in the active \n     conduct of the qualified trade or business. Assets used in \n     certain start-up activities or for research, or which are \n     held as ``reasonably required'' working capital are deemed to \n     be used in the active conduct of a qualified trade or \n     business. Two years after a QSB has come into existence, no \n     more than 50 percent of its assets can qualify as ``active'' \n     by virtue of the Section 1202(e)(6) working capital rule.\n       As noted, under Section 1202, an individual can exclude \n     from gross income 50% of any gain from the sale or exchange \n     of qualified small business stock originally issued after \n     August 10, 1993 and held for more than five years. Under \n     Section 1045 of the Code, the taxpayer may roll the gain over \n     tax-free provided that the taxpayer (1) has held the QSB \n     stock for more than six months and (2) invests the gain in \n     other QSB stock within 60 days of the sale. Generally, the \n     holding period of the stock purchased will include the \n     holding period of the stock sold.\n       The maximum amount of a taxpayer's gain eligible for the \n     Section 1202 exclusion is limited to the greater of $10 \n     million and 10 times the aggregate adjusted bases of the \n     stock sold. Gains of Section 1202 stock are taxed at the rate \n     of 28%.\n\n\n                    II. Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       Section 1. Short title.\n       The ``Encouraging Investment in Small Business Act.''\n       Section 2. Increased Exclusion and Other Modifications \n     Applicable to Qualified Small Business Stock.\n       (a) Increased Exclusion.\n       This provision increases the amount of QSB stock gain that \n     an individual can exclude from gross income from 50 percent \n     to 75 percent.\n       (b) Reduction in Holding Period.\n       This provision reduces from 5 years to 3 years the period \n     of time in which an individual must hold QSB stock in order \n     to qualify for the 75-percent exclusion. Section 1045's \n     rollover provisions will still apply.\n       (c) Repeal of Minimum Tax Preference.\n       This provision strikes Section 57(a)(7), which makes 42 \n     percent of the amount excluded pursuant to Section 1202 a \n     preference item under the alternative minimum tax. This \n     change is necessary because the AMT provisions in existing \n     law effectively eviscerate the benefit of Section 1202 in \n     certain situations.\n       Example. Jane buys Section 1202 stock for $2,000. After \n     five years, she sells the stock for $12,000. Under current \n     law, she excludes half of her gain and is taxed at 28% on the \n     other half [.28 $5,000 = $1,400]. Hence, her tax on the gain \n     is $1,400. However, if Jane is subject to the AMT, she must \n     pay additional taxes of $588, or 28% of 42% of the excluded \n     half of the gain. Jane's total tax bill of $1,988 amounts to \n     an effective rate of 19.9%, or nearly the same as the current \n     maximum tax rate on long-term capital gains of 20%. Under the \n     Encouraging Investment in Small Business Act, Jane would be \n     able to exclude 75% of her gain, would be subject to the 20% \n     rate that applies to most capital gains, and would not have \n     to recognize any of the gain as a preference item for AMT \n     purposes. Hence, her tax bill would be 20% of $2,500, or \n     $500. Absent the change, Jame would have little incentive to \n     invest in a qualified small business over any other business, \n     particularly if she is subject to the AMT. Under the \n     Encouraging Investment in Small Business Act, Section 1202's \n     original potent incentives to investors in small businesses \n     are restored.\n       (d)(1) Working Capital Limitations.\n       This provision eases Section 1202(e)'s working capital \n     restrictions on qualified small businesses. The provision \n     increases from 2 years to 5 years the time in which assets \n     that are held for investment by a business can be expected to \n     be used to finance research or an increase in working capital \n     needs. In other words, a corporation will be able to hold \n     assets longer, before eventually using them for research or \n     to satisfy increased working capital needs, and still meet \n     the active business requirements of section 1202.\n       (d)(2) Exception from Redemption Rules Where Business \n     Purpose.\n       Currently, the Section 1202 exclusion does not apply to \n     stock issued by a corporation if the corporation purchases \n     more than 5 percent of its own stock during the 2-year period \n     beginning on the date one year before the issuance of its \n     stock. Under the Encouraging Investment in Small Business \n     Act, this provision would be waived if the issuing \n     corporation could establish that the purchase was made for a \n     business purpose, and not to avoid the provision described \n     above.\n       (e) Excluded Qualified Trade or Business.\n       This provision tightens the language of Section 1202(e)(3), \n     which excludes certain\n\n[[Page S1826]]\n\n     businesses from QSB status. It does so in two ways. First, it \n     provides that a coproration can be a QSB even if its \n     principal asset, for a temporary period, is the reputation or \n     skill of one or more of its employees. Hence, in the case of \n     a small start-up computer software company, for example, if \n     its employees engage in consulting work, say, in order to \n     generate some cash flow while the software is under \n     development, the company will not be disqualified from QSB \n     status.\n       Second, the provision makes it clear that biotechnology and \n     aquaculture companies are not disqualified from QSB status.\n       (f) Increase in Cap on Eligible Gain for Joint Returns.\n       The Encouraging Investment in Small Business Act fixes a \n     marriage tax penalty provision in Section 1202 by doubling \n     (to $20,000,000) the maximum amount of eligible gain for \n     taxpayers filing joint returns.\n       (g) Decrease in Capital Gains Rate\n       Section 1202 gains are currently taxed at a rate of 28 \n     percent, which, prior to May 7, 1997, had been the maximum \n     marginal rate for net capital gains. The Taxpayer Relief Act \n     of 1997 reduced the maximum capital gain rate for individuals \n     from 28 percent to 20 percent, but left section 1202 gain \n     subject to the 28 percent rate. The Encouraging Investment in \n     Small Business Act would make section 1202 gains subject to \n     the generally-applicable 20 percent rate.\n       (h) Increase in Rollover Period for QSB Stock\n       Currently, a taxpayer can roll over, tax free, gain from \n     the sale or exchange of QSB stock where the taxpayer uses the \n     proceeds to purchase other QSB stock within 60 days of the \n     sale of the original stock. The Encouraging Investment in \n     Small Business Act would increase the roll over period to 180 \n     days, thus increasing the liquidity of QSB stock. A 180-day \n     roll over period is also employed in section 1031 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code for like-kind exchanges.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 456. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to enhance the \nassurance of efficiency, quality, and patient satisfaction in the \nfurnishing of health care to veterans by the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Veterans \nHealth Care Quality Assurance Act of 2001.\n  This legislation contains a number of proposals designed to ensure \nthat access to high quality medical services for our veterans is not \ncompromised as the Department of Veterans Affairs, the VA, strives to \nincrease efficiency in its nationwide network of veterans hospitals.\n  The VA administers the largest health care network in the U.S., \nincluding 172 hospitals, 73 home care programs, over 800 community-\nbased outpatient clinics, and numerous other specialized care \nfacilities.\n  Moreover, there are approximately 25 million veterans in the U.S., \nincluding approximately 19.3 million wartime veterans, and the number \nof veterans seeking medical care in VA hospitals is increasing.\n  The FY2000 VA medical caseload was projected to total approximately \n3.8 million, an increase of 185,000 over FY1999. This level is expected \nto increase to 3.9 million during FY2001. Furthermore, in FY2001, \noutpatient visits to VA facilities are expected to increase by 2.6 \nmillion to 40.4 million.\n  The average age of veterans is increasing as well, and this is \nexpected to result in additional demands for health care services, \nincluding more frequent and long-term health needs.\n  The VA is attempting to meet this unprecedented demand for health \ncare services without substantial increases in funding, largely through \nefforts to increase efficiency. Not surprisingly, these seemingly \ncompeting objectives are generating serious concerns about the \npossibility that quality of care and/or patient satisfaction are being \nsacrificed.\n  Many VA regional networks and medical center directors report that \ntimely access to high quality health care is being jeopardized, and \nthat is why I am introducing the Veterans Health Care Quality Assurance \nAct, legislation which seeks to ensure that no veterans' hospital is \ntargeted unfairly for cuts, and that efforts to ``streamline'' and \nincrease efficiency are not followed by the unintended consequence of \nundermining quality of care or patient satisfaction.\n  I believe that all veterans hospitals should be held to the same \nequitable VA-wide standards, and that quality and satisfaction must be \nguaranteed. Toward that end, the Veterans Health Care Quality Assurance \nAct calls for audits of every VA hospital every three years. This will \nensure that each facility is subject to an outside, independent review \nof its operations on a regular basis, and each audit will include \nfindings on how to improve services to our veterans.\n  The legislation will also establish an Office of Quality Assurance \nwithin the VA to ensure that steps taken to increase efficiency in VA \nmedical programs do not undermine quality or patient satisfaction. This \noffice will collect and disseminate information on efforts that have \nproven to successfully increase efficiency and resource utilization \nwithout undermining quality or patient satisfaction. The director of \nthis new Office of Quality Assurance should be an advocate for veterans \nand would be placed in the appropriate position in the VA command \nstructure to ensure that he or she is consulted by the VA Secretary and \nUnder Secretary for Veterans Health on matters that impact quality or \nsatisfaction.\n  The bill would require an initial report to Congress within six \nmonths of enactment, which would include a survey of each VA regional \nnetwork and a report on each network's efforts to increase efficiency, \nas well as an assessment of the extent to which each network and VA \nhospital is or is not implementing the same uniform, VA-wide policies \nto increase efficiency.\n  Under the bill's reporting requirement, the VA would also be required \nto publish, annually, an overview of VA-wide efficiency goals and \nquality/satisfaction standards that each veterans facility should be \nheld to. Further, the VA would be required to report to Congress on \neach hospital's standing in relation to efficiency, quality, and \nsatisfaction criteria, and how each facility compares to the VA-wide \naverage.\n  In an effort to encourage innovation in efforts to increase \nefficiency within the agency, the bill would encourage the \ndissemination and sharing of information throughout the VA in order to \nfacilitate implementation of uniform, equitable efficiency standards.\n  Finally the bill includes provisions calling for sharing of \ninformation on efforts to maximize resources and increase efficiency \nwithout compromising quality of care and patient satisfaction; exchange \nand mentoring initiatives among and between networks in order to \nfacilitate sharing of such information; incentives for networks to \nincrease efficiency and meet uniform quality/patient satisfaction \ntargets; and formal oversight by the VA to ensure that all networks are \nmeeting uniform efficiency criteria and that efforts to increase \nefficiency are equitable between networks and medical facilities.\n  Keeping our promise to our veterans is also an on-going duty. The \ndebt of gratitude we owe to our veterans can never be fully repaid. \nWhat we can and must do for our veterans is repay the financial debt we \nowe to them. Central to that solemn duty is ensuring that the benefits \nwe promised our veterans when they enlisted are there for them when \nthey need them.\n  I consider it a great honor to represent veterans. So many of them \ncontinue to make contributions in our communities upon their transition \nfrom military to civilian life, through youth activities and \nscholarships programs, homeless assistance initiatives, efforts to \nreach out to fellow veterans in need, and national leadership on issues \nof importance to veterans and all Americans. The least we can do is \nmake good on our promises, such as the promise of access to high \nquality health care.\n  I have nothing but the utmost respect for those who have served their \ncountry, and this legislation is but a small tribute to the men and \nwomen and their families who have served this country with courage, \nhonor and distinction. They answered the call to duty when their \ncountry needed them, and this is a component of my on-going effort to \nensure that we, as elected officials, answer their call when they need \nus.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 457. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to establish a \npresumption of service-connection for certain veterans with Hepatitis \nC, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce legislation I \nfirst\n\n[[Page S1827]]\n\nintroduced in the 105th Congress to address a serious health concern \nfor veterans specifically the health threat posed by the Hepatitis C \nvirus.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would make Hepatitis C a \nservice-connected condition so that veterans suffering from this virus \ncan be treated by the VA. The bill will establish a presumption of \nservice connection for veterans with Hepatitis C, meaning that the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs will assume that this condition was \nincurred or aggravated in military service, provided that certain \nconditions are met.\n  Under this legislation, veterans who received a transfusion of blood \nduring a period of service before December 31, 1992; veterans who were \nexposed to blood during a period of service; veterans who underwent \nhemodyalisis during a period of service; veterans diagnosed with \nunexplained liver disease during a period of service; veterans with an \nunexplained liver dysfunction value or test; or veterans working in a \nhealth care occupation during service, will be eligible for treatment \nfor this condition at VA facilities.\n  I have reviewed medical research that suggests many veterans were \nexposed to Hepatitis C in service and are now suffering from liver and \nother diseases caused by exposure to the virus. I am troubled that many \n``Hepatitis C veterans'' are not being treated by the VA because they \ncan't prove the virus was service connected, despite the fact that \nhepatitis C was little known and could not be tested for until \nrecently.\n  We are learning that those who served in Vietnam and other conflicts, \ntend to have higher than average rates of Hepatitis C. In fact, VA data \nshows that about 20 percent of its inpatient population is infected \nwith the Hepatitis C virus, and some studies have found that 10 percent \nof otherwise healthy Vietnam, Veterans are Hepatitis C positive.\n  Hepatitis C was not isolated until 1989, and the test for the virus \nhas only been available since 1990. Hepatitis C is a hidden infection \nwith few symptoms. However, most of those infected with the virus will \ndevelop serious liver disease 10 to 30 years after contracting it. For \nmany of those infected, Hepatitis C can lead to liver failure, \ntransplants, liver cancer, and death.\n  And yet, most people who have Hepatitis C don't even know it--and \noften do not get treatment until it's too late. Only five percent of \nthe estimated four million Americans with hepatitis C know they have \nit; yet with new treatments, some estimates indicate that 50 percent \nmay have the virus eradicated.\n  Vietnam Veterans in particular are just now starting to learn that \nthey have liver disease likely caused by Hepatitis C. Early detection \nand treatment may help head off serious liver disease for many of them. \nHowever, many veterans with Hepatitis C will not be treated by the VA \nbecause they must meet a standard that is virtually impossible to meet \nin order to establish a service connection for their condition--this in \nspite of the fact that we now know that many Vietnam-era and other \nveterans got this disease serving their country.\n  Many of my colleagues may be interested to know how veterans were \nlikely exposed to this virus. Many veterans received blood transfusions \nwhile in Vietnam. This is one of the most common ways Hepatitis C is \ntransmitted. Medical transmission of the virus through needles and \nother medical equipment is also possible in combat. Medical care \nproviders in the services were likely at increased risk as well, and \nmay have, in turn, posed a risk to the service members they treated.\n  Researchers have discovered that Hepatitis C was widespread in \nSoutheast Asia during the Vietnam war, and that some blood sent from \nthe U.S. was also infected with the virus. Researchers and veterans \norganizations, including the Vietnam Veterans of America, with whom I \nworked closely to prepare this legislation, believe that many veterans \nwere infected after being injured in combat and getting a transfusion \nor from working as a medic around combat injuries.\n  I believe we will actually save money in the long run by testing and \ntreating this infection early on. The alternative is much more costly \ntreatment of end-stage liver disease and the associated complications, \nor other disorders.\n  Some will argue that further epidemiologic data is needed to resolve \nor prove the issue of service connection. I agree that we have our work \ncut out for us, and further study should be done. However, there is \nalready a substantial body of research on the relationship between \nHepatitis C and military service. While further research is being \nconducted, we should not ask those who have already sacrificed so much \nfor this country to wait--perhaps for years--for the treatment they \ndeserve.\n  Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, well respected both within \nand outside of the medical profession, has said, ``In some studies of \nveterans entering the Department of Veterans Affairs health facilities, \nhalf of the veterans have tested positive for HCV. Some of these \nveterans may have left the military with HCV infection, while others \nmay have developed it after their military service. In any event, we \nneed to detect the treat HCV infection if we are to head off very high \nrates of liver disease and liver transplant in VA facilities over the \nnext decade. I believe this effort should include HCV testing as part \nof the discharge physical in the military, and entrance screening for \nveterans entering the VA health system.''\n  Veterans have already fought their share of battles--these men and \nwomen who sacrificed in war so that others could live in peace \nshouldn't have to fight again for the benefits and respect they have \nearned.\n  We still have a long way to go before we know how best to confront \nthis deadly virus. A comprehensive policy to confront such a monumental \nchallenge can not be established overnight. It will require the long-\nterm commitment of Congress and the Administration to a serious effort \nto address their health concern.\n  I hope this legislation will be a constructive step in this effort, \nand I look forward to working with the Veterans Affairs Committee, the \nVA-HUD appropriators, Vietnam Veterans of America and other veterans \ngroups to meet this emerging challenge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/05/senate-section/article/S1827-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1827-S1828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 42--AUTHORIZING EXPENDITURES BY THE COMMITTEE ON \n                             SMALL BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BOND submitted the following resolution; from the Committee on \nSmall Business; which was referred to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration, as follows:\n\n                               S.

NATIONAL RESPONSE TO INHALANT USE.\n\n       (a) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the President should designate the week of March 18 \n     through March 24, 2001, as ``National Inhalants and Poisons \n     Awareness Week''; and\n       (2) parents should learn about the dangers of inhalant \n     abuse and discuss those dangers with their children.\n       (b) Proclamation.--The Senate requests that the President \n     issue a proclamation--\n       (1) designating the week of March 18 through March 24, \n     2001, as ``National Inhalants and Poisons Awareness Week''; \n     and\n       (2) calling upon the people of the United States to observe \n     ``National Inhalants and Poisons Awareness Week'' with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today Senators Daschle, DeWine and I \nrise to introduce a resolution that will help fight a silent epidemic \namong America's youth. This epidemic can leave young people permanently \nbrain damaged or, worse, dead. It is called inhalant abuse.\n  This resolution will designate the week of March 18 through March 24, \n2001, as ``National Inhalants and Poisons Awareness Week.''\n  What exactly are inhalants? Inhalants are the intentional breathing \nof gas or vapors for the purpose of reaching a high. Over 1,400 common \nproducts can be abused, such as lighter fluid, pressurized whipped \ncream, hair spray, and gasoline, the abused product of choice in rural \nAlaska. These products are inexpensive, easily obtained and legal.\n  An inhalant abuse counselor told me, ``If it smells like a chemical, \nit can be abused.''\n  It's a ``silent epidemic'' because few adults really appreciate the \nseverity of the problem: One in five students has tried inhalants by \nthe time they reach the eighth grade; use of inhalants by children has \nnearly doubled in the last 10 years; and inhalants are the third most \nabused substances among teenagers, behind alcohol and tobacco.\n\n  Inhalants are deadly. Inhalant vapors react with fatty tissues in the \nbrain, literally dissolving them. One time use of inhalants can cause \ninstant and permanent brain, heart, kidney, liver or other organ \ndamage. The user can also suffer from instant heart failure known as \n``Sudden Sniffing Death Syndrome,'' this means an abuser can die the \nfirst, tenth or hundredth time he or she uses an inhalant.\n  In fact, according to a recent study by the Alaska Native Health \nConsortium, inhaling has a higher risk of ``instant death'' than any \nother abused substance.\n  That's what happened to Theresa, an 18-year old who lived in rural \nWestern Alaska. Theresa was inhaling gasoline; shortly thereafter, her \nheart stopped. She was found alone and outside in near zero \ntemperatures. Theresa, who was the youngest of five children and just a \nmonth shy of graduation, was flown to Fairbanks Memorial Hospital where \nshe was pronounced dead on arrival.\n  Two years ago in Pennsylvania, a teenage driver, with four teenage \npassengers, lost control of her car in broad daylight. The car hit a \ntree with such impact that all passengers were killed. High levels of a \nchemical, found in computer keyboard cleaners, were found in the young \ndriver's body. A medical examiner's report cited ``impairment due to \ninhalant abuse'' as the cause of the crash.\n  Mr. Haviland, the principal of the high school where the five girls \nattended, said neither teachers nor school administrators ever \nsuspected that students were involved with inhalants.\n  Inhalants are considered a ``gateway'' to other illicit drug abuse. \nBecause these products are legal, affordable and their abuse is hard to \ndetect, awareness must be promoted among young people, parents and \neducators. We hope that a national week of awareness will encourage \nprograms throughout the country, alerting parents and children to the \ndangers of inhalants.\n  I ask my colleagues to support and cosponsor this resolution. This \nnational tragedy can be prevented through education and awareness. \nHopefully, this week of awareness will save a child's life, and end one \nof our nation's silent epidemics.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/05/senate-section/article/S1828-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1828-S1830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 20--SETTING FORTH THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET \n         FOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2002\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Budget, as follows:\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article \nI wrote entitled ``Reaganomics II'' be printed in the Record. This \narticle provides an honest budgetary assessment and thereby makes the \nargument for why a one year budget is needed.\n  Reaganomics II, a tax cut of $1.6 trillion, is steamrolling through \nthe Congress. Reaganomics I, the tax cut of $750 billion, gave us the \nbiggest waste in history! The debt soared from less than $1 trillion to \n$4 trillion, now $5.7 trillion, with interest costs of $365 billion \nannually. In the last ten years we have wasted $3.4 trillion on \ninterest costs and we continue to spend each day, every day, $1 billion \nfor nothing. But President Bush and the Republican Congress charge on \nwailing about trillions of dollars in surplus, joined by the free press \nwith USA Today's headline of February 22, ``Government Remains Awash In \nMoney''. Awash in money? Surplus? Nowhere to be found. Ever since \nPresident Lyndon Johnson balanced the budget in 1969 we have ended each \nyear with a deficit. Fiscal year 2000 ended in deficit, and the \nSecretary of the Treasury has just reported the debt has already \nincreased this fiscal year another $52 billion. President Bush's \nbudget, just submitted, shows the debt increasing in the next 10 years \nfrom $5.637 trillion to $7.159 trillion. No surplus.\n  The U.S. economy is hemorrhaging with a current account deficit of \n$439 billion and the government is awash in red ink. The Social \nSecurity account at this moment is in the red $1 trillion. The Medicare \naccount is in the red $238 billion. We owe Military Retirement $156 \nbillion. We owe Civil Service Retirement $544 billion. The Unemployment \nCompensation fund is $92 billion in the red. Yet the Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, appears before Congress stating, ``We \nare running out of debt to retire.'' Ridiculous.\n  Greenspan justifies talk of ``surplus'' by dividing the national debt \nin two: debt borrowed from government accounts such as Social Security, \nMedicare, Military Retirement, etc.; and\n\n[[Page S1830]]\n\ndebt owed the public by borrowing in the open market. The term ``public \ndebt'' infers that is all the government owes. The government owes both \npublic and government debt. Ignoring the overall national debt, \nGreenspan testifies only about public debt. He fears the public debt \nwill be paid off and the investment of ``surpluses'' will become a \npolitical football. Last year when Greenspan called for paying down the \ndebt, the public debt was $3.4 trillion. Now it has only been paid down \n$13 billion and he calls for a tax cut. And the reduction of $13 \nbillion is achieved by transferring $13 billion of public debt to the \ngovernment debt. It is like paying off your Visa with your MasterCard. \nYou still owe the money. The national debt continues to increase, not \nbe ``paid down''. No surplus.\n  Dividing the national debt is a fraud. Worse, ten-year economic \nprojections, or budgets, give President Bush running room for a $1.6 \ntrillion tax cut and a $25 billion increase in spending--Reaganomics \nII! The President's plan is contingent upon spending cuts that he knows \nCongress will reject, and the Democratic alternative of a $900 billion \ntax cut is no more than Reaganomics Lite. Under each plan, deficits, on \nthe decline for the past eight years, will increase. The national debt \nand interest costs will soar, the dollar weakened. To meet the demand \nfor higher yields to offset the decline in the dollar, Greenspan will \nhave to raise interest rates which will guarantee a hard landing.\n  There is no education in the second kick of a mule. The way to stop \nReaganomics II is with a one-year budget. We survived 200 years with \none year budgets. First, start with this year's budget for next year. \nFreeze it. Debate and vote on any proposed cuts and require that \namendments for prescription drugs and health care be accompanied by an \noffset. Depending on the economy, delay all tax cut proposals until \nlater this year or this time next year when we learn whether it's a \nsoft landing or a hard landing. Then we can act responsibly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/05/senate-section/article/S1830-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   DIRECTING DISCHARGE OF S.J.
